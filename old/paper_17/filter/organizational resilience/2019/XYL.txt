item 1a.    risk factors in evaluating our business, the following discussion of significant factors, events, and uncertainties that make an investment in our securities risky should be carefully considered, along with all of the other information in this report and in our other filings with the sec. the events and consequences discussed in these risk factors could, in circumstances that we may not be able to accurately predict, recognize, or control, have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, cash flow, results of operations or market price of our common stock.
these risk factors do not identify all the risks we face. we operate in a continually changing business, economic and geopolitical environment and as a result new risk factors may emerge from time to time. we could also be affected by factors, events, or uncertainties that are not presently known to us or that we currently do not consider to present significant risks. in addition, the global economic and geopolitical climate amplifies many of these risks.
risks related to our business failure to compete successfully in our markets and disruptive technologies could adversely affect our business.
we offer our technologies, products and services in competitive markets. we believe the principal points of competition in our markets are product and service performance, quality and reliability, innovation, speed to market with new or disruptive technologies and business models, application expertise, brand reputation, energy efficiency, product security, product life cycle cost, timeliness of delivery, proximity of service centers, effectiveness of our distribution channels, price and customers' experience in conducting business with us. maintaining and improving our competitive position will require successful management of these factors in a business environment with increasingly rapid rates of change and disruption, including our continued investment in talent, manufacturing, technology and innovation, research and development, engineering, sales and marketing, customer service and support, and our distribution networks. our future growth rate depends upon a number of factors, including our ability to: (i) develop and maintain competitive products, services, business models and customer experience to address emerging trends and customer needs in our target markets, (ii) defend our market share against an ever-expanding number of competitors, many of which are new and non-traditional competitors from outside our industry such as major technology firms, or those out of emerging markets, (iii) enhance our product and service offerings by adding innovative features or disruptive technologies that differentiate them from those of our competitors and prevent commoditization, (iv) develop, manufacture and bring compelling new products and services to market quickly and cost-effectively, and (v) attract, develop and retain individuals with the requisite innovation and technical expertise and understanding of customers' needs to develop new technologies and introduce new products and services.
we may not be successful in maintaining our competitive position. our competitors or third parties from outside our industry may develop disruptive technologies, products and services more quickly than us or that are superior to ours, may develop new or more efficient or effective methods or business models to provide technologies, products and services, or may adapt more quickly than we do to new trends, disruptive technologies or evolving customer requirements. the failure of our technologies, products or services to maintain and gain market acceptance due to more attractive offerings, as well as customers' slower-than-expected adoption of and investment in our new and innovative technologies could significantly reduce our revenues or market share and adversely affect our competitive standing and prospects. pricing pressures also could cause us to adjust the prices of certain products to stay competitive, which could adversely affect our market share and financial performance. failure to continue competing successfully or to win large contracts could adversely affect our business, financial condition, cash flow or results of operations.
our business, products and services could be adversely affected by cyber threats or other interruptions in information technology, communications networks and operations.
our business operations rely on information technology and communications networks, some of which are operated by third parties including, increasingly, cloud-based service providers, to process, transmit and store our electronic information, including sensitive data such as confidential business information and personal data relating to employees, customers or other business partners. we have, or operate through, a concentration of operations on certain sites, such as production and shared service centers. we also rely on third parties' information technology systems to manage or support a variety of critical business processes and activities. regardless of protection measures, essentially all systems are susceptible to damage, disruption or shut-down due to cybersecurity attacks, including ransomware, denial-of-service, computer viruses and security breaches, as well as human error or malfeasance, equipment or system failure, including due to maintenance, obsolescence or age, vandalism, natural disasters, fire, power or communication outages, shutdown, telecommunication or utility failure and other events. in any such circumstances, our system redundancy and other business continuity and disaster recovery planning and response may be ineffective or inadequate.
in addition, we offer certain services and products, including pumps, controllers and meters, used by third parties for operational purposes or to collect data, which are digitally-enabled or connect to and are part of the "internet of things" (iot). cybersecurity attacks may target hardware, software and information installed, stored or transmitted by our products after they have been purchased and incorporated into third-parties' products, facilities or infrastructure. while we attempt to provide security measures to safeguard our products and services from cyber threats, the potential for an attack remains. a successful attack may result in the misappropriation, destruction, unauthorized access to or disclosure of third parties' confidential information, damage, disruption or shut-down of third parties' operations, recall of our products or increased costs for security and remediation, as well as possible damage to our brand reputation.
like many multinational corporations, we, and some third parties upon which we rely, have experienced cybersecurity attacks on information technology networks and systems, products and services in the past and may experience them in the future, likely with more frequency and involving a broader range of devices and modes of attack. to date, none have resulted in any material adverse impact to our business, operations, products, services or customers. we have adopted measures designed to mitigate potential risks associated with cybersecurity threats, breaches or other disruptions or damage to our information technology networks and systems, products and services but the unpredictability of the timing, nature and scope of such disruptions and threats could impact our business, operations, products and services. disruption to any of the information technology and communications networks on which we rely, or an attack on our products and services, could interfere with our operations, disrupt our supply chain and service to our customers, interrupt production and shipments, result in theft or compromise of our and our customers' intellectual property and trade secrets, damage employee, customer and business partner relationships, negatively impact our reputation, result in legal claims and proceedings or regulatory enforcement actions, and increase our costs for security and remediation, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position, results of operations, cash flows or financial condition.
although we continue to assess these risks, implement controls and perform business continuity and disaster recovery planning, we cannot be sure that cybersecurity attacks or other interruptions with material adverse effects will not occur.
our results of operations and financial condition are subject to global economic, geopolitical and financial market conditions.
we compete around the world in various geographic and product markets. in 2019, 49%, 24% and 20% of our total revenue was from customers located in the united states, western europe and emerging markets, respectively. we expect revenue from these markets to be significant for the foreseeable future. important factors impacting our businesses include the overall strength of these economies and our customers' confidence in both local and global macro-economic conditions; instability and uncertainties from the global geopolitical environment; industrial and private sector spending, federal, state, local and municipal governmental fiscal and trade policies; the strength of the residential and commercial real estate markets; interest rates; availability of commercial financing for our customers and end-users; the availability of funding for our public sector customers; and unemployment rates. a slowdown or prolonged downturn in the global economy or our markets has in the past, and could have in the future a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, cash flow and results of operations.
we are exposed to economic, geopolitical and other risks associated with our international sales and operations.
in 2019, 51% of our total revenue was from customers outside the united states, with 20% of total revenue generated in emerging markets. we expect our sales from international operations and export sales to continue to be a significant portion of our revenue. we have placed a particular emphasis on increasing our growth and presence in emerging markets. many of our manufacturing operations, employees and suppliers are located outside of the united states. both our international operations and sales are subject, in varying degrees, to risks inherent in doing business outside the united states. these risks include the following:
•   changes in trade protection measures, including embargoes, tariffs and other trade barriers, and import and export regulations and licensing requirements;
•   instability and uncertainties arising from the global geopolitical environment, including economic nationalism, populism, and increasing protectionism and anti-global sentiment;
•   changes in tax laws and potential negative consequences from the interpretation, application and enforcement by governmental tax authorities of tax laws and policies;
•   unanticipated changes in other laws and regulations or in how such provisions are interpreted or administered;
•   potential disruptions in our global supply chain;
•   possibility of unfavorable circumstances arising from host country laws or regulations, including those related to infrastructure and data transmission, security and privacy;
•   theft, compromise or misappropriation of technology or intellectual property;
•   currency exchange rate fluctuations and restrictions on currency repatriation;
•   disruption of operations from labor and political disturbances;
•   the transition away from libor to the secured overnight financing rate, sofr, as a benchmark reference for short-term interests;
•   increased costs and risks in developing, staffing and simultaneously managing a number of global operations as a result of distance as well as language and cultural differences; and
•   threat, outbreak, uncertainty or escalation of insurrection, armed conflict, terrorism, pandemics or war.
changes in the geopolitical or economic environments in the countries and regions in which we operate could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. for example, changes in united states policy regarding international trade, including import and export regulation and international trade agreements, could negatively impact our business. the united states tariffs imposed on certain goods imported from china and certain other countries has resulted in retaliatory tariffs by china and other countries. additional tariffs imposed by the united states on a broader range of imports from china or other countries' goods, or further retaliatory trade measures taken by china or other countries in response, could result in a continued increase in supply chain costs that we may not be able to offset or may otherwise adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations.
additionally, we continue to monitor the potential impacts brexit on our results of operations and financial condition. volatility in foreign currencies is expected to continue as the united kingdom executes its exit from the european union. if the united kingdom and the european union cannot conclude an agreement on their future relationship before the end of the transition period (referred to as a "hard brexit"), trade would be based on world trade organization rules which would likely lead to increased costs from re-imposition of tariffs on trade between the united kingdom and european union, increased transportation costs, shipping delays because of the need for customs inspections and procedures and shortages of certain goods. the united kingdom will also need to negotiate its own trade treaties with countries all over the world, which could take years to complete. in the case of a "hard brexit", our exposure to disruptions to our supply chain, increased costs, the imposition of tariffs and currency devaluation in the united kingdom could result in a material impact to our consolidated revenue, earnings and cash flow.
further, any payment of distributions, loans or advances to us by our foreign subsidiaries could be subject to restrictions on, or taxation of, dividends or repatriation of earnings under applicable local law, monetary transfer restrictions and foreign currency exchange regulations in the jurisdictions in which our subsidiaries operate. in addition to the general risks that we face outside the united states, our operations in emerging markets could involve additional uncertainties for us, including risks that governments may impose withholding or other taxes on remittances and other payments to us, or the amount of any such taxes may increase; governments may seek to nationalize our assets; or governments may impose or increase investment barriers or other restrictions affecting our business. in addition, emerging markets pose other uncertainties, including the difficulty of enforcing agreements, challenges collecting receivables, protecting our intellectual property and other assets, pressure on the pricing of our products and services, higher business conduct risks, ability to hire and retain qualified talent and risks of political instability. we cannot predict the impact such events might have on our business, financial condition, cash flow and results of operations.
our business could be adversely affected by inflation, tariffs and other manufacturing and operating cost increases.
our operating costs are subject to fluctuations, particularly due to changes in prices for commodities, parts, raw materials, energy and related utilities, freight, and cost of labor which may be driven by prevailing price levels, exchange rates, changes in trade protection measures including tariffs, and other economic factors. in order to remain competitive, we may not be able to recover all or a portion of these higher costs from our customers through product price increases. further, in a declining price environment, our operating margins may contract because we account for inventory using the first-in, first-out method. actions we take to mitigate volatility in manufacturing and operating costs may not be successful and, as a result, our business, financial condition, cash flow and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.
a material disruption to any of our facilities or operations, or that of third parties upon which we rely, may adversely affect our business.
our facilities and operations rely on a complex global supply chain consisting of suppliers, contract manufacturers and logistics providers. in addition, our business relies on certain third parties to supply critical business processes and activities, including in the areas of finance, human resources, procurement and information technology. if our facilities or operations of third parties upon which we rely in our supply chain and critical business operations were to be disrupted as a result of a significant equipment or system failure, natural disaster, power, water or communications outage, fire, explosion, critical supply failure, terrorism, cybersecurity attack, political disruption, outbreak of pandemics, insurrection, armed conflict or war, labor dispute, work stoppage or slowdown, technology failure, adverse weather conditions or other reason, our financial performance, operations and business could be adversely affected. interruptions could cause an inability to meet customer demand or contractual commitments, increase our costs, reduce our sales, and impact our business processes and activities, including our ability to timely report financial results. we also have or operate through a concentration of operations on certain sites, such as production and shared services centers, where business interruptions could cause material damage and costs. any interruption in capability may be lengthy and have lasting effects, require a significant amount of management and other employees' time and focus, and require us to make substantial expenditures to remedy the situation, which could negatively affect our operations, business processes and activities, profitability and financial condition. any recovery under our insurance policies may not offset the lost sales or increased costs that may be experienced during a disruption of operations or any resultant longer-term loss of suppliers, sales or customers, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, cash flow and results of operations.
our business could be adversely affected by the availability of products, parts and raw materials from our supply chain or the inability of suppliers to meet delivery requirements.
our business relies on third-party suppliers, including contract manufacturing, and commodity markets to secure select finished goods and raw materials, parts and components used in our products, and we expect that reliance to increase. parts and raw materials commonly used in our products include motors, fabricated parts, castings, bearings, seals, batteries, pcbs and electronic components, as well as steel, brass, nickel, copper, aluminum and plastics. we are exposed to the availability of these parts, materials and finished goods, which may be subject to curtailment or change due to, among other things, changes in the strategy or production planning of suppliers including decisions to exit production of key components upon which we rely, interruptions in production by suppliers, labor disputes, the impaired financial condition of a particular supplier, suppliers' capacity allocations to other purchasers, changes in trade protection measures including tariffs, exchange rates and prevailing price levels, ability to meet regulatory requirements, weather emergencies, effects of pandemics or acts of war or terrorism. any delay in our suppliers' abilities to provide us with necessary materials could impair our ability to deliver products to our customers and, accordingly, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.
we may not achieve some or all of the expected benefits of our restructuring and realignment plans and our restructuring and realignment may adversely affect our business.
in recent fiscal years, we have initiated restructuring and realignment plans in an effort to optimize our cost structure and improve our operational efficiency and effectiveness. in 2017, we undertook steps to advance a multi-year effort to transform many of our support functions and related technologies, including finance, human resources and procurement. challenges with the enabling technologies and delays in implementing planned restructuring and realignment activities have resulted in delayed realization of some the expected operational and financial benefits from such actions. as such, we may not be able to obtain all of the cost savings and benefits that were initially anticipated in connection with our restructuring and realignment plans. additionally, as a result of these plans, we may experience a loss of continuity, loss of accumulated knowledge or inefficiency during transitional periods and ongoing operations. realignment and restructuring require a significant amount of management and other employees' time and focus, which may divert attention from operating and growing our business.
the successful implementation and execution of our restructuring and realignment actions are critical to achieving our expected cost savings as well as effectively competing in the marketplace and positioning us for future growth. factors that may impede a successful implementation include the retention of key employees, the impact of regulatory matters including tax, matters involving certain third-party service providers selected to assist us, including staffing, technology and the service providers' compliance with the company's internal controls over financial reporting, and adverse economic market conditions. if our restructuring and realignment actions are not executed successfully, it could have a material adverse effect on the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting as well as our competitive position, business, financial condition, cash flow and results of operations.
our strategy includes acquisitions, and we may not be able to execute acquisitions of suitable candidates or integrate acquisitions successfully.
as part of our growth strategy, we plan to continue to pursue the acquisition of other companies, assets, technologies, product lines and customer channels that either complement or expand our existing business. we may not be able to identify suitable candidates, negotiate appropriate acquisition terms, obtain financing that may be needed to consummate acquisitions, complete proposed acquisitions, successfully integrate acquired businesses into our existing operations or expand into new markets. in addition, we cannot make assurances that any acquisition will perform as planned, be accretive to earnings, or prove to be beneficial to our operations or cash flow.
acquisitions involve a number of risks and present financial, managerial and operational challenges, including: diversion of management attention from existing businesses and operations; integration of technology, operations personnel, and financial and other systems; potentially insufficient cybersecurity controls; insufficient internal controls over financial or compliance activities or financial reporting; the failure to realize expected synergies; the assumption of liabilities normally assumed with an acquisition as well as the possibility that we become exposed to substantial undisclosed liabilities or new material risks associated with the acquired businesses; and the loss of key employees of the acquired businesses. failure to successfully execute our growth strategy via acquisitions and successfully integrate these acquisitions could adversely affect our competitive position, business, financial condition or results of operations.
failure to comply with laws, regulations and policies, including but not limited to the u.s. foreign corrupt practices act, other applicable anti-corruption legislation and data privacy and security laws, could result in fines, criminal penalties and an adverse effect on our business and reputation.
given our global operations, we are subject to regulation under a wide variety of u.s. federal and state and non-u.s. laws, regulations and policies, including laws related to anti-corruption, trade regulations, including export and import compliance, anti-trust and money laundering. the u.s. foreign corrupt practices act (the "fcpa"), the u.k. bribery act of 2010 and similar anti-bribery laws in other jurisdictions generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to government officials or other persons for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. our policies mandate compliance with these anti-bribery laws. we operate in many parts of the world that are recognized as having governmental and commercial corruption and in certain circumstances, strict compliance with anti-bribery laws may conflict with local customs and practices. we cannot assure you that our internal control policies and procedures will always protect us from improper conduct of our employees or business partners. in the event that we believe or have reason to believe that our employees or business partners have or may have violated applicable laws, regulations or policies, including anti-corruption laws, we are required to investigate the relevant facts and circumstances, which can be expensive and require significant time and attention from senior management. any such violation could result in substantial fines, sanctions, civil and/or criminal penalties, termination of relationships with business partners and curtailment of operations in certain jurisdictions, and as a result might materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition. in addition, actual or alleged violations could damage our reputation and ability to do business.
additionally, to conduct our operations, we regularly move data across borders, and consequently we are subject to a variety of continuously evolving and developing laws and regulations in the united states, such as the california consumer protection act, and abroad regarding privacy, data protection and data security. the scope of the laws that may be applicable to us is often uncertain and may be conflicting, particularly with respect to foreign laws. for example, the european union's general data protection regulation ("gdpr") greatly increases the jurisdictional reach of european union law and adds a broad array of requirements for handling personal data, including the enforcement of data subject rights and public disclosure of significant data breaches. other countries, such as china, have enacted or are enacting data localization and security laws that require data to stay within their borders. all of these evolving legal and operational requirements impose significant costs of compliance that are likely to increase over time. any such violation could result in substantial fines, sanctions or civil penalties, damage to our reputation and might materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition.
our business is subject to foreign currency exchange rates fluctuations.
we conduct approximately 51% of our business in various locations outside the united states. we are exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency transaction exchange rates, particularly with respect to the euro, swedish krona, polish zloty, canadian dollar, british pound and australian dollar. change in the value of currencies of the countries in which we do business relative to the value of the u.s. dollar or euro could affect our ability to sell products competitively and control our cost structure, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. additionally, we are subject to foreign exchange translation risk due to changes in the value of foreign currencies in relation to our reporting currency, the u.s. dollar. the translation risk is primarily concentrated in the exchange rate between the u.s. dollar and the euro, chinese yuan, british pound, canadian dollar, swedish krona and australian dollar. as the u.s. dollar fluctuates against other currencies in which we transact business, revenue and income can be impacted. for instance, our 2019 revenue decreased by 2.4% due to unfavorable foreign currency impacts. strengthening of the u.s. dollar relative to the euro and the currencies of the other countries in which we do business, could materially and adversely affect our sales growth in future periods. refer to item 7a. "quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk" for additional information on foreign exchange risk.
failure to retain our existing senior management, engineering, technology, sales and other key personnel or the inability to attract and retain new qualified personnel could negatively impact our ability to operate or grow our business.
our success will continue to depend to a significant extent on our ability to retain or attract employees in senior management, engineering, technology, sales, project management and other key personnel. the ability to attract or retain employees will depend on our ability to offer attractive compensation, benefits, training and development opportunities and build an inclusive and diverse culture in an increasingly competitive environment for talent, particularly in the fields of technology, innovation and data science. we will need to continue to develop qualified talent to support business growth and succession planning and to replace departing employees, all of which are important to our long-term success. a failure in effective succession planning, transfer of knowledge and smooth transitions involving key employees could hinder our strategic planning and execution. a failure to retain or attract highly-skilled personnel could adversely affect our reputation, ability to meet the needs of our customers, operating results or ability to operate or grow our business.
product defects, unanticipated use or inadequate disclosures with respect to our products could adversely affect our business, reputation and financial statements.
defects or inadequacies in manufacturing, design, software, security or service of our products (including such defects in products or components that we source from third parties), unanticipated use of, or inadequate disclosure of risks relating to the use of our products could create product safety, product security, regulatory or environmental risks, including personal injury, death, property or environmental damage. these events could lead to recalls, safety or security alerts relating to our products, result in the removal of a product from the market and result in liability claims being brought against us. although we have liability insurance, we cannot be certain that this insurance coverage will continue to be available to us at a reasonable cost or will be adequate to cover any liability claims. manufacturing, design, software, security or service defects or inadequacies may also result in contractual damages or credits being issued, which could impact our profitability. recalls, removals and liability and quality claims can result in significant costs, as well as negative publicity and damage to our reputation that could reduce demand for our products and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
our financial results can be difficult to predict.
our business is impacted by a substantial amount of short cycle, and book-and-bill business, which we have limited insight into, particularly for the business that we transact through our distributors. we are also impacted by large projects, whose timing can change based upon customer requirements due to a number of factors affecting the project beyond our knowledge or control, such as funding, readiness of the project and regulatory approvals. accordingly, our financial results for any given period can be difficult to predict.
changes in our effective tax rates and tax expenses may adversely affect our financial results.
we sell our products in approximately 150 countries and 51% of our revenue was generated outside the united states in 2019. given the global nature of our business, a number of factors may increase our effective tax rates and tax expense, including:
•   the geographic mix of jurisdictions in which profits are earned and taxed;
•   the statutory tax rates and tax laws in the jurisdictions in which we conduct business;
•   the resolution of tax issues arising from tax examinations by various tax authorities; and
•   the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities.
xylem is regularly examined by various tax authorities throughout the world and the resolutions of these examinations do not typically have a significant impact on our effective tax rates and tax expenses but they could. additionally, in december 2017, the united states enacted tax reform legislation ("tax act"). the legislation implements many new u.s. domestic and international tax provisions. many aspects of the tax act have been clarified through regulations, however several aspects remain unclear and additional clarifying guidance is expected to be issued (by the internal revenue service ("irs"), the u.s. treasury department or via a technical correction law change), although it may not be clarified for some time. in addition, many u.s. states have not yet updated their laws to take into account the new federal legislation. as a result, there may be further impacts of the new law on our results of operations and financial condition. it is possible that the tax act, or interpretations under it, could change and could have an adverse effect on us, and such effect could be material.
our indebtedness may affect our business and may restrict our operational flexibility.
as of december 31, 2019, our total outstanding indebtedness was $2,316 million as described under "liquidity and capital resources." our indebtedness could:
•   increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions;
•   limit our ability to pay future dividends;
•   limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry in which we operate;
•   require that a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations be used for the payment of interest on our indebtedness instead of funding working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions or other general corporate purposes; and
•   increase the amount of interest expense that we must pay because some of our borrowings are at variable interest rates, which, as interest rates increase, would result in higher interest expense.
in addition, there can be no assurance that future borrowings or equity financing will be available to us on favorable terms or at all for the payment or refinancing of our indebtedness. if we incur additional debt or raise equity through the issuance of preferred stock, the terms of the debt or preferred stock issued may give the holders rights, preferences and privileges senior to those of holders of our common stock, particularly in the event of liquidation. the terms of the debt may also impose additional and more stringent restrictions on our operations than we currently have.
our ability to make scheduled principal payments of, to pay interest on, or to refinance our indebtedness and to satisfy our other debt obligations will depend on our future operating performance, which may be affected by factors beyond our control. if we are unable to service our indebtedness, our business, financial condition and results of operations would be materially adversely affected.
we face risks related to legal and regulatory proceedings.
we are subject to various laws, ordinances, regulations and other requirements of government authorities in foreign countries and in the united states, any violation of which could potentially create substantial liability for us and damage our reputation. changes in laws, ordinances, regulations or other government policies, the nature, timing, and effect of which are uncertain, may significantly increase our expenses and liabilities.
from time to time we are involved in legal and regulatory proceedings that are incidental to the operation of our businesses (or the business operations of previously owned entities). these proceedings may seek remedies relating to environmental matters, tax, intellectual property, acquisitions or divestitures, product liability and personal injury claims, privacy, employment, labor and pension matters, government contract issues and commercial or contractual disputes. our continuing transition to connected or digital technologies and solutions has increased our exposure to intellectual property litigation and we expect that this risk will continue to increase as we execute on our innovation and technology priorities.
it is not possible to predict with certainty the outcome of claims, investigations, regulatory proceedings and lawsuits, and we could in the future incur judgments, fines or penalties or enter into settlements and claims that could have an adverse effect on our reputation as well as an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition in any particular period.  additionally, we may be required to change or cease operations at one or more facilities if a regulatory agency determines that we have failed to comply with laws, regulations or orders applicable to our business.
the global and diverse nature of our operations, coupled with the increase in regulation and enforcement in many regions of the globe, means that legal and compliance risks will continue to exist and additional legal and regulatory proceedings and other contingencies, the outcome of which cannot be predicted with certainty, will arise from time to time. in addition, subsequent developments in legal and regulatory proceedings may affect our assessments and estimates of loss contingencies recorded as a reserve and require us to make payments in excess of our reserves, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.
weather conditions and climate changes may adversely affect, or cause volatility in, our financial results.
the unpredictable nature of weather conditions, including heavy flooding, droughts and fluctuations in temperatures or weather patterns, including as a result of climate change, can positively or negatively impact portions of our business and may result in volatility for certain portions of our business, as well as the operations of certain of our customers and suppliers. for example, heavy rain events due to climate change may increase demand for some of our xylemvue solutions that may help customers minimize water and storm water overflows. within the dewatering space, pumps provided through our godwin and flygt brands are used to remove excess or unwanted water. heavy flooding due to weather conditions drives increased demand for these applications. on the other hand, drought conditions drive higher demand for pumps used in agricultural and turf irrigation applications, such as those provided by our goulds water technology and lowara brands. fluctuations in temperatures result in varying levels of demand for products used in residential and commercial hydronic applications where homes and buildings are heated and cooled with hvac units such as those provided by our bell & gossett brand.
if we do not or cannot adequately protect our intellectual property, if third parties infringe or misappropriate our intellectual property rights, or if third parties claim that we are infringing or misappropriating their intellectual property rights, we may suffer competitive injury, expend significant resources enforcing our rights or defending against such claims, or be prevented from selling products or services.
we own numerous patents, trademarks, copyrights, trade secrets and other intellectual property and licenses to intellectual property owned by others, which in the aggregate are important to our business. our intellectual property rights may provide us with competitive advantage because they may help us differentiate our technologies, products and services, including our growing portfolio of data analytics and digitally-enabled offerings. the intellectual property rights that we have or obtain, however, may not provide us with a significant competitive advantage because they may not be sufficiently broad or may be challenged, invalidated, circumvented, misappropriated, independently developed, or designed-around, particularly given our international operations in countries where laws governing intellectual property rights are not highly developed, protected or enforced. our failure to obtain or maintain intellectual property rights that convey competitive advantage, adequately protect our intellectual property or detect or prevent circumvention, misappropriation or unauthorized use of such property and the cost of enforcing our intellectual property rights could adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.
from time to time, we receive notices from third parties alleging intellectual property infringement or misappropriation. any dispute or litigation regarding intellectual property could be costly and time-consuming due to the complexity and the uncertainty of intellectual property litigation. our intellectual property portfolio may not be useful in asserting a counterclaim, or negotiating a license, in response to a claim of infringement or misappropriation. in addition, as a result of such claims of infringement or misappropriation, we could lose our rights to critical technology, be unable to license critical technology or sell critical products and services, be required to pay substantial damages or license fees with respect to the infringed rights or be required to redesign our products at substantial cost, any of which could adversely impact our competitive position, financial condition and results of operations. even if we successfully defend against claims of infringement or misappropriation, we may incur significant costs and diversion of management attention and resources, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
a significant portion of our products and offerings in our measurement & control solutions segment are affected by the availability and regulation of radio spectrum and could be affected by interference with the radio spectrum that we use.
a significant portion of the offerings in our measurement & control solutions segment use radio spectrum, which is subject to government regulation. to the extent we introduce new products designed for use in the united states or another country into a new market, such products may require significant modification or redesign in order to meet frequency requirements and other regulatory specifications. in some countries, limitations on frequency availability or the cost of making necessary modifications may preclude us from selling our products in those countries. the regulations that govern our use of the radio spectrum may change and the changes may require us to modify our products or seek new partnerships, either directly or due to interference caused by new consumer products allowed under the regulations.  the inability to modify our products to meet such requirements, the possible delays in completing such modifications, and the cost of such modifications all could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. in addition, suitable partners for co-development may not be able to be secured by us.
in the united states, our products are primarily designed to use licensed spectrum in the 900mhz range.  if the fcc does not renew our existing spectrum licenses, our business could be adversely affected.  in addition, there may be insufficient available frequencies in some markets to sustain or develop our planned operations at a commercially feasible price or at all.
outside of the united states, certain of our products require the use of radio frequency and are subject to regulations. in some jurisdictions, radio station licenses may be granted for a fixed term and must be periodically renewed. our advanced and smart metering systems offering transmits to (and receives information from, if applicable) handheld, mobile, or fixed network reading devices in licensed bands made available to us through strategic partnerships and are reliant to some extent on the licensed spectrum continuing to be available through our partners or our customers. we may be unable to find partners or customers that have access to sufficient frequencies in some markets to sustain or develop our planned operations or to find partners or customers that have access to sufficient frequencies in the relevant markets at a commercially feasible price or at all.
we may incur impairment charges for our goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets which would negatively impact our operating results.
we have a significant amount of goodwill and purchased intangible assets on our balance sheet as a result of acquisitions we have completed. as of december 31, 2019, the net carrying value of our goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets totaled approximately $3 billion. in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, we evaluate these assets for impairment at least annually, or more frequently if interim indicators suggest that a potential impairment could exist. significant negative industry or economic trends, disruptions to our business, inability to effectively integrate acquired businesses, unexpected significant changes or planned changes in use of the assets, failure of the fcc to renew licenses, divestitures and market capitalization declines may impair our goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets. any material charges relating to such impairments could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.
we cannot make assurances that we will pay dividends on our common stock or continue to repurchase our common stock under board approved share repurchase plans, and likewise our indebtedness could limit our ability to pay dividends or make share repurchases.
the timing, declaration, amount and payment of future dividends to our shareholders fall within the discretion of our board of directors and will depend on many factors, including our financial condition, cash flows, results of operations and capital requirements, as well as applicable law, regulatory constraints, industry practice and other business considerations that our board of directors considers relevant. there can be no assurance that we will pay a dividend in the future or continue to pay dividends.
further, the timing and amount of the repurchase of our common stock under board approved share repurchase plans has similar dependencies as the payment of dividends and accordingly, there can be no assurances that we will repurchase our common stock.
additionally, if we cannot generate sufficient cash flows from operations to meet our debt payment obligations, then our ability to pay dividends, if so determined by the board of directors, or make share repurchases will be impaired and we may be required to attempt to restructure or refinance our debt, raise additional capital or take other actions such as selling assets, reducing or delaying capital expenditures, reducing our dividend or delaying or curtailing share repurchases. there can be no assurance, however, that any such actions could be effected on satisfactory terms, if at all, or would be permitted by the terms of our debt or our other credit and contractual arrangements.
developments in environmental laws and regulations could impact our financial condition or results of operations.
our operations, product and service offerings are subject to and affected by many federal, state, local and foreign environmental laws and regulations, including those enacted in response to climate change concerns. in addition, we could be affected by future environmental laws or regulations. compliance with current and future environmental laws and regulations currently requires and is expected to continue to require operating and capital expenditures.
environmental laws and regulations may authorize substantial fines and criminal sanctions as well as facility shutdowns to address violations, and may require the installation of costly pollution control equipment or operational changes to limit emissions or discharges. we also incur, and expect to continue to incur, costs to comply with current environmental laws and regulations.
developments such as the adoption of new environmental laws and regulations, stricter enforcement of existing laws and regulations, violations by us of such laws and regulations, discovery of previously unknown or more extensive contamination, litigation involving environmental impacts, our inability to recover costs associated with any such developments, or financial insolvency of other responsible parties could in the future have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.
the level of returns on postretirement benefit plan assets, changes in interest rates and other factors could affect our earnings and cash flows in future periods.
certain members of our current and retired employee population are covered by pension and other employee-related defined benefit plans (collectively, postretirement benefit plans). we may experience significant fluctuations in costs related to our postretirement benefit plans as a result of macro-economic factors, such as interest rates, that are beyond our control. the cost of our postretirement plans is incurred over long periods of time and involves factors and uncertainties during those periods which can be volatile and unpredictable, including rates of return on postretirement benefit plan assets, discount rates used to calculate liabilities and expenses and rates of future compensation increases. management develops each assumption using relevant plan and company experience and expectations in conjunction with market-related data. our liquidity, financial position (including shareholders' equity) and results of operations could be materially affected by significant changes in key economic indicators, actuarial experience, financial market volatility, future legislation and other governmental regulatory actions.
we make contributions to fund our postretirement benefit plans when considered necessary or advantageous to do so. the macro-economic factors discussed above, including the return on postretirement benefit plan assets and the minimum funding requirements established by local government funding or taxing authorities, or established by other agreement, may influence future funding requirements. a significant decline in the fair value of our plan assets, or other adverse changes to our overall pension and other employee-related benefit plans, could require us to make significant funding contributions and affect cash flows in future periods.
risks related to ownership of our common stock the market price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly.
we cannot predict the prices at which our common stock may trade. the market price of our common stock may fluctuate widely, depending on many factors, some of which may be beyond our control, including:
•   actual or anticipated fluctuations in our operating results due to factors related to our business;
•   success or failure of our business strategy;
•   our quarterly or annual earnings, or those of other companies in our industry;
•   announcements by us or our competitors of significant new business awards or product and service offerings;
•   announcements by us or our competitors of significant acquisitions or divestitures;
•   changes in accounting standards, policies, guidance, interpretations or principles;
•   changes in earnings estimates by securities analysts or our ability to meet those estimates;
•   our ability to execute transformation, restructuring and realignment actions;
•   the operating and stock price performance of other comparable companies;
•   natural or environmental disasters or climate change considerations that investors believe may affect us;
•   overall market fluctuations;
•   uncertainty or instability arising from the global geopolitical environment or events or actual or potential global pandemics;
•   fluctuations in foreign currency impacts;
•   fluctuations in the budgets or spending of federal, state and local governmental entities around the world;
•   changes in laws and regulations affecting our business;
•   impact of trade protection measures including tariffs; and
•   general economic conditions and other external factors.
stock markets in general have experienced volatility that has often been unrelated to the operating performance of a particular company. these broad market fluctuations could adversely affect the trading price of our common stock.
risks related to our 2011 spin-off from itt corporation (now itt llc)
our spin-off from itt may expose us to potential liabilities.
pursuant to the distribution agreement and certain other agreements with itt (now itt llc) and exelis (acquired by harris inc.), itt and exelis agreed to indemnify us for certain liabilities, and we agreed to indemnify itt and exelis for certain liabilities. indemnities that we may be required to provide itt and exelis may be significant and could negatively impact our business. third parties could also seek to hold us responsible for any of the liabilities that itt or exelis agreed to retain. further, there can be no assurance that the indemnities from itt and exelis will be sufficient to protect us against the full amount of such liabilities, or that itt and exelis will be able to fully satisfy their indemnification obligations. moreover, even if we ultimately were to succeed in recovering from itt and exelis any amounts for which we are held liable, we may be temporarily required to bear these losses ourselves. each of these risks could negatively affect our business, results of operations, cash flow and financial condition.

this section of this form 10-k generally discusses 2019 and 2018 items and year-to-year comparisons between 2019 and 2018. discussions of 2017 items and year-to-year comparisons between 2018 and 2017 that are not included in this form 10-k can be found in "management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations" in part ii, item 7 of the company's annual report on form 10-k for the fiscal year ended december 31, 2018.
overview xylem is a leading global water technology company. we design, manufacture and service highly engineered products and solutions ranging across a wide variety of critical applications in utility, industrial, residential and commercial building services settings. our broad portfolio of solutions addresses customer needs across the water cycle, from the delivery, measurement and use of drinking water to the collection, test, treatment and analysis of wastewater to the return of water to the environment. our product and service offerings are organized into three reportable segments that are aligned around the critical market applications they provide: water infrastructure, applied water and measurement & control solutions.
•   water infrastructure serves the water infrastructure sector with pump systems that transport water from aquifers, lakes, rivers and seas; with filtration, ultraviolet and ozone systems that provide treatment, making the water fit to use; and pumping solutions that move the wastewater and storm water to treatment facilities where our mixers, biological treatment, monitoring and control systems provide the primary functions in the treatment process. we also provide sales and rental of specialty dewatering pumps and related equipment and services. additionally, our offerings use monitoring and control, smart and connected technologies to allow for remote monitoring of performance and enable products to self-optimize pump operations maximizing energy efficiency and minimizing unplanned downtime and maintenance for our customers. in the water infrastructure segment, we provide the majority of our sales directly to customers along with strong applications expertise, while the remaining amount is through distribution partners.
•   applied water serves the water usage applications sector with water pressure boosting systems for heating, ventilation and air conditioning, and for fire protection systems to the residential and commercial building services markets. in addition, our pumps, heat exchangers and controls provide cooling to power plants and manufacturing facilities, circulation for food and beverage processing, as well as boosting systems for agricultural irrigation. in the applied water segment, we provide the majority of our sales through long-standing relationships with many of the leading independent distributors in the markets we serve, with the remainder going directly to customers.
•   measurement &amp; control solutions primarily serves the utility infrastructure solutions and services sector by delivering communications, smart metering, measurement and control technologies and critical infrastructure technologies that allow customers to more effectively use their distribution networks for the delivery, monitoring and control of critical resources such as water, electricity and natural gas. we also provide analytical instrumentation used to measure and analyze water quality, flow and level in clean water, wastewater, surface water and coastal environments. additionally, we offer software and services including cloud-based analytics, remote monitoring and data management, leak detection, condition assessment, asset management and pressure monitoring solutions. we also offer smart lighting solutions that improve efficiency and public safety efforts across communities. in the measurement &amp; control solutions segment, we generate our sales through a combination of long-standing relationships with leading distributors and dedicated channel partners as well as direct sales depending on the regional availability of distribution channels and the type of product.
key performance indicators and non-gaap measures management reviews key performance indicators including revenue, gross margins, segment operating income and margins, orders growth, working capital and backlog, among others. in addition, we consider certain non-gaap (or "adjusted") measures to be useful to management and investors evaluating our operating performance for the periods presented, and to provide a tool for evaluating our ongoing operations, liquidity and management of assets. this information can assist investors in assessing our financial performance and measures our ability to generate capital for deployment among competing strategic alternatives and initiatives, including, but not limited to, dividends, acquisitions, share repurchases and debt repayment. excluding revenue, xylem provides guidance only on a non-gaap basis due to the inherent difficulty in forecasting certain amounts that would be included in gaap earnings, such as discrete tax items, without unreasonable effort. these adjusted metrics are consistent with how management views our business and are used to make financial, operating and planning decisions. these metrics, however, are not measures of financial performance under gaap and should not be considered a substitute for revenue, operating income, net income, earnings per share (basic and diluted) or net cash from operating activities as determined in accordance with gaap. we consider the following items to represent non-gaap measures as well as the related reconciling items to the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with gaap. the non-gaap measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies, to be key performance indicators:
•   "organic revenue" and "organic orders" defined as revenue and orders, respectively, excluding the impact of fluctuations in foreign currency translation and contributions from acquisitions and divestitures. divestitures include sales of insignificant portions of our business that did not meet the criteria for classification as a discontinued operation. the period-over-period change resulting from foreign currency translation impacts is determined by translating current period and prior period activity using the same currency conversion rate.
•   "constant currency" defined as financial results adjusted for foreign currency translation impacts by translating current period and prior period activity using the same currency conversion rate. this approach is used for countries whose functional currency is not the u.s. dollar.
•   "adjusted net income" and "adjusted earnings per share" defined as net income and earnings per share, respectively, adjusted to exclude, as applicable, restructuring and realignment costs, special charges, tax-related special items and gains and losses from the sale of a business. a reconciliation of adjusted net income is provided below.
restructuring and realignment, net of tax of $19 and $12               63          0.35               36          0.20
special charges, net of tax of $6 and $1                              172          0.95               12          0.07

▪   "adjusted operating expenses" and "adjusted gross profit" defined as operating expenses and gross profit, respectively, adjusted to exclude restructuring and realignment costs and special charges.
▪   "adjusted operating income" defined as operating income, adjusted to exclude restructuring and realignment costs and special charges, and "adjusted operating margin" defined as adjusted operating income divided by total revenue.
▪   "realignment costs" defined as costs not included in restructuring costs that are incurred as part of actions taken to reposition our business, including items such as professional fees, severance, relocation, travel, facility set-up and other costs.
▪   "sensus acquisition related costs" defined as costs incurred by the company associated with the acquisition of sensus that are being reported within operating income. these costs include integration costs, acquisition costs, costs related to the recognition of the backlog intangible asset amortization recorded in purchase accounting.
▪   "special charges" defined as costs incurred by the company, such as acquisition and integration related costs not included in "sensus acquisition related costs", non-cash impairment charges and other special non-operating items, such as pension adjustments.
▪   "tax-related special items" defined as tax items, such as tax return versus tax provision adjustments, tax exam impacts, tax law change impacts, excess tax benefits/losses and other discrete tax adjustments.
▪   "free cash flow" defined as net cash from operating activities, as reported in the statement of cash flows, less capital expenditures as well as adjustments for other significant items that impact current results which management believes are not related to our ongoing operations and performance. our definition of "free cash flow" does not consider certain non-discretionary cash payments, such as debt. the following table provides a reconciliation of free cash flow.
net cash provided by operating activities                           $839              $586

executive summary xylem reported revenue of $5,249 million for 2019, an increase of $42 million, or 0.8%, from $5,207 million reported in 2018. on a constant currency basis, revenue increased by $166 million, or 3.2%, primarily consisting of organic revenue growth of $188 million, or 3.6%, driven by growth in all end markets and across all segments. a net decrease in revenue related to acquisition and divestiture impacts of $22 million partially offset the organic revenue growth during the year.
operating income for 2019 was $486 million, reflecting a decrease of $168 million, or 25.7%, compared to $654 million in 2018. operating margin was 9.3% for 2019 versus 12.6% for 2018, a decrease of 330 basis points. operating margin was negatively impacted by increased special charges of $147 million, consisting entirely of non-cash impairment charges, and increased restructuring and realignment costs of $34 million during the year. excluding the impact of these items, adjusted operating income was $727 million, with an adjusted operating margin of 13.9% in 2019 as compared to adjusted operating income of $714 million with an adjusted operating margin of 13.7% in 2018. the slight increase in adjusted operating margin was primarily due to cost reductions from our global procurement and productivity initiatives, including restructuring savings, improved price realization and favorable volume impacts. these impacts were partially offset by cost inflation, unfavorable mix, increased spending on strategic investments and increased cost of quality.
additional financial highlights for 2019 include the following:
•   net income attributable to xylem of $401 million, or $2.21 per diluted share ($547 million or $3.02 per diluted share on an adjusted basis, up 4.8% from 2018)
•   cash from operating activities of $839 million, and free cash flow, excluding sensus acquisition related costs, of $613 million up 75% from 2018
•   orders of $5,339 million, down 1.8% from $5,437 million in 2018 (up 0.9% on an organic basis)
2020 business outlook we anticipate total revenue growth of approximately 1% in 2020, with organic revenue growth anticipated to be in the range of 1% to 3%. the following is a summary of our 2019 organic revenue performance and 2020 organic revenue outlook by end market.
•   utilities increased approximately 6% for 2019 on an organic basis driven by strength in the united states, the emerging markets and western europe, partially offset by weakness in canada. for 2020, we expect organic growth in the low-single-digit range driven by healthy water and wastewater spending in the united states, smart meter and infrastructure analytics growth opportunities and steady low-single-digit growth in europe. we also anticipate a healthy infrastructure investment focus in the emerging markets will continue in china, india and africa.
•   industrial increased by approximately 1% for 2019 on an organic basis driven by strength in the united states, europe and the middle east and africa, partially offset by weakness in latin america and canada. for 2020, we expect organic revenue to remain relatively flat driven by soft growth within the north america dewatering business during the first half of the year, as oil and gas markets continue to be soft. we anticipate mixed market conditions outside of the united states with modest strength in asia pacific offset by softness in the middle east due to geopolitical and economic uncertainty. we anticipate that europe will remain relatively flat during the year.
•   in the commercial markets, organic growth was approximately 3% for 2019 driven by strength in the emerging markets and north america, partially offset by weakness in western europe. for 2020, we expect organic growth in the low-single-digit range as we anticipate that soft overall market conditions will recover during the second half of the year driven by continued strength in the united states and solid market conditions in europe. the emerging markets will also continue to drive organic growth, led by initiatives in the china and india building markets.
•   in residential markets, organic growth was approximately 2% in 2019 driven by strength in the united states and asia pacific, partially offset by weakness in western europe and the middle east and africa. for 2020, we expect low-single-digit growth primarily driven by the united states housing market and a strong outlook in europe. we also anticipate modest growth opportunities for a second water supply in china and other countries within asia.
we will continue to strategically execute restructuring and realignment actions primarily to reposition our european and north american businesses in an effort to optimize our cost structure and improve our operational efficiency and effectiveness. during 2019, we incurred $53 million and $29 million in restructuring and realignment costs, respectively. we realized approximately $6 million of incremental net savings in 2019 from actions initiated in 2018, and an additional $16 million of net savings from our 2019 actions. as a result of our 2018 and 2019 actions we expect to realize approximately $25 million of incremental net savings in 2020 and beyond. during 2020, we currently expect to incur between $35 million and $45 million in restructuring and realignment costs.
we plan to continue to take actions and focus spending in 2020 on actions that allow us to make progress on our top strategic priorities.  the priority of accelerating profitable growth encompasses our initiatives to drive commercial leadership, grow in emerging markets and strengthen innovation and technology through creation of new centers of excellence, a streamlined approach to product development and strategic acquisitions.  the priority of driving continuous improvement is an area where we will continue to work to create new opportunities to unlock savings by eliminating waste and increasing efficiencies, which is supported by efforts to expand and further deepen our talent pool.  we plan to continue to deploy capital in smart, disciplined ways to develop and acquire solutions to address our customers' challenges. finally, we continue to work to improve cash performance and generate capital to return to our shareholders.

revenue revenue generated for 2019 was $5,249 million, an increase of $42 million, or 0.8%, compared to $5,207 million in 2018. on a constant currency basis, revenue grew 3.2% during 2019. this increase in revenue at constant currency was primarily driven by an increase in organic revenue of $188 million reflecting strong organic growth in the united states and the emerging markets, with the exception of latin america, partially offset by declines in canada and western europe. a net decrease in revenue related to acquisition and divestiture impacts of $22 million partially offset organic growth during the year.
the following table illustrates the impact from organic growth, recent acquisitions and divestitures, and foreign currency translation in relation to revenue during 2019:

(a)   foreign currency translation impact for the year primarily due to the weakening in value of various currencies against the u.s. dollar, the largest being the euro, the chinese yuan, the british pound, the swedish krona and the australian dollar.
water infrastructure water infrastructure revenue slightly increased $1 million to $2,177 million in 2019 (3.3% increase on a constant currency basis) compared to 2018. revenue was negatively impacted by $70 million of foreign currency translation, with the change at constant currency coming entirely from organic growth during the year of $71 million. organic growth for the year was driven by strength in the utility end market, particularly in the united states, where we benefited from healthy order intake and strong market conditions across both applications. the utility end market also saw growth in asia pacific and western europe driven by strong project deployments during the year. the industrial end market has remained relatively flat during the year with organic growth in the emerging markets and the united states, where we benefited from solid order intake and a strong mining market over the first half of the year, which was partially offset by declines in western europe due to the timing of project deployments in the prior year. organic growth in both end markets also benefited from price realization during the year.
from an application perspective, organic revenue growth for the year was primarily driven by our transport application. the transport application had strong organic revenue growth driven by project deliveries and price realization in the united states and the emerging markets. organic growth from the global dewatering application was also up modestly for the year, with strong growth in first half of the year, coming from strength in construction and mining in the united states and australia, being offset by rental revenue declines in north america in the second half of the year driven by a sharp drop off in oil and gas. organic revenue from our treatment application also contributed to the segment's growth driven by project deliveries in the united states and asia pacific where we benefited from strong order intake coming into the year. this organic growth was partially offset by declines in the middle east and latin america, primarily due to the lapping of large treatment project deliveries in these regions in the prior year.
applied water applied water revenue increased $7 million, or 0.5%, in 2019 (2.3% increase on a constant currency basis) compared to 2018. revenue was negatively impacted by $29 million of foreign currency translation, with the change at constant currency coming entirely from organic growth during the year of $36 million. organic growth for the year was primarily driven by strength in the commercial end market, as well as prudent growth in the industrial and residential end markets.
from an application perspective, organic revenue growth during the year was led by strength in the building services application in the commercial market which was driven by market expansion in the emerging markets, primarily in the middle east & africa, and product localization in china, partially offset by softness in western europe. the industrial water application had modest organic growth during the year, primarily driven by market growth in western europe, coupled with customers stocking orders due to geopolitical concerns, and strength in the united states, partially offset by some declines in the emerging market regions. organic growth in building services application in the residential market came primarily from healthy market growth in the united states and strong second water supply business in china, which was partially offset by declines in western europe and the middle east. organic growth within the segment also benefited from price realization during the year.
measurement & control solutions measurement & control solutions revenue increased $34 million, or 2.3%, in 2019 (3.9% increase on a constant currency basis) compared to 2018. revenue was negatively impacted by $25 million of foreign currency translation during the year. revenue growth at constant currency was made up of organic revenue growth of $81 million, or 5.4%, which was partially offset by $22 million of reduced revenue related to the net acquisition and divestiture impacts during the year. organic revenue growth for the year was driven by strength in the utility end market, primarily in the united states and the middle east, partially offset by declines in the united kingdom.
from an application perspective, organic revenue from the water metrology application contributed the majority of the organic growth for the segment, with large project deployments in the united states, the middle east and western europe during the year. the energy application also contributed to the organic growth during the year as gas project deployments more than offset the timing of a large electric project deployment in the prior year in the united states . this organic growth was partially offset by a decline in the software as a service ("saas") and other application primarily due to the timing of a large software sale in the prior year in the united kingdom. the test application remained relatively flat as compared to the prior year.
orders/backlog an order represents a legally enforceable, written document that includes the scope of work or services to be performed or equipment to be supplied to a customer, the corresponding price and the expected delivery date for the applicable products or services to be provided. an order often takes the form of a customer purchase order ("p.o.") or a signed quote from a xylem business. orders received during 2019 decreased by $98 million, or 1.8%, to $5,339 million (0.6% increase on a constant currency basis). order intake during the year was negatively impacted by $129 million of foreign currency translation. the order growth on a constant currency basis primarily consisted of organic order growth of $48 million, or 0.9%, over the prior year. net acquisition and divestiture activity of $17 million negatively impacted order growth during the year.
the following table illustrates the impact from organic growth, recent acquisitions and divestitures, and foreign currency translation in relation to orders during 2019:

(a)   foreign currency translation impact for the year primarily due to the weakening in value of various currencies against the u.s. dollar, the largest being the euro, the chinese yuan, the british pound, the swedish krona and the australian dollar.
water infrastructure water infrastructure segment orders decreased $21 million, or 0.9%, to $2,234 million (2.4% increase on a constant currency basis). order intake during the year was negatively impacted by $74 million of foreign currency translation. the order increase on a constant currency basis was driven by organic order growth in the transport application. transport organic order growth was primarily driven by a large smart city project order secured in india during the second half of the year and strong market conditions, coupled with some price realization, in europe, china and north america. organic orders for the treatment application declined during the year, primarily driven by project timing in north america and india due to the timing of large project orders in the prior year, partially offset by strong order intake in the middle east during the year.
applied water applied water segment orders slightly decreased $1 million to $1,556 million (1.8% increase on a constant currency basis). order intake during the year was negatively impacted by $29 million of foreign currency translation. the order increase on a constant currency basis was driven by strong organic order growth in the united states and china across both applications, which were partially offset by a reduction of orders in the middle east.
measurement & control solutions measurement & control solutions segment orders decreased $76 million, or 4.7%, to $1,549 million (3.1% decrease on a constant currency basis). order intake during the year was negatively impacted by $26 million of foreign currency translation. the order decrease on a constant currency basis was driven by an organic decline of $33 million, or 2.0%, which followed a difficult comparison to the prior year organic order growth of 18%, and $17 million of the net acquisition and divestiture impacts on the year. the decrease in organic orders during the year was driven by the energy application decline in north america, which had a significant electric deployment order in the prior year that did not repeat. water application orders grew organically during the year driven by strong order intake within the aia platform, partially offset by the lapping of large prior year orders for metrology projects, coupled with some softening market conditions, in north america and the middle east. saas and other experienced modest organic growth during the year, driven by order strength in north america, largely offset by the lapping of a
large uk software order in the prior year. organic orders for the test application declined during the quarter driven by project timing and soft market conditions in europe.
backlog backlog includes orders on hand as well as contractual customer agreements at the end of the period. delivery schedules vary from customer to customer based on their requirements. annual or multi-year contracts are subject to rescheduling and cancellation by customers due to the long-term nature of the contracts. as such, beginning total backlog, plus orders, minus revenues, will not equal ending total backlog due to contract adjustments, foreign currency fluctuations, and other factors. typically, large projects require longer lead production cycles and deployment schedules and delays can occur from time to time. total backlog was $1,801 million at december 31, 2019 and $1,689 million at december 31, 2018, an increase of 6.6%. we anticipate that approximately 60% of our total backlog at december 31, 2019 will be recognized as revenue during 2020. this is down from prior years due to the changing profile of our backlog which includes a greater portion of large multi-year projects.
gross margin gross margin as a percentage of consolidated revenue increased 10 basis points to 39.0% in 2019 as compared to 38.9% in 2018. the slight gross margin increase was primarily driven by cost reductions from global procurement and productivity improvement initiatives and price realization, which were partially offset by cost inflation and unfavorable mix.

research and development ("r&d") expenses r&d expense was $191 million, or 3.6% of revenue, in 2019 as compared to $189 million, or 3.6% of revenue, in 2018. additionally, we capitalized r&d on external sale software of $59 million in 2019 as compared to $60 million in 2018. our increased spending on r&d is driven by development needs to drive new product growth.
restructuring and asset impairment charges restructuring during 2019, we incurred restructuring costs of $20 million, $5 million and $28 million in our water infrastructure, applied water and measurement & control solutions segments, respectively. we incurred these charges related to actions taken in 2019 primarily as a continuation of our efforts to reposition our european and north american businesses to optimize our cost structure and improve our operational efficiency and effectiveness. the charges included the reduction of headcount and consolidation of facilities within our measurement & control solutions and water infrastructure segments, as well as headcount reductions within our applied water segment.
during 2018, we recognized restructuring costs of $9 million, $2 million and $9 million in our water infrastructure, applied water and measurement & control solutions, respectively. these charges were incurred primarily in an effort to reposition our european and north american businesses to optimize our cost structure and improve our operational efficiency and effectiveness. the charges included the reduction of headcount and consolidation of facilities within our measurement & control solutions and water infrastructure segments, as well as headcount reductions within our applied water segment.
the following is a rollforward of employee position eliminations associated with restructuring activities for the years ended december 31, 2019 and 2018:
the water infrastructure, applied water, and measurement & control solutions actions commenced in 2019 consist primarily of severance charges. the applied water actions are complete, the water infrastructure actions are expected to continue through q1 2020, and the measurement & control solutions actions are expected to continue through the fourth quarter of 2020. the water infrastructure, applied water, and measurement & control solutions actions commenced in 2018 consist primarily of severance charges and are complete. the water infrastructure, applied water, measurement & control solutions and corporate actions commenced in 2017 consist primarily of severance charges and are expected to continue through 2021. as a result of the actions initiated in 2019, we achieved savings of approximately $15 million in 2019 and estimate annual future net savings beginning in 2020 of approximately $39 million, resulting in $24 million of incremental savings from the 2019 actions.
asset impairment during the first and third quarter of 2019 we determined that certain assets within our measurement & control solutions segment, including customer relationships, internally developed software, proprietary technology, and plant property & equipment, were impaired. accordingly we recognized an impairment charge of $10 million during the year. refer to note 12, "goodwill and other intangible assets," for additional information.
during the fourth quarter of 2018 we determined that certain software assets within our water infrastructure segment were impaired. accordingly we recognized an impairment charge of $2 million.
goodwill impairment charge during the third quarter of 2019, the company recorded a goodwill impairment charge of $148 million related to the advanced infrastructure analytics ("aia") goodwill reporting unit. the impairment resulted from a downward revision of forecasted future cash flows. factors that contributed to the revised forecast in the third quarter include lower
than expected results as compared to prior forecasts, largely as a result of slower-than-expected conversion of pipeline opportunities to revenue. additionally, we have continued to invest in the aia platform ahead of the adoption curve, which has also impacted the near-term profitability of the business. these factors drove a decrease in the fair value, based on a discounted cash flow valuation, of the aia reporting unit that was below its carrying value as of july 1, 2019, requiring an impairment charge. refer to note 12, "goodwill and other intangible assets," for additional information.
operating income operating income was $486 million (operating margin of 9.3%) during 2019, a decrease of $168 million, or 25.7%, when compared to operating income of $654 million (operating margin of 12.6%) during the prior year. operating margin for the year was negatively impacted by increased special charges of $147 million, consisting entirely of non-cash impairment charges, and increased restructuring and realignment costs of $34 million as compared to the prior year. excluding these special charges and restructuring and realignment costs, adjusted operating income was $727 million (adjusted operating margin of 13.9%) for 2019 as compared to adjusted operating income of $714 million (adjusted operating margin of 13.7%) during the prior year. the slight increase in adjusted operating margin was primarily due to cost reductions from our global procurement and productivity initiatives, including restructuring savings, improved price realization and favorable volume impacts. these impacts were partially offset by cost inflation, unfavorable mix, increased spending on strategic investments and increased cost of quality.

applied water operating income for our applied water segment increased $5 million, or 2.1%, during 2019 as compared to the prior year, with operating margin also increasing from 15.4% to 15.6%. operating margin was negatively impacted by increased restructuring and realignment costs of $3 million in 2019. excluding these restructuring and realignment costs, adjusted operating income increased $8 million, or 3.3%, with adjusted operating margin increasing from 16.0% to 16.5%. the increase in adjusted operating margin was primarily due to cost reductions from our global procurement and productivity initiatives and price realization, which were partially offset by cost inflation, including tariffs, increased cost of quality, unfavorable mix, unfavorable volume and increased spending on strategic investments.
measurement & control solutions operating income for our measurement & control solutions segment decreased $185 million, or 156.8%, during 2019 as compared to the prior year, with operating margin also decreasing from 7.9% to (4.4)%. operating margin was negatively impacted by increased special charges of $154 million, consisting entirely of non-cash impairment charges, and increased restructuring and realignment costs of $20 million during the year. excluding these items, adjusted operating income decreased $11 million, or 7.8%, with adjusted operating margin decreasing from 9.4% to 8.5%.  the decrease in adjusted operating margin was primarily due to cost inflation, increased spending on strategic investments and unfavorable mix impacts. purchase accounting impacts from acquisitions also negatively affected operating margin. these impacts were partially offset by cost reductions from our global procurement and productivity initiatives, favorable volume impacts and price realization.
corporate and other operating loss for corporate and other decreased $6 million, or 10.2%, compared to the prior year, primarily due to $5 million of special charges incurred during 2018 that did not recur. excluding these costs, adjusted operating expense decreased $1 million, or 1.9%, compared to the prior year.
interest expense interest expense was $67 million and $82 million for 2019 and 2018, respectively. the decrease in interest expense for the year is primarily driven by the impact of cross currency swaps during the year and, to a lesser extent, additional interest expense that was incurred during 2018 related to debt to fund our acquisition of pure technologies ltd., which was repaid during 2019. see note 13, "derivative financial instruments" of our consolidated financial statements for a description of our cross currency swaps. see note 15, "credit facilities and debt" of our consolidated financial statements for a description of our credit facilities and long-term debt and related interest.
income tax expense the income tax provision for 2019 was $15 million at an effective tax rate of 3.7% as compared to $36 million at an effective tax rate of 6.1% in 2018. the 2019 effective tax rate differs from that of 2018 primarily due to the income tax benefit that resulted from changes in tax law in switzerland partially offset by the tax impact of the goodwill impairment charge on income before taxes in 2019.
other comprehensive (loss) income other comprehensive loss was $38 million in 2019 as compared to a loss of $111 million in 2018. foreign currency translation contributed favorable impacts during the year of $113 million driven the strengthening of the british pound, the canadian dollar and the south african rand as compared to the u.s. dollar in 2019 versus the weakening of these currencies in the prior year. additionally, the weakening of the euro, chinese yuan and the australian dollar as compared to the u.s. dollar was less negative in 2019 than the weakening of these currencies in the prior year. these favorable currency translation impacts were partially offset by the movement in our euro net investment hedges during the quarter. the tax impact on the foreign currency translation related to the euro net investment hedges also contributed to the net favorable foreign currency translation movement during the year. partially offsetting these favorable drivers was the increased loss in postretirement benefit plans during the year, primarily actuarial losses.
liquidity and capital resources the following table summarizes our sources and uses of cash:
(in millions)                  2019   2018                           change operating activities      $839                $586                $253
foreign exchange (a)        (3    )            (21    )             18
(a)   2019 impact is primarily due to the strengthening of the chinese yuan, the canadian dollar, the indian rupee, the south african rand, the russian ruble and various other currencies against the u.s. dollar.
sources and uses of liquidity operating activities during 2019, net cash provided by operating activities was $839 million, compared to $586 million in 2018. the $253 million year-over-year increase was primarily driven by improvement in working capital levels due to the improved management of inventory and collection of receivables, increase in cash from earnings and decreased payments for post-retirement obligations during the period, which were partially offset by an increase in cash tax payments.
investing activities cash used in investing activities was $231 million in 2019, compared to $643 million in 2018. this decrease in cash used of $412 million was mainly driven by the $433 million spent on 2018 acquisitions, primarily the acquisition of pure technologies ltd., versus the $18 million spent for acquisition activity during the current year and modestly lower spending on capital expenditures compared to the prior year. this decrease is partially offset by $22 million of proceeds received for a divested business in 2018.
financing activities cash used by financing activities was $177 million in 2019, compared to $40 million in 2018. the increase in cash used during the year was primarily due to higher levels of short-term debt related to acquisition financing in 2018 and an increase in dividends paid of $22 million during the period as compared to the prior year. these drivers are partially offset by the higher net repayment of $120 million of long-term debt in the prior year and a decrease in share repurchase activity of $19 million as compared to the prior year.
funding and liquidity strategy our ability to fund our capital needs depends on our ongoing ability to generate cash from operations and access to bank financing and the capital markets. historically, we have generated operating cash flow sufficient to fund our primary cash needs centered on operating activities, working capital, capital expenditures, strategic investments and dividends. if our cash flows from operations are less than we expect, we may need to incur debt or issue equity. from time to time, we may need to access the long-term and short-term capital markets to obtain financing. our access to, and the availability of, financing on acceptable terms and conditions in the future will be impacted by many factors, including: (i) our credit ratings or absence of a credit rating, (ii) the liquidity of the overall capital
markets, and (iii) the current state of the economy. there can be no assurance that such financing will be available to us on acceptable terms or that such financing will be available at all.
we monitor our global funding requirements and seek to meet our liquidity needs on a cost effective basis. based on our current global cash positions, cash flows from operations and access to the commercial paper markets, we believe there is sufficient liquidity to meet our funding requirements.  in addition, our existing committed credit facilities and access to the public debt markets would provide further liquidity if required.
we anticipate that our present sources of funds, including funds from operations and additional borrowings, will provide us with sufficient liquidity and capital resources to meet our liquidity and capital needs in both the united states and outside of the united states over the next twelve months.
credit facilities & long-term contractual commitments see note 15, "credit facilities and debt" of our consolidated financial statements for a description of our credit facilities and long-term debt.
non-u.s. operations for 2019 and 2018, we generated 51% and 53% of our revenue from non-u.s. operations, respectively. as we continue to grow our operations in the emerging markets and elsewhere outside of the united states, we expect to continue to generate significant revenue from non-u.s. operations and expect that a substantial portion of our cash will be predominately held by our foreign subsidiaries. we expect to manage our worldwide cash requirements considering available funds among the many subsidiaries through which we conduct business and the cost effectiveness with which those funds can be accessed. we may transfer cash from certain international subsidiaries to the u.s. and other international subsidiaries when we believe it is cost effective to do so. we continually review our domestic and foreign cash profile, expected future cash generation and investment opportunities and reassess whether there is a need to repatriate funds held internationally to support our u.s. operations. as of december 31, 2019, we have provided a deferred tax liability of $9 million for net foreign withholding taxes and state income taxes on $505 million of earnings expected to be repatriated to the u.s. parent in the future.
contractual obligations the following table summarizes our contractual commitments as of december 31, 2019:
in addition to the amounts presented in the table above, we have recorded liabilities for net investment hedges of $24 million and employee severance indemnities of $16 million. these amounts have been excluded from the contractual obligations table due to an inability to reasonably estimate the timing or amounts of such payments in individual years. further, benefit payments which reflect expected future service related to the company's pension and other postretirement employee benefit obligations are presented in note 16, "postretirement benefit plans" of the consolidated financial statements and deferred income tax liabilities and uncertain tax positions are presented in note 7, "income taxes" of the consolidated financial statements, and as such, these obligations are not included in the above table. finally, estimated environmental payments and workers' compensation and general liability reserves are excluded from the table above. we estimate, based on historical experience, that we will spend approximately $2 million to $3 million per year on environmental investigation and remediation and approximately $5 million to $6 million per year on workers' compensation and general liability. at december 31, 2019, we had estimated and accrued $3 million and $20 million related to environmental matters, and workers' compensation and general liability, respectively.
(1)   refer to note 15, "credit facilities and debt," of the consolidated financial statements for discussion of the use and availability of debt and revolving credit agreements. amounts represent principal payments of short-term and long-term debt including current maturities and exclude unamortized discounts.
(2)   amounts represent estimates of future interest payments on short-term and long-term debt outstanding as of december 31, 2019.
(3)   refer to note 11, "leases" of the consolidated financial statements for further lease discussion.
(4)   represents unconditional purchase agreements that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms to purchase goods or services, including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed, minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. purchase agreements that are able to cancel without penalty have been excluded.
off-balance sheet arrangements as of december 31, 2019, we have issued guarantees for the debt and other obligations of consolidated subsidiaries in the normal course of business. we have determined that none of these arrangements has a material current effect or is reasonably likely to have a material future effect on our consolidated financial statements, financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources.
we obtain certain stand-by letters of credit, bank guarantees and surety bonds from third-party financial institutions in the ordinary course of business when required under contracts or to satisfy insurance related requirements. as of december 31, 2019, the amount of surety bonds, bank guarantees, stand-by letters of credit, and insurance letters of credit was $340 million.
critical accounting estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, and the disclosure of contingent liabilities. management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.
significant accounting policies used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements are discussed in note 1, "summary of significant accounting policies," of the consolidated financial statements. accounting estimates and assumptions discussed in this section are those that we consider most critical to an understanding of our financial statements because they are inherently uncertain, involve significant judgments, include areas where different estimates reasonably could have been used, and changes in the estimate that are reasonably possible could materially impact the financial statements. management believes that the accounting estimates employed and the resulting balances are reasonable; however, actual results in these areas could differ from management's estimates under different assumptions or conditions.
revenue recognition. xylem adopted the new guidance on recognizing revenue from contracts with customers as of january 1, 2018. in accordance with this new guidance xylem recognizes revenue in a manner that depicts the transfer of promised goods and services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which it expects to be entitled to for providing those goods and services. for each arrangement with a customer, we identify the contract, the associated performance obligations within the contract, determine the transaction price of that contract, allocate the transaction price to each performance obligation and recognize revenue as each performance obligation is satisfied.
the satisfaction of performance obligations in a contract is based upon when the customer obtains control over the asset. depending on the nature of the performance obligation, control transfers either at a particular point in time, or over time which determines the recognition pattern of revenue.
for product sales, other than long-term construction-type contracts, we recognize revenue once control has passed at a point in time, which is generally when products are shipped. in instances where contractual terms include a provision for customer acceptance, revenue is recognized when either (i) we have previously demonstrated that the product meets the specified criteria based on either seller or customer specified objective criteria or (ii) upon formal acceptance received from the customer where the product has not been previously demonstrated to meet customer specified objective criteria. we recognize revenue on product sales to channel partners, including resellers, distributors or value-added solution providers at the point in time when the risks and rewards, possession, and title have transferred to the customer, which usually occurs at the point of delivery.
revenue from performance obligations related to services is recognized over time, as the performance obligations are satisfied. in these instances, the customer consumes the benefit of the service as xylem performs.
certain businesses also enter into long-term construction-type sales contracts where revenue is recognized over time. in these instances, revenue is recognized using a measure of progress that applies an input method based on costs incurred in relation to total estimated costs. we also recognize revenue for certain of these arrangements using the output method and measure progress based on shipments of product where control has transferred to the customer.
for all contracts with customers, we determine the transaction price in the arrangement and allocate the transaction price to each performance obligation identified in the contract. judgment is required to determine the appropriate unit of account, and we separate out the performance obligations if they are capable of being distinct and if they are distinct within the context of the contract. the transaction price is adjusted for our estimate of variable consideration which may include a right of return, discounts, rebates, penalties and retainage. to estimate variable consideration, we apply the expected value or the most likely amount method, based on whichever method most appropriately predicts the amount of consideration we expect to be entitled to. the method applied is typically based on historical experience and known trends. we constrain the amounts of variable consideration that are included in the transaction price, to the extent that it is probable that a significant reversal in the amount of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur or when uncertainties around the variable consideration are resolved.
the adoption of the new revenue guidance did not provide materially different results from historical revenue guidance.
income taxes. deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities, applying enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which we expect the differences will reverse. based on the evaluation of available evidence, we recognize future tax benefits, such as net operating loss carryforwards, to the extent that we believe it is more likely than not we will realize these benefits. we periodically assess the likelihood that we will be able to recover our deferred tax assets and reflect any changes to our estimate of the amount we are more likely than not to realize in the valuation allowance, with a corresponding adjustment to earnings or other comprehensive income, as appropriate.
in assessing the need for a valuation allowance, we look to the future reversal of existing taxable temporary differences, taxable income in carryback years and the feasibility of tax planning strategies and estimated future taxable income. the valuation allowance can be affected by changes to tax laws, changes to statutory tax rates and changes to future taxable income estimates.
due to the tax act, we have recorded net foreign withholding taxes and state income taxes on earnings that are expected to be repatriated to the u.s. parent. we have not recorded any deferred taxes on the amounts that the company currently does not intend to repatriate as the determination of any deferred taxes on this amount is not practicable.
the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions across our global operations. we recognize potential liabilities and record tax liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the u.s. and other tax jurisdictions based on our estimate of whether, and to the extent to which, additional taxes will be due. furthermore, we recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities or upon completion of the litigation process, based on the technical merits of the position. the tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate resolution.
we adjust our liability for uncertain tax positions in light of changing facts and circumstances; however, due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties, the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from our current estimate of the tax liabilities. if our estimate of tax liabilities proves to be less than the ultimate assessment, an additional tax expense would result. if a payment of these amounts ultimately proves to be less than the recorded amounts, the reversal of the liabilities would result in tax benefits being recognized in the period when we determine the liabilities are no longer necessary.
business combinations. we record acquisitions using the purchase method of accounting. all of the assets acquired, liabilities assumed, contractual contingencies and contingent consideration is recorded at fair value as of the acquisition date. the excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair values of the net tangible and intangible assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. the application of the purchase method of accounting for business combinations requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions in the determination of the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, in order to properly allocate purchase price consideration between assets that are depreciated and amortized from goodwill. these assumptions and estimates include a market participant's use of the asset and the appropriate discount rates for a market participant. our estimates are based on historical experience, information obtained from the management of the acquired companies and, when appropriate, includes assistance from independent third-party appraisal firms. significant assumptions and estimates include, but are not limited to, the cash flows that an asset is expected to generate in the future, the cost to build/recreate certain technology, the appropriate weighted-average cost of capital, and the cost savings expected to be derived from acquiring an asset. these estimates are inherently uncertain and unpredictable. in addition, unanticipated events and circumstances may occur which may affect the accuracy or validity of such estimates.
goodwill and intangible assets. we review goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable. we also review the carrying value of our finite-lived intangible assets for potential impairment when impairment indicators arise. we conduct our annual impairment test as of the first day of the fourth quarter. for goodwill, the estimated fair value of each reporting unit is compared to the carrying value of the net assets assigned to that reporting unit. if the estimated fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying value, goodwill is not impaired. if the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value, then an impairment charge is recognized for that excess up to the amount of recorded goodwill. we estimate the fair value of our reporting units using an income approach. we estimate the fair value of our intangible assets with indefinite lives using either the income approach or the market approach. under the income approach, we calculate fair value based on the present value of estimated future cash flows. under the market approach, we calculate fair value based on recent sales and selling prices of similar assets.
determining the fair value of a reporting unit or an indefinite-lived intangible asset is judgmental in nature and involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions, particularly related to future operating results and cash flows. these estimates and assumptions include, but are not limited to, revenue growth rates and operating margins used to calculate projected future cash flows, risk-adjusted discount rates, assumed royalty rates, future economic and market conditions and identification of appropriate market comparable data. in addition, the identification of reporting units and the allocation of assets and liabilities to the reporting units when determining the carrying value of each reporting unit also require judgment. goodwill is tested for impairment at either the operating segment identified in note 22, "segment and geographic data," of the consolidated financial statements, or one level below. the fair value of our reporting units and indefinite-lived intangible assets is based on estimates and assumptions that are believed to be reasonable. significant changes to these estimates and assumptions could adversely impact our conclusions. actual future results may differ from those estimates.
in the third quarter of 2019, the company revised its forecasted future cash flows for the aia business. factors that contributed to the revised forecast in the third quarter include lower than expected results as compared to prior forecasts, largely as a result of slower-than-expected conversion of pipeline opportunities to revenue. additionally, we have continued to invest in the aia platform ahead of the adoption curve, which has also impacted the near term profitability of the business. based on these factors we determined that there were indicators that the aia reporting unit's goodwill may be impaired, and accordingly, we performed an interim goodwill impairment test as of july 1, 2019. the results of the impairment test showed that the fair value of the aia reporting unit was lower than the carrying value, resulting in a $148 million goodwill impairment charge. as of december 31, 2019 the remaining goodwill balance in our aia reporting unit after recording the goodwill impairment charge was $171 million.
also, during the third quarter of 2019, due to the factors discussed above, we assessed whether the carrying amounts of the aia reporting unit's long-lived assets may not be recoverable and therefore impaired. our assessment resulted in an impairment charge of $7 million, related to customer relationships, proprietary technology, software and property, plant and equipment. the charge was calculated using an income approach.
if we do not achieve our forecasts, given that the fair value and the carrying value of the aia reporting unit were the same at july 1, 2019, it is possible that the goodwill of the aia reporting unit could be deemed to be impaired in a future period.
during the fourth quarter of 2019, we performed our annual impairment assessment and determined that the estimated fair values of our goodwill reporting units were substantially in excess of each of their carrying values. however, future goodwill impairment tests could result in a charge to earnings. we will continue to evaluate goodwill on an annual basis as of the beginning of our fourth quarter and whenever events and changes in circumstances require us to do so. we determined that no impairment of the indefinite-lived intangibles existed as of the measurement date in 2019. however, future indefinite-lived intangible impairment tests could result in a charge to earnings. we will continue to evaluate indefinite-lived intangibles on an annual basis as of the beginning of our fourth quarter and whenever events and changes in circumstances indicate there may be a potential impairment.
postretirement plans. company employees around the world participate in numerous defined benefit plans. the determination of projected benefit obligations and the recognition of expenses related to these plans are dependent on various assumptions. these major assumptions primarily relate to discount rates, expected long-term rates of return on plan assets, rate of future compensation increases, mortality, health care inflation and years of service (some of which are disclosed in note 16, "postretirement benefit plans," of the consolidated financial statements) and other factors. actual results that differ from our assumptions are accumulated and amortized on a straight-line basis only to the extent they exceed 10% of the higher of the market-related value or projected benefit obligation, over the average remaining service period of active plan participants, or for plans with all or substantially all inactive participants, over the average remaining life expectancy.
significant assumptions management develops each assumption using relevant company experience, in conjunction with market-related data for each individual country in which such plans exist. all assumptions are reviewed annually with third-party consultants and adjusted as necessary. the table included below provides the weighted average assumptions used to estimate our defined benefit pension obligations and costs as of and for the years ended 2019 and 2018.
u.s.          int'l           u.s.          int'l benefit obligation assumptions discount rate                              3.25   %       1.80    %      4.50   %       2.60    %

nm   not meaningful. the pension benefits for future service for all the u.s. pension plans are based on years of service and not impacted by future compensation increases.
we determine the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets by evaluating both historical returns and estimates of future returns. specifically, the company analyzes the estimated future returns based on independent estimates of asset class returns and evaluates historical broad market returns over long-term timeframes based on the strategic asset allocation, which is detailed in note 16, "postretirement benefit plans," of the consolidated financial statements.
based on the approach described above, the chart below shows weighted average actual returns versus the weighted average expected long-term rates of return for our pension plans that were utilized in the calculation of the net periodic pension cost for each respective year.
expected long-term rate of return on plan assets    7.09   %         7.34   %
actual rate of return on plan assets               12.59   %        (3.85   )%
for the recognition of net periodic pension cost, the calculation of the expected return on plan assets is generally derived by applying the expected long-term rate of return to the market-related value of plan assets. the market-related value of plan assets is based on average asset values at the measurement date over the last five years. the use of fair value, rather than a calculated value, could materially affect net periodic pension cost. the weighted average expected long-term rate of return for all of our plan assets to be used in determining net periodic benefit costs for 2020 is estimated at 3.46%. we estimate that every 25 basis point change in the expected return on plan assets impacts the expense by $1 million.
the discount rate reflects our expectation of the present value of expected future cash payments for benefits at the measurement date. a decrease in the discount rate increases the present value of benefit obligations and increases pension expense. we base the discount rate assumption on current investment yields of high-quality fixed income investments during the retirement benefits maturity period. the pension discount rate was determined by considering an interest rate yield curve comprising aaa/aa bonds, with maturities between zero and 30 years, developed by the plan's actuaries. annual benefit payments are then discounted to present value using this yield curve to develop a single-point discount rate matching the plan's characteristics. our weighted average discount rate for all pension plans effective january 1, 2020, is 1.97%. we estimate that every 25 basis point change in the discount rate impacts the expense by $1 million.
the rate of future compensation increase assumption reflects our long-term actual experience and future and near-term outlook. effective january 1, 2020, our expected rate of future compensation is 3.04% for all pension plans. the estimated impact of a 25 basis point change in the expected rate of future compensation is less than $1 million.
the assumed rate of future increases in the per capita cost of health care (the health care trend rate) is 6.53% for 2020, decreasing ratably to 4.50% in 2028. an increase or decrease in the health care trend rates by one percent per year would impact the aggregate annual service and interest components by less than $1 million, and impact the benefit obligation by approximately $3 million.
we currently anticipate making contributions to our pension and postretirement benefit plans in the range of $15 million to $25 million during 2020, of which $5 million is expected to be made in the first quarter.
funded status funded status is derived by subtracting the respective year-end values of the projected benefit obligations from the fair value of plan assets. we estimate that every 25 basis point change in the discount rate impacts the funded status by approximately $33 million.
fair value of plan assets the plan assets of our pension plans comprise a broad range of investments, including domestic and foreign equity securities, interests in private equity and hedge funds, fixed income investments, insurance contracts, and cash and cash equivalents.
a portion of our pension benefit plan assets portfolio comprises investments in private equity and hedge funds. the private equity and hedge fund investments are generally measured at net asset value. however, in certain instances, the values reported by the asset managers were not current at the measurement date. accordingly, we made estimate adjustments to the last reported value where necessary to measure the assets at fair value at the measurement date. these adjustments consider information received from the asset managers, as well as general market information. the adjustment recorded at december 31, 2019 and 2018 for these assets represented less than one percent of total plan assets in each respective year. asset values for other positions were generally measured using market observable prices. we estimate that a 5% change in asset values will impact funded status by approximately $28 million.

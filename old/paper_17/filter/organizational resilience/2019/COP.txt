total production of 1,348 mboed increased 5 percent in 2019 compared with 2018.
the increase in total average production primarily resulted from new wells online in the lower 48; an increased interest in the western north slope (wns) and greater kuparuk area (gka) of alaska following acquisitions closed in
2018; and higher production in norway due to drilling activity and the startup of aasta hansteen in december
the increase in production was partly offset by normal field decline and disposition impacts, primarily from the u.k. asset sale in 2019 and non-core asset sales in the lower 48 during 2018.
2019 compared with 1,242 mboed in 2018, an increase of
underlying production, which excludes libya and the net volume impact from closed dispositions and acquisitions of 51 mboed in 2019 and 47 mboed in 2018, is used to measure our ability to grow production organically.

it includes information on expensed and capitalized environmental costs for 2019 and those expected for 2020 and 2021.
information contained on our internet website is not part of this report on form 10-k.
our annual reports on form 10-k, quarterly reports on form 10-q, current reports on form 8-k and any amendments to these reports filed or furnished pursuant to section 13(a) or 15(d) of the securities exchange act of 1934 are available on our website, free of charge, as soon as reasonably practicable after such reports are filed with, or furnished to, the sec.
item 1a. risk factors you should carefully consider the following risk factors in addition to the other information included in this annual report on form 10-k.
these risk factors are not the only risks we face.
our business could also be affected by additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently consider to be immaterial.
if any of these risks were to occur, our business, operating results and financial condition, as well as the value of an investment in our common stock could be adversely affected.
our operating results, our future rate of growth and the carrying value of our assets are exposed to the effects of changing commodity prices.
brent crude oil prices averaged $64 per barrel in 2019, ranging from a low of $53 per barrel in january to a high of almost
given volatility in commodity price drivers and the worldwide political and economic environment generally, as well as increased uncertainty generated by recent (and potential future) armed hostilities in various oil-producing regions around the globe, price trends may continue to be volatile.
our revenues, operating results and future rate of growth are highly dependent on the prices we receive for our crude oil, bitumen, natural gas, ngls and lng.
the factors influencing these prices are beyond our control.
lower crude oil, bitumen, natural gas, ngl and lng prices may have a material adverse effect on our revenues, operating income, cash flows and liquidity, and may also affect the amount of dividends we elect to declare and pay on our common stock and the amount of shares we elect to acquire as part of the share repurchase program and the timing of such acquisitions.
lower prices may also limit the amount of reserves we can produce economically, adversely affecting our proved reserves, reserve replacement ratio and accelerating the reduction in our existing reserve levels as we continue production from upstream fields.
significant reductions in crude oil, bitumen, natural gas, ngls and lng prices could also require us to reduce our capital expenditures, impair the carrying value of our assets or discontinue the classification of certain assets as proved reserves.
in the past three years, we recognized several impairments, which are described in note 9-impairments and the "aplng" section of note 6-investments, loans and long-term receivables, in the notes to consolidated financial statements.
if commodity prices remain low relative to their historic levels, and as we continue to optimize our investments and exercise capital flexibility, it is reasonably likely we will incur future impairments to long-lived assets used in operations, investments in nonconsolidated entities accounted for under the equity method and unproved properties.
although it is not reasonably practicable to quantify the impact of any future impairments at this time, our results of operations could be adversely affected as a result.
dividends are authorized and determined by our board of directors in its sole discretion and depend upon a number of factors, including:
our results of operations and anticipated future results of operations.
our financial condition, especially in relation to the anticipated future capital needs of our properties.
the level of distributions paid by comparable companies.
our operating expenses.
other factors our board of directors deems relevant.
we expect to continue to pay quarterly dividends to our stockholders; however, our board of directors may reduce our dividend or cease declaring dividends at any time, including if it determines that our net cash provided by operating activities, after deducting capital expenditures and investments, are not sufficient to pay our desired levels of dividends to our stockholders or to pay dividends to our stockholders at all.
additionally, as of december 31, 2019, $5.4 billion of repurchase authority remained of the $15 billion share repurchase program our board of directors had authorized.
in february, 2020, our board of directors approved an increase to our repurchase authorization from $15 billion to $25 billion, to support our plan for future share repurchases.
our share repurchase program does not obligate us to acquire a specific number of shares during any period, and our decision to commence, discontinue or resume repurchases in any period will depend on the same factors that our board of directors may consider when declaring dividends, among others.
any downward revision in the amount of dividends we pay to stockholders or the number of shares we purchase under our share repurchase program could have an adverse effect on the market price of our common stock.
we may need additional capital in the future, and it may not be available on acceptable terms.
we have historically relied primarily upon cash generated by our operations to fund our operations and strategy; however, we have also relied from time to time on access to the debt and equity capital markets for funding.
there can be no assurance that additional debt or equity financing will be available in the future on acceptable terms, or at all.
our ability to obtain additional financing, or refinance our existing indebtedness when it matures or in accordance with our plans, will be subject to a number of factors, including market conditions, our operating performance, investor sentiment and our ability to incur additional debt in compliance with agreements governing our then-outstanding debt.
if we are unable to generate sufficient funds from operations or raise additional capital for any reason, our business could be adversely affected.
in addition, we are regularly evaluated by the major rating agencies based on a number of factors, including our financial strength and conditions affecting the oil and gas industry generally.
any downgrade in our credit rating or announcement that our credit rating is under review for possible downgrade could increase the cost associated with any additional indebtedness we incur.
our business may be adversely affected by deterioration in the credit quality of, or defaults under our contracts with, third parties with whom we do business.
the operation of our business requires us to engage in transactions with numerous counterparties operating in a variety of industries, including other companies operating in the oil and gas industry.
these counterparties may default on their obligations to us as a result of operational failures or a lack of liquidity, or for other reasons, including bankruptcy.
market speculation about the credit quality of these counterparties, or their ability to continue performing on their existing obligations, may also exacerbate any operational difficulties or liquidity issues they are experiencing, particularly as it relates to other companies in the oil and gas industry as a result of the volatility in commodity prices.
any default by any of our counterparties may result in our inability to perform our obligations under agreements we have made with third parties or may otherwise adversely affect our business or results of operations.
in addition, our rights against any of our counterparties as a result of a default may not be adequate to compensate us for the resulting harm caused or may not be enforceable at all in some circumstances.
we may also be forced to incur additional costs as we attempt to enforce any rights we have against a defaulting counterparty, which could further adversely impact our results of operations.
(pdvsa) providing for the payment of approximately
$2 billion over a five-year period in connection with an arbitration award issued by the international chamber of commerce (icc) tribunal in favor of conocophillips on a contractual dispute arising from venezuela's expropriation of our interests in the petrozuata and hamaca heavy oil ventures and other pre-expropriation fiscal measures.
we collected approximately $0.8 billion of the
pdvsa has defaulted on its remaining payment obligations under this agreement, we are therefore now forced to incur additional costs as we seek to recover any unpaid amounts under the agreement.
unless we successfully add to our existing proved reserves, our future crude oil, bitumen, natural gas and ngl production will decline, resulting in an adverse impact to our business.
the rate of production from upstream fields generally declines as reserves are depleted.
if we do not conduct successful exploration and development activities, or, through engineering studies, optimize production performance or identify additional or secondary recovery reserves, our proved reserves will decline materially as we produce crude oil, bitumen, natural gas and ngls, and our business will experience reduced cash flows and results of operations.
any cash conservation efforts we may undertake as a result of commodity price declines may further limit our ability to replace depleted reserves.
the exploration and production of oil and gas is a highly competitive industry.
the exploration and production of crude oil, bitumen, natural gas and ngls is a highly competitive business.
we compete with private, public and state-owned companies in all facets of the exploration and production business, including to locate and obtain new sources of supply and to produce oil, bitumen, natural gas and ngls in an efficient, cost-effective manner.
some of our competitors are larger and have greater resources than we do or may be willing to incur a higher level of risk than we are willing to incur to obtain potential sources of supply.
if we are not successful in our competition for new reserves, our financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected.
any material change in the factors and assumptions underlying our estimates of crude oil, bitumen, natural gas and ngl reserves could impair the quantity and value of those reserves.
our proved reserve information included in this annual report represents management's best estimates based on assumptions, as of a specified date, of the volumes to be recovered from underground accumulations of crude oil, bitumen, natural gas and ngls.
such volumes cannot be directly measured and the estimates and underlying assumptions used by management are subject to substantial risk and uncertainty.
any material changes in the factors and assumptions underlying our estimates of these items could result in a material negative impact to the volume of reserves reported or could cause us to incur impairment expenses on property associated with the production of those reserves.
future reserve revisions could also result from changes in, among other things, governmental regulation.
we expect to continue to incur substantial capital expenditures and operating costs as a result of our compliance with existing and future environmental laws and regulations.
our business is subject to numerous laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment, which are expected to continue to have an increasing impact on our operations in the u.s. and in other countries in which we operate.
for a description of the most significant of these environmental laws and regulations, see the "contingencies-environmental" section of management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations.
these laws and regulations continue to increase in both number and complexity and affect our operations with respect to, among other things:
permits required in connection with exploration, drilling, production and other activities.the discharge of pollutants into the environment.
the handling, use, storage, transportation, disposal and cleanup of hazardous materials and hazardous and nonhazardous wastes.
the dismantlement, abandonment and restoration of our properties and facilities at the end of their useful lives.
exploration and production activities in certain areas, such as offshore environments, arctic fields, oil sands reservoirs and unconventional plays.
we have incurred and will continue to incur substantial capital, operating and maintenance, and remediation expenditures as a result of these laws and regulations.
any failure by us to comply with existing or future laws, regulations and other requirements could result in administrative or civil penalties, criminal fines, other enforcement actions or third-party litigation against us.
to the extent these expenditures, as with all costs, are not ultimately reflected in the prices of our products and services, our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows in future periods could be materially adversely affected.
existing and future laws, regulations and initiatives relating to global climate change, such as limitations on ghg emissions, may impact or limit our business plans, result in significant expenditures, promote alternative uses of energy or reduce demand for our products.
continuing political and social attention to the issue of global climate change has resulted in both existing and pending international agreements and national, regional or local legislation and regulatory measures to limit ghg emissions, such as cap and trade regimes, carbon taxes, restrictive permitting, increased fuel efficiency standards and incentives or mandates for renewable energy.
for example, in december 2015, the u.s. joined the international community at the 21st conference of the parties of the united nations framework convention on climate change in paris that prepared an agreement requiring member countries to review and represent a progression in their intended ghg emission reduction goals every five years beginning in 2020.
while the u.s. announced its intention to withdraw from the paris agreement, there is no guarantee that the commitments made by the u.s. will not be implemented, in whole or in part, by u.s. state and local governments or by major corporations headquartered in the u.s.
the implementation of current agreements and regulatory measures, as well as any future agreements or measures addressing climate change and ghg emissions, may adversely impact the demand for our products, impose taxes on our products or operations or require us to purchase emission credits or reduce emission of ghgs from our operations.
as a result, we may experience declines in commodity prices or incur substantial capital expenditures and compliance, operating, maintenance and remediation costs, any of which may have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations.
additionally, increasing attention to global climate change has resulted in pressure upon shareholders, financial institutions and/or financial markets to modify their relationships with oil and gas companies and to limit investments and/or funding to such companies, which could increase our costs or otherwise adversely affect our business and results of operations.
furthermore, increasing attention to global climate change has resulted in an increased likelihood of governmental investigations and private litigation, which could increase our costs or otherwise adversely affect our business.
in 2017 and 2018, cities, counties, and a state government in california, new york, washington, rhode island and maryland, as well as the pacific coast federation of fishermen's association, inc., filed lawsuits against oil and gas companies, including conocophillips, seeking compensatory damages and equitable relief to abate alleged climate change impacts.
the ultimate outcome and impact to us cannot be predicted with certainty, and we could incur substantial legal costs associated with defending these and similar lawsuits in the future.
in addition, although we design and operate our business operations to accommodate expected climatic conditions, to the extent there are significant changes in the earth's climate, such as more severe or frequent weather conditions in the markets where we operate or the areas where our assets reside, we could incur increased expenses, our operations could be adversely impacted, and demand for our products could fall.
for more information on legislation or precursors for possible regulation relating to global climate change that affect or could affect our operations and a description of the company's response, see the
climate change" section of management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations.
domestic and worldwide political and economic developments could damage our operations and materially reduce our profitability and cash flows.
actions of the u.s., state, local and foreign governments, through sanctions, tax and other legislation, executive order and commercial restrictions, could reduce our operating profitability both in the u.s. and abroad.
special taxes or tax assessments; and payment transparency regulations that could require us to disclose competitively sensitive information or might cause us to violate non-disclosure laws of other countries.
one area subject to significant political and regulatory activity is the use of hydraulic fracturing, an essential completion technique that facilitates production of oil and natural gas otherwise trapped in lower permeability rock formations.
a range of local, state, federal and national laws and regulations currently govern or, in some hydraulic fracturing operations, prohibit hydraulic fracturing in some jurisdictions.
although hydraulic fracturing has been conducted for many decades, a number of new laws, regulations and permitting requirements are under consideration by the u.s. epa and others which could result in increased costs, operating restrictions, operational delays or limit the ability to develop oil and natural gas resources.
in addition, certain interest groups have also proposed ballot initiatives and constitutional amendments designed to restrict oil and natural-gas development generally and hydraulic fracturing in particular.
for example, in 2018, colorado voters rejected proposition 112, a colorado ballot initiative that would have drastically limited the use of hydraulic fracturing in colorado.
in the event that ballot initiatives, local or state restrictions or prohibitions are adopted and result in more stringent limitations on the production and development of oil and natural gas in areas where we conduct operations, we may incur significant costs to comply with such requirements or may experience delays or curtailment in the permitting or pursuit of exploration, development or production activities.
such compliance costs and delays, curtailments, limitations or prohibitions could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.
the u.s. government can also prevent or restrict us from doing business in foreign countries.
these restrictions and those of foreign governments have in the past limited our ability to operate in, or gain access to, opportunities in various countries.
actions by host governments, such as the expropriation of our oil assets by the venezuelan government, have affected operations significantly in the past and may continue to do so in the future.
changes in domestic and international regulations may affect our ability to collect payments such as those pertaining to the settlement with pdvsa or the icsid award against the government of venezuela;
or to obtain or maintain permits, including those necessary for drilling and development of wells in various locations.
local political and economic factors in international markets could have a material adverse effect on us.
approximately 50 percent of our hydrocarbon production was derived from production outside the u.s. in
2019, and 39 percent of our proved reserves, as of december 31, 2019, were located outside the u.s.
we are subject to risks associated with operations in international markets, including changes in foreign governmental policies relating to crude oil, natural gas, bitumen, ngls or lng pricing and taxation, other political, economic or diplomatic developments (including the effect of international trade discussion and disputes), changing political conditions and international monetary and currency rate fluctuations.
in addition, some countries where we operate lack a fully independent judiciary system.
this, coupled with changes in foreign law or policy, results in a lack of legal certainty that exposes our operations to increased risks, including increased difficulty in enforcing our agreements in those jurisdictions and increased risks of adverse actions by local government authorities, such as expropriations.
our business may be adversely affected by price controls, government-imposed limitations on production of crude oil, bitumen, natural gas and ngls, or the unavailability of adequate gathering, processing, compression, transportation, and pipeline facilities and equipment for our production of crude oil, bitumen, natural gas and ngls.
from time to time, regulatory agencies have imposed price controls and limitations on production by restricting the rate of flow of crude oil, bitumen, natural gas and ngl wells below actual production capacity.
because legal requirements are frequently changed and subject to interpretation, we cannot predict whether future restrictions on our business may be enacted or become applicable to us.
our ability to sell and deliver the crude oil, bitumen, natural gas, ngls and lng that we produce also depends on the availability, proximity, and capacity of gathering, processing, compression, transportation and pipeline facilities and equipment, as well as any necessary diluents to prepare our crude oil, bitumen, natural gas, ngls and lng for transport.
the facilities, equipment and diluents we rely on may be temporarily unavailable to us due to market conditions, extreme weather events, regulatory reasons, mechanical reasons or other factors or conditions, many of which are beyond our control.
in addition, in certain newer plays, the capacity of necessary facilities, equipment and diluents may not be sufficient to accommodate production from existing and new wells, and construction and permitting delays, permitting costs and regulatory or other constraints could limit or delay the construction, manufacture or other acquisition of new facilities and equipment.
if any facilities, equipment or diluents, or any of the transportation methods and channels that we rely on become unavailable for any period of time, we may incur increased costs to transport our crude oil, bitumen, natural gas, ngls and lng for sale or we may be forced to curtail our production of crude oil, bitumen, natural gas or ngls.
our investments in joint ventures decrease our ability to manage risk.
we conduct many of our operations through joint ventures in which we may share control with our joint venture partners.
there is a risk our joint venture participants may at any time have economic, business or legal interests or goals that are inconsistent with those of the joint venture or us, or our joint venture partners may be unable to meet their economic or other obligations and we may be required to fulfill those obligations alone.
failure by us, or an entity in which we have a joint venture interest, to adequately manage the risks associated with any operations, acquisitions or dispositions could have a material adverse effect on the financial condition or results of operations of our joint ventures and, in turn, our business and operations.
we may not be able to successfully complete any disposition we elect to pursue.
from time to time, we may seek to divest portions of our business or investments that are not important to our ongoing strategic objectives.
any dispositions we undertake may involve numerous risks and uncertainties, any of which could adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition.
in particular, we may not be able to successfully complete any disposition on a timeline or on terms acceptable to us, if at all, whether due to market conditions, regulatory challenges or other concerns.
in addition, the reinvestment of capital from disposition proceeds may not ultimately yield investment returns in line with our internal or external expectations.
any dispositions we pursue may also result in disruption to other parts of our business, including through the diversion of resources and management attention from our ongoing business and other strategic matters, or through the disruption of relationships with our employees and key vendors.
further, in connection with any disposition, we may enter into transition services agreements or undertake indemnity or other obligations that may result in additional expenses for us.
we may also be required under applicable accounting rules to recognize impairments associated with any disposition we pursue, whether or not completed.
as part of our disposition strategy, on may 17, 2017, we completed the sale of our 50 percent nonoperated interest in the fccl partnership, as well as the majority of our western canada gas assets to cenovus energy.
our operations present hazards and risks that require significant and continuous oversight.
the scope and nature of our operations present a variety of significant hazards and risks, including operational hazards and risks such as explosions, fires, crude oil spills, severe weather, geological events, labor disputes, armed hostilities, terrorist attacks, sabotage, civil unrest or cyber attacks.
our operations may also be adversely affected by unavailability, interruptions or accidents involving services or infrastructure required to develop, produce, process or transport our production, such as contract labor, drilling rigs, pipelines, railcars, tankers, barges or other infrastructure.
our operations are subject to the additional hazards of pollution, releases of toxic gas and other environmental hazards and risks.
offshore activities may pose incrementally greater risks because of complex subsurface conditions such as higher reservoir pressures, water depths and metocean conditions.
all such hazards could result in loss of human life, significant property and equipment damage, environmental pollution, impairment of operations, substantial losses to us and damage to our reputation.
further, our business and operations may be disrupted if we do not respond, or are perceived not to respond, in an appropriate manner to any of these hazards and risks or any other major crisis or if we are unable to efficiently restore or replace affected operational components and capacity.
our technologies, systems and networks may be subject to cyber attacks.
our business, like others within the oil and gas industry, has become increasingly dependent on digital technologies, some of which are managed by third-party service providers on whom we rely to help us collect, host or process information.
among other activities, we rely on digital technology to estimate oil and gas reserves, process and record financial and operating data, analyze seismic and drilling information and communicate with employees and third parties.
as a result, we face various cyber security threats such as attempts to gain unauthorized access to, or control of, sensitive information about our operations and our employees, attempts to render our data or systems
(or those of third parties with whom we do business)
corrupted or unusable, threats to the security of our facilities and infrastructure as well as those of third parties with whom we do business and attempted cyber terrorism.
in addition, computers control oil and gas production, processing equipment and distribution systems globally and are necessary to deliver our production to market.
a disruption, failure or a cyber breach of these operating systems, or of the networks and infrastructure on which they rely, many of which are not owned or operated by us, could damage critical production, distribution or storage assets, delay or prevent delivery to markets or make it difficult or impossible to accurately account for production and settle transactions.
although we have experienced occasional breaches of our cyber security, none of these breaches have had a material effect on our business, operations or reputation.
as cyber attacks continue to evolve, we must continually expend additional resources to continue to modify or enhance our protective measures or to investigate and remediate any vulnerabilities detected.
our implementation of various procedures and controls to monitor and mitigate security threats and to increase security for our information, facilities and infrastructure may result in increased costs.
despite our ongoing investments in security resources, talent and business practices, we are unable to assure that any security measures will be effective.
if our systems and infrastructure were to be breached, damaged or disrupted, we could be subject to serious negative consequences, including disruption of our operations, damage to our reputation, a loss of counterparty trust, reimbursement or other costs, increased compliance costs, significant litigation exposure and legal liability or regulatory fines, penalties or intervention.
any of these could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition.
although we have business continuity plans in place, our operations may be adversely affected by significant and widespread disruption to our systems and infrastructure that support our business.
while we continue to evolve and modify our business continuity plans, there can be no assurance that they will be effective in avoiding disruption and business impacts.
further, our insurance may not be adequate to compensate us for all resulting losses, and the cost to obtain adequate coverage may increase for us in the future.
legal proceedings the following is a description of reportable legal proceedings, including those involving governmental authorities under federal, state and local laws regulating the discharge of materials into the environment for this reporting period.
the following proceedings include those matters that arose during the fourth quarter of
2019 form 10-qs that were not resolved prior to the fourth quarter of 2019.
material developments to the previously reported matters have been included in the descriptions below.
while it is not possible to accurately predict the final outcome of these pending proceedings, if any one or more of such proceedings were to be decided adversely to conocophillips, we expect there would be no material effect on our consolidated financial position.
on april 30, 2012, the separation of our downstream business was completed, creating two independent energy companies: conocophillips and phillips
we do not expect any of those matters to result in a net claim against us.
in may 2012, the illinois attorney general's office filed and notified conocophillips of a complaint with respect to operations at the phillips 66 wrb wood river refinery alleging violations of the illinois groundwater standards and a third-party's hazardous waste permit.
the complaint seeks remediation of area groundwater; compliance with the hazardous waste permit; enhanced pipeline and tank integrity measures;
matters previously reported-conocophillips on june 28, 2018, the texas commission on environmental quality issued a proposed agreed order to conocophillips company to resolve alleged violations of the texas health & safety code and/or commission rules occurring in 2015 through 2017 at a formerly owned gas injection plant in howard county, texas.
in november of 2019, the company concluded this matter by entering into an agreed order with the agency and paying an administrative penalty of $120,014.

business environment and executive overview conocophillips is an independent e&p company with operations and activities in 17 countries.
our diverse, low cost of supply portfolio includes resource-rich unconventional plays in north america;
conventional assets in north america, europe, asia and australia; lng developments; oil sands in canada; and an inventory of global conventional and unconventional exploration prospects.

optimism about worldwide economic growth during the first quarter turned to pessimism in the second quarter as trade disputes dampened growth forecasts.
at the end of the second quarter, geopolitical tensions in the middle east, threatening the safe passage of supertankers carrying crude oil through the persian gulf, revived oil prices.
worldwide economic growth concerns returned in the third quarter to depress prices, only to be reversed again by geopolitical tensions in the middle east, as oilfield infrastructure in saudi arabia was attacked, temporarily disrupting approximately five percent of the world's oil supply.
our business strategy anticipates prices will remain volatile and is designed to be resilient in lower price environments, while retaining upside during periods of higher prices.
portfolio diversification and optimization, a strong balance sheet and disciplined capital investment have positioned our company to navigate through volatile energy cycles.
our value proposition principles, namely, to focus on financial returns, maintain a strong balance sheet, deliver compelling returns of capital, and expand cash flow through disciplined capital investments, are being executed in accordance with our priorities for allocating cash flows from the business.
invest capital to sustain production and pay our existing dividend;
grow our existing dividend; maintain debt at a level we believe is sufficient to maintain a strong investment grade credit rating through price cycles; allocate greater than 30 percent of our net cash provided by operating activities to share repurchases and dividends;
and, invest capital in a disciplined fashion to grow our cash from operations.
we believe our commitment to our value proposition, as evidenced by the results discussed below, positions us for success in an environment of price uncertainty and ongoing volatility.
in 2019, we successfully delivered on our priorities.
we achieved production growth of five percent on a total boe basis compared with the prior year, with higher value oil volumes growing eight percent.
cash provided by operating activities of $11.1 billion exceeded capital expenditures and investments of $6.6 billion.
after repurchasing $3.5 billion of our common stock and paying $1.5 billion of dividends to shareholders, we ended the year with cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash totaling $5.4 billion and $3.0 billion of short-term investments.
in october, we announced an increase to our quarterly dividend of 38 percent to $0.42 per share and announced planned 2020 share buybacks of
in february 2020, we announced 2020 operating plan capital of $6.5 billion to $6.7 billion.
the plan includes funding for ongoing development drilling programs, major projects, exploration and appraisal activities, as well as base maintenance.
capital spend is expected to be higher in the first quarter largely from winter construction and exploration and appraisal drilling in alaska.
this guidance does not include capital for acquisitions.
key operating and financial summary significant items during 2019 included the following:

business environment brent crude oil prices averaged $64 per barrel in 2019, ranging from a low of $53 per barrel in january to a high of almost $75 per barrel in april.
the energy industry has periodically experienced this type of volatility due to fluctuating supply-and-demand conditions and such volatility may persist for the foreseeable future.
commodity prices are the most significant factor impacting our profitability and related reinvestment of operating cash flows into our business.
our strategy is to create value through price cycles by delivering on the foundational principles that underpin our value proposition;
focus on financial returns through cash flow expansion, maintain balance sheet strength and deliver peer-leading distributions.
operational and financial factors affecting profitability the focus areas we believe will drive our success through the price cycles include:
maintain a relentless focus on safety and environmental stewardship.
safety and environmental stewardship, including the operating integrity of our assets, remain our highest priorities, and we are committed to protecting the health and safety of everyone who has a role in our operations and the communities in which we operate.
we strive to conduct our business with respect and care for both the local and global environment and systematically manage risk to drive sustainable business growth.
demonstrating our commitment to sustainability and environmental stewardship, on november 2017, we announced our intention to target a 5 to 15 percent reduction in our ghg emission intensity by 2030.
in december 2018, we became a founding member of the climate leadership council (clc), an international policy institute founded in collaboration with business and
environmental interests to develop a carbon dividend plan.
we also belong to and fund americans for carbon dividends, the education and advocacy branch of the clc.
in early 2019, we issued our first stand-alone climate-related risk report and incorporated this into our website during our annual sustainability report update.
our sustainability efforts continued through 2019 with a focus on advancing our action plans for climate change, biodiversity, water and human rights.
we are committed to building a learning organization using human performance principles as we relentlessly pursue improved hse and operational performance.
focus on financial returns.
this is a core principle of our value proposition.
our goal is to achieve strong financial returns by exercising capital discipline, controlling our costs, and continually optimizing our portfolio.
o maintain capital allocation discipline.
we participate in a commodity price-driven and capital-intensive industry, with varying lead times from when an investment decision is made to the time an asset is operational and generates cash flow.
as a result, we must invest significant capital dollars to explore for new oil and gas fields, develop newly discovered fields, maintain existing fields, and construct pipelines and lng facilities.
we allocate capital across a geographically diverse, low cost of supply resource base, which combined with legacy assets results in low production decline.
cost of supply is the wti equivalent price that generates a 10 percent after-tax return on a point-forward and fully burdened basis.
fully burdened includes capital infrastructure, foreign exchange, price related inflation and g&a.
in setting our capital plans, we exercise a rigorous approach that evaluates projects using this cost of supply criteria, which should lead to value maximization and cash flow expansion using an optimized investment pace, not production growth for growth's sake.
additional capital may be allocated toward growth, but discipline will be maintained.
our cash allocation priorities call for the investment of sufficient capital to sustain production and pay the existing dividend.
in february 2020, we announced 2020 operating plan capital of $6.5 billion to $6.7 billion.
the plan includes funding for ongoing development drilling programs, major projects, exploration and appraisal activities, as well as base maintenance.
capital spend is expected to be higher in the first quarter largely from winter construction and exploration and appraisal drilling in alaska.
this guidance does not include capital for acquisitions.
controlling operating and overhead costs, without compromising safety and environmental stewardship, is a high priority.
we monitor these costs using various methodologies that are reported to senior management monthly, on both an absolute-
managing operating and overhead costs is critical to maintaining a competitive position in our industry, particularly in a low commodity price environment.
the ability to control our operating and overhead costs impacts our ability to deliver strong cash from operations.
in 2019, our production and operating expenses were two percent higher than 2018, primarily due to costs associated with higher production volumes, which grew five percent during the same period.
we continue to optimize our asset portfolio to focus on low cost of supply assets that support our strategy.
in 2019, we continued to dispose of or market certain non-core assets, including the u.k., australia-west and our niobrara assets in the lower 48.
we will continue to evaluate our assets to determine whether they compete for capital within our portfolio and will optimize the portfolio as necessary, directing capital towards the most competitive investments.
maintain balance sheet strength.
we believe balance sheet strength is critical in a cyclical business such as ours.
our strong operating performance buffered by a solid balance sheet enables us to deliver on our priorities through the price cycles.
our priorities include execution of our development plans, maintaining a growing dividend, and repurchasing shares on a dollar cost average basis.
in 2019, we paid dividends on our common stock of approximately $1.5 billion and repurchased
$3.5 billion of our common stock.
combined, our dividend and repurchases represented 45 percent of our net cash provided by operating activities.
billion of shares.
additionally, as of december 31, 2019, $5.4 billion of repurchase authority remained of the
$15 billion share repurchase program our board of directors had authorized.
in february 2020, we announced that the board of directors approved an increase to our repurchase authorization from $15
billion to $25 billion, to support our plan for future share repurchases.
whether we undertake these additional repurchases is ultimately subject to numerous considerations, including market conditions and other factors.
see risk factors "our ability to declare and pay dividends and repurchase shares is subject to certain considerations."
in october 2019, we announced that our board of directors approved an increase to our quarterly dividend of 38 percent to $0.42 per share.
o successful exploration, exploitation and development of new and existing fields.
o application of new technologies and processes to improve recovery from existing fields.
o purchases of increased interests in existing fields and bolt-on acquisitions.
proved reserve estimates require economic production based on historical 12-month, first-of-month, average prices and current costs.
reserve replacement represents the net change in proved reserves, net of production, divided by our current year production, as shown in our supplemental reserve table disclosures.
in 2019, our reserve replacement, which included a net decrease of 0.1 billion boe from sales and purchases, was 100 percent.
percent of the total change in reserves. our organic reserve replacement, which excludes the impact of sales and purchases, was 117 percent in 2019.
approximately 50 percent of organic reserve additions were from lower 48 unconventional assets.
the remaining additions were evenly distributed across the other operating segments.
in the five years ended december 31, 2019, our reserve replacement was negative 34 percent, reflecting the impact of asset dispositions and lower prices during that period.
31, 2019, which excludes a decrease of 2.0 billion boe related to sales and purchases, was 40 percent, reflecting development activities as well as lower prices during that period.
historically, our reserve replacement has varied considerably year to year contingent upon the timing of major projects which may have long lead times between capital investment and production.
in the last several years, more of our capital has been allocated to short cycle time, onshore, unconventional plays.
accordingly, we believe our recent success in replacing reserves can be viewed on a trailing three-year basis.
in the three years ended december 31, 2019, our reserve replacement was 23 percent, reflecting the impact of asset dispositions during that period.
our organic reserve replacement during the three years ended december 31, 2019, which excludes a decrease of 1.8 billion boe related to sales and purchases, was 143 percent, reflecting reserve additions from development activities.
access to additional resources may become increasingly difficult as commodity prices can make projects uneconomic or unattractive.
in addition, prohibition of direct investment in some nations, national fiscal terms, political instability, competition from national oil companies, and lack of access to high-potential areas due to environmental or other regulation may negatively impact our ability to increase our reserve base.
apply technical capability.
we leverage our knowledge and technology to create value and safely deliver on our plans.
technical strength is part of our heritage and allows us to economically convert additional resources to reserves, achieve greater operating efficiencies and reduce our environmental impact.
companywide, we continue to evaluate potential solutions to leverage knowledge of technological successes across our operations.
we have embraced the digital transformation and are using digital innovations to work and operate more efficiently.
predictive analytics have been adopted in our operations and planning process.
artificial intelligence, machine learning and deep learning are being used for seismic advancements.
we strive to attract, develop and retain individuals with the knowledge and skills to implement our business strategy and who support our values and ethics.
we offer university internships across multiple disciplines to attract the best early career talent.
we also recruit experienced hires to fill critical skills and maintain a broad range of expertise and experience.
we promote continued learning, development and technical training through structured development programs designed to enhance the technical and functional skills of our employees.
other factors affecting profitability other significant factors that can affect our profitability include:
our earnings and operating cash flows generally correlate with industry price levels for crude oil and natural gas.
industry price levels are subject to factors external to the company and over which we have no control, including but not limited to global economic health, supply disruptions or fears thereof caused by civil unrest or military conflicts, actions taken by opec, environmental laws, tax regulations, governmental policies and weather-related disruptions.
brent crude oil prices averaged $64.30 per barrel in 2019, a decrease of 9 percent compared with
natural gas prices weakened in 2019 versus the prior year due to strong production, while demand growth was dampened by mild weather.
ngl prices weakened year over year due to strong supply growth with only moderate demand growth.
curtailment orders imposed by the alberta government, which limited production from the province starting january 2019, provided strength to the wcs differential to wti at hardisty.
we continue to optimize bitumen price realizations through the utilization of downstream transportation solutions and implementation of alternate blend capability which results in lower diluent costs.
north america's energy supply landscape has been transformed from one of resource scarcity to one of abundance.
in recent years, the use of hydraulic fracturing and horizontal drilling in unconventional formations has led to increased industry actual and forecasted crude oil and natural gas production in the u.s.
and long-term growth opportunities for our company, the increased abundance of crude oil and natural gas due to development of unconventional plays could also have adverse financial implications to us, including: an extended period of low commodity prices; production curtailments;
and delay of plans to develop areas such as unconventional fields.
should one or more of these events occur, our revenues would be reduced, and additional asset impairments might be possible.
impairments.
we participate in a capital-intensive industry.
at times, our pp&e and investments become impaired when, for example, commodity prices decline significantly for long periods of time, our reserve estimates are revised downward, or a decision to dispose of an asset leads to a write-down to its fair value.
we may also invest large amounts of money in exploration which, if exploratory drilling proves unsuccessful, could lead to a material impairment of leasehold values.
as we optimize our assets in the future, it is reasonably possible we may incur future losses upon sale or impairment charges to long-lived assets used in operations, investments in nonconsolidated entities accounted for under the equity method, and unproved properties.
a sustained decline in the current and long-term outlook on gas price could affect the carrying value of certain lower 48 non-core gas assets and it is reasonably possible this could result in a future non-cash impairment.
for additional information on our impairments in 2019, 2018 and 2017, see note 9-impairments, in the notes to consolidated financial statements.
our operations are in countries with different tax rates and fiscal structures.
accordingly, even in a stable commodity price and fiscal/regulatory environment, our overall effective tax rate can vary significantly between periods based on the "mix" of before-tax earnings within our global operations.
fiscal and regulatory environment.
our operations can be affected by changing economic, regulatory and political environments in the various countries in which we operate, including the u.s.
civil unrest or strained relationships with governments may impact our operations or investments.
these changing environments could negatively impact our results of operations, and further changes to
increase government fiscal take could have a negative impact on future operations.
our management carefully considers the fiscal and regulatory environment when evaluating projects or determining the levels and locations of our activity.
mboed to 1,270 mboed, including the impact of a recent third-party pipeline outage on the kebabangan field in malaysia.
operating segments we manage our operations through six operating segments, which are primarily defined by geographic region:
corporate and other represents costs not directly associated with an operating segment, such as most interest expense, premiums incurred on the early retirement of debt, corporate overhead, certain technology activities, as well as licensing revenues.
our key performance indicators, shown in the statistical tables provided at the beginning of the operating segment sections that follow, reflect results from our operations, including commodity prices and production.

consolidated results a summary of the company's net income (loss) attributable to conocophillips by business segment follows:
millions of dollars years ended december 31
a $2.1 billion after-tax gain associated with the completion of the sale of two conocophillips u.k.
an unrealized gain of $649 million after-tax on our cenovus energy (cve) common shares in 2019, as compared to a $436 million after-tax unrealized loss on those shares in 2018.
higher crude oil sales volumes due to growth in the lower 48 unconventionals and from the acquisition of incremental interests in operated assets in alaska during the second and fourth quarters of 2018.
the absence of premiums on early debt retirements totaling $195 million after-tax.
a $164 million income tax benefit related to deepwater incentive tax credits recognized for malaysia block g.
million income tax benefit related to the revaluation of deferred tax assets following finalization of rules relating to the 2017 tax cuts and jobs act.
these increases in net income were partly offset by:
the absence of a $774 million after-tax gain on the clair disposition in the u.k.
million after-tax impairment related to the sale of our lower 48 niobrara interests.
lower equity in earnings of affiliates due to $120 million of impairments to equity method investments in our lower 48 segment and a $118 million reduction in equity earnings at qg3 in our asia pacific and middle east segment due to a deferred tax adjustment.
higher exploration expenses, primarily in our lower 48 segment due to $197 million after-tax of leasehold impairment and dry hole costs associated with our decision to discontinue exploration activities in the central louisiana austin chalk trend.
sales and other operating revenues decreased 11 percent in 2019, mainly due to lower realized crude oil, natural gas and ngl prices, partly offset by higher sales volumes of crude oil in the lower 48 and alaska.
equity in earnings of affiliates decreased $295 million in 2019, primarily due to impairments of equity method investments in our lower 48 segment totaling
million resultant from a deferred tax adjustment at qg3, reported in our asia pacific and middle east segment.

billion before-tax gain associated with the completion of the sale of two conocophillips u.k. subsidiaries to chrysaor e&p limited.
partly offsetting this increase, was the absence of a $715 million before-tax gain on the sale of a conocophillips subsidiary to bp in 2018, which held 16.5 percent of our 24 percent interest in the bp-operated clair field in the u.k.
for additional information related to these dispositions, see note 5-asset acquisitions and dispositions, in the notes to consolidated financial statements.
other income increased $1,185 million in 2019, primarily due to an unrealized gain of $649 million before-tax on our cve common shares in 2019, and the absence of a $437 million before-tax unrealized loss on those shares in 2018.
for discussion of our cve shares, see note

underlying production, which excludes libya and the net volume impact from closed dispositions and acquisitions of 51 mboed in 2019 and 47 mboed in 2018, is used to measure our ability to grow production organically.
our underlying production grew 5 percent to 1,254
(millions of dollars)
the alaska segment primarily explores for, produces, transports and markets crude oil, ngls and natural gas.
in 2019, alaska contributed 25 percent of our worldwide liquids production and less than 1 percent of our natural gas production.
alaska reported earnings of $1,520 million in
2019, compared with earnings of $1,814 million in 2018.
the decrease in earnings was mainly due to lower realized crude oil prices and higher production and operating and dd&a expenses associated with incremental volumes from acquisitions completed during 2018.
additionally, earnings were lower due to the absence of a $98 million tax valuation allowance reduction, the absence of a $79 million after-tax benefit resulting from an accrual reduction due to a transportation cost ruling by the ferc, and $62 million less in enhanced oil recovery credits.
partly offsetting these decreases in earnings, were higher crude oil sales volumes due to the gka and wns acquisitions completed in 2018.
38 mboed of production in 2019, as well as volumes from new wells online.
these production increases were partly offset by normal field decline.

the lower 48 segment consists of operations located in the contiguous u.s. and the gulf of mexico.
2019, the lower 48 contributed 39 percent of our worldwide liquids production and 22 percent of our natural gas production.
lower 48 reported earnings of $436 million in
earnings decreased primarily due to lower realized crude oil, ngl and natural gas prices; higher dd&a due to increased production volumes; a $301 million after-tax impairment of our niobrara assets;
higher exploration expenses, primarily due to a combined $197 million after-tax of leasehold impairment and dry hole costs associated with our decision to discontinue exploration activities in the central louisiana austin chalk; and lower earnings in equity affiliates due to a combined $120 million after-tax of impairments associated with a fair value reduction of our investment in mwcc and the disposition of our interests in the golden pass lng terminal and golden pass pipeline.
partly offsetting the decrease in earnings were increased crude oil and ngl sales volumes in the eagle ford, bakken and permian unconventional.
for additional information related to our impairment of mwcc, see note 3-variable interest entities in the notes to consolidated financial statements.
for more information related to the sale of our interests in golden pass lng terminal and golden pass pipeline, see note 5-asset acquisitions and dispositions in the notes to consolidated financial statements.
the increase was primarily due to new production from unconventional assets in eagle ford, bakken and the permian basin, partly offset by normal field decline.
we have also entered into agreements to amend our contractual obligations for retaining use of the facilities.
as a result of entering into these agreements, we recognized a
before-tax impairment of $60 million in the first quarter of 2019 which is included in the "equity in earnings of affiliates" line on our consolidated income statement.
we completed the sale in the second quarter of 2019.
see note 15-fair value measurement in the notes to consolidated financial statements, for additional information.
in the fourth quarter of 2019, we sold our interests in the magnolia field and platform and recognized an after-
tax gain of $63 million.
in the fourth quarter of 2019, we signed an agreement to sell our interests in the niobrara shale play for $380
million, plus customary adjustments, and overriding royalty interests in certain future wells.
we recorded an after-tax impairment of $301 million in the fourth quarter to reduce the carrying value to fair value.
this transaction is subject to regulatory approval and other conditions precedent and is expected to close in the first quarter of 2020.
in january 2020, we entered into an agreement to sell our interests in certain non-core properties in the lower

*average prices for sales of bitumen produced during 2018 and 2019 excludes additional value realized from the purchase and sale of third-
party volumes for optimization of our pipeline capacity between canada and the u.s. gulf coast.
our canadian operations consist of the surmont oil sands development in alberta and the liquids-rich montney unconventional play in british columbia.
in 2019, canada contributed 7 percent of our worldwide liquids production and less than one percent of our worldwide natural gas production.
canada operations reported earnings of $279 million in 2019 compared with $63 million in 2018.
earnings increased mainly due to higher realized bitumen prices, a $68 million tax benefit primarily comprised of a previously unrecognizable tax basis related to a tax settlement, lower dd&a expense due to lower rates from
reserve additions, lower production and operating expenses, and a $25 million tax benefit due to a four year phased four percent reduction in alberta's corporate income tax rate.
partly offsetting the increase in earnings were lower sales volumes due to a planned turnaround at surmont, lower production due to a mandated production curtailment imposed by the alberta government in january 2019, and the absence of an $80 million tax restructuring benefit.
the production decrease was primarily due to a turnaround at surmont, which had an annualized average impact of 3 mboed, and a mandated production curtailment imposed by the alberta government, which also impacted production by 3

sectors of the north sea, the norwegian sea and libya.
in 2019, our europe and north africa operations contributed 16 percent of our worldwide liquids production and 17 percent of our natural gas production.
earnings for europe and north africa operations of $2,724 million increased $858 million in 2019 compared with 2018.
the increase in earnings was primarily due to a $2.1 billion after-tax gain associated with the completion of the sale of two conocophillips u.k. subsidiaries to chrysaor e&p limited.
earnings also increased due to the cessation of dd&a in the second quarter of 2019 for our disposed u.k. subsidiaries when these assets became held-for-sale.
partly offsetting the increase in earnings were the absence of a $774 million
after-tax gain related to the sale of a conocophillips subsidiary to bp, which held 16.5 percent of our 24
the decrease was mainly due to normal field decline and a 20 mboed disposition impact from the sale of our u.k. assets to chrysaor completed september 30, 2019.
partly offsetting these production decreases were volumes from new wells online in norway, including the aasta hansteen field which achieved first production in december of 2018.
asset disposition update on september 30, 2019, we completed the sale of two conocophillips u.k. subsidiaries to chrysaor e&p limited for proceeds of $2.2 billion after interest and customary adjustments.
together the subsidiaries sold indirectly held our exploration and production assets in the u.k., including $1.8 billion of aro.
reserves associated with the u.k. assets sold were 84 mmboe at the time of disposition.

during 2019, asia pacific and middle east contributed 13 percent of our worldwide liquids production and 60 percent of our natural gas production.
asia pacific and middle east reported earnings of $1,929 million in 2019, compared with
lower lng and crude oil sales volumes; and lower equity in earnings of affiliates, primarily due to a deferred tax adjustment at qg3 that resulted in a $118 million reduction to equity earnings.
partly offsetting this decrease in earnings was a $164 million income tax benefit related to deepwater incentive tax credits from the malaysia block g and a $52 million after-tax gain on disposition of our interest in the greater sunrise fields.
the increase was primarily due to new production from malaysia, including first gas supply from kbb to pflng1 in the second quarter of 2019 and first oil from gumusut phase 2 in the third quarter of 2019;
partly offsetting this production increase was normal field decline.
asset dispositions update in the second quarter of 2019, we recognized an after-tax gain of $52 million upon completion of the sale of our
30 percent interest in the greater sunrise fields to the government of timor-leste for $350 million.
no production or reserve impacts were associated with the sale.
in october 2019, we entered into an agreement to sell the subsidiaries that hold our australia-west assets and operations to santos for $1.39 billion, plus customary adjustments, with an effective date of january 1, 2019.
in addition, we will receive a payment of $75 million upon final investment decision of the barossa development project.
this transaction is expected to be completed in the first quarter of 2020, subject to regulatory approvals and the satisfaction of other specific conditions precedent.
we will retain our 37.5 percent interest in the australia pacific lng project and operatorship of that project's lng facility.

corporate and other millions of dollars
net interest consists of interest and financing expense, net of interest income and capitalized interest.
net interest decreased $76 million in 2019 compared with 2018, primarily due to lower capitalized interest on projects; increased interest income from holding higher cash balances; and lower interest on debt expense resultant from the retirement of $4.7 billion of debt in 2018; partly offset by the absence of an accrual reduction due to a transportation cost ruling by the ferc.
million in 2019 compared with 2018, primarily due to higher costs associated with compensation and benefits, including certain key employee compensation programs and higher facility costs.
technology includes our investment in new technologies or businesses, as well as licensing revenues.
activities are focused on both conventional and tight oil reservoirs, shale gas, heavy oil, oil sands, enhanced oil recovery and lng.
the category "other" includes certain foreign currency transaction gains and losses, environmental costs associated with sites no longer in operation, other costs not directly associated with an operating segment, premiums incurred on the early retirement of debt, unrealized holding gains or losses on equity securities, and pension settlement expense.
earnings in "other" increased by $1,776 million in 2019 compared with 2018, primarily due to an unrealized gain of $649 million after-tax on our cve common shares in
2019, and the absence of a $436
additionally, earnings increased due to the absence of $195 million in premiums on the early retirement of debt, lower pension settlement expense, and a $151 million tax benefit related to the revaluation of deferred tax assets following finalization of rules related to the 2017 tax cuts and jobs act.

*capital includes total debt and total equity.
and long-term liquidity requirements, we look to a variety of funding sources, including cash generated from operating activities, proceeds from asset sales, our commercial paper and credit facility programs and our ability to sell securities using our shelf registration statement.
in 2019, the primary uses of our available cash were $6,636 million to support our ongoing capital expenditures and investments program;
$2,910 million net purchases of investments, and $1,500
we believe current cash balances and cash generated by operations, together with access to external sources of funds as described below in the "significant changes in capital" section, will be sufficient to meet our funding requirements in the near and long term, including our capital spending program, share repurchases, dividend payments and required debt payments.
our commitment to disciplined execution of these funding requirements includes cash investment strategies that position us for success in an environment of short-term price volatility as well as extended downturns in commodity prices.
the primary objectives of these cash investment strategies in priority order are to protect principal, maintain liquidity, and provide yield and total returns.
funds for short-term needs to support our operating plan and provide resiliency to react to short-term price volatility are invested in highly liquid instruments with maturities within the year.
funds we consider available to maintain resiliency in longer term price downturns and to capture opportunities outside a given operating plan may be invested in instruments with maturities greater than one year.
for additional information, see note 1-accounting policies and note
14-derivative and financial instruments.
significant changes in capital operating activities during 2019, cash provided by operating activities was $11,104 million, a 14 percent decrease from 2018.
the decrease was primarily due to lower prices, lower collections related to settlements reached with ecuador and pdvsa, and a pension contribution made in conjunction with the sale of two u.k. subsidiaries, partially offset by higher volumes.
while the stability of our cash flows from operating activities benefits from geographic diversity, our short-
and long-term operating cash flows are highly dependent upon prices for crude oil, bitumen, natural gas, lng and ngls.
prices and margins in our industry have historically been volatile and are driven by market conditions over which we have no control.
absent other mitigating factors, as these prices and margins fluctuate, we would expect a corresponding change in our operating cash flows.
the level of absolute production volumes, as well as product and location mix, impacts our cash flows.
future production is subject to numerous uncertainties, including, among others, the volatile crude oil and natural gas price environment, which may impact investment decisions; the effects of price changes on production sharing and variable-
royalty contracts; acquisition and disposition of fields;
operating efficiencies; timing of startups and major turnarounds;
political instability; weather-related disruptions; and the addition of proved reserves through exploratory success and their timely and cost-effective development.
while we actively manage these factors, production levels can cause variability in cash flows, although generally this variability has not been as significant as that caused by commodity prices.
in 2019, our reserve replacement, which included a net decrease of 0.1 billion boe from sales and purchases, was 100
55 percent of the total change in reserves.
our organic reserve replacement, which excludes the impact of sales and purchases, was 117 percent in 2019.
approximately 51 percent of organic reserve additions are from lower 48, 13 percent from alaska,

percent, reflecting development activities as well as lower prices during that period.
historically our reserve replacement has varied considerably year to year contingent upon the timing of major projects which may have long lead times between capital investment and production.
in the last several years, more of our capital has been allocated to short cycle time, onshore, unconventional plays.
accordingly, we believe our recent success in replacing reserves can be viewed on a trailing three-year basis.
in the three years ended december 31, 2019, our reserve replacement was 23 percent, reflecting the impact of asset dispositions during that period.
31, 2019, which excludes a decrease of 1.8 billion boe related to sales and purchases, was 143 percent, reflecting reserve additions from development activities.
reserve replacement represents the net change in proved reserves, net of production, divided by our current year production, as shown in our supplemental reserve table disclosures. for additional information about our

section, engineering estimates of proved reserves are imprecise; therefore, each year reserves may be revised upward or downward due to the impact of changes in commodity prices or as more technical data becomes available on reservoirs.
we have reported revisions as increases to reserves in the current period, however in prior periods, reported revisions as decreases to reserves. it is not possible to reliably predict how revisions will impact reserve quantities in the future.
we completed the sale of two conocophillips u.k.
we also completed the sale of several assets including our 30 percent interest in the greater sunrise fields for $350 million and received $106 million of contingent payments from cenovus energy.
in the fourth quarter of 2019, we entered into an agreement to sell the subsidiaries that hold our australia-west assets and operations to santos for $1.39 billion, plus customary adjustments.
in addition, we will receive a payment of $75 million upon final investment decision of the barossa development project.
quarter of 2019, we signed an agreement to sell our interests in the niobrara shale play for $380 million, plus customary adjustments, and overriding royalty interests in certain future wells.
both transactions are subject to regulatory approval and other conditions precedent and expected to close in the first quarter of 2020.
investing activities in 2019 also included net purchases of $2.9 billion of investments in short-term and long-
term financial instruments. these investments include time deposits, commercial paper as well as debt securities classified as available for sale.

our revolving credit facility may be used for direct bank borrowings, the issuance of letters of credit totaling up to $500 million, or as support for our commercial paper program.
the revolving credit facility is broadly syndicated among financial institutions and does not contain any material adverse change provisions or any covenants requiring maintenance of specified financial ratios or credit ratings.
the facility agreement contains a cross-default provision relating to the failure to pay principal or interest on other debt obligations of $200 million or more by conocophillips, or any of its consolidated subsidiaries.
credit facility borrowings may bear interest at a margin above rates offered by certain designated banks in the london interbank market or at a margin above the overnight federal funds rate or prime rates offered by certain designated banks in the u.s.
the agreement also contains early termination rights if our current directors or their approved successors cease to be a majority of the board of directors.
the revolving credit facility supports the conocophillips company $6.0 billion commercial paper program, which is primarily a funding source for short-term working capital needs.
we had no direct outstanding borrowings or letters of credit under the revolving credit facility at december 31, 2019 and december
since we had no commercial paper outstanding and had issued no letters of credit, we had access to
$6.0 billion in borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facility at december 31, 2019.
our current long-term debt ratings remained unchanged in 2019 and are as follows:
outlook; moody's investors services - "a3" with a "stable" outlook; and standard & poor's - "a" with a stable outlook.
we do not have any ratings triggers on any of our corporate debt that would cause an automatic default, and thereby impact our access to liquidity, in the event of a downgrade of our credit rating.
if our credit rating were downgraded, it could increase the cost of corporate debt available to us and restrict our access to the commercial paper markets.
if our credit rating were to deteriorate to a level prohibiting us from accessing the commercial paper market, we would still be able to access funds under our revolving credit facility.
certain of our project-related contracts, commercial contracts and derivative instruments contain provisions requiring us to post collateral.
many of these contracts and instruments permit us to post either cash or letters
of credit as collateral.
at december 31, 2019 and 2018, we had direct bank letters of credit of $277 million and $323 million, respectively, which secured performance obligations related to various purchase commitments incident to the ordinary conduct of business.
in the event of credit ratings downgrades, we may be required to post additional letters of credit.
shelf registration we have a universal shelf registration statement on file with the sec under which we, as a well-known seasoned issuer, have the ability to issue and sell an indeterminate amount of various types of debt and equity securities.
off-balance sheet arrangements as part of our normal ongoing business operations and consistent with normal industry practice, we enter into numerous agreements with other parties to pursue business opportunities, which share costs and apportion risks among the parties as governed by the agreements.

capital program
our capital expenditures and investments for the three-year period ended december 31,
the 2019 expenditures supported key exploration and developments, primarily:
development, appraisal and exploration activities in the lower 48, including eagle ford, permian unconventional, and bakken.
appraisal and development activities in alaska related to the western north slope; development activities in the greater kuparuk area and the greater prudhoe area; leasehold acquisition in the greater kuparuk area.
development activities across assets in norway, as well as for assets in the u.k. that recently have been sold.
optimization of oil sands development and appraisal activities in liquids-rich plays in canada.
signature bonus for indonesia corridor block production sharing contract, as well as continued development in china, malaysia, australia, and indonesia.
2020 capital budget in february 2020, we announced 2020 operating plan capital of $6.5 billion to $6.7 billion.
the plan includes funding for ongoing development drilling programs, major projects, exploration and appraisal activities, as well as base maintenance.
capital spend is expected to be higher in the first quarter largely from winter construction and exploration and appraisal drilling in alaska.
this guidance does not include capital for acquisitions.

if a range of amounts can be reasonably estimated and no amount within the range is a better estimate than any other amount, then the minimum of the range is accrued.
based on currently available information, we believe it is remote that future costs related to known contingent liability exposures will exceed current accruals by an amount that would have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial statements.
for information on other contingencies, see
"critical accounting estimates" and note 13-contingencies and commitments, in the notes to consolidated financial statements.
legal and tax matters we are subject to various lawsuits and claims including but not limited to matters involving oil and gas royalty and severance tax payments, gas measurement and valuation methods, contract disputes, environmental damages, climate change, personal injury, and property damage.
our primary exposures for such matters relate to alleged royalty and tax underpayments on certain federal, state and privately owned properties and claims of alleged environmental contamination from historic operations.
our legal organization applies its knowledge, experience and professional judgment to the specific characteristics of our cases, employing a litigation management process to manage and monitor the legal proceedings against us.
our process facilitates the early evaluation and quantification of potential exposures in individual cases.
based on professional judgment and experience in using these litigation management tools and available information about current developments in all our cases, our legal organization regularly assesses the adequacy of current accruals and determines if adjustment of existing accruals, or establishment of new accruals, is required.
see note 19-income taxes, in the notes to consolidated financial statements, for additional information about income tax-related contingencies.
environmental we are subject to the same numerous international, federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations as other companies in our industry.
the most significant of these environmental laws and regulations include, among others, the:
european union regulation for registration, evaluation, authorization and restriction of chemicals
u.s. federal comprehensive environmental response, compensation and liability act
(cercla or superfund), which imposes liability on generators, transporters and arrangers of hazardous substances at sites where hazardous substance releases have occurred or are threatening to occur.
u.s. federal resource conservation and recovery act (rcra), which governs the treatment, storage and disposal of solid waste.
u.s. federal oil pollution act of 1990 (opa90), under which owners and operators of onshore facilities and pipelines, lessees or permittees of an area in which an offshore facility is located, and owners and operators of vessels are liable for removal costs and damages that result from a discharge of oil into navigable waters of the u.s.
u.s. federal emergency planning and community right-to-know act (epcra), which requires facilities to report toxic chemical inventories with local emergency planning committees and response departments.
u.s. federal safe drinking water act, which governs the disposal of wastewater in underground injection wells.
u.s. department of the interior regulations, which relate to offshore oil and gas operations in u.s.
waters and impose liability for the cost of pollution cleanup resulting from operations, as well as potential liability for pollution damages.
these laws and their implementing regulations set limits on emissions and, in the case of discharges to water, establish water quality limits and establish standards and impose obligations for the remediation of releases of hazardous substances and hazardous wastes.
these permits can require an applicant to collect substantial information in connection with the application process, which can be expensive and time consuming.
in addition, there can be delays associated with notice and comment periods and the agency's processing of the application.
many of the delays associated with the permitting process are beyond the control of the applicant.
many states and foreign countries where we operate also have, or are developing, similar environmental laws and regulations governing these same types of activities.
while similar, in some cases these regulations may impose additional, or more stringent, requirements that can add to the cost and difficulty of marketing or transporting products across state and international borders.
the ultimate financial impact arising from environmental laws and regulations is neither clearly known nor easily determinable as new standards, such as air emission standards and water quality standards, continue to evolve.
however, environmental laws and regulations, including those that may arise to address concerns about global climate change, are expected to continue to have an increasing impact on our operations in the u.s. and in other countries in which we operate.
notable areas of potential impacts include air emission compliance and remediation obligations in the u.s. and canada.
an example is the use of hydraulic fracturing, an essential completion technique that facilitates production of oil and natural gas otherwise trapped in lower permeability rock formations.
a range of local, state, federal or national laws and regulations currently govern hydraulic fracturing operations, with hydraulic fracturing currently prohibited in some jurisdictions.
although hydraulic fracturing has been conducted for many decades, a number of new laws, regulations and permitting requirements are under consideration by various state environmental agencies, and others which could result in increased costs, operating restrictions, operational delays and/or limit the ability to develop oil and natural gas resources.
governmental restrictions on hydraulic fracturing could impact the overall profitability or viability of certain of our oil and natural gas investments.
we have adopted operating principles that incorporate established industry standards designed to meet or exceed government requirements.
our practices continually evolve as technology improves and regulations change.
we also are subject to certain laws and regulations relating to environmental remediation obligations associated with current and past operations.
longer-term expenditures are subject to considerable uncertainty and may fluctuate significantly.
we occasionally receive requests for information or notices of potential liability from the epa and state environmental agencies alleging we are a potentially responsible party under cercla or an equivalent state statute.
on occasion, we also have been made a party to cost recovery litigation by those agencies or by private parties.
as of december 31, 2019, there were 15 sites around the u.s. in which we were identified as a potentially responsible party under cercla and comparable state laws.
for most superfund sites, our potential liability will be significantly less than the total site remediation costs because the percentage of waste attributable to us, versus that attributable to all other potentially responsible
although liability of those potentially responsible is generally joint and several for federal sites and frequently so for state sites, other potentially responsible parties at sites where we are a party typically have had the financial strength to meet their obligations, and where they have not, or where potentially responsible parties could not be located, our share of liability has not increased materially.
many of the sites at which we are potentially responsible are still under investigation by the epa or the state agencies concerned.
prior to actual cleanup, those potentially responsible normally assess site conditions, apportion responsibility and determine the appropriate remediation.
in some instances, we may have no liability or attain a settlement of liability.
actual cleanup costs generally occur after the parties obtain epa or equivalent state agency approval.
there are relatively few sites where we are a major participant, and given the timing and amounts of anticipated expenditures, neither the cost of remediation at those sites nor such costs at all cercla sites, in the aggregate, is expected to have a material adverse effect on our competitive or financial condition.
expensed environmental costs were $511 million in 2019 and are expected to be about $545 million per year in 2020 and 2021.
capitalized environmental costs were $194 million in 2019 and are expected to be about
accrued liabilities for remediation activities are not reduced for potential recoveries from insurers or other third parties and are not discounted (except those assumed in a purchase business combination, which we do record on a discounted basis).
many of these liabilities result from cercla, rcra and similar state or international laws that require us to undertake certain investigative and remedial activities at sites where we conduct, or once conducted, operations or at sites where conocophillips-generated waste was disposed.
the accrual also includes a number of sites we identified that may require environmental remediation, but which are not currently the subject of cercla, rcra or other agency enforcement activities.
the laws that require or address environmental remediation may apply retroactively and regardless of fault, the legality of the original activities or the current ownership or control of sites.
in the future, we may incur significant costs under both cercla and rcra.
remediation activities vary substantially in duration and cost from site to site, depending on the mix of unique site characteristics, evolving remediation technologies, diverse regulatory agencies and enforcement policies, and the presence or absence of potentially liable third parties.
therefore, it is difficult to develop reasonable estimates of future site remediation costs.
at december 31, 2019, our balance sheet included total accrued environmental costs of
we expect to incur a substantial amount of these expenditures within the next 30 years.
notwithstanding any of the foregoing, and as with other companies engaged in similar businesses, environmental costs and liabilities are inherent concerns in our operations and products, and there can be no assurance that material costs and liabilities will not be incurred.
however, we currently do not expect any material adverse effect upon our results of operations or financial position as a result of compliance with current environmental laws and regulations.
climate change continuing political and social attention to the issue of global climate change has resulted in a broad range of proposed or promulgated state, national and international laws focusing on ghg reduction.
these proposed or promulgated laws apply or could apply in countries where we have interests or may have interests in the future.
laws in this field continue to evolve, and while it is not possible to accurately estimate either a timetable for implementation or our future compliance costs relating to implementation, such laws, if enacted, could have a material impact on our results of operations and financial condition.
examples of legislation or precursors for possible regulation that do or could affect our operations include:
european emissions trading scheme (ets), the program through which many of the eu member states are implementing the kyoto protocol.

while the u.s. announced its intention to withdraw from the paris agreement, there is no guarantee that the commitments made by the u.s. will not be implemented, in whole or in part, by u.s. state and local governments or by major corporations headquartered in the u.s.
in the u.s., some additional form of regulation may be forthcoming in the future at the federal and state levels with respect to ghg emissions.
such regulation could take any of several forms that may result in the creation of additional costs in the form of taxes, the restriction of output, investments of capital to maintain compliance with laws and regulations, or required acquisition or trading of emission allowances.
we are working to continuously improve operational and energy efficiency through resource and energy conservation throughout our operations.
compliance with changes in laws and regulations that create a ghg tax, emission trading scheme or ghg reduction policies could significantly increase our costs, reduce demand for fossil energy derived products, impact the cost and availability of capital and increase our exposure to litigation.
the ultimate impact on our financial performance, either positive or negative, will depend on a number of factors, including but not limited to:
the timing of the introduction of such legislation or regulation.
the nature of the legislation (such as a cap and trade system or a tax on emissions) or regulation.
the price placed on ghg emissions (either by the market or through a tax).
the price and availability of offsets.
the amount and allocation of allowances.
technological and scientific developments leading to new products or services.
any potential significant physical effects of climate change (such as increased severe weather events, changes in sea levels and changes in temperature).
whether, and the extent to which, increased compliance costs are ultimately reflected in the prices of our products and services.
the company has responded by putting in place a sustainable development risk management standard covering the assessment and registering of significant and high sustainable development risks based on their consequence and likelihood of occurrence.
we have developed a company-wide climate change action plan with the goal of tracking mitigation activities for each climate-related risk included in the corporate sustainable development risk register.
the risks addressed in our climate change action plan fall into four broad categories:
ghg emissions management.
physical climate-related impacts.
scope 1 and scope 2 ghg emissions help us understand climate transition risk.
scope 2 emissions are ghg emissions from the generation of purchased electricity or steam that we consume.
our corporate authorization process requires all qualifying projects to run a ghg pricing sensitivity using a corporate price of $40 per tonne of carbon dioxide equivalent, plus annual inflation, for all scope 1 and scope
projects in jurisdictions with existing ghg pricing regimes must incorporate that existing ghg price and its forecast into their base case economics.
$40 per tonne of carbon dioxide equivalent sensitivity must also be run from 2024 onward.
thus, both existing and emerging regulatory requirements are considered in our decision-making.
the company does not use an estimated market cost of ghg emissions when assessing reserves in jurisdictions without existing ghg regulations.
in december 2018, we became a founding member of the clc, an international policy institute founded in collaboration with business and environmental interests to develop a carbon dividend plan.
we also belong to and fund americans for carbon dividends, the education and advocacy branch of the clc.
in 2017 and 2018, cities, counties, and a state government in california, new york, washington, rhode island and maryland, as well as the pacific coast federation of fishermen's association, inc., have filed lawsuits against oil and gas companies, including conocophillips, seeking compensatory damages and equitable relief to abate alleged climate change impacts.
the lawsuits brought by the cities of san francisco, oakland and new york have been dismissed by the district courts and appeals are pending.
lawsuits filed by other cities and counties in california and washington are currently stayed pending resolution of the appeals brought by the cities of san francisco and oakland to the u.s. court of appeals for the ninth circuit.
lawsuits filed in maryland and rhode island are proceeding in state court while rulings in those matters, on the issue of whether the matters should proceed in state or federal court, are on appeal to the u.s. court of appeals for the fourth circuit and first circuit, respectively.
all parish lawsuits are stayed pending an appeal to the fifth circuit court of appeals on the issue of whether they will proceed in federal or state court.
based on our historical taxable income, our expectations for the future, and available tax-planning strategies, management expects the net deferred tax assets will be realized as offsets to reversing deferred tax liabilities.
critical accounting estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to select appropriate accounting policies and to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses.
see note 1-accounting policies, in the notes to consolidated financial statements, for descriptions of our major accounting policies.
certain of these accounting policies involve judgments and uncertainties to such an extent there is a reasonable likelihood materially different amounts would have been reported under different conditions, or if different assumptions had been used.
these critical accounting estimates are discussed with the audit and finance committee of the board of directors at least annually.
we believe the following discussions of critical accounting estimates, along with the discussion of deferred tax asset valuation allowances in this report, address all important accounting areas where the nature of accounting estimates or assumptions is material due to the levels of subjectivity and judgment necessary to account for highly uncertain matters or the susceptibility of such matters to change.
the acquisition of geological and geophysical seismic information, prior to the discovery of proved reserves, is expensed as incurred, similar to accounting for research and development costs.
however, leasehold acquisition costs and exploratory well costs are capitalized on the balance sheet pending determination of whether proved oil and gas reserves have been recognized.
property acquisition costs for individually significant leaseholds, management periodically assesses for impairment based on exploration and drilling efforts to date.
for relatively small individual leasehold acquisition costs, management exercises judgment and determines a percentage probability that the prospect ultimately will fail to find proved oil and gas reserves and pools that leasehold information with others in the geographic area.
for prospects in areas with limited, or no, previous exploratory drilling, the percentage probability of ultimate failure is normally judged to be quite high.
this judgmental percentage is multiplied by the leasehold acquisition cost, and that product is divided by the contractual period of the leasehold to determine a periodic leasehold impairment charge that is reported in exploration expense.
this judgmental probability percentage is reassessed and adjusted throughout the contractual period of the leasehold based on favorable or unfavorable exploratory activity on the leasehold or on adjacent leaseholds, and leasehold impairment amortization expense is adjusted prospectively.
at year-end 2019, the remaining $3.5 billion of net capitalized unproved property costs consisted primarily of individually significant leaseholds, mineral rights held in perpetuity by title ownership, exploratory wells currently being drilled, suspended exploratory wells, and capitalized interest.
of this amount, approximately
$2.1 billion is concentrated in 10 major development areas, the majority of which are not expected to move to proved properties in 2020, and $0.6 billion is held for sale.
management periodically assesses individually
significant leaseholds for impairment based on the results of exploration and drilling efforts and the outlook for commercialization.
exploratory costs for exploratory wells, drilling costs are temporarily capitalized, or "suspended," on the balance sheet, pending a determination of whether potentially economic oil and gas reserves have been discovered by the drilling effort to justify development.
if exploratory wells encounter potentially economic quantities of oil and gas, the well costs remain capitalized on the balance sheet as long as sufficient progress assessing the reserves and the economic and operating viability of the project is being made.
the accounting notion of "sufficient progress" is a judgmental area, but the accounting rules do prohibit continued capitalization of suspended well costs on the expectation future market conditions will improve or new technologies will be found that would make the development economically profitable.
often, the ability to move into the development phase and record proved reserves is dependent on obtaining permits and government or co-venturer approvals, the timing of which is ultimately beyond our control.
once all required approvals and permits have been obtained, the projects are moved into the development phase, and the oil and gas reserves are designated as proved reserves.
for complex exploratory discoveries, it is not unusual to have exploratory wells remain suspended on the balance sheet for several years while we perform additional appraisal drilling and seismic work on the potential oil and gas field or while we seek government or co-venturer approval of development plans or seek environmental permitting.
once a determination is made the well did not encounter potentially economic oil and gas quantities, the well costs are expensed as a dry hole and reported in exploration expense.
management reviews suspended well balances quarterly, continuously monitors the results of the additional appraisal drilling and seismic work, and expenses the suspended well costs as a dry hole when it determines the potential field does not warrant further investment in the near term.
criteria utilized in making this determination include evaluation of the reservoir characteristics and hydrocarbon properties, expected development costs, ability to apply existing technology to produce the reserves, fiscal terms, regulations or contract negotiations, and our expected return on investment.
for additional information on suspended wells, including an aging analysis, see note 8-suspended wells and other exploration expenses, in the notes to consolidated financial statements.
proved reserves engineering estimates of the quantities of proved reserves are inherently imprecise and represent only approximate amounts because of the judgments involved in developing such information.
reserve estimates are based on geological and engineering assessments of in-place hydrocarbon volumes, the production plan, historical extraction recovery and processing yield factors, installed plant operating capacity and approved operating limits.
the reliability of these estimates at any point in time depends on both the quality and quantity of the technical and economic data and the efficiency of extracting and processing the hydrocarbons.
despite the inherent imprecision in these engineering estimates, accounting rules require disclosure of
"proved" reserve estimates due to the importance of these estimates to better understand the perceived value and future cash flows of a company's operations.
there are several authoritative guidelines regarding the engineering criteria that must be met before estimated reserves can be designated as "proved."
our geosciences and reservoir engineering organization has policies and procedures in place consistent with these authoritative guidelines.
we have trained and experienced internal engineering personnel who estimate our proved reserves held by consolidated companies, as well as our share of equity affiliates.
proved reserve estimates are adjusted annually in the fourth quarter and during the year if significant changes occur, and take into account recent production and subsurface information about each field.
also, as required by current authoritative guidelines, the estimated future date when an asset will be permanently shut down for economic reasons is based on 12-month average prices and current costs.
will end affects the amount of estimated reserves.
therefore, as prices and cost levels change from year to year, the estimate of proved reserves also changes.
our proved reserves include estimated quantities related to pscs, reported under the "economic interest"
method, as well as variable-royalty regimes, and are subject to fluctuations in commodity prices; recoverable operating expenses; and capital costs.
if costs remain stable, reserve quantities attributable to recovery of costs will change inversely to changes in commodity prices.
the estimation of proved developed reserves also is important to the income statement because the proved developed reserve estimate for a field serves as the denominator in the unit-of-production calculation of the dd&a of the capitalized costs for that asset.
at year-end 2019, the net book value of productive pp&e subject to a unit-of-production calculation was approximately $35 billion and the dd&a recorded on these assets in 2019 was approximately $5.8 billion.
the estimated proved developed reserves for our consolidated operations were 3.3 billion boe at the end of 2018 and 3.2
billion boe at the end of 2019.
if the estimates of proved reserves used in the unit-of-production calculations had been lower by 10 percent across all calculations, before-tax dd&a in 2019
impairments long-lived assets used in operations are assessed for impairment whenever changes in facts and circumstances indicate a possible significant deterioration in future cash flows expected to be generated by an asset group and annually in the fourth quarter following updates to corporate planning assumptions.
if there is an indication the carrying amount of an asset may not be recovered, the asset is monitored by management through an established process where changes to significant assumptions such as prices, volumes and future development plans are reviewed.
if, upon review, the sum of the undiscounted before-tax cash flows is less than the carrying value of the asset group, the carrying value is written down to estimated fair value.
individual assets are grouped for impairment purposes based on a judgmental assessment of the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash flows that are largely independent of the cash flows of other groups of assets-generally on a
because there usually is a lack of quoted market prices for long-lived assets, the fair value of impaired assets is typically determined based on the present values of expected future cash flows using discount rates believed to be consistent with those used by principal market participants, or based on a multiple of operating cash flow validated with historical market transactions of similar assets where possible.
the expected future cash flows used for impairment reviews and related fair value calculations are based on judgmental assessments of future production volumes, commodity prices, operating costs and capital decisions, considering all available information at the date of review.
differing assumptions could affect the timing and the amount of an impairment in any period.
see note 9-impairments, in the notes to consolidated financial statements, for additional information.
investments in nonconsolidated entities accounted for under the equity method are reviewed for impairment when there is evidence of a loss in value and annually following updates to corporate planning assumptions.
such evidence of a loss in value might include our inability to recover the carrying amount, the lack of sustained earnings capacity which would justify the current investment amount, or a current fair value less than the investment's carrying amount.
when it is determined such a loss in value is other than temporary, an impairment charge is recognized for the difference between the investment's carrying value and its estimated fair value.
when determining whether a decline in value is other than temporary, management considers factors such as the length of time and extent of the decline, the investee's financial condition and near-term prospects, and our ability and intention to retain our investment for a period that will be sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in the market value of the investment.
since quoted market prices are usually not available, the fair value is typically based on the present value of expected future cash flows using discount rates believed to be consistent with those used by principal market participants, plus market analysis of comparable assets owned by the investee, if appropriate.
differing assumptions could affect the timing and the amount of an impairment of an investment in any period.
see the "aplng" section of note 6-investments, loans and long-term receivables, in the notes to consolidated financial statements, for additional
information.
asset retirement obligations and environmental costs under various contracts, permits and regulations, we have material legal obligations to remove tangible equipment and restore the land or seabed at the end of operations at operational sites.
our largest asset removal obligations involve plugging and abandonment of wells, removal and disposal of offshore oil and gas platforms around the world, as well as oil and gas production facilities and pipelines in alaska.
the fair values of obligations for dismantling and removing these facilities are recorded as a liability and an increase to pp&e at the time of installation of the asset based on estimated discounted costs.
estimating future asset removal costs is difficult.
most of these removal obligations are many years, or decades, in the future and the contracts and regulations often have vague descriptions of what removal practices and criteria must be met when the removal event actually occurs.
asset removal technologies and costs, regulatory and other compliance considerations, expenditure timing, and other inputs into valuation of the obligation, including discount and inflation rates, are also subject to change.
normally, changes in asset removal obligations are reflected in the income statement as increases or decreases to dd&a over the remaining life of the assets.
however, for assets at or nearing the end of their operations, as well as previously sold assets for which we retained the asset removal obligation, an increase in the asset removal obligation can result in an immediate charge to earnings, because any increase in pp&e due to the increased obligation would immediately be subject to impairment, due to the low fair value of these properties.
in addition to asset removal obligations, under the above or similar contracts, permits and regulations, we have certain environmental-related projects.
future environmental remediation costs are difficult to estimate because they are subject to change due to such factors as the uncertain magnitude of cleanup costs, the unknown time and extent of such remedial actions that may be required, and the determination of our liability in proportion to that of other responsible parties.
10-asset retirement obligations and accrued environmental costs, in the notes to consolidated financial statements, for additional information.
projected benefit obligations determination of the projected benefit obligations for our defined benefit pension and postretirement plans are important to the recorded amounts for such obligations on the balance sheet and to the amount of benefit expense in the income statement.
the actuarial determination of projected benefit obligations and company contribution requirements involves judgment about uncertain future events, including estimated retirement dates, salary levels at retirement, mortality rates, lump-sum election rates, rates of return on plan assets, future health care cost-trend rates, and rates of utilization of health care services by retirees.
due to the specialized nature of these calculations, we engage outside actuarial firms to assist in the determination of these projected benefit obligations and company contribution requirements.
governed pension plans, the actuary exercises fiduciary care on behalf of plan participants in the determination of the judgmental assumptions used in determining required company contributions into the plans.
due to differing objectives and requirements between financial accounting rules and the pension plan funding regulations promulgated by governmental agencies, the actuarial methods and assumptions for the two purposes differ in certain important respects.
ultimately, we will be required to fund all vested benefits under pension and postretirement benefit plans not funded by plan assets or investment returns, but the judgmental assumptions used in the actuarial calculations significantly affect periodic financial statements and funding patterns over time.
projected benefit obligations are particularly sensitive to the discount rate assumption.
100 basis-point decrease in the discount rate assumption would increase projected benefit obligations by
benefit expense is sensitive to the discount rate and return on plan assets assumptions.
100 basis-point decrease in the discount rate assumption would increase annual benefit expense by
$100 million, while a 100 basis-point decrease in the return on plan assets assumption would increase annual benefit expense by $60 million.
in determining the discount rate, we use yields on high-quality fixed income investments matched to the estimated benefit cash flows of our plans.
that lump sum retirement benefits taken from pension plans during the year could exceed the total of service and interest components of annual pension expense and trigger accelerated recognition of a portion of unrecognized net actuarial losses and gains.
these benefit payments are based on decisions by plan participants and are therefore difficult to predict.
in the event there is a significant reduction in the expected years of future service of present employees or the elimination of the accrual of defined benefits for some or all of their future services for a significant number of employees, we could recognize a curtailment gain or loss.
see note 18-employee benefit plans, in the notes to consolidated financial statements, for additional information.
contingencies a number of claims and lawsuits are made against the company arising in the ordinary course of business.
management exercises judgment related to accounting and disclosure of these claims which includes losses, damages, and underpayments associated with environmental remediation, tax, contracts, and other legal disputes.
as we learn new facts concerning contingencies, we reassess our position both with respect to amounts recognized and disclosed considering changes to the probability of additional losses and potential exposure.
however, actual losses can and do vary from estimates for a variety of reasons including legal, arbitration, or other third-party decisions; settlement discussions; evaluation of scope of damages;
interpretation of regulatory or contractual terms;
expected timing of future actions; and proportion of liability shared with other responsible parties.
estimated future costs related to contingencies are subject to change as events evolve and as additional information becomes available during the administrative and litigation processes.
for additional information on contingent liabilities, see the "contingencies" section within "capital resources and liquidity" and note 13-contingencies and commitments.

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk financial instrument market risk we and certain of our subsidiaries hold and issue derivative contracts and financial instruments that expose our cash flows or earnings to changes in commodity prices, foreign currency exchange rates or interest rates.
we may use financial and commodity-based derivative contracts to manage the risks produced by changes in the prices of natural gas, crude oil and related products;
fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates; or to capture market opportunities.
our use of derivative instruments is governed by an "authority limitations" document approved by our board of directors that prohibits the use of highly leveraged derivatives or derivative instruments without sufficient liquidity.
the authority limitations document also establishes the value at risk (var)
the executive vice president and chief financial officer, who reports to the chief executive officer, monitors commodity price risk and risks resulting from foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates.
the commercial organization manages our commercial marketing, optimizes our commodity flows and positions, and monitors risks.
commodity price risk our commercial organization uses futures, forwards, swaps and options in various markets to accomplish the following objectives:
meet customer needs.
consistent with our policy to generally remain exposed to market prices, we use swap contracts to convert fixed-price sales contracts, which are often requested by natural gas consumers, to floating market prices.
enable us to use market knowledge to capture opportunities such as moving physical commodities to more profitable locations and storing commodities to capture seasonal or time premiums.
we use a var model to estimate the loss in fair value that could potentially result on a single day from the effect of adverse changes in market conditions on the derivative financial instruments and derivative commodity instruments we hold or issue, including commodity purchases and sales contracts recorded on the balance sheet at december 31, 2019, as derivative instruments.
interest rate risk the following table provides information about our debt instruments that are sensitive to changes in u.s.

foreign currency exchange risk we have foreign currency exchange rate risk resulting from international operations.
we do not comprehensively hedge the exposure to currency exchange rate changes although we may choose to selectively hedge certain foreign currency exchange rate exposures, such as firm commitments for capital projects or local currency tax payments, dividends and cash returns from net investments in foreign affiliates to be remitted within the coming year, and investments in equity securities.
at december 31, 2019 and 2018, we held foreign currency exchange forwards hedging cross-border commercial activity and foreign currency exchange swaps and options for purposes of mitigating our cash-
although these forwards, swaps and options hedge exposures to fluctuations in exchange rates, we elected not to utilize hedge accounting.
as a result, the change in the fair value of these foreign currency exchange derivatives is recorded directly in earnings.
at december 31, 2019, we had outstanding foreign currency exchange forward contracts to sell $1.35 billion cad at $0.748 cad against the u.s. dollar.
based on the assumed volatility in the fair value calculation, the net fair value of these foreign currency contracts at december 31, 2019 and december 31,
2018, was a before-tax loss of $28 million and a before-tax gain of $6
based on an adverse hypothetical 10 percent change in the december 2019 and december 2018 exchange rate, this would result in an additional before-tax loss of $115 million and $17 million, respectively.
the sensitivity analysis is based on changing one assumption while holding all other assumptions constant, which in practice may be unlikely to occur, as changes in some of the assumptions may be correlated.

report of management management prepared, and is responsible for, the consolidated financial statements and the other information appearing in this annual report.
the consolidated financial statements present fairly the company's financial position, results of operations and cash flows in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states.
in preparing its consolidated financial statements, the company includes amounts that are based on estimates and judgments management believes are reasonable under the circumstances.
the company's financial statements have been audited by ernst & young llp, an independent registered public accounting firm appointed by the audit and finance committee of the board of directors and ratified by stockholders.
management has made available to ernst
& young llp all of the company's financial records and related data, as well as the minutes of stockholders'
assessment of internal control over financial reporting management is also responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting.
conocophillips' internal control system was designed to provide reasonable assurance to the company's management and directors regarding the preparation and fair presentation of published financial statements.
all internal control systems, no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations.
therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation.
management assessed the effectiveness of the company's internal control over financial reporting as of december 31, 2019.
in making this assessment, it used the criteria set forth by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission in internal control-integrated framework (2013)
based on our assessment, we believe the company's internal control over financial reporting was effective as of december 31, 2019.
ernst & young llp has issued an audit report on the company's internal control over financial reporting as of december 31, 2019, and their report is included herein.
chairman and chief executive officer executive vice president and chief financial officer february 18, 2020
report of independent registered public accounting firm to the stockholders and the board of directors of conocophillips opinion on the financial statements we have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of conocophillips
(the company) as of december 31, 2019 and 2018, the related consolidated income statement, consolidated statements of comprehensive income, changes in equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended december 31, 2019, and the related notes, condensed consolidating financial information listed in the index at item 8, and financial statement schedule listed in item 15(a) (collectively referred to as the
"consolidated financial statements"). in our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the company at december 31, 2019 and 2018, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended december 31, 2019, in conformity with u.s. generally accepted accounting principles.
we also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board
(united states) (pcaob), the company's internal control over financial reporting as of december 31, 2019, based on criteria established in internal control-integrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission (2013 framework) and our report dated february 18, 2020, expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.
basis for opinion these financial statements are the responsibility of the company's management. our responsibility is to express an opinion on the company's financial statements based on our audits.
we are a public accounting firm registered with the pcaob and are required to be independent with respect to the company in accordance with the u.s. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the securities and exchange commission and the pcaob.
we conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the pcaob. those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. we believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
critical audit matters the critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit and finance committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective or complex judgments. the communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.
accounting for asset retirement obligations for certain offshore properties description of the matter at december 31, 2019, the asset retirement obligation ("aro") balance totaled $6.2
the estimation of obligations related to certain offshore assets requires significant judgment given the magnitude of these removal costs and higher estimation uncertainty related to the removal plan and costs. furthermore, given certain of these assets are nearing the end of their operations, the impact of changes in these aros may result in a
material impact to earnings given the relatively short remaining useful lives of the assets.
auditing the company's aros for the obligations identified above is complex and highly judgmental due to the significant estimation required by management in determining the obligations. in particular, the estimates were sensitive to significant subjective assumptions such as removal cost estimates and end of field life, which are affected by expectations about future market or economic conditions.
how we addressed the matter in our audit we obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of the company's internal controls over its aro estimation process, including management's review of the significant assumptions that have a material effect on the determination of the obligations. we also tested management's controls over the completeness and accuracy of the financial data used in the valuation.
to test the aros for the obligations identified above, our audit procedures included, among others, assessing the significant assumptions and inputs used in the valuation, including removal cost estimates and end of field life assumptions. for example, we evaluated removal cost estimates by comparing to settlements and recent removal activities and costs. we also compared end of field life assumptions to production forecasts.
we involved our internal specialists in testing the underlying removal cost estimates.
depreciation, depletion and amortization of proved oil and gas properties description of the matter at december 31, 2019, the net book value of the company's properties, plants and equipment was $42.3 billion, and depreciation, depletion and amortization (dd&a)
as described in note 1, dd&a of properties, plants and equipment on producing hydrocarbon properties and certain pipeline and lng assets (those which are expected to have a declining utilization pattern) are determined by the unit-of-production method based on proved oil and gas reserves, as estimated by the company's internal reservoir engineers. proved oil and gas reserve estimates are based on geological and engineering assessments of in-place hydrocarbon volumes, the production plan, historical extraction recovery and processing yield factors, installed plant operating capacity and approved operating limits. significant judgment is required by the company's internal reservoir engineers in evaluating geological and engineering data when estimating proved oil and gas reserves. estimating reserves also requires the selection of inputs, including oil and gas price assumptions, future operating and capital costs assumptions and tax rates by jurisdiction, among others. because of the complexity involved in estimating oil and gas reserves, management also used a third-party petroleum engineering firm to perform a review of the processes and controls used by the company's internal reservoir engineers to determine estimates of proved oil and gas reserves.
auditing the company's dd&a calculation is complex because of the use of the work of the internal reservoir engineers and third-party petroleum engineering firm and the evaluation of management's determination of the inputs described above used by the internal reservoir engineers in estimating proved oil and gas reserves.
how we addressed the matter in our audit we obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of the company's internal controls over its process to calculate dd&a, including management's controls over the completeness and accuracy of the financial data provided to the internal reservoir engineers for use in estimating proved oil and gas reserves.
our audit procedures included, among others, evaluating the professional qualifications and objectivity of the company's internal reservoir engineers primarily responsible for overseeing the preparation of the reserve estimates and the third-party petroleum engineering firm used to review the company's processes and controls.
in addition, in assessing whether we can use the work of the internal reservoir engineers, we evaluated the completeness and accuracy of the financial data and inputs described above used by the internal reservoir engineers in estimating proved oil and gas reserves by agreeing them to source documentation and we identified and evaluated corroborative and contrary evidence. for proved undeveloped reserves, we evaluated management's development plan for compliance with the sec rule that undrilled locations are scheduled to be drilled within five years, unless specific circumstances justify a longer time, by assessing consistency of the development projections with the company's drill plan. we also tested the accuracy of the dd&a calculations, including comparing the proved oil and gas reserve amounts used in the calculation to the company's reserve report.
report of independent registered public accounting firm to the stockholders and the board of directors of conocophillips opinion on internal control over financial reporting we have audited conocophillips' internal control over financial reporting as of december 31,
2019, based on criteria established in internal control-integrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission (2013 framework)
maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of december 31, 2019, based on the coso criteria.
we also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board (united states) (pcaob), the consolidated balance sheets of the company as of december
31, 2019 and 2018, the related consolidated income statement, consolidated statements of comprehensive income, changes in equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended december 31, 2019, and the related notes, condensed consolidating financial information listed in the index at item 8, and financial statement schedule listed in item 15(a) and our report dated february 18, 2020, expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.
basis for opinion the company's management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included under the heading
"assessment of internal control over financial reporting" in the accompanying
"report of management." our responsibility is to express an opinion on the company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.
we are a public accounting firm registered with the pcaob and are required to be independent with respect to the company in accordance with the u.s. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the securities and exchange commission and the pcaob.
we conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the pcaob. those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.
our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. we believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
definition and limitations of internal control over financial reporting a company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. a company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

notes to consolidated financial statements conocophillips note 1-accounting policies
-our consolidated financial statements include the accounts of majority-owned, controlled subsidiaries and variable interest entities where we are the primary beneficiary.
operating and financial policies.
for those exceptions, it will be measured at cost minus impairment, plus or minus observable price changes in orderly transactions for an identical or similar investment of the same issuer.
we manage our operations through six operating segments, defined by geographic region: alaska, lower
for additional information, see note 25-segment disclosures and related information.
-adjustments resulting from the process of translating foreign functional currency financial statements into u.s. dollars are included in accumulated other comprehensive loss in common stockholders' equity.
some of our foreign operations use their local currency as the functional currency.
use of estimates
-the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the u.s. requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and the disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities.
revenue recognition
-revenues associated with the sales of crude oil, bitumen, natural gas, lng, ngls and other items are recognized at the point in time when the customer obtains control of the asset.
in evaluating when a customer has control of the asset, we primarily consider whether the transfer of legal title and physical delivery has occurred, whether the customer has significant risks and rewards of ownership, and whether the customer has accepted delivery and a right to payment exists.
these products are typically sold at prevailing market prices.
we allocate variable market-based consideration to deliveries (performance obligations) in the current period as that consideration relates specifically to our efforts to transfer control of current period deliveries to the customer and represents the amount we expect to be entitled to in exchange for the related products.
revenues associated with transactions commonly called buy/sell contracts, in which the purchase and sale of inventory with the same counterparty are entered into "in contemplation" of one another, are combined and reported net (i.e., on the same income statement line).
-we typically incur shipping and handling costs prior to control transferring to the customer and account for these activities as fulfillment costs.
accordingly, we include shipping and handling costs in production and operating expenses for production activities.
transportation costs related to marketing activities are recorded in purchased commodities.
freight costs billed to customers are treated as a component of the transaction price and recorded as a component of revenue when the customer obtains control.
-cash equivalents are highly liquid, short-term investments that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash and have original maturities of 90 days or less from their date of purchase.
-short-term investments include investments in bank time deposits and marketable securities (commercial paper and government obligations) which are carried at cost plus accrued interest and have original maturities of greater than 90 days but within one year or when the remaining maturities are within one year.
we also invest in financial instruments classified as available for sale debt securities which are carried at fair value. those instruments are included in short-term investments when they have remaining maturities within one year as of the balance sheet date.
-long-term investments in debt securities includes financial instruments classified as available for sale debt securities with remaining maturities greater than one year as of the balance sheet date.
they are carried at fair value and presented within the "investments and long-term receivables" line of our consolidated balance sheet.
-we have several valuation methods for our various types of inventories and consistently use the following methods for each type of inventory.
the majority of our commodity-related inventories are recorded at cost using the lifo basis.
we measure these inventories at the lower-of-cost-or-market in the aggregate.
any necessary lower-of-cost-or-market write-downs at year end are recorded as permanent adjustments to the lifo cost basis.
costs include both direct and indirect expenditures incurred in bringing an item or product to its existing condition and location, but not unusual/nonrecurring costs or research and development costs.
-assets and liabilities measured at fair value and required to be categorized within the fair value hierarchy are categorized into one of three different levels depending on the observability of the inputs employed in the measurement.
level 1 inputs are quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
level 2 inputs are observable inputs other than quoted prices included within level 1 for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly through market-corroborated inputs.
level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs for the asset or liability reflecting significant modifications to observable related market data or our assumptions about pricing by market participants.
if the right of offset exists and certain other criteria are met, derivative assets and liabilities with the same counterparty are netted on the balance sheet and the collateral payable or receivable is netted against derivative assets and derivative liabilities, respectively.
recognition and classification of the gain or loss that results from recording and adjusting a derivative to fair value depends on the purpose for issuing or holding the derivative.
oil and gas exploration and development
-oil and gas exploration and development costs are accounted for using the successful efforts method of accounting.
-oil and gas leasehold acquisition costs are capitalized and included in the balance sheet caption pp&e.
leasehold impairment is recognized based on exploratory experience and management's judgment.
upon achievement of all conditions necessary for reserves to be classified as proved, the associated leasehold costs are reclassified to proved properties.
-geological and geophysical costs and the costs of carrying and retaining undeveloped properties are expensed as incurred.
exploratory well costs are capitalized, or
"suspended," on the balance sheet pending further evaluation of whether economically recoverable reserves have been found.
if economically recoverable reserves are not found, exploratory well costs are expensed as dry holes.
if exploratory wells encounter potentially economic quantities of oil and gas, the well costs remain capitalized on the balance sheet as long as sufficient progress assessing the reserves and the economic and operating viability of the project is being made.
for complex exploratory discoveries, it is not unusual to have exploratory wells remain suspended on the balance
sheet for several years while we perform additional appraisal drilling and seismic work on the potential oil and gas field or while we seek government or co-venturer approval of development plans or seek environmental permitting.
once all required approvals and permits have been obtained, the projects are moved into the development phase, and the oil and gas resources are designated as proved reserves.
management reviews suspended well balances quarterly, continuously monitors the results of the additional appraisal drilling and seismic work, and expenses the suspended well costs as dry holes when it judges the potential field does not warrant further investment in the near term.
suspended wells and other exploration expenses, for additional information on suspended wells.
development costs
-costs incurred to drill and equip development wells, including unsuccessful development wells, are capitalized.
-leasehold costs of producing properties are depleted using the unit-
of-production method based on estimated proved oil and gas reserves.
amortization of intangible development costs is based on the unit-of-production method using estimated proved developed oil and gas reserves.
capitalized interest
-interest from external borrowings is capitalized on major projects with an expected construction period of one year or longer.
capitalized interest is added to the cost of the underlying asset and is amortized over the useful lives of the assets in the same manner as the underlying assets.
-depreciation and amortization of pp&e on producing hydrocarbon properties and certain pipeline and lng assets
(those which are expected to have a declining utilization pattern), are determined by the unit-of-production method.
depreciation and amortization of all other pp&e are determined by either the individual-unit-straight-line method or the group-straight-line method
impairment of properties, plants and equipment
-pp&e used in operations are assessed for impairment whenever changes in facts and circumstances indicate a possible significant deterioration in the future cash flows expected to be generated by an asset group and annually in the fourth quarter following updates to corporate planning assumptions.
if there is an indication the carrying amount of an asset may not be recovered, the asset is monitored by management through an established process where changes to significant assumptions such as prices, volumes and future development plans are reviewed.
if, upon review, the sum of the undiscounted before-tax cash flows is less than the carrying value of the asset group, the carrying value is written down to estimated fair value through additional amortization or depreciation provisions and reported as impairments in the periods in which the determination of the impairment is made.
individual assets are grouped for impairment purposes at the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash flows that are largely independent of the cash flows of other groups of assets-
because there usually is a lack of quoted market prices for long-lived assets, the fair value of impaired assets is typically determined based on the present values of expected future cash flows using discount rates believed to be consistent with those used by principal market participants or based on a multiple of operating cash flow validated with historical market transactions of similar assets where possible.
long-lived assets committed by management for disposal within one year are accounted for at the lower of amortized cost or fair value, less cost to sell, with fair value determined using a binding negotiated price, if available, or present value of expected future cash flows as previously described.
the expected future cash flows used for impairment reviews and related fair value calculations are based on estimated future production volumes, prices and costs, considering all available evidence at the date of review.
the impairment review includes cash flows from proved developed and undeveloped reserves, including any development expenditures necessary to achieve that production.
additionally, when probable and possible reserves exist, an appropriate risk-adjusted amount of these reserves may be included in the impairment calculation.
impairment of investments in nonconsolidated entities
-investments in nonconsolidated entities are assessed for impairment whenever changes in the facts and circumstances indicate a loss in value has occurred and annually following updates to corporate planning assumptions.
when such a condition is judgmentally determined to be other than temporary, the carrying value of the investment is written down to fair value.
the fair value of the impaired investment is based on quoted market prices, if available, or upon the present value of expected future cash flows using discount rates believed to be consistent with those used by principal market participants, plus market analysis of comparable assets owned by the investee, if appropriate.
maintenance and repairs
-costs of maintenance and repairs, which are not significant improvements, are expensed when incurred.
-when complete units of depreciable property are sold, the asset cost and related accumulated depreciation are eliminated, with any gain or loss reflected in the "gain on dispositions"
line of our consolidated income statement.
when less than complete units of depreciable property are disposed of or retired which do not significantly alter the dd&a rate, the difference between asset cost and salvage value is charged or credited to accumulated depreciation.
asset retirement obligations and environmental costs
-the fair value of legal obligations to retire and remove long-lived assets are recorded in the period in which the obligation is incurred
when the liability is initially recorded, we capitalize this cost by increasing the carrying amount of the related pp&e.
if, in subsequent periods, our estimate of this liability changes, we will record an adjustment to both the liability and pp&e.
over time the liability is increased for the change in its present value, and the capitalized cost in pp&e is depreciated over the useful life of the related asset.
reductions to estimated liabilities for assets that are no longer producing are recorded as a credit to impairment, if the asset had been previously impaired, or as a credit to dd&a, if the asset had not been previously impaired.
for additional information, see note 10-asset retirement obligations and accrued environmental costs.
environmental expenditures are expensed or capitalized, depending upon their future economic benefit.
expenditures relating to an existing condition caused by past operations, and those having no future economic benefit, are expensed.
liabilities for environmental expenditures are recorded on an undiscounted basis (unless acquired in a purchase business combination, which we record on a discounted basis) when environmental assessments or cleanups are probable and the costs can be reasonably estimated.
recoveries of environmental remediation costs from other parties are recorded as assets when their receipt is probable and estimable.
-the fair value of a guarantee is determined and recorded as a liability at the time the guarantee is given.
the initial liability is subsequently reduced as we are released from exposure under the guarantee.
we amortize the guarantee liability over the relevant time period, if one exists, based on the facts and circumstances surrounding each type of guarantee.
in cases where the guarantee term is indefinite, we reverse the liability when we have information indicating the liability is essentially relieved or amortize it over an appropriate time period as the fair value of our guarantee exposure declines over time.
we amortize the guarantee liability to the related income statement line item based on the nature of the guarantee.
we reverse the fair value liability only when there is no further exposure under the guarantee.
-we recognize share-based compensation expense over the shorter of the service period (i.e., the stated period of time required to earn the award) or the period beginning at the start of the service period and ending when an employee first becomes eligible for retirement.
we have elected to recognize expense on a straight-line basis over the service period for the entire award, whether the award was granted with ratable or cliff vesting.
-deferred income taxes are computed using the liability method and are provided on all temporary differences between the financial reporting basis and the tax basis of our assets and liabilities,
except for deferred taxes on income and temporary differences related to the cumulative translation adjustment considered to be permanently reinvested in certain foreign subsidiaries and foreign corporate joint ventures.
allowable tax credits are applied currently as reductions of the provision for income taxes.
interest related to unrecognized tax benefits is reflected in interest and debt expense, and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits are reflected in production and operating expenses.
taxes collected from customers and remitted to governmental authorities
net income (loss) per share of common stock
-basic net income (loss) per share of common stock is calculated based upon the daily weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the year.
also, this calculation includes fully vested stock and unit awards that have not yet been issued as common stock, along with an adjustment to net income (loss) for dividend equivalents paid on unvested unit awards that are considered participating securities.
diluted net income per share of common stock includes unvested stock, unit or option awards granted under our compensation plans and vested but unexercised stock options, but only to the extent these instruments dilute net income per share, primarily under the treasury-stock method.
diluted net loss per share, which is calculated the same as basic net loss per share, does not assume conversion or exercise of securities that would have an antidilutive effect.
treasury stock is excluded from the daily weighted-average number of common shares outstanding in both calculations.
the earnings per share impact of the participating securities is immaterial.
note 2-changes in accounting principles we adopted the provisions of fasb asu no. 2016-02, "leases," (asc topic 842) and its amendments, beginning january 1, 2019.
asc topic 842 establishes comprehensive accounting and financial reporting requirements for leasing arrangements, supersedes the existing requirements in fasb asc topic 840,
the provisions of asc topic 842 also modify the definition of a lease and outline requirements for recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of leasing arrangements by both lessees and lessors.
842 using the modified retrospective approach and elected to utilize the optional transition method, which permits us to apply the provisions of asc topic 842 to leasing arrangements existing at or entered into after january 1, 2019, and present in our financial statements comparative periods prior to january 1, 2019 under the historical requirements of asc topic 840.
in addition, we elected to adopt the package of optional transition-related practical expedients, which among other things, allows us to carry forward certain historical conclusions reached under asc topic 840 regarding lease identification, classification, and the accounting treatment of initial direct costs.
furthermore, we elected not to record assets and liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet for new or existing lease arrangements with terms of 12
the primary impact of applying asc topic 842 is the initial recognition of $
million of lease liabilities and corresponding right-of-use assets on our consolidated balance sheet as of january 1, 2019, for leases classified as operating leases under asc topic 840, as well as enhanced disclosure of our leasing arrangements.
our accounting treatment for finance leases remains unchanged.
in addition, there is no cumulative effect to retained earnings or other components of equity recognized as of january 1, 2019, and the adoption of asc topic 842 did not impact the presentation of our consolidated income statement or statement of cash flows.
see note 17-non-mineral leases for additional information related to the adoption of asc topic 842.
we adopted the provisions of fasb asu no. 2018-02, "reclassification of certain tax effects from accumulated other comprehensive income,"

note 3-variable interest entities we hold variable interests in vies for which there are existing arrangements that provide those entities with additional forms of subordinated financial support.
however, as we are not considered the primary beneficiary, these entities have not been consolidated in our financial statements.
mwcc is considered a vie, as it has entered into arrangements that provide it with additional forms of subordinated financial support.
we are not the primary beneficiary and do not consolidate mwcc because we share the power to govern the business and operation of the company and to undertake certain obligations that most significantly impact its economic performance with nine other unaffiliated owners of mwcc.
based on inputs related to the fair value of mwcc observed in the second quarter of 2019, we reduced the carrying value of our equity method investment in mwcc to $
million and recorded a before-tax impairment of $
million which is included in the "equity in earnings of affiliates" line on our consolidated income statement. for additional information see note 15-fair value measurement.
at december 31, 2019, the book value of our equity method investment in mwcc was $
million. we have not provided any financial support to mwcc other than amounts previously contractually required. unless we elect otherwise, we have no requirement to provide liquidity or purchase the assets of mwcc.
percent interest in aplng, our joint venture with origin energy and sinopec. we are not the primary beneficiary because we share, with our joint venture partners, the power to direct the key activities of aplng that most significantly impacts its economic performance. therefore, we do not consolidate aplng and account for this entity as an equity method investment.
as of december 31, 2019, we no longer have certain guarantees that provide aplng with additional subordinated financial support. for additional information see note 12-guarantees.

any future additional payments are expected to be allocated in a similar manner.
each exploration license area will periodically be reviewed for any indicators of potential impairment, which, if required, would result in acceleration of basis difference amortization.
as the joint venture produces natural gas from each license, we amortize the basis difference allocated to that license using the unit-of-production method.

asset retirement obligations we record the fair value of a liability for an aro when it is incurred (typically when the asset is installed at the production location).
when the liability is initially recorded, we capitalize the associated asset retirement cost by increasing the carrying amount of the related pp&e.
if, in subsequent periods, our estimate of this liability changes, we will record an adjustment to both the liability and pp&e.
over time, the liability increases for the change in its present value, while the capitalized cost depreciates over the useful life of the related asset.
we have numerous aros we are required to perform under law or contract once an asset is permanently taken out of service.
most of these obligations are not expected to be paid until several years, or decades, in the future and will be funded from general company resources at the time of removal.
our largest individual obligations involve plugging and abandonment of wells and removal and disposal of offshore oil and gas platforms around the world, as well as oil and gas production facilities and pipelines in alaska.

note 12-guarantees at december 31, 2019, we were liable for certain contingent obligations under various contractual arrangements as described below.
we recognize a liability, at inception, for the fair value of our obligation as a guarantor for newly issued or modified guarantees.
unless the carrying amount of the liability is noted below, we have not recognized a liability because the fair value of the obligation is immaterial.
in addition, unless otherwise stated, we are not currently performing with any significance under the guarantee and expect future performance to be either immaterial or have only a remote chance of occurrence.
the following is a description of the guarantees with values calculated utilizing december
2019 exchange rates:
during the third quarter of 2016, we issued a guarantee to facilitate the withdrawal of our pro-rata portion of the funds in a project finance reserve account.
we estimate the remaining term of this guarantee is
our maximum exposure under this guarantee is approximately $
at december 31, 2019, the carrying value of this guarantee is approximately $

our maximum potential liability for future payments, or cost of volume delivery, under these guarantees is estimated to be $
billion in the event of intentional or reckless breach)

future payments are considered unlikely, as the payments, or cost of volume delivery, would only be triggered if aplng does not have enough natural gas to meet these sales commitments and if the co-
we have guaranteed the performance of aplng with regard to certain other contracts executed in connection with the project's continued development.
the guarantees have remaining terms of up to
26 years or the life of the venture
as of december 31, 2019, we were released from certain of these guarantees considered subordinated financial support to aplng.
our remaining maximum potential amount of future payments related to the remaining guarantees is approximately $
other guarantees we have other guarantees with maximum future potential payment amounts totaling approximately
million, which consist primarily of guarantees of the residual value of leased office buildings, guarantees of the residual value of leased corporate aircraft, and a guarantee for our portion of a joint venture's project finance reserve accounts.
these guarantees have remaining terms of up to three years and would become payable if, upon sale, certain asset values are lower than guaranteed amounts, business conditions decline at guaranteed entities, or as a result of nonperformance of contractual terms by guaranteed parties.
in conjunction with the disposition of our two u.k. subsidiaries to chrysaor e&p limited, we will temporarily continue to support various guarantees and letters of credit which were provided for the benefit of entities that are now affiliates of chrysaor e&p limited.
our maximum potential payment exposure under these obligations is approximately $
these agreements include indemnifications for taxes, environmental liabilities, employee claims and litigation.
the terms of these indemnifications vary greatly.
the majority of these indemnifications are related to environmental issues, the term is generally indefinite and the maximum amount of future payments is generally unlimited.
we amortize the indemnification liability over the relevant time period, if one exists, based on the facts and circumstances surrounding each type of indemnity.
in cases where the indemnification term is indefinite, we will reverse the liability when we have information the liability is essentially relieved or amortize the liability over an appropriate time period as the fair value of our indemnification exposure declines.
although it is reasonably possible future payments may exceed amounts recorded, due to the nature of the indemnifications, it is not possible to make a reasonable estimate of the maximum potential amount of future payments.
million of environmental accruals for known contamination that are included in the "asset retirement obligations and accrued environmental costs" line on our consolidated balance sheet.
for additional information about environmental liabilities, see note 13-contingencies and commitments.
note 13-contingencies and commitments a number of lawsuits involving a variety of claims arising in the ordinary course of business have been filed against conocophillips.
we also may be required to remove or mitigate the effects on the environment of the placement, storage, disposal or release of certain chemical, mineral and petroleum substances at various active and inactive sites.
we regularly assess the need for accounting recognition or disclosure of these contingencies.
in the case of all known contingencies (other than those related to income taxes), we accrue a
if a range of amounts can be reasonably estimated and no amount within the range is a better estimate than any other amount, then the minimum of the range is accrued.
see note 19-income taxes, for additional information about income tax-related contingencies.
based on currently available information, we believe it is remote that future costs related to known contingent liability exposures will exceed current accruals by an amount that would have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial statements.
estimates particularly sensitive to future changes include contingent liabilities recorded for environmental remediation, tax and legal matters.
estimated future environmental remediation costs are subject to change due to such factors as the uncertain magnitude of cleanup costs, the unknown time and extent of such remedial actions that may be required, and the determination of our liability in proportion to that of other responsible parties.
estimated future costs related to tax and legal matters are subject to change as events evolve and as additional information becomes available during the administrative and litigation processes.
environmental we are subject to international, federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations.
when we prepare our consolidated financial statements, we record accruals for environmental liabilities based on management's best estimates, using all information that is available at the time.
we measure estimates and base liabilities on currently available facts, existing technology, and presently enacted laws and regulations, taking into account stakeholder and business considerations.
when measuring environmental liabilities, we also consider our prior experience in remediation of contaminated sites, other companies' cleanup experience, and data released by the u.s. epa or other organizations.
we consider unasserted claims in our determination of environmental liabilities, and we accrue them in the period they are both probable and reasonably estimable.
although liability of those potentially responsible for environmental remediation costs is generally joint and several for federal sites and frequently so for other sites, we are usually only one of many companies cited at a particular site.
we have been successful to date in sharing cleanup costs with other financially sound companies.
many of the sites at which we are potentially responsible are still under investigation by the epa or the agency concerned.
prior to actual cleanup, those potentially responsible normally assess the site conditions, apportion responsibility and determine the appropriate remediation.
in some instances, we may have no liability or may attain a settlement of liability.
where it appears that other potentially responsible parties may be financially unable to bear their proportional share, we consider this inability in estimating our potential liability, and we adjust our accruals accordingly.
as a result of various acquisitions in the past, we assumed certain environmental obligations.
some of these environmental obligations are mitigated by indemnifications made by others for our benefit, and some of the indemnifications are subject to dollar limits and time limits.
we are currently participating in environmental assessments and cleanups at numerous federal superfund and comparable state and international sites.
after an assessment of environmental exposures for cleanup and other costs, we make accruals on an undiscounted basis (except those acquired in a purchase business combination, which we record on a discounted basis) for planned investigation and remediation activities for sites where it is probable future costs will be incurred and these costs can be reasonably estimated.
in the future, we may be involved in additional environmental assessments, cleanups and proceedings.
see note 10-asset retirement obligations and accrued environmental costs, for a summary of our accrued environmental liabilities.
legal proceedings we are subject to various lawsuits and claims including but not limited to matters involving oil and gas royalty and severance tax payments, gas measurement and valuation methods, contract disputes, environmental damages, climate change, personal injury, and property damage.
our primary exposures for such matters relate to alleged royalty and tax underpayments on certain federal, state and privately owned properties and claims of alleged environmental contamination from historic operations.
our legal organization applies its knowledge, experience and professional judgment to the specific characteristics of our cases, employing a litigation management process to manage and monitor the legal proceedings against us.
our process facilitates the early evaluation and quantification of potential exposures in individual cases.
based on professional judgment and experience in using these litigation management tools and available information about current developments in all our cases, our legal organization regularly assesses the adequacy of current accruals and determines if adjustment of existing accruals, or establishment of new accruals, is required.
other contingencies we have contingent liabilities resulting from throughput agreements with pipeline and processing companies not associated with financing arrangements.
under these agreements, we may be required to provide any such company with additional funds through advances and penalties for fees related to throughput capacity not utilized.
in addition, at december 31, 2019, we had performance obligations secured by letters of credit of
million (issued as direct bank letters of credit) related to various purchase commitments for materials, supplies, commercial activities and services incident to the ordinary conduct of business.

the cost of securities sold and redeemed is determined using the specific identification method.
credit risk financial instruments potentially exposed to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash equivalents, short-term investments, long-term investments in debt securities, otc derivative contracts and trade receivables.
our cash equivalents and short-term investments are placed in high-quality commercial paper, government money market funds, government debt securities, time deposits with major international banks and financial institutions, and high-quality corporate bonds.
the credit risk from our otc derivative contracts, such as forwards, swaps and options, derives from the counterparty to the transaction.
individual counterparty exposure is managed within predetermined credit limits and includes the use of cash-call margins when appropriate, thereby reducing the risk of significant nonperformance.
we also use futures, swaps and option contracts that have a negligible credit risk because these trades are cleared primarily with an exchange clearinghouse and subject to mandatory margin requirements until settled; however, we are exposed to the credit risk of those exchange brokers for receivables arising from daily margin cash calls, as well as for cash deposited to meet initial margin requirements.
our trade receivables result primarily from our petroleum operations and reflect a broad national and international customer base, which limits our exposure to concentrations of credit risk.
the majority of these receivables have payment terms of
30 days or less , and we continually monitor this exposure and the creditworthiness of the counterparties.
we do not generally require collateral to limit the exposure to loss;
however, we will sometimes use letters of credit, prepayments and master netting arrangements to mitigate credit risk with counterparties that both buy from and sell to us, as these agreements permit the amounts owed by us or owed to others to be offset against amounts due to us.
certain of our derivative instruments contain provisions that require us to post collateral if the derivative exposure exceeds a threshold amount. we have contracts with fixed threshold amounts and other contracts with variable threshold amounts that are contingent on our credit rating. the variable threshold amounts typically decline for lower credit ratings, while both the variable and fixed threshold amounts typically revert to zero if we fall below investment grade. cash is the primary collateral in all contracts; however, many also permit us to post letters of credit as collateral, such as transactions administered through the new york mercantile exchange.
the aggregate fair value of all derivative instruments with such credit risk-related contingent features that were in a liability position on december 31, 2019 and december 31, 2018, was $

note 15-fair value measurement we carry a portion of our assets and liabilities at fair value that are measured at a reporting date using an exit price (i.e., the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability) and disclosed according to the quality of valuation inputs under the following hierarchy:
level 1: quoted prices (unadjusted) in an active market for identical assets or liabilities.
level 3: unobservable inputs that are significant to the fair value of assets or liabilities.
the classification of an asset or liability is based on the lowest level of input significant to its fair value.
those that are initially classified as level 3 are subsequently reported as level 2 when the fair value derived from unobservable inputs is inconsequential to the overall fair value, or if corroborated market data becomes available.
2 are subsequently reported as level 3 if corroborated market data is no longer available.
transfers occur at the end of the reporting period.
there were no material transfers in or out of level 1 during
recurring fair value measurement financial assets and liabilities reported at fair value on a recurring basis primarily include our investment in cenovus energy shares, our investments in debt securities classified as available for sale, and commodity derivatives.
level 1 derivative assets and liabilities primarily represent exchange-traded futures and options that are valued using unadjusted prices available from the underlying exchange.
level 1 also includes our investment in common shares of cenovus energy, which is valued using quotes for shares on the nyse, and our investments in u.s. government obligations classified as available for sale debt securities, which are valued using exchange prices.
level 2 derivative assets and liabilities primarily represent otc swaps, options and forward purchase and sale contracts that are valued using adjusted exchange prices, prices provided by brokers or pricing service companies that are all corroborated by market data.
level 2 also includes our investments in debt securities classified as available for sale including investments in corporate bonds, commercial paper, and asset-backed securities that are valued using pricing provided by brokers or pricing service companies that are corroborated with market data.
level 3 derivative assets and liabilities consist of otc swaps, options and forward purchase and sale contracts where a significant portion of fair value is calculated from underlying market data that is not readily available.
the derived value uses industry standard methodologies that may consider the historical relationships among various commodities, modeled market prices, time value, volatility factors and other relevant economic measures.
the use of these inputs results in management's best estimate of fair value.

investments in debt securities classified as available for sale: the fair value of investments in debt securities categorized as level 1 in the fair value hierarchy is measured using exchange prices.
the fair value of investments in debt securities categorized as level 2 in the fair value hierarchy is measured using pricing provided by brokers or pricing service companies that are corroborated with market data.
see note 14-derivatives and financial instruments, for additional information.
loans and advances-related parties: the carrying amount of floating-rate loans approximates fair value.
the fair value of fixed-rate loan activity is measured using market observable data and is categorized as level 2 in the fair value hierarchy.

note 17-non-mineral leases the company primarily leases office buildings and drilling equipment, as well as ocean transport vessels, tugboats, corporate aircraft, and other facilities and equipment.
certain leases include escalation clauses for adjusting rental payments to reflect changes in price indices and other leases include payment provisions that vary based on the nature of usage of the leased asset.
additionally, the company has executed certain leases that provide it with the option to extend or renew the term of the lease, terminate the lease prior to the end of the lease term, or purchase the leased asset as of the end of the lease term.
in other cases, the company has executed lease agreements that require it to guarantee the residual value of certain leased office buildings.
for additional information about guarantees, see note 12-guarantees.
only the lease components of these contractual arrangements are subject to the provisions of asc topic 842, and any non-lease components are subject to other applicable accounting guidance; however, we have elected to adopt the optional practical expedient not to separate lease components apart from non-lease components for accounting purposes.
this policy election has been adopted for each of the company's leased asset classes existing as of the effective date and subject to the transition provisions of asc topic 842 and will be applied to all new or modified leases executed on or after january 1,
leases are evaluated for classification as operating or finance leases at the commencement date of the lease and right-of-use assets and corresponding liabilities are recognized on our consolidated balance sheet based on the present value of future lease payments relating to the use of the underlying asset during the lease term.
future lease payments include variable lease payments that depend upon an index or rate using the index or rate at the commencement date and probable amounts owed under residual value guarantees.
the amount of future lease payments may be increased to include additional payments related to lease extension, termination, and/or purchase options when the company has determined, at or subsequent to lease commencement, generally due to limited asset availability or operating commitments, it is reasonably certain of exercising such options.
we use our incremental borrowing rate as the discount rate in determining the present value of future lease payments, unless the interest rate implicit in the lease arrangement is readily determinable.
lease payments that vary subsequent to the commencement date based on future usage levels, the nature of leased asset activities, or certain other contingencies are not included in the measurement of lease right-of-use assets and corresponding liabilities.
we have elected not to record assets and liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet for lease arrangements with terms of 12 months or less.
we often enter into leasing arrangements acting in the capacity as operator for and/or on behalf of certain oil and gas joint ventures of undivided interests.
if the lease arrangement can be legally enforced only against us as operator and there is no separate arrangement to sublease the underlying leased asset to our coventurers, we recognize at lease commencement a right-of-use asset and corresponding lease liability on our consolidated balance sheet on a gross basis.
while we record lease costs on a gross basis in our consolidated income statement and statement of cash flows, such costs are offset by the reimbursement we receive from our coventurers for their share of the lease cost as the underlying leased asset is utilized in joint venture activities.
as a result, lease cost is presented in our consolidated income statement and statement of cash flows on a proportional basis.
if we are a nonoperating coventurer, we recognize a right-of-use asset and corresponding lease liability only if we were a specified contractual party to the lease arrangement and the arrangement could be legally enforced against us.
in this circumstance, we would recognize both the right-of-use asset and corresponding lease liability on our consolidated balance sheet on a proportional basis consistent with our undivided interest ownership in the related joint venture.
the company has historically recorded certain finance leases executed by investee companies accounted for under the proportionate consolidation method of accounting on its consolidated balance sheet on a proportional basis consistent with its ownership interest in the investee company.
as of december 31, 2018, $
million of finance lease assets (net of accumulated dd&a) and $
million of finance lease liabilities were recorded on our consolidated balance sheet associated with these leases.
in accordance with the transition provisions of asc topic 842, and since we have elected to adopt the package of optional transition-related practical expedients, the historical accounting treatment for these leases has been carried forward and is subject to reconsideration upon the modification or other required reassessment of the arrangements prior to lease term expiration.
in connection with our adoption of asc topic 842, we have recorded on our consolidated balance sheet $
million of operating leases executed by investee companies accounted for under the proportionate
consolidation method of accounting on a proportional basis consistent with our ownership interest in the investee company.

the following is a description of the valuation methodologies used for the pension plan assets.
there have been no changes in the methodologies used at december 31, 2019 and 2018.
fair values of equity securities and government debt securities categorized in level 1 are primarily based on quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities.
fair values of corporate debt securities, agency and mortgage-backed securities and government debt securities categorized in level 2 are estimated using recently executed transactions and quoted market prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets and for identical assets and liabilities in markets that are not active.
if there have been no market transactions in a particular fixed income security, its fair value is calculated by pricing models that benchmark the security against other securities with actual market prices.
when observable quoted market prices are not available, fair value is based on pricing models that use something other than actual market prices (e.g., observable inputs such as benchmark yields, reported trades and issuer spreads for similar securities), and these securities are categorized in level 3 of the fair value hierarchy.
fair values of investments in common/collective trusts are determined by the issuer of each fund based on the fair value of the underlying assets.
fair values of mutual funds are based on quoted market prices, which represent the net asset value of shares held.
fair values of international cash equivalents categorized in level 2 are valued using observable yield curves, discounting and interest rates.
cash balances held in the form of short-term fund units that are redeemable at the measurement date are categorized as level 2.
fair values of exchange-traded derivatives classified in level 1 are based on quoted market prices.
for other derivatives classified in level 2, the values are generally calculated from pricing models with market input parameters from third-party sources.
fair values of insurance contracts are valued at the present value of the future benefit payments owed by the insurance company to the plans' participants.
fair values of real estate investments are valued using real estate valuation techniques and other methods that include reference to third-party sources and sales comparables where available.
a portion of u.s. pension plan assets is held as a participating interest in an insurance annuity contract, which is calculated as the market value of investments held under this contract, less the accumulated benefit obligation covered by the contract.
the participating interest is classified as level 3 in the fair value hierarchy as the fair value is determined via a combination of quoted market prices, recently executed transactions, and an actuarial present value computation for contract obligations.

of the 79 million shares available for issuance under the plan, no more than
million shares of common stock are available for incentive stock options.
the human resources and compensation committee
of our board of directors is authorized to determine the types, terms, conditions and limitations of awards granted.
awards may be granted in the form of, but not limited to, stock options, restricted stock units and performance share units to employees and non-employee directors who contribute to the company's continued success and profitability.
we recognize share-based compensation expense over the shorter of the service period (i.e., the stated period of time required to earn the award); or the period beginning at the start of the service period and ending when an employee first becomes eligible for retirement, but not less than six months, as this is the minimum period of time required for an award to not be subject to forfeiture.
our share-based compensation programs generally provide accelerated vesting (i.e., a waiver of the remaining period of service required to earn an award) for awards held by employees at the time of their retirement.
some of our share-based awards vest ratably (i.e., portions of the award vest at different times) while some of our awards cliff vest (i.e., all of the award vests at the same time).
we recognize expense on a straight-line basis over the service period for the entire award, whether the award was granted with ratable or cliff vesting.

downstream businesses) through the stock option grant date and the average historical stock price volatility of a group of peer companies for the expected term of the options.

these psus are authorized three years prior to their effective grant date (the performance period).
compensation expense is initially measured using the average fair market value of conocophillips common stock and is subsequently adjusted, based on changes in the conocophillips stock price through the end of each subsequent reporting period, through the grant date for stock-settled awards and the settlement date for cash-settled awards.
stock-settled for performance periods beginning before 2009, psus do not vest until the employee becomes eligible for retirement by reaching age 55 with five years of service, and restrictions do not lapse until the employee separates from the company. with respect to awards for performance periods beginning in 2009 through 2012, psus do not vest until the earlier of the date the employee becomes eligible for retirement by reaching age 55
with five years of service or five years after the grant date of the award, and restrictions do not lapse until the earlier of the employee's separation from the company or five years after the grant date (although recipients can elect to defer the lapsing of restrictions until separation). we recognize compensation expense for these awards beginning on the grant date and ending on the date the psus are scheduled to vest. since these awards are authorized three years prior to the grant date, for employees eligible for retirement by or shortly after the grant date, we recognize compensation expense over the period beginning on the date of authorization and ending on the date of grant. until issued as stock, recipients of the psus receive a quarterly cash payment of a dividend equivalent that is charged to retained earnings. beginning in 2013, psus authorized for future grants will vest, absent employee election to defer, upon settlement following the conclusion of the three-year performance period. we recognize compensation expense over the period beginning on the date of authorization and ending on the conclusion of the performance period. psus are settled by issuing one share of conocophillips common stock per unit.

from inception of the performance share program through 2013, approved psu awards were granted after the conclusion of performance periods.
beginning in february 2014, initial target psu awards are issued near the beginning of new performance periods. these initial target psu awards will terminate at the end of the performance periods and will be settled after the performance periods have ended. also in 2014, initial target psu awards were issued for open performance periods that began in prior years. for the open performance period beginning in 2012, the initial target psu awards terminated at the end of the three-year performance period and were replaced with approved psu awards. for the open performance period beginning in 2013, the initial target psu awards terminated at the end of the three-year performance period and were settled after the performance period ended.
there is no effect on recognition of compensation expense.
-in addition to the above active programs, we have outstanding shares of restricted stock and restricted stock units that were either issued as part of our non-employee director compensation program for current and former members of the company's board of directors or as part of an executive compensation program that has been discontinued.

u.s. general business credits
u.s. capital loss
state net operating losses and tax credits
various foreign net operating losses and tax credits
during 2019, valuation allowances increased a total of $
the increase primarily relates to deferred tax assets recognized during 2019 as a result of the finalization of rules related to the u.s. tax cuts and jobs act (tax legislation including ongoing issuance of tax regulations related to such legislation), as further discussed below.
based on our historical taxable income, expectations for the future, and available tax-planning strategies, management expects deferred tax assets, net of valuation allowance, will primarily be realized as offsets to reversing deferred tax liabilities.
on december 2, 2019, the internal revenue service finalized foreign tax credit regulations related to the 2017
due to the finalization of these regulations, in the fourth quarter of 2019 we recognized $
million of net deferred tax assets.
million of existing foreign tax credit carryovers where recognition was previously considered to be remote.
present legislation still makes their realization unlikely and therefore these credits have been offset with a full valuation allowance.
deferred income taxes have not been provided on this amount, as we do not plan to initiate any action that would require the payment of income taxes.

revenues from contracts outside the scope of asc topic 606 relate primarily to physical gas contracts at market prices which qualify as derivatives accounted for under asc topic 815, "derivatives and hedging,"
there is no significant difference in contractual terms or the policy for recognition of revenue from these contracts and those within the scope of asc topic 606.

we have long-term commodity sales contracts which use prevailing market prices at the time of delivery, and under these contracts, the market-
based variable consideration for each performance obligation (i.e., delivery of commodity) is allocated to each wholly unsatisfied performance obligation within the contract.
accordingly, we have applied the practical expedient allowed in asc topic 606 and do not disclose the aggregate amount of the transaction price allocated to performance obligations or when we expect to recognize revenues that are unsatisfied (or partially unsatisfied) as of the end of the reporting period.
receivables and contract liabilities receivables from contracts with customers at december 31, 2019, the "accounts and notes receivable" line on our consolidated balance sheet included trade receivables of $
million at december 31, 2018, and included both contracts with customers within the scope of asc topic 606 and those that are outside the scope of asc topic 606.
we typically receive payment within 30 days or less (depending on the terms of the invoice) once delivery is made.
revenues that are outside the scope of asc topic 606 relate primarily to physical gas sales contracts at market prices for which we do not elect npns and are therefore accounted for as a derivative under asc topic 815.
there is little distinction in the nature of the customer or credit quality of trade receivables associated with gas sold under contracts for which npns has not been elected compared with trade receivables where npns has been elected.
contract liabilities from contracts with customers we have entered into contractual arrangements where we license proprietary technology to customers related to the optimization process for operating lng plants. the agreements typically provide for negotiated payments to be made at stated milestones. the payments are not directly related to our performance under the contract and are recorded as deferred revenue to be recognized as revenue when the customer can utilize and benefit from their right to use the license. payments are received in installments over the construction period.

(asu no. 2016-13), which sets forth the current expected credit loss model, a new forward-looking impairment model for certain financial instruments based on expected losses rather than incurred losses.
the impact of adopting this asu is not expected to be material to our financial statements.
in accordance with fasb asc topic 932, "extractive activities-oil and gas," and regulations of the sec, we are making certain supplemental disclosures about our oil and gas exploration and production operations.

for-sale assets at december 31, 2019. see note 5-asset acquisitions and dispositions, in the notes to consolidated financial statements, for additional information on held-for-sale assets.
as required by current authoritative guidelines, the estimated future date when an asset will be permanently shut down for economic reasons is based on historical
12-month first-of-month average prices and current costs.
this estimated date when production will end affects the amount of estimated reserves.
therefore, as prices and cost levels change from year to year, the estimate of proved reserves also changes.
our proved reserves include estimated quantities related to pscs, which are reported under the "economic interest" method, as well as variable-royalty regimes, and are subject to fluctuations in commodity prices, recoverable operating expenses and capital costs.
if costs remain stable, reserve quantities attributable to recovery of costs will change inversely to changes in commodity prices.
6 percent of our total proved reserves were under pscs, located in our asia pacific/middle east geographic reporting area, and 6
percent of our total proved reserves were under a variable-royalty regime, located in our canada geographic reporting area.
reserves governance the recording and reporting of proved reserves are governed by criteria established by regulations of the sec and fasb.
proved reserves are those quantities of oil and gas, which, by analysis of geoscience and engineering data, can be estimated with reasonable certainty to be economically producible-from a given date forward, from known reservoirs, and under existing economic conditions, operating methods, and government regulations-prior to the time at which contracts providing the right to operate expire, unless evidence indicates renewal is reasonably certain, regardless of whether deterministic or probabilistic methods are used for the estimation.
proved developed reserves are proved reserves that can be expected to be recovered through existing wells with existing equipment and operating methods, or in which the cost of the required equipment is relatively minor compared with the cost of a new well, and through installed extraction equipment and infrastructure operational at the time of the reserves estimate if the extraction is by means not involving a well.
proved undeveloped reserves are proved reserves expected to be recovered from new wells on undrilled acreage, or from existing wells where a relatively major expenditure is required for recompletion. reserves on undrilled acreage are limited to those directly offsetting development spacing areas that are reasonably certain of production when drilled, unless evidence provided by reliable technologies exists that establishes reasonable certainty of economic producibility at greater distances. as defined by sec regulations, reliable technologies may be used in reserve estimation when they have been demonstrated in the field to provide reasonably certain results with consistency and repeatability in the formation being evaluated or in an analogous formation.
the technologies and data used in the estimation of our proved reserves include, but are not limited to, performance-based
we have a companywide, comprehensive, sec-compliant internal policy that governs the determination and reporting of proved reserves.
this policy is applied by the geoscientists and reservoir engineers in our business units around the world.
as part of our internal control process, each business unit's reserves processes and controls are reviewed annually by an internal team which is headed by the company's manager of reserves compliance and reporting.
this team, composed of internal reservoir engineers, geoscientists, finance personnel and a senior representative from degolyer and macnaughton (d&m), a third-party petroleum engineering consulting firm, reviews the business units' reserves for adherence to sec guidelines and company policy through on-site visits, teleconferences and review of documentation.
in addition to providing independent reviews, this internal team also ensures reserves are calculated using consistent and appropriate standards and procedures.
this team is independent of business unit line management and is responsible for reporting its findings to senior management.
the team is responsible for communicating our reserves policy and procedures and is available for internal peer reviews and consultation on major projects or technical issues throughout the year.
all of our proved reserves held by consolidated companies and our share of equity affiliates have been estimated by conocophillips.
during 2019, our processes and controls used to assess over 90 percent of proved reserves as of december 31,
the purpose of their review was to assess whether the adequacy and effectiveness of our internal processes and controls used to determine estimates of proved reserves are in accordance with sec regulations.
in such review, conocophillips' technical staff presented d&m with an overview of the reserves data, as well as the methods and assumptions used in estimating reserves.
the data presented included pertinent seismic information, geologic maps, well logs, production tests, material balance calculations, reservoir simulation models, well performance data, operating procedures and relevant economic criteria.
management's intent in retaining d&m to review its processes and controls was to provide objective third-party input on these processes and controls.
d&m's opinion was the general processes and controls employed by conocophillips in estimating its december 31, 2019, proved reserves for the properties reviewed are in accordance with the sec reserves definitions.
d&m's report is included as exhibit 99 of this annual report on form 10-k.
the technical person primarily responsible for overseeing the processes and internal controls used in the preparation of the company's reserves estimates is the manager of reserves compliance and reporting.
this individual holds a master's degree in petroleum engineering.
he is a member of the society of petroleum engineers with over 25 years of oil and gas industry experience and has held positions of increasing responsibility in reservoir engineering, subsurface and asset management in the u.s. and several international field locations.
engineering estimates of the quantities of proved reserves are inherently imprecise.
see the "critical accounting estimates" section of management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for additional discussion of the sensitivities surrounding these estimates.

notable changes in proved crude oil reserves in the three years ended december 31, 2019, included:
: in 2019, alaska upward revisions were due to cost and technical revisions of 74 million barrels, partially offset by downward price revisions of 34 million barrels.
downward revisions in lower 48 were due to changes in development timing for specific well locations from the unconventional plays of 71 million barrels and price revisions of 22 million barrels, partially offset by upward revisions related to infill drilling and improved well performance of 57 million barrels.
in 2018, downward revisions in lower 48 were primarily due to changes in development timing for specific well locations from the unconventional plays and are more than offset by increases in planned well locations in the unconventional plays in the extensions and discoveries category.
downward revisions in lower 48 due to development timing were partially offset by higher prices. revisions in alaska, europe and asia pacific/middle east were primarily due to higher prices.
: in 2019, extensions and discoveries in lower 48 were due to planned development to add specific well locations from the unconventional plays which more than offset the decreases in the revisions category.
in asia pacific/middle east, increases were due to sanctioning of development programs in china and malaysia.
were primarily due to changes in the development strategy to add specific well locations from the unconventional plays.
extensions and discoveries in alaska were driven by drilling success in western north slope.
were primarily due to continued drilling success in the permian unconventional, eagle ford and bakken.
: in 2019, europe sales represent the disposition of the u.k. assets. in 2018, europe sales were due to the disposition of a subsidiary that held 16.5 percent of our 24 percent interest in the clair field in the u.k.
in 2017, canada sales were due to the disposition of a majority of our western canada assets.

notable changes in proved ngl reserves in the three years ended december 31, 2019, included:
were due to changes in development timing for specific well locations from the unconventional plays of 32 million barrels and price revisions of 11 million barrels, partially offset by upward revisions related to infill drilling and improved well performance of 32 million barrels.
in 2018, downward revisions in lower 48 were primarily due to changes in development timing for specific well locations from the unconventional plays and are more than offset by increases in planned well locations in the unconventional plays in the extensions and discoveries category.
: in 2019, extensions and discoveries in lower 48 were due to planned development to add specific well locations from the unconventional plays which more than offset the decreases in the revisions category.
were primarily due to changes in the development strategy to add specific well locations from the unconventional plays.
were primarily due to continued drilling success in the permian unconventional, eagle ford and bakken.
: in 2019, europe sales represent the disposition of the u.k. assets.
in 2018, lower 48 sales were primarily due to the disposition of our interests in the barnett.
in 2017, lower 48 sales were due to the disposition of our interests in the san juan basin and panhandle assets, while canada sales were due to the disposition of a majority of our western canada assets.

the value of net production consumed in operations is not reflected in net revenues and production expenses, nor do the volumes impact the respective per unit metrics.
reserve volumes include natural gas to be consumed in operations of 3,141 bcf,
3,131 bcf, and 3,825 bcf as of december 31,
these volumes are not included in the calculation of our standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows relating to proved oil and gas reserve quantities.
notable changes in proved natural gas reserves in the three years ended december 31, 2019, included:

natural gas reserves are converted to barrels of oil equivalent (boe) based on a 6:1 ratio:
six mcf of natural gas converts to one boe.
proved undeveloped reserves we had 1,327 mmboe of puds at year-end 2019, compared with 1,162 mmboe at year-end 2018.
the following table shows changes in total proved undeveloped reserves for 2019:

transfers to proved developed reserves were driven by the ongoing development of our assets. approximately half of the transfers were from the development of our lower 48 unconventional plays. the remainder of transfers were from development across the asia pacific/middle east, alaska, europe and canada regions.
downward revisions were driven by changes in development timing of 166 mmboe primarily in lower 48 and canada, largely offset by upward revisions for infill drilling of 147 mmboe primarily in lower 48, europe, alaska and africa.
extensions and discoveries were largely driven by an addition of 358 mmboe in lower 48 for the continued development of unconventional plays. the remaining extensions and discoveries were driven by the continued development planned in alaska, canada and asia pacific/middle east.
sales were due to the disposition of the u.k.
25 percent of total proved reserves, compared with 22 percent at december 31,
31, 2019, relating to the development of puds were $4.6 billion.
a portion of our costs incurred each year relates to development projects where the puds will be converted to proved developed reserves in future years.
at the end of 2019, more than 90 percent of total puds were under development or scheduled for development within five years of initial disclosure. the remainder are to be developed as parts of major projects ongoing in our canada, asia pacific/middle east and europe regions.
all major development areas are currently producing and are expected to have puds convert to proved developed over time.
of our total puds at year-end 2019, 81 percent are in north america, and 95 percent of these reserve volumes are planned for development within five years of initial disclosure.
results of operations the company's results of operations from oil and gas activities for the years 2019, 2018 and 2017 are shown in the following tables.
non-oil and gas activities, such as pipeline and marine operations, lng operations, crude oil and gas marketing activities, and the profit element of transportation operations in which we have an ownership interest are excluded.
additional information about selected line items within the results of operations tables is shown below:
sales are net of fees to transport our produced hydrocarbons beyond the production function to a final delivery point using transportation operations which are not consolidated.
other revenues include gains and losses from asset sales, certain amounts resulting from the purchase and sale of hydrocarbons, and other miscellaneous income.
production costs include costs incurred to operate and maintain wells, related equipment and facilities used in the production of petroleum liquids and natural gas.
depreciation of support equipment is reclassified as applicable.

*at year-end 2019, the greater prudhoe area in alaska contained more than 15% of total proved reserves.
average sales prices for alaska crude oil and asia pacific/middle east natural gas above reflect a reduction for transportation costs in which we have an ownership interest that are incurred subsequent to the terminal point of the production function.
accordingly, the average sales prices differ from those discussed in item 7 of management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations.

development and exploration activities the following two tables summarize our net interest in productive and dry exploratory and development wells in the years ended december 31, 2019,
a "development well" is a well drilled within the proved area of a reservoir to the depth of a stratigraphic horizon known to be productive.
exploratory wells also include wells drilled in areas near or offsetting current production, or in areas where well density or production history have not achieved statistical certainty of results.

standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows relating to proved oil and gas reserve quantities in accordance with sec and fasb requirements, amounts were computed using
and end-of-year costs, appropriate statutory tax rates and a prescribed
10 percent discount factor.
twelve-month average prices are calculated as the unweighted arithmetic average of the first-day-of-the-month price for each month within the 12-month period prior to the end of the reporting period.
for all years, continuation of year-end economic conditions was assumed.
the calculations were based on estimates of proved reserves, which are revised over time as new data becomes available.
probable or possible reserves, which may become proved in the future, were not considered.
the calculations also require assumptions as to the timing of future production of proved reserves and the timing and amount of future development costs, including dismantlement, and future production costs, including taxes other than income taxes.
while due care was taken in its preparation, we do not represent that this data is the fair value of our oil and gas properties, or a fair estimate of the present value of cash flows to be obtained from their development and production.

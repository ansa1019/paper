beyond our environmental stewardship, we also support the world's communities in two important ways. first, we believe that we contribute to economic development and well-being by enabling more affordable access to mobility around the world. for example, many of the automobiles sold through our auction platform are purchased for use in developing countries where affordable transportation is a critical enabler of education, health care, and well-being more generally. in addition, because of the special role we play in responding to catastrophic weather events, we believe we contribute to disaster recovery and resilience in the communities we serve. for example, we mobilized our people, entered into emergency leases, and engaged with a multitude of service providers to timely retrieve, store, and remarket tens of thousands of flood-damaged vehicles in the houston, texas metropolitan area in the wake of hurricane harvey in the summer of 2017.

item 1a. risk factors.
the following discussion of risk factors contains forward-looking statements. these risk factors may be important for understanding any statement in this form 10-k or elsewhere. the following information should be read in conjunction with part ii, item 7, "management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations" and the consolidated financial statements and related notes in part ii, item 8, "financial statements and supplementary data" of this form 10-k.
because of the following factors, as well as other variables affecting our results of operations, past financial performance may not be a reliable indicator of future performance, and historical trends should not be used to anticipate results or trends in future periods.
risks related to our business if we are unsuccessful at addressing our business challenges, our business and results of operations may be adversely affected and our ability to invest in and grow our business could be limited.
our business faces many challenges we must address. one set of challenges relates to dynamic and accelerating market trends, which may include declines in the markets in which we operate. for example, a competitive pricing environment and weakened market in certain geographies with associated customer pricing sensitivity has presented market challenges in printing. a second set of challenges relates to changes in the competitive landscape. our primary competitors are exerting increased competitive pressure in targeted areas and are entering new markets; our emerging competitors are introducing new technologies and business models; and our alliance partners in some businesses are increasingly becoming our competitors in others. a third set of challenges relates to business model changes and our go-to-market execution. for example, we may fail to develop innovative products and services, maintain the manufacturing quality of our products, manage our global, multi-tier distribution network, limit potential misuse of pricing programs by our channel partners, adapt to new or changing marketplaces or successfully market new products and services, any of which could adversely affect our business and financial condition.
in addition, we have in the recent past and may again in the future face macroeconomic challenges, including weakness in certain geographic regions and global political developments that impact international trade, such as trade disputes and increased tariffs. we may also be vulnerable to increased risks associated with our efforts to address such challenges given the broad range of geographic markets in which we and our customers and partners operate. if we experience these challenges and do not succeed in our efforts to mitigate them, or if these efforts are more costly or time-consuming than expected, our business and results of operations may be adversely affected, which could limit our ability to invest in and grow our business.
we operate in an intensely competitive industry and competitive pressures could harm our business and financial performance.
we encounter aggressive competition from numerous and varied competitors in all areas of our business, and our competitors have targeted and are expected to continue targeting our key market segments. we compete on the basis of our technology, innovation, performance, price, quality, reliability, brand, reputation, distribution, range of products and services, ease of use of our products, account relationships, customer training, service and support, security, availability of application software and internet infrastructure offerings, and our sustainability performance. if our products, services, support and cost structure do not enable us to compete successfully, our results of operations and business prospects could be harmed.
we have a large portfolio of products and must allocate our financial, personnel and other resources across all of our products while competing with companies that have smaller portfolios or specialize in one or more of our product lines. as a result, we may invest less in certain areas of our business than our competitors, and our competitors may have greater financial, technical and marketing resources available to their products and services compared to the resources allocated to our competing products and services.
companies with whom we have alliances in certain areas may be or may become our competitors in other areas. in addition, companies with whom we have alliances also may acquire or form alliances with our competitors, which could reduce their business with us. if we are unable to effectively manage these complicated relationships with alliance partners, our business and results of operations could be adversely affected.
we face aggressive price competition and may have to continue lowering the prices of many of our products and services to stay competitive, while at the same time trying to maintain or improve our revenue and gross margin. in addition, competitors who have a greater presence in some of the lower-cost markets in which we compete, or who can obtain better pricing, more favorable contractual terms and conditions, or more favorable allocations of products and components during periods of limited supply, may be able to offer lower prices than we are able to offer. our cash flows, results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected by these and other industry-wide pricing pressures.
industry consolidation may also affect competition by creating larger, more homogeneous and potentially stronger competitors in the markets in which we operate. additionally, our competitors may affect our business by entering into exclusive arrangements with our existing or potential customers or suppliers.
because our business model is based on providing innovative and high-quality products, we may spend a proportionately greater amount of our revenues on research and development than some of our competitors. if we cannot proportionately decrease our cost structure (apart from research and development expenses) on a timely basis in response to competitive price pressures, our gross margin and, therefore, our profitability could be adversely affected. in addition, if our pricing and other facets of our offerings are not sufficiently competitive, or if there is a negative reception to our product decisions, we may lose market share in certain areas, which could adversely affect our financial performance and business prospects.
even if we are able to maintain or increase market share for a particular product, its financial performance could decline because the product is in a maturing industry or market segment or contains technology that is becoming obsolete. financial performance could also decline due to increased competition from other types of products. for example, non-original supplies (including imitation, refill or remanufactured alternatives) for some of our laserjet toner and inkjet cartridges compete with our printing supplies business.
customers are increasingly using online and omnichannel resellers and distributors to purchase our products. these resellers and distributors often sell our products alongside competing products, including non-original supplies, or they may highlight the availability of lower cost non-original supplies. we expect this competition will continue, and it may negatively impact our financial performance, particularly if large commercial customers purchase competing products instead of hp products.
if we cannot successfully execute our strategy and continue to develop, manufacture and market innovative products and services, our business and financial performance may suffer.
our strategy is focused on leveraging our existing portfolio of products and services to meet the demands of a continually changing technological landscape and to offset certain areas of industry decline. to successfully execute this strategy, we must emphasize the aspects of our core business where demand remains strong, identify and capitalize on natural areas of growth, innovate and develop new products and services that will enable us to expand beyond our existing technology categories and adapt to new and changing marketplaces for our products. for example, our go-to-market strategy, including online, omnichannel and contractual sales, needs to evolve in-line with market dynamics, forces and demand. if we cannot innovate, develop and execute evolutionary strategies in this changing environment, then we may not be able to successfully compete and maintain the value proposition of our products, including supplies. any failure to successfully execute this strategy, including any failure to invest sufficiently in strategic growth areas, could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.
the process of developing new high-technology products and services and enhancing existing products and services is complex, costly and uncertain, and any failure by us to anticipate customers' changing needs and emerging technological trends accurately could significantly harm our market share, cash flows, results of operations and financial condition. for example, our strategy includes advancing our position in the personal systems and printing markets. in personal systems, we are focused on reinventing computing experiences, growing the lifetime value of our products, and accelerating services and solutions; in printing, we are focused on driving print innovation, maximizing the value of our installed base of printers, accelerating our contractual business model and pivoting our business models to providing customers choice. our strategy also includes disrupting in our industrial businesses, primarily by expanding our graphics and 3d printing solutions and unlocking new sources of value from microfluidics.
we must optimize our cost structure, make long-term investments, develop or acquire and appropriately protect intellectual property, and commit significant research and development and other resources before knowing whether our predictions will accurately reflect customer demand for our products and services. any failure to accurately predict technological and business trends, control research and development costs or execute our strategy could harm our business and financial performance. our research and development initiatives or other investments may not be successful in whole or in part, including research and development projects which we have prioritized with respect to funding and/or personnel, and our customers may not adopt our new business models.
our industry is subject to rapid and substantial innovation and technological change. even if we successfully develop new products and technologies, future products and technologies may eventually supplant ours if we are unable to keep pace with technological advances and end-user requirements and preferences and timely enhance our existing products and technologies or develop new ones. our competitors may also create products that replace ours. as a result, any of our products and technologies may be rendered obsolete or uneconomical.
after we develop a product, we must be able to manufacture appropriate volumes quickly while also managing costs and preserving margins. to accomplish this, we must accurately forecast volumes, mixes of products and configurations that meet customer requirements, and we may not succeed at doing so within a given product's lifecycle or at all. any delay in the development, production or marketing of a new product, service or solution could result in us not being among the first to market, which could further harm our competitive position. moreover, new products and services may not be profitable, and even if they are profitable, operating margins for some new products and businesses may not be as high as the margins we have experienced historically.
if we cannot continue to produce high-quality and secure products and services, our reputation, business and financial performance may suffer.
in the course of conducting our business, we must address quality and security issues associated with our products and services, including defects in our engineering, design and manufacturing processes, unsatisfactory performance under service contracts, and unsatisfactory performance or malicious acts by third-party contractors or subcontractors or their employees.  our business is also exposed to the risk of defects in third-party components included in our products, including security vulnerabilities, as illustrated by the "spectre" and "meltdown" side-channel exploit threats. in order to address quality and security issues, we work extensively with our customers and suppliers and engage in product testing to determine the causes of problems and to develop and implement effective solutions.  however, the products and services that we offer are complex, and our regular testing and quality control efforts may not be completely effective in controlling or detecting all quality and security issues or errors, particularly with respect to defects or security vulnerabilities in components manufactured by third parties.
if we are unable to determine the cause or find an effective solution to address quality and security issues with our products, we may delay shipment to customers, which would delay revenue recognition and receipt of customer payments and could adversely affect our net revenue, cash flows and profitability.  in addition, after products are delivered, quality and security issues may require us to repair or replace such products.  addressing quality and security issues can be expensive and may result in additional warranty, repair, replacement and other costs, adversely affecting our financial performance. in the event of security vulnerabilities or other issues with third-party components, we may have to rely on third parties to provide mitigation techniques such as firmware updates. furthermore, mitigation techniques for vulnerabilities in third-party components may be ineffective or may result in adverse performance, system instability and data loss or corruption. if new or existing customers have difficulty operating our products or are dissatisfied with our services, our results of operations could be adversely affected, and we could face possible claims if we fail to meet our customers' expectations.  in addition, quality and security issues, including those resulting from defects or security vulnerabilities in third-party components, can impair our relationships with new or existing customers and adversely affect our brand and reputation, which could, in turn, adversely affect our cash flows, results of operations and financial condition.
the net revenue and profitability of our operations have historically varied, which makes our future financial results less predictable.
our net revenue, gross margin and profit vary among our diverse products and services, customer groups and geographic markets and therefore will likely be different in future periods than our current results. overall gross margins and profitability in any given period are dependent on the product, service, customer and geographic mix reflected in that period's net revenue, which in turn depends on the overall demand for our products and services. delays or reductions in spending by our customers or potential customers could have a material adverse effect on demand for our products and services, which could result in a significant decline in net revenue. in addition, net revenue declines in some of our businesses may affect net revenue in our other businesses as we may lose cross-selling opportunities. competition, lawsuits, investigations, increases in component and manufacturing costs that we are unable to pass on to our customers, increased tariffs, component supply disruptions and other risks affecting our businesses may also have a significant impact on our overall gross margin and profitability. in addition, newer geographic markets may be relatively less profitable due to our investments associated with entering those markets and local pricing pressures, and we may have difficulty establishing and maintaining the operating infrastructure necessary to support the high growth rate associated with some of those markets. market trends, industry shifts, competitive pressures, commoditization of products, increased component or shipping costs, increased tariffs, regulatory impacts and other factors may result in reductions in revenue or pressure on gross margins in a given period, which may lead to adjustments to our operations. for example, our supplies business has recently experienced declining revenues due to declines in market share, installed base and usage, and increased customer pricing sensitivity. our efforts to address the challenges facing our business could increase the level of variability in our financial results because the rate at which we are able to realize the benefits from those efforts may vary from period to period.
we depend on third-party suppliers, and our financial results could suffer if we fail to manage our suppliers effectively.
our operations depend on our ability to anticipate our needs for components, products and services, as well as our suppliers' ability to deliver sufficient quantities of quality components, products and services at reasonable prices and in time for us to meet critical schedules for the delivery of our own products and services. given the wide variety of products and services that we offer, the large number of our suppliers and contract manufacturers that are located around the world, and the long lead times required to manufacture, assemble and deliver certain components and products, problems could arise in production, planning and inventory management that could seriously harm our business. third-party suppliers may have limited financial resources to withstand challenging business conditions, particularly as a result of increased interest rates or emerging market volatility, and our business could be negatively impacted if key suppliers are forced to cease or limit their operations. due to the international nature of our third-party supplier network, our financial results may also be negatively impacted by increased trade barriers and increased tariffs, which could increase the cost of certain components, products and services that we may not be able to offset. in addition, our ongoing efforts to optimize the efficiency of our supply chain could cause supply disruptions and be more expensive, time-consuming and resource-intensive than expected. furthermore, certain of our suppliers may decide to discontinue conducting business with us. other supplier problems that we could face include component shortages, excess supply, risks related to the terms of our contracts with suppliers, risks associated with contingent workers, risks related to supply chain working conditions and materials sourcing and risks related to our relationships with single-source suppliers, each of which is described below.
•   component shortages. we may experience a shortage of, or a delay in receiving, certain components as a result of strong demand, capacity constraints, supplier financial weaknesses, the inability of suppliers to borrow funds, disputes with suppliers (some of whom are also our customers), disruptions in the operations of component suppliers, other problems experienced by suppliers or problems faced during the transition to new suppliers. for example, our pc business relies heavily upon oms to manufacture its products and is therefore dependent upon the continuing operations of those oms to fulfill demand for our pc products. we represent a substantial portion of the business of some of these oms, and any changes to the nature or volume of our business transactions with a particular om could adversely affect the operations and financial condition of the om and lead to shortages or delays in receiving products from that om. if shortages or delays persist, the price of certain components may increase, we may be exposed to quality issues or the components may not be available at all. we may not be able to secure enough components at reasonable prices or of acceptable quality to build products or provide services in a timely manner in the quantities needed or according to our specifications. accordingly, our business, cash flows, results of operations and financial condition could suffer if we lose time-sensitive sales, incur additional freight costs or are unable to pass on price increases to our customers. if we cannot adequately address supply issues, we might have to re-engineer some product or service offerings, which could result in further costs and delays.
•   excess supply. in order to secure components for our products or services, at times we may make advance payments to suppliers or enter into non-cancelable commitments with vendors. in addition, we may purchase components strategically in advance of demand to take advantage of favorable pricing or to address concerns about the availability of future components. if we fail to anticipate customer demand properly, a temporary oversupply could result in excess or obsolete components, which could adversely affect our business and financial performance.
•   contractual terms. as a result of binding long-term price or purchase commitments with vendors, we may be obligated to purchase components or services at prices that are higher than those available in the current market and be limited in our ability to respond to changing market conditions. if we commit to purchasing components or services for prices in excess of the then-current market price, we may be at a disadvantage to competitors who have access to components or services at lower prices, our gross margin could suffer, and we could incur additional charges relating to inventory obsolescence. in addition, many of our competitors obtain products or components from the same oms and suppliers that we utilize. our competitors may obtain better pricing, more favorable contractual terms and conditions, and more favorable allocations of products and components during periods of limited supply, and our ability to engage in relationships with certain oms and suppliers could be limited. the practice employed by our pc business of purchasing product components and transferring those components to oms may create large supplier receivables with the oms that, depending on the financial condition of the oms, may create collectability risks. in addition, certain of our oms and suppliers may decide to discontinue conducting business with us. any of these developments could adversely affect our future cash flows, results of operations and financial condition.
•   contingent workers. we also rely on third-party suppliers for the provision of contingent workers, and our failure to manage our use of such workers effectively could adversely affect our results of operations. we have been exposed to various legal claims relating to the status of contingent workers in the past and could face similar claims in the future. we may be subject to shortages, oversupply or fixed contractual terms relating to contingent workers. our ability to manage the size of, and costs associated with, the contingent workforce may be subject to additional constraints imposed by local laws.
•   working conditions and materials sourcing. we work with our suppliers to improve their labor practices and working conditions, such as by including requirements in our agreements with our suppliers that workers receive fair treatment, safe working conditions and freely chosen employment, that materials are responsibly sourced and that business operations are conducted in an environmentally responsible and ethical way. brand perception and customer loyalty could be adversely impacted by a supplier's improper practices or failure to comply with the above-mentioned requirements or those included in our supplier code of conduct, general specification for the environment and other related provisions and requirements of our procurement contracts, including supplier audits, reporting of smelters, wood fiber certification (for hp brand paper and product packaging) and ghg emissions, water and waste data.
•   single-source suppliers. we obtain a significant number of components from single sources due to technology, availability, price, quality or other considerations. for example, we rely on canon for certain laser printer engines and laser toner cartridges. we also rely on intel to provide us with a sufficient supply of processors for many of our pcs and workstations, and we rely on amd to provide us with a sufficient supply of processors for other products. some of those processors are customized for our products. new products that we introduce may utilize custom components obtained from only one source initially until we have evaluated whether there is a need for additional suppliers. replacing a single-source supplier could delay production of some products as replacement suppliers may be subject to capacity constraints or other output limitations. for some components, such as customized components and some of the processors that we obtain from intel, or the laser printer engines and toner cartridges that we obtain from canon, alternative sources either may not exist or may be unable to produce the quantities of those components necessary to satisfy our production requirements. in addition, we sometimes purchase components from single-source suppliers under short-term agreements that contain favorable pricing and other terms but that may be unilaterally modified or terminated by the supplier with limited notice and with little or no penalty. the performance of such single-source suppliers under those agreements (and the renewal or extension of those agreements upon similar terms) may affect the quality, quantity and price of our components. the loss of a single-source supplier, the deterioration of our relationship with a single-source supplier, or any unilateral modification to the contractual terms under which we are supplied components by a single-source supplier could adversely affect our business and financial performance.
if we fail to manage the distribution of our products and services properly, our business and financial performance could suffer.
we use a variety of distribution methods to sell our products and services around the world, including third-party resellers and distributors and both direct and indirect sales to enterprise accounts and consumers. successfully managing the interaction of our direct sales and indirect channel sales efforts to reach various potential customer segments for our products and services is a complex process. moreover, since each distribution method has distinct risks and gross margins, any failure to implement the most advantageous balance in the delivery model for our products and services could adversely affect our net revenue and gross margins and therefore our profitability.
our financial results could be materially adversely affected due to distribution channel conflicts or if the financial conditions of our channel partners were to weaken. our results of operations may be adversely affected by any conflicts that might arise between our various distribution channels or the loss or deterioration of any alliance or distribution arrangement or reduced assortments of our products. moreover, some of our wholesale and retail distributors may have insufficient financial resources and may not be able to withstand changes in business conditions, including economic weakness, industry consolidation and market trends. they may also have difficulty selling our products under new business models. many of our significant distributors operate on narrow margins and have been negatively affected by business pressures in the past. considerable trade receivables that are not covered by collateral or credit insurance are outstanding with our distribution and retail channel partners. net revenue from indirect sales could suffer, and we could experience disruptions in distribution, if our distributors' financial conditions, abilities to borrow funds or operations weaken or if our distributors cannot successfully compete in the online or omnichannel marketplace.
our inventory management is complex, as we continue to sell a significant mix of products through distributors. we must manage both owned and channel inventory effectively, particularly with respect to sales to distributors, which involves forecasting demand and pricing challenges. our forecasts may not accurately predict demand, and distributors may increase orders during periods of product shortages, cancel orders if their inventory is too high or delay orders in anticipation of new products. distributors also may adjust their orders in response to the supply of our products and the products of our competitors and seasonal fluctuations in end-user demand. our reliance upon indirect distribution methods, including a multi-tiered channel, may reduce our visibility into inventories, demand and pricing trends and issues, and therefore make forecasting more difficult. sales of our products by channel partners to unauthorized resellers or unauthorized resale of our products could also make our forecasting more difficult and impact pricing in the market. if we have excess or obsolete inventory, we may have to reduce our prices and write down inventory. moreover, our use of indirect distribution channels may limit our willingness or ability to adjust prices quickly and otherwise to respond to pricing changes by competitors. in addition, factors in different markets may cause differential discounting between the geographies where our products are sold, which makes it difficult to achieve global consistency in pricing and creates the opportunity for grey marketing.
our uneven sales cycle makes planning and inventory management difficult and future financial results less predictable.
our quarterly sales often have reflected a pattern in which a disproportionate percentage of each quarter's total sales occurs towards the end of the quarter. this uneven sales pattern makes predicting net revenue, earnings, cash flow from operations and working capital for each financial period difficult, increases the risk of unanticipated variations in our quarterly results and financial condition and places pressure on our inventory management and logistics systems. if predicted demand is substantially greater than orders, there may be excess inventory. alternatively, if orders substantially exceed predicted demand, we may not be able to fulfill all of the orders received in each quarter and such orders may be canceled by the customer. depending on when they occur in a quarter, developments such as a systems failure, component pricing movements, component shortages or global logistics disruptions could adversely impact our inventory levels and results of operations in a manner that is disproportionate to the number of days in the quarter affected.
we experience some seasonal trends in the sale of our products that also may produce variations in our quarterly results and financial condition. for example, sales to governments (particularly sales to the u.s. government) are often stronger in the third calendar quarter, and many customers whose fiscal year is the calendar year spend their remaining capital budget authorizations in the fourth calendar quarter prior to new budget constraints in the first calendar quarter of the following year. consumer sales are often higher in the fourth calendar quarter compared to other quarters due in part to seasonal holiday demand. european sales are often weaker during the summer months. demand during the spring and early summer also may be adversely impacted by market anticipation of seasonal trends. moreover, to the extent that we introduce new products in anticipation of seasonal demand trends, our discounting of existing products may adversely affect our gross margin prior to or shortly after such product launches. typically, our fourth fiscal quarter is our strongest by revenues. many of the factors that create and affect seasonal trends are beyond our control.
any failure by us to identify, manage and complete acquisitions, divestitures and other significant transactions successfully could harm our financial results, business and prospects.
as part of our business strategy, we may acquire companies or businesses, divest businesses or assets, enter into strategic alliances and joint ventures and make investments to further our business (collectively, "business combination and investment transactions"). risks associated with business combination and investment transactions include the following, any of which could adversely affect our revenue, gross margin, profitability and financial results:
•   managing business combination and investment transactions requires varying levels of management resources, which may divert our attention from other business operations.
•   we may not fully realize all of the anticipated benefits of any particular business combination and investment transaction, and the timeframe for realizing the benefits of a particular business combination and investment transaction may depend partially upon the actions of employees, advisors, suppliers, other third-parties or market trends.
•   certain prior business combination and investment transactions resulted, and in the future any such transactions may result, in significant costs and expenses, including those related to severance pay, early retirement costs, employee benefit costs, goodwill and asset impairment charges, charges from the elimination of duplicative facilities and contracts, asset impairment charges, inventory adjustments, assumed litigation and other liabilities, legal, accounting and financial advisory fees, and required payments to executive officers and key employees under retention plans.
•   any increased or unexpected costs, unanticipated delays or failures to meet contractual obligations could make business combination and investment transactions less profitable than anticipated or unprofitable.
•   our ability to conduct due diligence with respect to business combination and investment transactions, and our ability to evaluate the results of such due diligence, is dependent upon the veracity and completeness of statements and disclosures made or actions taken by third parties or their representatives.
•   our due diligence process may fail to identify significant issues with the acquired company's product quality, financial disclosures, accounting practices or internal controls.
•   the pricing and other terms of our contracts for business combination and investment transactions require us to make estimates and assumptions at the time we enter into these contracts, and, during the course of our due diligence, we may not identify all of the factors necessary to estimate accurately our costs, timing and other matters or we may incur costs if a business combination and investment transaction is not consummated.
•   in order to complete a business combination and investment transaction, we may issue common stock, potentially creating dilution for our existing stockholders.
•   we may borrow to finance business combination and investment transactions, and the amount and terms of any potential acquisition-related or other borrowings, as well as other factors, could affect our liquidity and financial condition.
•   our effective tax rate on an ongoing basis is uncertain, and business combination and investment transactions could adversely impact our effective tax rate.
•   any announced business combination and investment transaction may not close on the expected timeframe or at all, which may cause our financial results to differ from expectations in a given quarter.
•   business combination and investment transactions may lead to litigation, which could impact our financial condition and results of operations.
•   if we fail to identify and successfully complete and integrate business combination and investment transactions that further our strategic objectives, we may be required to expend resources to develop products, services and technology internally, which may put us at a competitive disadvantage.
we have incurred and will incur additional depreciation and amortization expense over the useful lives of certain assets acquired in connection with business combination and investment transactions, and, to the extent that the value of goodwill, tangible or intangible assets acquired in connection with a business combination and investment transaction becomes impaired, we may be required to incur additional material charges relating to the impairment of those assets. if there are future decreases in our stock price or significant changes in the business climate or results of operations of our reporting units, we may incur additional charges, which may include impairment charges.
as part of our business strategy, we regularly evaluate the potential disposition of assets and businesses that may no longer help us meet our objectives. when we decide to sell assets or a business, we may encounter difficulty in finding buyers or alternative exit strategies on acceptable terms in a timely manner, which could delay the achievement of our strategic objectives. we may also dispose of a business at a price or on terms that are less desirable than we had anticipated. in addition, we may experience greater dis-synergies than expected, and the impact of the divestiture on our revenue growth may be larger than projected. after reaching an agreement with a buyer or seller for the acquisition or disposition of a business, we are subject to satisfaction of pre-closing conditions as well as necessary regulatory and governmental approvals on acceptable terms, which, if not satisfied or obtained, may prevent us from completing the transaction. such regulatory and governmental approvals may be required in diverse jurisdictions around the world, including jurisdictions with opaque regulatory frameworks, and any delays in the timing of such approvals could materially delay the transaction or prevent it from closing.
integrating acquisitions may be difficult and time-consuming. any failure by us to integrate acquired companies, products or services into our overall business in a timely manner could harm our financial results, business and prospects.
in order to pursue our strategy successfully, we must identify candidates for and successfully complete business combination and investment transactions, some of which may be large or complex, and manage post-closing issues such as the integration of acquired businesses, products, services or employees. integration issues are often time-consuming and expensive and, without proper planning and implementation, could significantly disrupt our business and the acquired business. the challenges involved in integration include:
•   successfully combining product and service offerings and entering or expanding into markets in which we are not experienced or are developing expertise;
•   convincing both our customers and distributors and those of the acquired business that the transaction will not diminish client service standards or business focus;
•   persuading both our customers and distributors and those of the acquired business not to defer purchasing decisions or switch to other suppliers (which could result in our incurring additional obligations in order to address customer uncertainty), minimizing sales force attrition and expanding and coordinating sales, marketing and distribution efforts;
•   consolidating and rationalizing corporate it infrastructure, which may include multiple legacy systems from various acquisitions and integrating software code and business processes;
•   minimizing the diversion of management attention from ongoing business concerns;
•   persuading employees that business cultures are compatible, maintaining employee morale and retaining key employees, engaging with employee works councils representing an acquired company's non-u.s. employees, integrating employees, correctly estimating employee benefit costs and implementing restructuring programs;
•   coordinating and combining administrative, manufacturing, research and development and other operations, subsidiaries, facilities and relationships with third-parties in accordance with local laws and other obligations while maintaining adequate standards, controls and procedures;
•   managing integration issues shortly after or pending the completion of other independent transactions.
we may not achieve some or all of the expected benefits of our restructuring plan and our restructuring may adversely affect our business.
we have undertaken and may undertake in the future restructuring plans in order to realign our cost structure due to the changing nature of our business and to achieve operating efficiencies that we expect to reduce costs, including the plans announced in october 2016, which we amended in may 2018, and the plan announced in october 2019. we began implementing the 2020 restructuring plan in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019 and expect to complete the restructuring by the end of fiscal 2022. implementation of any restructuring plan may be costly and disruptive to our business, and we may not be able to obtain the estimated workforce reductions within the projected timing or at all, or the cost savings and benefits that were initially anticipated in connection with our restructuring. additionally, as a result of restructuring initiatives, we may experience a loss of continuity, loss of accumulated knowledge and/or inefficiency, adverse effects on employee morale, loss of key employees and/or other retention issues during transitional periods. reorganization and restructuring can require a significant amount of management and other employees' time and focus, which may divert attention from operating and growing our business. if we fail to achieve some or all of the expected benefits of restructuring, it could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position, business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. for more information about our restructuring plans, see note 3 to our consolidated financial statements in item 8.
our financial performance may suffer if we cannot continue to develop, license or enforce the intellectual property rights on which our businesses depend.
we rely upon patent, copyright, trademark, trade secret and other intellectual property ("ip") laws in the united states, similar laws in other countries, and agreements with our employees, customers, suppliers and other parties, to establish and maintain ip rights in the products and services we sell, provide or otherwise use in our operations. however, any of our ip rights could be challenged, invalidated, infringed or circumvented, or such ip rights may not be sufficient to permit us to take advantage of current market trends or to otherwise provide competitive advantages, either of which could result in costly product redesign efforts, discontinuance of certain product offerings or other harm to our competitive position. for example, our enforcement of our ip rights of our inkjet printer supplies against infringers may be successfully challenged or our ip rights may be successfully circumvented. further, the laws of certain countries do not protect proprietary rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states. therefore, in certain jurisdictions we may be unable to protect our proprietary technology adequately against unauthorized third-party copying or use; this, too, could adversely affect our ability to sell products or services and our competitive position.
our products and services depend in part on ip and technology licensed from third parties.
some of our business and some of our products rely on key technologies developed or licensed by third parties. we may not be able to obtain or continue to obtain licenses and technologies from these third parties at all or on reasonable terms, or such third parties may demand cross-licenses to our ip. third-party components may become obsolete, defective or incompatible with future versions of our products, or our relationship with the third party may deteriorate, or our agreements with the third party may expire or be terminated. we may face legal or business disputes with licensors that may threaten or lead to the disruption of inbound licensing relationships. in order to remain in compliance with the terms of our licenses, we must carefully monitor and manage our use of third-party components, including both proprietary and open source license terms that may require the licensing or public disclosure of our ip without compensation or on undesirable terms. additionally, some of these licenses may not be available to us in the future on terms that are acceptable or that allow our product offerings to remain competitive. our inability to obtain licenses or rights on favorable terms could have a material effect on our business, including our financial condition and results of operations. in addition, it is possible that as a consequence of a merger or acquisition, third parties may obtain licenses to some of our ip rights or our business may be subject to certain restrictions that were not in place prior to such transaction. because the availability and cost of licenses from third parties depends upon the willingness of third parties to deal with us on the terms we request, there is a risk that third parties who license to our competitors will either refuse to license to us at all or refuse to license to us on terms equally favorable to those granted to our competitors. consequently, we may lose a competitive advantage with respect to these ip rights or we may be required to enter into costly arrangements in order to terminate or limit these rights. finally, we may rely on third-parties to enforce certain ip rights. for instance, we rely on canon to enforce ip rights associated with certain laserjet products.  failure by canon to do so could impair our ability to protect our market share for those products.
third-party claims of ip infringement are commonplace in our industry and successful third-party claims may limit or disrupt our ability to sell our products and services.
third parties also may claim that we or customers indemnified by us are infringing upon their ip rights. for example, patent assertion entities may purchase ip assets for the purpose of asserting claims of infringement and attempting to extract settlements from companies such as us and our customers. if we cannot or do not license allegedly infringed ip at all or on reasonable terms, or if we are required to substitute similar technology from another source, our operations could be adversely affected. even if we believe that ip claims are without merit, they can be time-consuming and costly to defend against and may divert management's attention and resources away from our business. claims of ip infringement also might require us to redesign affected products, enter into costly settlement or license agreements, pay costly damage awards, or face a temporary or permanent injunction prohibiting us from importing, marketing or selling certain of our products. even if we have an agreement to indemnify us against such costs, the indemnifying party may be unable or unwilling to uphold its contractual obligations to us. additionally, claims of ip infringement may adversely impact our brand and reputation and imperil new and existing customer relationships.
further, our results of operations and cash flows have been and could continue to be affected in certain periods and on an ongoing basis by the imposition, accrual and payment of copyright levies or similar fees. in certain countries (primarily in europe), proceedings are ongoing or have been concluded in which groups representing copyright owners have sought or are seeking to impose upon and collect from us levies upon it equipment (such as pcs, multifunction devices and printers) alleged to be copying devices under applicable laws. other such groups have also sought to modify existing levy schemes to increase the amount of the levies that can be collected from us. other countries that have not imposed levies on these types of devices are expected to extend existing levy schemes, and countries that do not currently have levy schemes may decide to impose copyright levies on these types of devices. the total amount of the copyright levies will depend on the types of products determined to be subject to the levy, the number of units of those products sold during the period covered by the levy, and the per unit fee for each type of product, all of which are affected by several factors, including the outcome of ongoing litigation involving us and other industry participants and possible action by the legislative bodies in the applicable countries, and could be substantial. consequently, the ultimate impact of these copyright levies or similar fees, and our ability to recover such amounts through increased prices, remains uncertain.
system security risks, data protection breaches, cyberattacks, system outages and systems integration issues could disrupt our internal operations or services provided to customers, and any such disruption could reduce our revenue, increase our expenses, damage our reputation and adversely affect our stock price.
individuals or organizations, including malicious computer programmers and hackers, state-sponsored organizations or nation-states, may be able to penetrate our network security and misappropriate or compromise our confidential information or that of third parties, create system disruptions or cause shutdowns. such individuals or organizations also may be able to develop and deploy viruses, worms, ransomware and other malicious software programs that attack our products or otherwise exploit any security vulnerabilities of our products, or attempt to fraudulently induce our employees, customers, or others to disclose passwords or other sensitive information or unwittingly provide access to our systems or data. in addition, sophisticated hardware and operating system software and applications that we produce or procure from third parties may contain defects in design or manufacture, including "bugs" and other problems that could unexpectedly interfere with the operation of the system. breaches of our facilities, network, or data security could disrupt the security of our systems and business applications, impair our ability to provide services to our customers and protect the privacy of their data, result in product development delays, compromise confidential or technical business information harming our reputation or competitive position, result in theft or misuse of our ip or other assets, require us to allocate more resources to improved technologies, or otherwise adversely affect our business. additionally, the costs to us to eliminate or alleviate cyber or other security problems, including bugs, viruses, worms, malicious software programs and other security vulnerabilities, could be significant, and our efforts to address these problems may not be successful and could result in interruptions, delays, cessation of service and loss of existing or potential customers that may impede our sales, manufacturing, distribution or other critical functions. media or other reports of perceived security vulnerabilities in our network security, even if nothing has actually been attempted or occurred, could also adversely impact our brand and reputation and materially affect our business. while we have developed and implemented security measures and internal controls designed to protect against cyber and other security problems, such measures cannot provide absolute security and may not be successful in preventing future security breaches. moreover, these threats are constantly evolving, thereby increasing the difficulty of successfully defending against them or implementing adequate preventative measures. in some instances, we may have no current capability to detect certain vulnerabilities, which may allow them to persist in the environment over long periods of time. in the past, we have experienced data security incidents resulting from unauthorized use of our systems or those of third parties, which to date have not had a material impact on our operations; however, there is no assurance that such impacts will not be material in the future.
we manage and store various proprietary information and sensitive or confidential data relating to our business and our customers. breaches of our security measures or the accidental loss, inadvertent disclosure or unapproved dissemination of proprietary information or sensitive or confidential data about us, our clients or our customers, including the potential loss or disclosure of such information or data as a result of fraud, trickery or other forms of deception, could expose us, our customers or the individuals affected to a risk of loss or misuse of this information, damage our brand and reputation or otherwise harm our business, and result in government enforcement actions and litigation and potential liability for us. for example, the gdpr imposes a strict data protection compliance regime with severe penalties of up to the greater of 4% of worldwide annual turnover and/or €20 million. we also could lose existing or potential customers or incur significant expenses in connection with our customers' system failures or any actual or perceived security vulnerabilities in our products and services. in addition, the cost and operational consequences of implementing further data protection measures could be significant.
portions of our it infrastructure, including portions provided by third parties, also may experience interruptions, outages, delays or cessations of service or may produce errors in connection with systems integrations, migration work or other causes from time to time. any such events could result in business disruptions and the process of remediating them could be more expensive, time-consuming, disruptive and resource intensive than planned. such disruptions could adversely impact our ability to fulfill orders and respond to customer requests and interrupt other processes. delayed sales, lower margins or lost customers resulting from these disruptions could reduce our revenue, increase our expenses, damage our reputation and adversely affect our stock price.
our business and financial performance could suffer if we do not manage the risks associated with our services businesses properly.
the risks that accompany our services businesses differ from those of our other businesses. for example, the success of our services business depends to a significant degree on attracting clients to our services, retaining these clients and maintaining or increasing the level of revenues from these clients. our standard services agreements are generally renewable at a customer's option and/or subject to cancellation rights, with penalties for early termination. we may not be able to retain or renew services contracts with our clients, or our clients may reduce the scope of the services they contract for. factors that may influence contract termination, non-renewal or reduction include business downturns, dissatisfaction with our services or products attached to services we provide, our retirement or lack of support for our services, our clients selecting alternative technologies to replace us, the cost of our services as compared to the cost of services offered by our competitors, general market conditions or other reasons. we may not be able to replace the revenue and earnings from lost clients or reductions in services. while our services agreements typically include penalties for early termination, these penalties may not fully cover our investments in these businesses in the event a client terminates a services agreement early or reduces the scope of the agreement. our clients could also delay or terminate implementations or use of our services or choose not to invest in additional services from us in the future. in addition, the pricing and other terms of some of our services agreements require us to make estimates and assumptions at the time we enter into these contracts that could differ from actual results. any increased or unexpected costs or unanticipated delays in connection with the performance of these engagements, including delays caused by factors outside our control, could make these agreements less profitable or unprofitable, which could have an adverse effect on the product margin of our services business. as a result, we may not generate the revenues we may have anticipated from our services businesses within the timelines anticipated, if at all.
in order to be successful, we must attract, retain, train, motivate, develop and transition key employees, and failure to do so could seriously harm us.
in order to be successful, we must attract, be able to hire, retain, train, motivate, develop, transition and deploy qualified executives and other key employees, including those in managerial, technical, development, sales, marketing and it support positions. identifying, developing internally or hiring externally, training and retaining qualified executives, engineers and qualified sales representatives are critical to our future, and competition for experienced employees in the it industry can be intense. in order to attract and retain executives and other key employees in a competitive marketplace, we must provide a competitive compensation package, including cash- and equity-based compensation. our equity-based incentive awards may contain conditions relating to our stock price performance and our long-term financial performance that make the future value of those awards uncertain. if the anticipated value of such equity-based incentive awards does not materialize, if our equity-based compensation otherwise ceases to be viewed as a valuable benefit, if our total compensation package is not viewed as being competitive, or if we do not obtain the stockholder approval needed to continue granting equity-based incentive awards in the amounts we believe are necessary, our ability to attract, retain and motivate executives and key employees could be weakened. our failure to successfully hire executives and key employees or the loss of any executives and key employees could have a significant impact on our operations. further, changes in our management team may be disruptive to our business, and any failure to successfully transition and assimilate key new hires or promoted employees could adversely affect our business and results of operations.
recent global, regional and local economic weakness and uncertainty could adversely affect our business and financial performance.
our business and financial performance depend significantly on worldwide economic conditions and the demand for technology products and services in the markets in which we compete. recent economic weakness and uncertainty in various markets throughout the world have resulted, and may result in the future, in decreased net revenue, gross margin, earnings or growth rates and in increased expenses and difficulty in managing inventory levels. for example, we have in the past experienced the impacts of macroeconomic weakness across many geographic regions and markets, and we may experience similar impacts in the future. ongoing u.s. federal government spending limits may continue to reduce demand for our products and services from organizations that receive funding from the u.s. government, and could negatively affect macroeconomic conditions in the united states, which could further reduce demand for our products and services. political developments impacting international trade, including continued uncertainty surrounding brexit, trade disputes and increased tariffs, particularly between the united states and china, may negatively impact markets and cause weaker macroeconomic conditions or drive political or national sentiment, weakening demand for our products and services.
economic weakness and uncertainty and political or nationalist sentiment impacting global trade, including the willingness of non-u.s. consumers to purchase goods or services from u.s. corporations, may adversely affect demand for our products and services, may result in increased expenses due to higher allowances for doubtful accounts and potential goodwill and asset impairment charges, and may make it more difficult for us to accurately forecast revenue, gross margin, cash flows and expenses.
we also have experienced, and may experience in the future, gross margin declines in certain businesses, reflecting the effect of items such as competitive pricing pressures and increases in component and manufacturing costs resulting from higher labor and material costs borne by our manufacturers and suppliers that, as a result of competitive pricing pressures or other factors, we are unable to pass on to our customers. in addition, our business may be disrupted if we are unable to obtain equipment, parts or components from our suppliers-and our suppliers from their suppliers-due to the insolvency of key suppliers or the inability of key suppliers to obtain credit, or if any of our distributors, including wholesale and retail distributors, lack sufficient financial resources to withstand economic weakness.
economic weakness and uncertainty could cause our expenses to vary materially from our expectations. any financial turmoil affecting the banking system and financial markets or any significant financial services institution failures could negatively impact our treasury operations, as the financial condition of such parties may deteriorate rapidly and without notice in times of market volatility and disruption. poor financial performance of asset markets combined with lower interest rates and the adverse effects of fluctuating currency exchange rates could lead to higher pension and post-retirement benefit expenses. interest and other expenses could vary materially from expectations depending on changes in interest rates, borrowing costs, currency exchange rates, costs of hedging activities and the fair value of derivative instruments. economic downturns also may lead to future restructuring actions and associated expenses.
due to the international nature of our business, political or economic changes, uncertainty or other factors could harm our business and financial performance.
approximately 65% of our net revenue for fiscal year 2019 came from outside the united states. in addition, a portion of our business activity is being conducted in emerging markets. our future business and financial performance could suffer due to a variety of international factors, including:
•   ongoing instability or changes in a country's or region's economic, regulatory or political conditions, including inflation, recession, interest rate fluctuations, changes or uncertainty in fiscal or monetary policy and actual or anticipated military or political conflicts or any other change resulting from brexit;
•   longer collection cycles and financial instability among customers, the imposition by governments of additional taxes, tariffs or other restrictions on foreign trade or changes in restrictions on trade between the united states and other countries, including the impact of recently imposed tariffs between the united states and china on a wide variety of products;
•   trade regulations and procedures and actions affecting production, shipping, pricing and marketing of products, including policies adopted by the united states or other countries that may champion or otherwise favor domestic companies and technologies over foreign competitors;
•   political or nationalist sentiment impacting global trade, including the willingness of non-u.s. consumers to purchase goods or services from u.s. corporations;
•   local labor conditions and regulations, including local labor issues faced by specific suppliers and original equipment manufacturers ("oems"), or changes to immigration and labor law which may adversely impact our access to technical and professional talent;
•   changes or uncertainty in the international, national or local regulatory and legal environments;
•   differing technology standards or customer requirements;
•   import, export or other business licensing requirements or requirements relating to making foreign direct investments, which could increase our cost of doing business in certain jurisdictions, prevent us from shipping products to particular countries or markets, affect our ability to obtain favorable terms for components, increase our operating costs or lead to penalties or restrictions;
•   changes in tax laws; and
•   fluctuations in freight costs, limitations on shipping and receiving capacity, and other disruptions in the transportation and shipping infrastructure at important geographic points of exit and entry for our products and shipments.
the factors described above also could disrupt our product and component manufacturing and key suppliers located outside of the united states. for example, we rely on manufacturers in taiwan for the production of notebook computers and other suppliers in asia for product assembly and manufacture.
beginning in 2018, the united states commenced certain trade actions, including imposing tariffs on certain goods imported from china and other countries, which has resulted in retaliatory tariffs by china and other countries. additional tariffs imposed by the united states on a broader range of imports, or further retaliatory trade measures taken by china or other countries in response, could increase the cost of our products and the components that go into making them. these increased costs could adversely impact our overall gross margin and profitability. tariffs could also make our products more expensive for customers, which could make our products less competitive and reduce demand.
in many foreign countries, particularly in those with developing economies, there are companies that engage in business practices prohibited by laws and regulations applicable to us, such as the foreign corrupt practices act of 1977, as amended (the "fcpa"). although we implement policies, procedures and training designed to facilitate compliance with these laws, our employees, contractors and agents, as well as those of the companies to which we outsource certain of our business operations, may take actions in violation of our policies. any such violation, even if prohibited by our policies, could have an adverse effect on our business and reputation.
we are exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, which could adversely impact our results.
currencies other than the u.s. dollar, including the euro, the british pound, chinese yuan (renminbi) and the japanese yen, can have an impact on our results as expressed in u.s. dollars. global economic events, including trade disputes, economic sanctions and emerging market volatility, and associated uncertainty may cause currencies to fluctuate, which may contribute to variations in our sales of products and services in impacted jurisdictions. for example, the united kingdom's june 2016 vote to leave the european union (commonly known as "brexit") caused significant volatility in currency exchange rates, especially between the u.s. dollar and the british pound. continued uncertainty regarding brexit may result in future exchange rate volatility. in addition, in the event that one or more european countries were to replace the euro with another currency, our sales into such countries, or into europe generally, would likely be adversely affected until stable exchange rates are established. because a majority of our revenues are generated outside the united states, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, such as the strengthening of the u.s. dollar against the euro or the british pound or the weakness of the japanese yen, could adversely affect our net revenue growth in future periods. in addition, currency variations can adversely affect margins on sales of our products in countries outside of the united states and products that include components obtained from suppliers located outside of the united states.
from time to time, we may use forward contracts and options designated as cash flow hedges to protect against foreign currency exchange rate risks. the effectiveness of our hedges depends on our ability to accurately forecast future cash flows, which is particularly difficult during periods of uncertain demand for our products and services and highly volatile exchange rates. we may incur significant losses from our hedging activities due to factors such as demand volatility. in addition, certain or all of our hedging activities may be ineffective or may not offset any or more than a portion of the adverse financial impact resulting from currency variations. losses associated with hedging activities also may impact our revenue, financial condition and, to a lesser extent, our cost of sales.
business disruptions could seriously harm our future revenue and financial condition and increase our costs and expenses.
our worldwide operations could be disrupted by earthquakes, telecommunications failures, power or water shortages, tsunamis, floods, hurricanes, typhoons, fires, extreme weather conditions (whether as a result of climate change or otherwise), medical epidemics or pandemics and other natural or manmade disasters or catastrophic events, for which we are predominantly self-insured. the occurrence of any of these business disruptions could result in significant losses, seriously harm our revenue, profitability and financial condition, adversely affect our competitive position, increase our costs and expenses, and require substantial expenditures and recovery time in order to fully resume operations. in addition, global climate change may result in certain natural disasters occurring more frequently or with greater intensity, such as drought, wildfires, storms, sea-level rise, and flooding. our corporate headquarters and a portion of our research and development activities are located in california, and other critical business operations and some of our suppliers are located in california and asia, near major earthquake faults known for seismic activity. the manufacture of product components, the final assembly of our products and other critical operations are concentrated in certain geographic locations. we also rely on major logistics hubs primarily in asia to manufacture and distribute our products, and primarily in the southwestern united states to import products into north and south america. our operations and those of our significant suppliers and distributors could be adversely affected if manufacturing, logistics or other operations in these locations are disrupted for any reason, such as those listed above or other economic, business, labor, environmental, public health, regulatory or political issues. the ultimate impact on us, our significant suppliers, our distributors and our general infrastructure of being located near locations more vulnerable to the occurrence of the aforementioned business disruptions, such as near major earthquake faults, and being consolidated in certain geographical areas is unknown and remains uncertain. even if our operations are unaffected or recover quickly, if our customers cannot timely resume their own operations due to a catastrophic event, they may reduce or cancel their orders, which may adversely affect our results of operations.
terrorist acts, conflicts, wars and geopolitical uncertainties may seriously harm our business and revenue, costs and expenses and financial condition and stock price.
terrorist acts, conflicts or wars (wherever located around the world) may cause damage or disruption to our business, our employees, facilities, partners, suppliers, distributors, resellers or customers or adversely affect our ability to manage logistics, operate our transportation and communication systems or conduct certain other critical business operations. the potential for future attacks, the national and international responses to attacks or perceived threats to national security, and other actual or potential conflicts or wars have created many economic and political uncertainties. in addition, as a major multinational company with headquarters and significant operations located in the united states, actions against or by the united states may impact our business or employees. although it is impossible to predict the occurrences or consequences of any such events, if they occur, they could result in a decrease in demand for our products, make it difficult or impossible to provide services or deliver products to our customers or to receive components from our suppliers, create delays and inefficiencies in our supply chain and result in the need to impose employee travel restrictions. we are predominantly uninsured for losses and interruptions caused by terrorist acts, conflicts and wars.
failure to comply with our customer contracts or government contracting regulations could adversely affect our business and results of operations.
our contracts with our customers may include unique and specialized performance requirements. in particular, our contracts with federal, state, provincial and local governmental customers are subject to various procurement regulations, contract provisions and other requirements relating to their formation, administration and performance. any failure by us to comply with the specific provisions in our customer contracts or any violation of government contracting regulations could result in the imposition of various civil and criminal penalties, which may include termination of contracts, forfeiture of profits, suspension of payments and, in the case of our government contracts, fines and suspension from future government contracting. such failures could also cause reputational damage to our business. in addition, hewlett-packard company has in the past been, and we may in the future be, subject to qui tam litigation brought by private individuals on behalf of the government relating to our government contracts, which could include claims for treble damages. further, any negative publicity related to our customer contracts or any proceedings surrounding them, regardless of its accuracy, may damage our business by affecting our ability to compete for new contracts. if our customer contracts are terminated, if we are suspended or disbarred from government work, or if our ability to compete for new contracts is adversely affected, our financial performance could suffer.
unanticipated changes in our tax provisions, the adoption of new tax legislation or exposure to additional tax liabilities could affect our financial performance.
we are subject to income and other taxes in the united states and various foreign jurisdictions. our tax liabilities are affected by the amounts we charge in intercompany transactions for inventory, services, licenses, funding and other items. we are subject to ongoing tax audits in various jurisdictions. tax authorities may disagree with these intercompany transactions or other matters and may assess additional taxes or adjust taxable income on our tax returns as a result. we regularly assess the likely outcomes of these audits in order to determine the appropriateness of our tax provision. however, we cannot assure you that we will accurately predict the outcomes of these audits, and the amounts ultimately paid upon resolution of audits could be materially different from the amounts previously included in our income tax expense and therefore could have a material impact on our tax provision, net income and cash flows.
our effective tax rate in the future could be adversely affected by changes to our operating structure, changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities or changes in tax laws or in their interpretation or enforcement. in addition, tax legislation has been introduced or is being considered in various jurisdictions that could significantly impact our tax rate, the carrying value of deferred tax assets, or our deferred tax liabilities. for example, the organization for economic cooperation and development (the "oecd") has recently recommended changes to numerous long-standing international tax principles. if countries amend their tax laws to adopt certain parts of the oecd guidelines, this may increase tax uncertainty and may adversely impact our tax liabilities.  any of these changes could affect our financial performance.
our business is subject to various federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations that could result in costs or other sanctions that adversely affect our business and results of operations.
we are subject to various federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations. there can be no assurance that such laws and regulations will not be changed in ways that will require us to modify our business models and objectives or affect our returns on investments by restricting existing activities and products, subjecting them to escalating costs or prohibiting them outright. for example, we are subject to laws, regulations and standards concerning environmental protection, including laws addressing the discharge of pollutants into the air and water, the management and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes, the clean-up of contaminated sites, the content of our products and the recycling, reuse, treatment and disposal of our products, including print supplies and batteries. in particular, we face increasing complexity in our product design and procurement operations as we adjust to new and future requirements relating to the chemical and materials composition of our products, their safe use, the energy consumption associated with those products, climate change laws and regulations, and product reparability, reuse and take-back legislation. if we were to violate or become liable under environmental laws or if our products become non-compliant with environmental laws, we could incur substantial costs or face other sanctions, which may include restrictions on our products entering certain jurisdictions. our potential exposure includes fines and civil or criminal sanctions, third-party property damage, personal injury claims and clean-up costs. further, liability under some environmental laws relating to contaminated sites can be imposed retroactively, on a joint and several basis, and without any finding of noncompliance or fault. the amount and timing of costs to comply with environmental laws are difficult to predict.
failure to maintain our credit ratings could adversely affect our liquidity, capital position, borrowing costs and access to capital markets.
our credit risk is evaluated by the major independent rating agencies. past downgrades of hewlett-packard company's ratings increased the cost of borrowing under our credit facilities and reduced market capacity for our commercial paper. future downgrades could have the same effects, and could also require the posting of additional collateral under some of our derivative contracts. we cannot be assured that we will be able to maintain our current credit ratings, and any additional actual or anticipated changes or downgrades in our credit ratings, including any announcement that our ratings are under further review for a downgrade, may further impact us in a similar manner and may have a negative impact on our liquidity, capital position and access to capital markets.
our stock price has historically fluctuated and may continue to fluctuate, which may make future prices of our stock difficult to predict.
our stock price, like that of other technology companies, can be volatile. some of the factors that could affect our stock price are:
•   speculation, coverage or sentiment in the media or the investment community about, or actual changes in, our business, strategic position, market share, organizational structure, operations, financial condition, financial reporting and results, effectiveness of cost-cutting efforts, value or liquidity of our investments, exposure to market volatility, prospects, business combination or investment transactions, future stock price performance, board of directors, executive team, our competitors or our industry in general;
•   the announcement of new, planned or contemplated products, services, technological innovations, acquisitions, divestitures or other significant transactions by us or our competitors;
•   quarterly increases or decreases in net revenue, gross margin, earnings or cash flows, changes in estimates by the investment community or our financial outlook and variations between actual and estimated financial results;
•   announcements of actual and anticipated financial results by our competitors and other companies in the it industry;
•   developments relating to pending investigations, claims and disputes;
•   developments relating to the acquisition proposal made to us by xerox holdings corporation; and
•   the timing and amount of our share repurchases.
general or industry-specific market conditions or stock market performance or domestic or international macroeconomic and geopolitical factors unrelated to our performance also may affect the price of our stock. for these reasons, investors should not rely on recent or historical trends to predict future stock prices, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. additional volatility in the price of our securities could result in the filing of securities class action litigation matters, which could result in substantial costs and the diversion of management time and resources.
some anti-takeover provisions contained in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws, as well as provisions of delaware law, could impair a takeover attempt.
we have provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws each of which could have the effect of rendering more difficult or discouraging an acquisition of hp deemed undesirable by our board of directors. these include provisions:
•   limiting the liability of, and providing indemnification to, our directors and officers;
•   specifying that our stockholders may take action only at a duly called annual or special meeting of stockholders and otherwise in accordance with our bylaws and limiting the ability of our stockholders to call special meetings;
•   requiring advance notice of proposals by our stockholders for business to be conducted at stockholder meetings and for nominations of candidates for election to our board of directors; and
•   controlling the procedures for conduct of our board of directors and stockholder meetings and election, appointment and removal of our directors.
these provisions, alone or together, could deter or delay hostile takeovers, proxy contests and changes in control or our management. as a delaware corporation, we are also subject to provisions of delaware law, including section 203 of the delaware general corporation law, which prevents some stockholders from engaging in certain business combinations without approval of the holders of substantially all of our outstanding common stock.
any provision of our certificate of incorporation or bylaws or delaware law that has the effect of delaying or deterring a change in control of hp could limit the opportunity for our stockholders to receive a premium for their shares of our stock and also could affect the price that some investors are willing to pay for our stock.
we make estimates and assumptions in connection with the preparation of our consolidated financial statements, and any changes to those estimates and assumptions could adversely affect our results of operations.
in connection with the preparation of our consolidated financial statements, we use certain estimates and assumptions based on historical experience and other factors. our most critical accounting estimates are described in the section entitled "management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations" in item 7 of this report. for example, we make significant estimates and assumptions when accounting for revenue recognition, taxes on earnings and restructuring and other charges. in addition, as discussed in note 14 to the consolidated financial statements, we make certain estimates, including decisions related to provisions for legal proceedings and other contingencies. while we believe that these estimates and assumptions are reasonable under the circumstances, they are subject to significant uncertainties, some of which are beyond our control. should any of these estimates and assumptions change or prove to have been incorrect, it could adversely affect our results of operations.
risks related to the separation the allocation of ip rights between hewlett packard enterprise and hp as part of the separation, and the shared use of certain ip rights following the separation, could adversely impact our reputation, our ability to enforce certain ip rights that are important to us and our competitive position.
in connection with the separation, hewlett-packard company allocated to each of hewlett packard enterprise and hp the ip assets relevant to their respective businesses. the terms of the separation include cross-licenses and other arrangements to provide for certain ongoing use of ip in the existing operations of both businesses. for example, through a joint brand holding structure, both hewlett packard enterprise and hp will retain the ability to make ongoing use of certain variations of the legacy hewlett-packard and hp branding, respectively. there is a risk that the joint brand holding structure may impair the enforcement of hp's trademark rights against third parties that infringe them. furthermore, as a result of this shared use of the legacy branding, there is a risk that conduct or events adversely affecting the reputation of hewlett packard enterprise could also adversely affect the reputation of hp. in addition, as a result of the allocation of ip as part of the separation, we no longer own ip allocated to hewlett packard enterprise and our resulting ip ownership position could adversely affect our position and options relating to patent enforcement, patent licensing and cross-licensing, our ability to sell our products or services, our competitive position in the industry and our ability to enter new product markets.
we obtained an opinion of outside counsel that, for u.s. federal income tax purposes, the separation qualified, for both the company and our stockholders, as a tax-free reorganization within the meaning of sections 368(d)(1)(d) and 355 of the u.s. internal revenue code of 1986, as amended. in addition, we obtained a private letter ruling from the internal revenue service (the "irs") and opinions of outside counsel regarding certain matters impacting the u.s. federal income tax treatment of the separation for the company and certain related transactions as transactions that are generally tax-free for u.s. federal income tax purposes. the opinions of outside counsel and the irs private letter ruling were based, among other things, on various factual assumptions we have authorized and representations we have made to outside counsel and the irs. if any of these assumptions or representations are, or become, inaccurate or incomplete, reliance on the opinions and irs private letter ruling may be affected. an opinion of outside counsel represents their legal judgment but is not binding on the irs or any court. accordingly, there can be no assurance that the irs will not challenge the conclusions reflected in the opinions or that a court would not sustain such a challenge. if the separation or certain internal transactions undertaken in anticipation of the separation are determined to be taxable for u.s. federal income tax purposes, we and/or our stockholders that are subject to u.s. federal income tax could incur significant u.s. federal income tax liabilities.
we or hewlett packard enterprise may fail to perform under the transaction agreements executed as part of the separation.
in connection with the separation, we and hewlett packard enterprise entered into several agreements, including among others a separation and distribution agreement and an employee matters agreement. the separation and distribution agreement and employee matters agreement determine the allocation of assets and liabilities between the companies following the separation for those respective areas and include any necessary indemnifications related to liabilities and obligations. hewlett packard enterprise has spun off or separated certain of its businesses since the separation, and some of its obligations under these and other agreements have transferred to the successor entities. we will rely on hewlett packard enterprise or its successor entities to satisfy their performance and payment obligations under these agreements. if hewlett packard enterprise or its successor entities has separated are unable to satisfy their obligations under these agreements, we could incur operational difficulties or losses that could have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations.

hp inc. and subsidiaries management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (continued)
overview we are a leading global provider of personal computing and other access devices, imaging and printing products, and related technologies, solutions, and services. we sell to individual consumers, smbs and large enterprises, including customers in the government, health, and education sectors. we have three reportable segments: personal systems, printing and corporate investments. the personal systems segment offers commercial and consumer desktop and notebook pcs, workstations, thin clients, commercial mobility devices, retail pos systems, displays and other related accessories, software, support, and services. the printing segment provides consumer and commercial printer hardware, supplies, solutions and services, as well as scanning devices. corporate investments include hp labs and certain business incubation and investment projects.
•   in personal systems, our strategic focus is on profitable growth through market segmentation with respect to enhanced innovation in multi-operating systems, multi-architecture, geography, customer segments and other key attributes. additionally, we are investing in end point services and solutions. we are focused on services including daas as the market begins to shift to contractual solutions. we believe that we are well positioned due to our competitive product lineup.
•   in printing, our strategic focus is on contractual solutions and graphics, as well as expanding our footprint in the 3d printing and digital manufacturing marketplace. in contractual solutions we have a continued focus on managed print services and instant ink. in graphics, we are focused on innovations such as our indigo and latex product offerings.
we continue to experience challenges that are representative of trends and uncertainties that may affect our business and results of operations. one set of challenges relates to dynamic market trends, such as forecasted declining pc client markets and home printing markets. a second set of challenges relates to changes in the competitive landscape. our primary competitors are exerting competitive pressure in targeted areas and are entering new markets, our emerging competitors are introducing new technologies and business models, and our alliance partners in some businesses are increasingly becoming our competitors in others. a third set of challenges relates to business model changes and our go-to-market execution in an evolving distribution and reseller landscape, with increasing online and omnichannel presence. additional challenges we face at the segment level are set forth below.
•   in personal systems, we face challenges with industry component availability and a competitive pricing environment.
•   in printing, a competitive pricing environment, including from non-original supplies (which includes imitation, refill or remanufactured alternatives), and a weakened market in certain geographies with associated pricing sensitivity of our customers present challenges. we also face challenges in printing due to our multi-tier distribution network, primarily in emea, including limiting grey marketing and the potential misuse of pricing programs. we also obtain many printing components from single sources due to technology, availability, price, quality or other considerations. for instance, we source the majority of our a4 and a portion of our a3 portfolio of laser printer engines and laser toner cartridges from canon. any decision by either party to not renew our agreement with canon or to limit or reduce the scope of the agreement could adversely affect our net revenue from laserjet products; however, we have a long-standing business relationship with canon and anticipate renewal of this agreement.
our business and financial performance also depend significantly on worldwide economic conditions. accordingly, we face global macroeconomic challenges, tariff-driven headwinds, uncertainty in the markets, volatility in exchange rates, weaker macroeconomic conditions and evolving dynamics in the global trade environment. the full impact of these and other global macroeconomic challenges on our business cannot be known at this time.
to address these challenges, we continue to pursue innovation with a view towards developing new products and services aligned with generating market demand and meeting the needs of our customers and partners. in addition, we continue to work on improving our operations and adapting our business models, with a particular focus on enhancing our end-to-end processes, analytics and efficiencies. we also continue to work on optimizing our sales coverage models, aligning our sales incentives with our strategic goals, improving channel execution and inventory management, strengthening our capabilities in our areas of strategic focus, strengthening our pricing discipline, and developing and capitalizing on market opportunities.
specifically, in october 2019, we announced cost-reduction and operational efficiency initiatives intended to simplify the way we work, move closer to our customers and facilitate specific investment in our business. these efforts include transforming our operating model to integrate our sales force into a single commercial organization and reducing structural costs across the company through our restructuring plan approved in september 2019 (the "fiscal 2020 plan"). we expect to invest some of the savings from these efforts across our businesses, including investing to build our digital capabilities. over time, we expect these investments will make us more efficient and allow us to advance our positions in personal systems and printing, while also disrupting new industries where we see attractive medium to long-term growth opportunities. however, the rate at which we are able to invest in our business and the returns that we are able to achieve from these investments will be hp inc. and subsidiaries management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (continued)
affected by many factors, including the efforts to address the execution, industry and macroeconomic challenges facing our business as discussed above. as a result, we may experience delays in the anticipated timing of activities related to these efforts, and the anticipated benefits of these efforts may not materialize.
we typically experience higher net revenues in our fourth quarter compared to other quarters in our fiscal year due in part to seasonal holiday demand. historical seasonal patterns should not be considered reliable indicators of our future net revenues or financial performance.
for a further discussion of trends, uncertainties and other factors that could impact our operating results, see the section entitled "risk factors" in item 1a in this annual report on form 10-k.
critical accounting policies and estimates general the consolidated financial statements of hp are prepared in accordance with united states ("u.s.") generally accepted accounting principles ("gaap"), which require management to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, net revenue and expenses, and the disclosure of contingent liabilities. management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying amount of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. management has discussed the development, selection and disclosure of these estimates with the audit committee of hp's board of directors. management believes that the accounting estimates employed and the resulting amounts are reasonable; however, actual results may differ from these estimates. making estimates and judgments about future events is inherently unpredictable and is subject to significant uncertainties, some of which are beyond our control. should any of these estimates and assumptions change or prove to have been incorrect, it could have a material impact on our results of operations, financial position and cash flows.
a summary of significant accounting policies is included in note 1, "overview and summary of significant accounting policies" to the consolidated financial statements in item 8, which is incorporated herein by reference. an accounting policy is deemed to be critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made, if different estimates reasonably could have been used, or if changes in the estimate that are reasonably possible could materially impact the financial statements. management believes the following critical accounting policies reflect the significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements.
revenue recognition we recognize revenue depicting the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which we are expected to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. we evaluate customers' ability to pay based on various factors like historical payment experience, financial metrics and customer credit scores.
we enter into contracts to sell our products and services, and while many of our sales contracts contain standard terms and conditions, there are contracts which contain non-standard terms and conditions. further, many of our arrangements include multiple performance obligations. as a result, significant contract interpretation may be required to determine the appropriate accounting, including the identification of performance obligations that are distinct, the allocation of the transaction price among performance obligations in the arrangement and the timing of transfer of control of promised goods or services for each of those performance obligations.
we evaluate each performance obligation in an arrangement to determine whether it represents a distinct good or services. a performance obligation constitutes distinct goods or services when the customer can benefit from the goods or services either on its own or together with other resources that are readily available to the customer and the performance obligation is distinct within the context of the contract.
transaction price is the amount of consideration to which we expect to be entitled in exchange for transferring goods or services to the customer. if the transaction price includes a variable amount, we estimate the amount using either the expected value or most likely amount method. we reduce the transaction price at the time of revenue recognition for customer and distributor programs and incentive offerings, rebates, promotions, other volume-based incentives and expected returns. we use estimates to determine the expected variable consideration for such programs based on historical experience, expected consumer behavior and market conditions.
when a sales arrangement contains multiple performance obligations, such as hardware and/or services, we allocate revenue to each performance obligation in proportion to their selling price. the selling price for each performance obligation is based on its standalone selling price ("ssp"). we establish ssp using the price charged for a performance obligation when sold hp inc. and subsidiaries management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (continued)
separately ("observable price") and, in some instances, using the price established by management having the relevant authority. when observable price is not available, we establish ssp based on management's judgment considering internal factors such as margin objectives, pricing practices and controls, customer segment pricing strategies and the product life-cycle. consideration is also given to market conditions such as competitor pricing strategies and technology industry life cycles. we may modify or develop new go-to-market practices in the future, which may result in changes in selling prices, impacting standalone selling price determination applying the aforementioned management judgments and estimates. this may change the pattern and timing of revenue recognition for identical arrangements executed in future periods but will not change the total revenue recognized for any given arrangement. in most arrangements with multiple performance obligations, the transaction price is allocated to each performance obligation at the inception of the arrangement based on their relative selling price.
revenue is recognized when, or as, a performance obligation is satisfied by transferring control of a promised good or service to a customer. we generally invoice the customer upon delivery of the goods or services and the payments are due as per contract terms. for fixed price support or maintenance and other service contracts that are in the nature of stand-ready obligations, payments are generally received in advance from customers and revenue is recognized on a straight-line basis over the duration of the contract. in instances when revenue is derived from sales of third-party vendor products or services, we record revenue on a gross basis when we are a principal in the transaction and on a net basis when we are acting as an agent between the customer and the vendor. we consider several factors to determine whether we are acting as a principal or an agent, most notably whether we are the primary obligor to the customer, have established our own pricing and have inventory and credit risks.
warranty we accrue the estimated cost of product warranties at the time we recognize revenue. we evaluate our warranty obligations on a product group basis. our standard product warranty terms generally include post-sales support and repairs or replacement of a product at no additional charge for a specified period. while we engage in extensive product quality programs and processes, including actively monitoring and evaluating the quality of our component suppliers, we base our estimated warranty obligation on contractual warranty terms, repair costs, product call rates, average cost per call, current period product shipments and ongoing product failure rates, as well as specific product class failure outside of our baseline experience. warranty terms generally range from 90 days to three years for parts, labor and onsite services, depending upon the product. over the last three fiscal years, the annual warranty expense and actual warranty costs have averaged approximately 1.8% of annual net revenue.
restructuring and other charges we have engaged in restructuring actions which require management to estimate the timing and amount of severance and other employee separation costs for workforce reduction and enhanced early retirement programs, fair value of assets made redundant or obsolete, and the fair value of lease cancellation and other exit costs. we accrue for severance and other employee separation costs under these actions when it is probable that benefits will be paid and the amount is reasonably estimable. the rates used in determining severance accruals are based on existing plans, historical experiences and negotiated settlements. other charges include non-recurring costs that are distinct from ongoing operational costs incurred in connection with the separation or information technology rationalization efforts. for a full description of our restructuring actions, refer to our discussions of restructuring in "results of operations" below and in note 3, "restructuring and other charges" to the consolidated financial statements in item 8, which are incorporated herein by reference.
retirement and post-retirement benefits our pension and other post-retirement benefit costs and obligations depend on various assumptions. our major assumptions relate primarily to discount rates, mortality rates, expected increases in compensation levels and the expected long-term return on plan assets. the discount rate assumption is based on current investment yields of high-quality fixed-income securities with maturities similar to the expected benefits payment period. mortality rates help predict the expected life of plan participants and are based on a historical demographic study of the plan. the expected increase in the compensation levels assumption reflects our long-term actual experience and future expectations. the expected long-term return on plan assets is determined based on asset allocations, historical portfolio results, historical asset correlations and management's expected returns for each asset class. we evaluate our expected return assumptions annually including reviewing current capital market assumptions to assess the reasonableness of the expected long-term return on plan assets. we update the expected long-term return on assets when we observe a sufficient level of evidence that would suggest the long-term expected return has changed. in any fiscal year, significant differences may arise between the actual return and the expected long-term return on plan assets. historically, differences between the actual return and expected long-term return on plan assets have resulted from changes in target or actual asset allocation, short-term performance relative to expected long-term performance, and to a lesser extent, differences between target and actual investment allocations, the timing of benefit payments compared to expectations, and the use of derivatives intended to effect asset allocation changes or hedge certain investment or liability exposures. for the hp inc. and subsidiaries management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (continued)
recognition of net periodic benefit cost, the calculation of the expected long-term return on plan assets uses the fair value of plan assets as of the beginning of the fiscal year unless updated as a result of interim re-measurement.
our major assumptions vary by plan, and the weighted-average rates used are set forth in note 4, "retirement and post-retirement benefit plans" to the consolidated financial statements in item 8, which is incorporated herein by reference. the following table provides the impact a change of 25 basis points in each of the weighted-average assumptions of the discount rate, expected increase in compensation levels and expected long-term return on plan assets would have had on our net periodic benefit cost for fiscal year 2019:
change in net periodicbenefit cost in millions assumptions:
expected increase in compensation levels                                  $2
taxes on earnings the tax cuts and jobs act ("tcja") made significant changes to the u.s. tax law. the tcja lowered our u.s. statutory federal income tax rate from 35% to 21% effective january 1, 2018, while also imposing a one-time transition tax on accumulated foreign earnings.
in december 2017, the sec staff issued sab no. 118, which allows registrants to record provisional amounts during a one year "measurement period". in january 2019, we completed our accounting for the tax effects of the tcja with no material changes to the provisional amounts recorded during the measurement period.
in january 2018, the fasb released guidance on the accounting for tax on the global minimum tax provisions of tcja. the global minimum tax provisions impose a tax on foreign income in excess of a deemed return on tangible assets of foreign corporations. we have elected to treat the global minimum tax inclusions as period costs.
as a result of certain employment actions and capital investments we have undertaken, income from manufacturing activities in certain jurisdictions is subject to reduced tax rates and, in some cases, is wholly exempt from taxes for fiscal years through 2027.
material changes in our estimates of cash, working capital and long-term investment requirements in the various jurisdictions in which we do business could impact how future earnings are repatriated to the united states, and our related future effective tax rate. the effects of the tcja related to these policies are referenced and discussed in detail in note 6, "taxes on earnings" to the consolidated financial statements in item 8, which is incorporated herein by reference.
we calculate our current and deferred tax provisions based on estimates and assumptions that could differ from the final positions reflected in our income tax returns. we adjust our current and deferred tax provisions based on income tax returns which are generally filed in the third or fourth quarters of the subsequent fiscal year.
we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected tax consequences of temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which we expect the differences to reverse.
we record a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that we are more likely than not to realize. in determining the need for a valuation allowance, we consider future market growth, forecasted earnings, future taxable income, the mix of earnings in the jurisdictions in which we operate and prudent and feasible tax planning strategies. in the event we were to determine that it is more likely than not that we will be unable to realize all or part of our deferred tax assets in the future, we would increase the valuation allowance and recognize a corresponding charge to earnings or other comprehensive income in the period in which we make such a determination. likewise, if we later determine that we are more likely than not to realize the deferred tax assets, we would reverse the applicable portion of the previously recognized valuation allowance. in order for us to realize our deferred tax assets, we must be able to generate sufficient taxable income in the jurisdictions in which the deferred tax assets are located.
we are subject to income taxes in the united states and approximately 58 other countries, and we are subject to routine corporate income tax audits in many of these jurisdictions. we believe that positions taken on our tax returns are fully supported, but tax authorities may challenge these positions, which may not be fully sustained on examination by the relevant tax authorities. accordingly, our income tax provision includes amounts intended to satisfy assessments that may result from these challenges. determining the income tax provision for these potential assessments and recording the related effects hp inc. and subsidiaries management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (continued)
requires management judgments and estimates. the amounts ultimately paid on resolution of an audit could be materially different from the amounts previously included in our income tax provision and, therefore, could have a material impact on our income tax provision, net income and cash flows. our accrual for uncertain tax positions is attributable primarily to uncertainties concerning the tax treatment of our domestic operations, including the allocation of income among different jurisdictions, intercompany transactions, pension and related interest. for a further discussion on taxes on earnings, refer to note 6, "taxes on earnings" to the consolidated financial statements in item 8, which is incorporated herein by reference.
inventory we state our inventory at the lower of cost or market on a first-in, first-out basis. we make adjustments to reduce the cost of inventory to its net realizable value at the product group level for estimated excess or obsolescence. factors influencing these adjustments include changes in demand, technological changes, product life cycle and development plans, component cost trends, product pricing, physical deterioration and quality issues.
business combinations we allocate the fair value of purchase consideration to the assets acquired, liabilities assumed, and non-controlling interests in the acquiree generally based on their fair values at the acquisition date. the excess of the fair value of purchase consideration over the fair value of these assets acquired, liabilities assumed and non-controlling interests in the acquiree is recorded as goodwill and may involve engaging independent third-parties to perform an appraisal. when determining the fair values of assets acquired, liabilities assumed, and non-controlling interests in the acquiree, management makes significant estimates and assumptions, especially with respect to intangible assets.
critical estimates in valuing intangible assets include, but are not limited to, expected future cash flows, which includes consideration of future growth rates and margins, attrition rates, future changes in technology and brand awareness, loyalty and position, and discount rates. fair value estimates are based on the assumptions management believes a market participant would use in pricing the asset or liability. amounts recorded in a business combination may change during the measurement period, which is a period not to exceed one year from the date of acquisition, as additional information about conditions existing at the acquisition date becomes available.
goodwill we review goodwill for impairment annually during our fourth quarter and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of goodwill may not be recoverable. we can elect to perform a qualitative assessment to test a reporting unit's goodwill for impairment or perform a quantitative impairment test. based on a qualitative assessment, if we determine that the fair value of a reporting unit is more likely than not (i.e., a likelihood of more than 50 percent) to be less than its carrying amount, the quantitative impairment test will be performed.
in the quantitative impairment test, we compare the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying amount with the fair values derived most significantly from the income approach, and to a lesser extent, the market approach. under the income approach, we estimate the fair value of a reporting unit based on the present value of estimated future cash flows. we base cash flow projections on management's estimates of revenue growth rates and operating margins, taking into consideration industry and market conditions. we base the discount rate on the weighted-average cost of capital adjusted for the relevant risk associated with business-specific characteristics and the uncertainty related to the reporting unit's ability to execute on the projected cash flows. under the market approach, we estimate fair value based on market multiples of revenue and earnings derived from comparable publicly-traded companies with similar operating and investment characteristics as the reporting unit. we weight the fair value derived from the market approach depending on the level of comparability of these publicly-traded companies to the reporting unit. when market comparables are not meaningful or not available, we estimate the fair value of a reporting unit using only the income approach.
if the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds the carrying amount of the net assets assigned to that reporting unit, goodwill is not impaired. if the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, goodwill is impaired and the excess of the reporting unit's carrying value over the fair value is recognized as an impairment loss.
our annual goodwill impairment analysis, performed using the qualitative assessment option as of the first day of the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2019, resulted in a conclusion that it was more likely than not that the fair value of our reporting units exceeded their respective carrying values. as a result, we concluded that a quantitative impairment test was not necessary.
fair value of derivative instruments we use derivative instruments to manage a variety of risks, including risks related to foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates and existing assets and liabilities. we use forwards, swaps and at times, options to hedge certain foreign currency, interest rate and, return on certain investments exposures. we do not use derivative instruments for speculative purposes. as of october 31, 2019, the gross notional value of our derivative portfolio was $24 billion. assets and liabilities related to derivative instruments are measured at fair value and were $392 million and $166 million, respectively, as of october 31, 2019.
hp inc. and subsidiaries management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (continued)
fair value is the price we would receive to sell an asset or pay to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. in the absence of active markets for the identical assets or liabilities, such measurements involve developing assumptions based on market observable data and, in the absence of such data, internal information that is consistent with what market participants would use in a hypothetical transaction that occurs at the measurement date. the determination of fair value often involves significant judgments about assumptions such as determining an appropriate discount rate that factors in both risk and liquidity premiums, identifying the similarities and differences in market transactions, weighting those differences accordingly and then making the appropriate adjustments to those market transactions to reflect the risks specific to the asset or liability being valued. we generally use industry standard valuation models to measure the fair value of our derivative positions. when prices in active markets are not available for the identical asset or liability, we use industry standard valuation models to measure fair value. where applicable, these models project future cash flows and discount the future amounts to present value using market-based observable inputs, including interest rate curves, hp and counterparty credit risk, foreign currency exchange rates, and forward and spot prices.
for a further discussion on fair value measurements and derivative instruments, refer to note 9, "fair value" and note 10, "financial instruments", respectively, to the consolidated financial statements in item 8, which are incorporated herein by reference.
loss contingencies we are involved in various lawsuits, claims, investigations and proceedings including those consisting of intellectual property ("ip"), commercial, securities, employment, employee benefits and environmental matters that arise in the ordinary course of business. we record a liability when we believe that it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. significant judgment is required to determine both the probability of having incurred a liability and the estimated amount of the liability. we review these matters at least quarterly and adjust these liabilities to reflect the impact of negotiations, settlements, rulings, advice of legal counsel and other updated information and events, pertaining to a particular case. pursuant to the separation and distribution agreement, we share responsibility with hewlett packard enterprise for certain matters, as discussed in note 14, "litigation and contingencies" to the consolidated financial statements in item 8, which is incorporated herein by reference, and hewlett packard enterprise has agreed to indemnify us in whole or in part with respect to certain matters. based on our experience, we believe that any damage amounts claimed in the specific litigation and contingencies matters further discussed in note 14, "litigation and contingencies", are not a meaningful indicator of hp's potential liability. litigation is inherently unpredictable. however, we believe we have valid defenses with respect to legal matters pending against us. nevertheless, cash flows or results of operations could be materially affected in any particular period by the resolution of one or more of these contingencies. we believe we have recorded adequate provisions for any such matters and, as of october 31, 2019, it was not reasonably possible that a material loss had been incurred in excess of the amounts recognized in our financial statements.
recent accounting pronouncements for a summary of recent accounting pronouncements applicable to our consolidated financial statements see note 1, "overview and summary of significant accounting policies" to the consolidated financial statements in item 8, which is incorporated herein by reference.
results of operations revenue from our international operations has historically represented, and we expect will continue to represent, a majority of our overall net revenue. as a result, our net revenue growth has been impacted, and we expect it will continue to be impacted, by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. in order to provide a framework for assessing performance excluding the impact of foreign currency fluctuations, we supplement the year-over-year percentage change in net revenue with the year-over-year percentage change in net revenue on a constant currency basis, which excludes the effect of foreign currency exchange fluctuations calculated by translating current period revenues using monthly average exchange rates from the comparative period and hedging activities from the prior-year period and does not adjust for any repricing or demand impacts from changes in foreign currency exchange rates. this information is provided so that net revenue can be viewed with and without the effect of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, which is consistent with how management evaluates our net revenue results and trends, as management does not believe that the excluded items are reflective of ongoing operating results. the constant currency measures are provided in addition to, and not as a substitute for, the year-over-year percentage change in net revenue on a gaap basis. other companies may calculate and define similarly labeled items differently, which may limit the usefulness of this measure for comparative purposes.

net revenue in fiscal year 2019, total net revenue increased 0.5% (increased 2.0% on a constant currency basis) as compared to the prior-year period. net revenue from the united states remained flat at $20.6 billion and net revenue from outside of the united states increased 0.7% to $38.2 billion. the increase in net revenue was primarily driven by growth in notebooks, desktops and workstations in personal systems, partially offset by unfavorable foreign currency impacts and a decline in printing supplies.
in fiscal year 2018, total net revenue increased 12.3% (increased 10.1% on a constant currency basis) as compared to the prior-year period. net revenue from the united states increased 6.6% to $20.6 billion and net revenue from outside of the united states increased 15.7% to $37.9 billion. the increase in net revenue was primarily driven by growth in notebooks, desktops, supplies, commercial printing hardware revenue and favorable foreign currency impacts.
a detailed discussion of the factors contributing to the changes in segment net revenue is included under "segment information" below.
gross margin our gross margin was 19.0% for fiscal year 2019 compared with 18.2% for fiscal year 2018. the increase was primarily due to higher rate in personal systems driven by lower supply chain costs.
our gross margin was 18.2% for fiscal year 2018 compared with 18.4% for fiscal year 2017. the decrease was primarily due to higher commercial hardware unit placements in printing and an increase in commodity and logistics costs in personal systems, partially offset by higher pricing in personal systems and favorable foreign currency impacts.
a detailed discussion of the factors contributing to the changes in segment gross margins is included under "segment information" below.
operating expenses research and development ("r&d")
r&d expense increased 7% in fiscal year 2019 compared to the prior-year period, primarily due to continuing investments in innovation and key growth initiatives.
r&d expense increased 18% in fiscal year 2018 compared to the prior-year period, primarily due to continuing investment in printing, including the acquisition of samsung's printer business.
hp inc. and subsidiaries management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (continued)
sg&a expense increased 5% in fiscal year 2019 as compared to the prior-year period, primarily driven by increased investments in key growth initiatives and go-to-market in personal systems and investment in digital infrastructure.
sg&a expense increased 13% in fiscal year 2018 as compared to the prior-year period, primarily driven by incremental go-to-market investments to support revenue growth, including the acquisition of samsung's printer business.
acquisition-related charges acquisition-related charges for the fiscal years 2019, 2018 and 2017 relate primarily to third-party professional and legal fees, and integration-related costs, as well as fair value adjustments of certain acquired assets such as inventory.
amortization of intangible assets amortization expense increased by $36 million in fiscal year 2019 compared to the prior-year period, due to intangible assets resulting primarily from the acquisition of the apogee group.
amortization expense increased by $79 million in fiscal year 2018 compared to the prior-year period, due to intangible assets resulting primarily from the acquisition of samsung's printer business.
interest and other, net interest and other, net expense increased by $536 million in fiscal year 2019 compared to the prior-year period, primarily due to tax indemnifications related to the termination of the tax matters agreement ("tma") with hewlett packard enterprise during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2019.
interest and other, net expense increased by $726 million in fiscal year 2018 compared to the prior-year period, primarily due to the reversal of indemnification receivables from hewlett packard enterprise pertaining to various income tax audit settlements, and loss on extinguishment of debt.
benefit from (provision for) taxes our effective tax rates were (24.9%), (76.8%) and 22.9% in fiscal years 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. in fiscal year 2019, our effective tax rate generally differs from the u.s. federal statutory rate of 21% primarily due to the resolution of various audits, changes in valuation allowances, and impacts of u.s. tax reform. in fiscal year 2018, our effective tax rate generally differs from the u.s. federal statutory rate of 23.3% primarily due to transitional impacts of u.s. tax reform and resolution of various audits and tax litigation. in fiscal year 2017, our effective tax rate generally differs from the u.s. federal statutory rate of 35% due to favorable tax rates associated with certain earnings in lower-tax jurisdictions throughout the world. the jurisdictions with favorable tax rates that had the most significant impact on our effective tax rate in the periods presented were puerto rico, singapore, china, malaysia and ireland. additionally, the overall effective tax rate in fiscal year 2017 was impacted by adjustments to valuation allowances and state income taxes.
for a reconciliation of our effective tax rate to the u.s. federal statutory rate of 21%, 23.3% and 35% in fiscal years 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively, and further explanation of our provision for income taxes, see note 6, "taxes on earnings" to the consolidated financial statements in item 8, which is incorporated herein by reference.

in fiscal year 2018, we recorded $2.8 billion of net income tax benefit related to discrete items in the provision for taxes which include impacts of the tcja. as discussed in the note 6 "taxes on earnings" to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report, we had not yet completed our analysis of the full impact of the tcja. however, as of october 31, 2018, we recorded a provisional tax benefit of $760 million related to $5.6 billion net benefit for the decrease in our deferred tax liability on unremitted foreign earnings, partially offset by $3.3 billion net expense for the deemed repatriation tax payable in installments over eight years, a $1.2 billion net expense for the remeasurement of our deferred assets and liabilities to the new u.s. statutory tax rate and a $317 million net expense related to realization on u.s. deferred taxes that are expected to be hp inc. and subsidiaries management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (continued)
realized at a lower rate. fiscal year 2018 also included tax benefits related to audit settlements of $1.5 billion and valuation allowance releases of $601 million pertaining to a change in our ability to utilize certain foreign and u.s. deferred tax assets due to a change in our geographic earnings mix. these benefits were partially offset by other net tax charges of $34 million. in fiscal year 2018, in addition to the discrete items mentioned above, we recorded excess tax benefits of $42 million associated with stock options, restricted stock units and performance-adjusted restricted stock units.

segment information a description of the products and services for each segment can be found in note 2, "segment information," to the consolidated financial statements in item 8, which is incorporated herein by reference. future changes to this organizational structure may result in changes to the segments disclosed.
realignment effective at the beginning of its first quarter of fiscal year 2019, we implemented an organizational change to align our business unit financial reporting more closely with our current business structure. the organizational change resulted in the transfer of certain samsung-branded product categories from commercial to consumer within the printing segment. we reflected this change to our business unit information in prior reporting periods on an as-if basis. the reporting change had no impact to previously reported segment net revenue, consolidated net revenue, earnings from operations, net earnings or net earnings per share ("eps").

liquidity and capital resources we use cash generated by operations as our primary source of liquidity. we believe that internally generated cash flows are generally sufficient to support our operating businesses, capital expenditures, acquisitions, restructuring activities, maturing debt, income tax payments and the payment of stockholder dividends, in addition to investments and share repurchases. we are able to supplement this short-term liquidity, if necessary, with broad access to capital markets and credit facilities made available by various domestic and foreign financial institutions. while our access to capital markets may be constrained and our cost of borrowing may increase under certain business, market and economic conditions, our access to a variety of funding sources to meet our liquidity needs is designed to facilitate continued access to capital resources under all such conditions. our liquidity is subject to various risks including the risks identified in the section entitled "risk factors" in item 1a and market risks identified in the section entitled "quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk" in item 7a, which are incorporated herein by reference.
our cash and cash equivalents balances are held in numerous locations throughout the world, with the majority of those amounts held outside of the united states. we utilize a variety of planning and financing strategies in an effort to ensure that our worldwide cash is available when and where it is needed. our cash position remains strong, and we expect that our cash balances, anticipated cash flow generated from operations and access to capital markets will be sufficient to cover our expected near-term cash outlays.
amounts held outside of the united states are generally utilized to support non-u.s. liquidity needs and may from time to time be distributed to the united states. the tcja made significant changes to the u.s. tax law, including a one-time transition tax on accumulated foreign earnings. the payments associated with this one-time transition tax will be paid over eight years and began in fiscal year 2019. we expect a significant portion of the cash and cash equivalents held by our foreign subsidiaries hp inc. and subsidiaries management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (continued)
will no longer be subject to u.s. income tax consequences upon a subsequent repatriation to the united states as a result of the transition tax on accumulated foreign earnings. however, a portion of this cash may still be subject to foreign income tax or withholding tax consequences upon repatriation. as we evaluate the future cash needs of our operations, we may revise the amount of foreign earnings considered to be permanently reinvested in our foreign subsidiaries and how to utilize such funds, including reducing our gross debt level, or other uses.
liquidity our cash and cash equivalents, marketable debt securities and total debt were as follows:
as of october 31
marketable debt securities(1)   $-                   $0.7              $1.1
(1)   includes highly liquid u.s. treasury notes, u.s. agency securities, non-u.s. government bonds, corporate debt securities, money market and other funds. we classify these investments within other current assets in consolidated balance sheets, including those with maturity dates beyond one year, based on their highly liquid nature and availability for use in current operations.

net cash provided by operating activities increased by $0.9 billion for fiscal year 2018 as compared to fiscal year 2017. the increase was primarily due to higher earnings from operations and cash generated from working capital management activities.
working capital metrics management utilizes current cash conversion cycle information to manage our working capital level. the table below presents the cash conversion cycle:
as of october 31
days of sales outstanding in accounts receivable ("dso")      35               30               29
days of supply in inventory ("dos")                           41               43               46
days of purchases outstanding in accounts payable ("dpo")   (107   )         (105   )         (105   )
the cash conversion cycle is the sum of days of dso and dos less dpo. items which may cause the cash conversion cycle in a particular period to differ from a long-term sustainable rate include, but are not limited to, changes in business mix, changes in payment terms, extent of receivables factoring, seasonal trends and the timing of revenue recognition and inventory purchases within the period.
dso measures the average number of days our receivables are outstanding. dso is calculated by dividing ending accounts receivable, net of allowance for doubtful accounts, by a 90-day average of net revenue. for fiscal years 2019 and
hp inc. and subsidiaries management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (continued)
dos measures the average number of days from procurement to sale of our product. dos is calculated by dividing ending inventory by a 90-day average of cost of goods sold. for fiscal year 2019, the decrease in dos compared to fiscal year 2018 was primarily due to reduction in inventory driven by reclassification of certain balances to other current assets pursuant to adoption of the new revenue standard in the first quarter of fiscal 2019. for fiscal year 2018, the dos was lower primarily due to a focus on inventory management.
dpo measures the average number of days our accounts payable balances are outstanding. dpo is calculated by dividing ending accounts payable by a 90-day average of cost of goods sold. for fiscal year 2019, the increase in dpo compared to fiscal year 2018 was higher primarily due to working capital management activities, partially offset by lower inventory purchasing volume. for fiscal year 2018, the dpo remained flat compared to fiscal year 2017.
net cash used in investing activities decreased by $1.0 billion for fiscal year 2018 as compared to fiscal year 2017, primarily due to a decrease in investments classified as available-for-sale investments within other current assets by $1.6 billion, and collateral related to our derivatives of $0.4 billion, partially offset by the payment of $1.0 billion for the acquisition of samsung's printer business.
financing activities net cash used in financing activities decreased by $0.8 billion in fiscal year 2019 compared to fiscal year 2018, primarily due to lower payment of debt of $1.5 billion, partially offset by a decrease in outstanding commercial paper amounts of $0.7 billion.
net cash used in financing activities increased by $4.4 billion in fiscal year 2018 compared to fiscal year 2017, primarily due to the payment to repurchase approximately $1.85 billion of debt, higher share repurchase amount of $1.1 billion and higher outstanding commercial paper of $0.9 billion in fiscal year 2017.
capital resources debt levels as of october 31
we maintain debt levels that we establish through consideration of a number of factors, including cash flow expectations, cash requirements for operations, investment plans (including acquisitions), share repurchase activities, our cost of capital and targeted capital structure.
short-term debt decreased by $1.1 billion for fiscal year 2019 as compared to fiscal year 2018, primarily due to a decrease in outstanding commercial paper amounts of $0.9 billion.
long-term debt decreased by $2.2 billion for fiscal year 2018 as compared to fiscal year 2017 primarily due to the payment to repurchase approximately $1.85 billion in aggregate principal amount of u.s. dollar global notes.
our debt-to-equity ratio is calculated as the carrying amount of debt divided by total stockholders' deficit. our debt-to-equity ratio changed by 5.1x in fiscal year 2019 compared to fiscal year 2018, primarily due to an increase in stockholders' deficit balance of $0.6 billion.
our debt-to-equity ratio changed by 7.1x in fiscal year 2018 compared to fiscal year 2017, primarily due to a decrease in stockholders' deficit balance of $2.8 billion.
our weighted-average interest rate reflects the effective interest rate on our borrowings prevailing during the period and reflects the effect of interest rate swaps. for more information on our interest rate swaps, see note 10, "financial instruments" in the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto in item 8, "financial statements and supplementary data".

available borrowing resources we had the following resources available to obtain short or long-term financing:
as of october 31, 2019
2016 shelf registration statement   unspecified uncommitted lines of credit         $724
as of october 31, 2019, we maintain a senior unsecured committed revolving credit facility with aggregate lending commitments of $4.0 billion, that will be available until march 30, 2023 and is primarily to support the issuance of commercial paper. funds borrowed under this revolving credit facility may also be used for general corporate purposes.
for more information on our borrowings, see note 11, "borrowings", to the consolidated financial statements in item 8, which is incorporated herein by reference.
credit ratings our credit risk is evaluated by major independent rating agencies based upon publicly available information as well as information obtained in our ongoing discussions with them. while we do not have any rating downgrade triggers that would accelerate the maturity of a material amount of our debt, previous downgrades have increased the cost of borrowing under our credit facility, have reduced market capacity for our commercial paper and have required the posting of additional collateral under some of our derivative contracts. in addition, any further downgrade to our credit ratings by any rating agencies may further impact us in a similar manner, and, depending on the extent of any such downgrade, could have a negative impact on our liquidity and capital position. we can access alternative sources of funding, including drawdowns under our credit facility, if necessary, to offset potential reductions in the market capacity for our commercial paper.

contractual and other obligations our contractual and other obligations as of october 31, 2019, were as follows:
operating lease obligations(4)       1,340                   284                    399                   262         395

(1)   amounts represent the principal cash payments relating to our short-term and long-term debt and do not include any fair value adjustments, discounts or premiums.
(2)   amounts represent the expected interest payments relating to our short-term and long-term debt. we have outstanding interest rate swap agreements accounted for as fair value hedges that have the economic effect of changing fixed interest rates associated with some of our u.s. dollar global notes to variable interest rates. the impact of our outstanding interest rate swaps at october 31, 2019 was factored into the calculation of the future interest payments on debt.
(3)   purchase obligations include agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding on us and that specify all significant terms, including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed, minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. these purchase obligations are related principally to inventory and other items. purchase obligations exclude agreements that are cancelable without penalty. purchase obligations also exclude open purchase orders that are routine arrangements entered into in the ordinary course of business as they are difficult to quantify in a meaningful way. even though open purchase orders are considered enforceable and legally binding, the terms generally allow us the option to cancel, reschedule, and adjust terms based on our business needs prior to the delivery of goods or performance of services.
(4)   amounts represent the operating lease obligations, net of total sublease income of $130 million.
(5)   amounts represent the capital lease obligations, including total capital lease interest obligations of $64 million.
(6)   retirement and post-retirement benefit plan contributions. in fiscal year 2020, we expect to contribute approximately $76 million to non-u.s. pension plans, $36 million to cover benefit payments to u.s. non-qualified plan participants and $6 million to cover benefit claims for our post-retirement benefit plans. our policy is to fund our pension plans so that we meet at least the minimum contribution required by local government, funding and taxing authorities. expected contributions and payments to our pension and post-retirement benefit plans are excluded from the contractual obligations table because they do not represent contractual cash outflows as they are dependent on numerous factors which may result in a wide range of outcomes. for more information on our retirement and post-retirement benefit plans, see note 4, "retirement and post-retirement benefit plans", to the consolidated financial statements in item 8, which is incorporated herein by reference.
(7)   cost savings plans. as a result of our approved restructuring plans, including the fiscal 2020 plan, we expect to make future cash payments of approximately $1.0 billion. we expect to make future cash payments of $418 million in fiscal year 2020 with remaining cash payments through fiscal year 2023. these payments have been excluded from the contractual obligations table because they do not represent contractual cash outflows and there is uncertainty as to the timing of these payments. for more information on our restructuring activities that are part of our cost improvements, see note 3, "restructuring and other charges", to the consolidated financial statements in item 8, which is incorporated herein by reference.
(8)   uncertain tax positions. as of october 31, 2019, we had approximately $509 million of recorded liabilities and related interest and penalties pertaining to uncertain tax positions. we are unable to make a reasonable estimate as to when cash settlement with the tax authorities might occur due to the uncertainties related to these tax matters. payments of these obligations would result from settlements with taxing authorities. for more information on our uncertain tax positions, see note 6, "taxes on earnings", to the consolidated financial statements in item 8, which is incorporated herein by reference.
hp inc. and subsidiaries management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (continued)
(9)   payment of one-time transition taxes under the tcja. the tcja made significant changes to u.s. tax law resulting in a one-time gross transition tax of $3.0 billion on accumulated foreign earnings. we expect the actual cash payments for the tax to be much lower as we expect to reduce the overall liability by more than half once existing and future credits and other balance sheet tax attributes are used. the payments associated with this one-time transition tax will be paid over eight years and began in fiscal year 2019.
off-balance sheet arrangements as part of our ongoing business, we have not participated in transactions that generate material relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities, which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes.
we have third-party short-term financing arrangements intended to facilitate the working capital requirements of certain customers. for more information on our third-party short-term financing arrangements, see note 7 "supplementary financial information" to the consolidated financial statements in item 8, which is incorporated herein by reference.

item 1a. risk factors cautionary statement about forward-looking statements we describe many of the trends and other factors that drive our business and future results in item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and in other parts of this report (including this item 1a). such discussions contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of section 21e of the securities exchange act of 1934. forward-looking statements are those that address activities, events or developments that management intends, expects, projects, believes or anticipates will or may occur in the future. they are based on management's assumptions and assessments in light of past experience and trends, current economic and industry conditions, expected future developments and other relevant factors. they are not guarantees of future performance, and actual results, developments and business decisions may differ significantly from those envisaged by our forward-looking statements. we do not undertake to update or revise any of our forward-looking statements. our forward-looking statements are also subject to risks and uncertainties that can affect our performance in both the near- and long-term. these forward-looking statements should be considered in light of the information included in this form 10-k, including, in particular, the factors discussed below. these factors may be revised or supplemented in subsequent reports on forms 10-q and 8-k.
risk factors our business, operating results, cash flows and financial condition are subject to the principal risks and uncertainties set forth below, any one of which could cause our actual results to vary materially from recent results or from our anticipated future results.
macroeconomic and industry risks each of our businesses is subject to unique industry and economic conditions that may adversely affect the markets and operating conditions of our customers, which in turn can affect demand for our products and services and our results of operations.
•   aerospace-our aerospace business is impacted by customer buying patterns of aftermarket parts, supplier stability, factory transitions and global supply chain capacity constraints that may lead to shortages of crucial components. operating results may be adversely affected by downturns in the global demand for air travel which impacts new aircraft production or the delay or cancellation of new aircraft orders, delays in launch schedules for new aircraft, the retirement of aircraft and global flying hours, which impact air transport, regional, business and general aviation aircraft utilization rates. operating results may be adversely affected by the decrease in air travel demand due to regional restrictions or suspension of service for public health, safety, or environmental events. operating results could also be impacted by changes in overall trends related to end market demand for the product portfolio, as well as, new entrants and non-traditional players entering the market. operating results in our defense and space business unit may be affected by the mix of u.s. and foreign government appropriations for defense and space programs and by compliance risks. results may also be impacted by the potential introduction of counterfeit parts into our global supply chain.
•   honeywell building technologies-operating results may be adversely impacted by downturns in the level of global commercial construction activity (including retrofits and upgrades), lower capital spending and operating expenditures on building projects, less industrial plant expansion, changes in the competitive landscape including new market entrants and new technologies, and fluctuations in inventory levels in distribution channels.
•   performance materials and technologies-operating results may be adversely impacted by downturns in capacity utilization for chemical, industrial, refining, petrochemical and semiconductor plants, our customers' availability of capital for refinery construction and expansion, raw material demand and supply volatility, product commoditization, continued illegal imports of hydrofluorocarbons into europe and our ability to maximize our facilities' production capacity and minimize downtime. in particular, the volatility in oil and natural gas prices have and will continue to impact our customers' operating levels and capital spending and thus demand for our products and services.
•   safety and productivity solutions-operating results may be adversely impacted by reduced investments in process automation, safety monitoring, and plant capacity utilization initiatives, fluctuations in retail markets, lower customer demand due to the failure to anticipate and respond to overall trends related to end market demand, changes in the competitive landscape including new market entrants and technology that may lead to product commoditization, and adverse industry economic conditions, all of which could result in lower market share, reduced selling prices and lower margins.
an increasing percentage of our sales and operations is in non-u.s. jurisdictions and is subject to the economic, political, regulatory, foreign exchange and other risks of international operations.
our international operations, including u.s. exports, represent more than half of the company's sales. risks related to international operations include exchange control regulations, wage and price controls, antitrust regulations, employment regulations, foreign investment laws, import, export and other trade restrictions (such as sanctions and embargoes), differing levels of protection of intellectual property, acts of industrial espionage, violations by our employees of anti-corruption laws (despite our efforts to mitigate these risks), changes in regulations regarding transactions with state-owned enterprises, nationalization of private enterprises, acts of terrorism, and our ability to hire and maintain qualified staff and maintain the safety of our employees in these regions. instability and uncertainties arising from the global geopolitical environment, and the evolving international and domestic political, regulatory and economic landscape, the potential for changes in global trade policies including sanctions and trade barriers, trends such as populism, economic nationalism and negative sentiment toward multinational companies, and the cost of compliance with increasingly complex and often conflicting regulations worldwide can impair our flexibility in modifying product, marketing, pricing or other strategies for growing our businesses, as well as our ability to improve productivity and maintain acceptable operating margins.
while there is uncertainty regarding the final outcome and full terms of the united kingdom's future relationship with the european union, it is possible that there will be greater restrictions on imports and exports between the united kingdom and other countries, including the united states, increased tariffs on u.k. imports and exports, and increased regulatory complexities. the company has developed plans to mitigate the potential impact of these possible restrictions, but the implications of these uncertainties could affect the company's business, financial position and results of operations.
existing free trade laws and regulations provide certain beneficial duties and tariffs for qualifying imports and exports. changes in laws or policies governing the terms of foreign trade, and in particular increased trade restrictions, tariffs or taxes on imports from countries where we manufacture products or from where we import products or raw materials, either directly or through our suppliers, could have an impact on our competitive position and financial results.
the united states has commenced certain trade actions, including imposing tariffs on certain goods imported from china and other countries, which has resulted in retaliatory tariffs by china and other countries. additional tariffs imposed by the united states on a broader range of imports, or further retaliatory trade measures taken by china or other countries in response, could increase the cost of our products.
operating outside of the united states also exposes us to foreign exchange risk, which we monitor and seek to reduce through hedging activities. however, foreign exchange hedging activities bear a financial cost and may not always be available to us or be successful in eliminating such volatility. finally, we generate significant amounts of cash outside of the united states that is invested with financial and non-financial counterparties. while we employ comprehensive controls regarding global cash management to guard against cash or investment loss and to ensure our ability to fund our operations and commitments, a material disruption to the counterparties with whom we transact business could expose honeywell to financial loss.
operating outside the united states also exposes us to additional intellectual property risk. the laws and enforcement practices of certain jurisdictions in which we operate may not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as in the u.s. and may impose joint venture, technology transfer, local service or other foreign investment requirements and restrictions that potentially compromise control over our technology and proprietary information. failure of foreign jurisdictions to protect our intellectual property rights, an inability to effectively enforce such rights in foreign jurisdictions, or the imposition of foreign jurisdiction investment or sourcing restrictions or requirements could result in loss of valuable proprietary information and could impact our competitive position and financial results.
risks related to our defined benefit pension plans may adversely impact our results of operations and cash flow.
significant changes in actual investment return on pension assets, discount rates, and other factors could adversely affect our results of operations and require cash pension contributions in future periods. changes in discount rates and actual asset returns different than our anticipated asset returns can result in significant non-cash actuarial gains or losses which we record in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year, and, if applicable, in any quarter in which an interim re-measurement is triggered. with regard to cash pension contributions, funding requirements for our pension plans are largely dependent upon interest rates, actual investment returns on pension assets and the impact of legislative or regulatory changes related to pension funding obligations.
we may be required to transition from the use of the libor interest rate index in the future.
we have certain contracts indexed to libor to calculate the interest rate. the continued availability of the libor index is not guaranteed after 2021. we cannot predict whether and to what extent banks will continue to provide libor submissions to the administrator of libor or whether any additional reforms to libor may be enacted. the language in certain of our libor-based contracts identify various events that trigger when a successor rate to the designated rate would be selected. if a trigger is satisfied, such contracts may give the calculation agent discretion over the substitute index or indices for the calculation of interest rates to be selected. the implementation of a substitute index or indices for the calculation of interest rates under our contracts may result in our incurring significant expenses in effecting the transition and may result in disputes or litigation over the appropriateness or comparability to libor of the substitute index or indices, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations.
operational risks raw material price fluctuations, the ability of key suppliers to meet quality and delivery requirements, or catastrophic events can increase the cost of our products and services, impact our ability to meet commitments to customers and cause us to incur significant liabilities.
the cost of raw materials is a key element in the cost of our products, particularly in performance materials and technologies (copper, fluorspar, tungsten salts, ethylene, aluminum, and molybdenum) and in aerospace (nickel, steel, titanium and other metals). our inability to offset material price inflation through increased prices to customers, formula or long-term fixed price contracts with suppliers, productivity actions or through commodity hedges could adversely affect our results of operations.
many major components, product equipment items and raw materials, particularly in aerospace, are procured or subcontracted on a single or sole-source basis. although we maintain a qualification and performance surveillance process and we believe that sources of supply for raw materials and components are generally adequate, it is difficult to predict what effects shortages or price increases may have in the future. our ability to manage inventory and meet delivery requirements may be constrained by our suppliers' inability to scale production and adjust delivery of long-lead time products during times of volatile demand. our inability to fill our supply needs would jeopardize our ability to fulfill obligations under commercial and government contracts, which could, in turn, result in reduced sales and profits, contract penalties or terminations, and damage to customer relationships.
we may be unable to successfully execute or effectively integrate acquisitions, and divestitures may not occur as planned.
we regularly review our portfolio of businesses and pursue growth through acquisitions and seek to divest non-core businesses. we may not be able to complete transactions on favorable terms, on a timely basis, or at all. in addition, our results of operations and cash flows may be adversely impacted by (i) the failure of acquired businesses to meet or exceed expected returns, including risk of impairment; (ii) the failure to integrate multiple acquired businesses into honeywell simultaneously and on schedule and/or to achieve expected synergies; (iii) the inability to dispose of non-core assets and businesses on satisfactory terms and conditions; and (iv) the discovery of unanticipated liabilities, labor relations difficulties, cybersecurity concerns, compliance issues or other problems in acquired businesses for which we lack contractual protections, insurance or indemnities, or with regard to divested businesses, claims by purchasers to whom we have provided contractual indemnification.
our future growth is largely dependent upon our ability to develop new technologies and introduce new products that achieve market acceptance in increasingly competitive markets with acceptable margins.
our future growth rate depends upon a number of factors, including our ability to (i) identify and evolve with emerging technological and broader industry trends in our target end-markets; (ii) develop and maintain competitive products; (iii) defend our market share against an ever-expanding number of competitors including many new and non-traditional competitors; (iv) enhance our products by adding innovative features that differentiate our products from those of our competitors and prevent commoditization of our products; (v) develop, manufacture and bring compelling new products to market quickly and cost-effectively; (vi) monitor disruptive technologies and business models; (vii) achieve sufficient return on investment for new products introduced based on capital expenditures and research and development spending; (viii) respond to changes in overall trends related to end-market demand; and (ix) attract, develop and retain individuals with the requisite technical expertise and understanding of customers' needs to develop new technologies and introduce new products. competitors may also develop after-market services and parts for our products which attract customers and adversely affect our return on investment for new products. the failure of our technologies or products to gain market acceptance due to more attractive offerings by our competitors or the failure to address any of the above factors could significantly reduce our revenues and adversely affect our competitive standing and prospects.
failure to increase productivity through sustainable operational improvements, as well as an inability to successfully execute repositioning projects or to effectively manage our workforce, may reduce our profitability or adversely impact our businesses.
our profitability and margin growth are dependent upon our ability to drive sustainable improvements. in addition, we seek productivity and cost savings benefits through repositioning actions and projects, such as consolidation of manufacturing facilities, transitions to cost-competitive regions and product line rationalizations. risks associated with these actions include delays in execution, additional unexpected costs, realization of fewer than estimated productivity improvements and adverse effects on employee morale. we may not realize the full operational or financial benefits we expect, the recognition of these benefits may be delayed and these actions may potentially disrupt our operations. in addition, organizational changes, increased attrition, failure to create and implement a succession plan for key company positions, not retaining key talent, inability to attract new employees with unique skills, labor relations difficulties, or workforce stoppage could have a material adverse effect on our business, reputation, financial position and results of operations.
as a supplier to the u.s. government, we are subject to unique risks, such as the right of the u.s. government to terminate contracts for convenience and to conduct audits and investigations of our operations and performance.
u.s. government contracts are subject to termination by the government, either for the convenience of the government or for our failure to perform consistent with the terms of the applicable contract. our contracts with the u.s. government are also subject to government audits that may recommend downward price adjustments and other changes. when appropriate and prudent, we made adjustments and paid voluntary refunds in the past and may do so in the future.
we are also subject to government investigations of business practices and compliance with government procurement regulations. if, as a result of any such investigation or other government investigations (including investigation of violations of certain environmental, employment or export laws), honeywell or one of its businesses were found to have violated applicable law, then it could be suspended from bidding on or receiving awards of new government contracts, suspended from contract performance pending the completion of legal proceedings and/or have its export privileges suspended.
our operations and the prior operations of predecessor companies expose us to the risk of material environmental liabilities.
mainly because of past operations and operations of predecessor companies, we are subject to potentially material liabilities related to the remediation of environmental hazards and to claims of personal injuries or property damages that may be caused by hazardous substance releases and exposures. we continue to incur remedial response and voluntary clean-up costs for site contamination and are a party to lawsuits and claims associated with environmental and safety matters, including past production of products containing hazardous substances. additional lawsuits, claims and costs involving environmental matters are likely to continue to arise in the future. various federal, state, local and foreign governments regulate the discharge of materials into the environment, or the use of or communications respecting certain materials in our products, and can impose substantial fines and criminal sanctions for violations, and require injunctive relief measures, including installation of costly equipment or operational changes to limit emissions and/or decrease the likelihood of accidental hazardous substance releases, or limiting access of our products to markets, among others. in addition, changes in laws, regulations and enforcement of policies, the discovery of previously unknown contamination or new technology or information related to individual sites, the establishment of stricter toxicity standards with respect to certain contaminants, or the imposition of new clean-up requirements or remedial techniques could require us to incur additional costs in the future that would have a negative effect on our financial condition or results of operations.
cybersecurity incidents could disrupt business operations, result in the loss of critical and confidential information, and adversely impact our reputation and results of operations.
global cybersecurity threats and incidents can range from uncoordinated individual attempts to gain unauthorized access to information technology (it) systems to sophisticated and targeted measures known as advanced persistent threats, directed at the company, its products, its customers and/or its third party service providers, including cloud providers. our customers, including the u.s. government, are increasingly requiring cybersecurity protections and mandating cybersecurity standards in our products, and we may incur additional costs to comply with such demands. while we have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, these types of threats and incidents, none of them to date have been material to the company. we seek to deploy comprehensive measures to deter, prevent, detect, respond to and mitigate these threats, including identity and access controls, data protection, vulnerability assessments, continuous monitoring of our it networks and systems and maintenance of backup and protective systems. despite these efforts, cybersecurity incidents, depending on their nature and scope, could potentially result in the misappropriation, destruction, corruption or unavailability of critical data and confidential or proprietary information (our own or that of third parties) and the disruption of business operations. the potential consequences of a material cybersecurity incident include financial loss, reputational damage, litigation with third parties, theft of intellectual property, fines levied by the federal trade commission, diminution in the value of our investment in research, development and engineering, and increased cybersecurity protection and remediation costs due to the increasing sophistication and proliferation of threats, which in turn could adversely affect our competitiveness and results of operations.
the development of technology products and services presents security and safety risks.
an increasing number of our products, services and technologies are delivered with internet of things (iot) capabilities and the accompanying interconnected device networks which include sensors, data and advanced computing capabilities. we have developed product software designs which we believe are less susceptible to cyber-attacks, but despite these efforts, if our products and services that include iot solutions do not work as intended or are compromised, the possible consequences include financial loss, reputational damage, exposure to legal claims or enforcement actions, theft of intellectual property, and diminution in the value of our investment in research, development and engineering, which in turn could adversely affect our competitiveness and results of operations.
data privacy, data protection, and information security may require significant resources and presents certain risks.
we collect, store, have access to and otherwise process certain confidential or sensitive data, including proprietary business information, personal data or other information that is subject to privacy and security laws, regulations and/or customer-imposed controls. despite our efforts to protect such data, we may be vulnerable to material security breaches, theft, misplaced or lost data, programming errors, or employee errors that could potentially lead to the compromising of such data, improper use of our systems, software solutions or networks, unauthorized access, use, disclosure, modification or destruction of information, defective products, production downtimes and operational disruptions. in addition, we operate in an environment in which there are different and potentially conflicting data privacy laws in effect in the various u.s. states and foreign jurisdictions in which we operate and we must understand and comply with each law and standard in each of these jurisdictions while ensuring the data is secure. for example, the state of california recently passed legislation granting residents certain new data privacy rights and regulating the security of iot devices, effective in january 2020; european laws require us to have an approved legal mechanism to transfer personal data out of europe; the european union general data protection regulation, which became enforceable in may 2018, superseded prior european union data protection legislation and imposes more stringent requirements in how we collect and process personal data and provides for significantly greater penalties for noncompliance; and several other countries have passed laws that require personal data relating to their citizens to be maintained on local servers and impose additional data transfer restrictions. government enforcement actions can be costly and interrupt the regular operation of our business, and violations of data privacy laws can result in fines, reputational damage and civil lawsuits, any of which may adversely affect our business, reputation and financial statements.
a material disruption of our operations, particularly at our manufacturing facilities or within our information technology infrastructure, could adversely affect our business.
our facilities, supply chains, distribution systems and information technology systems are subject to catastrophic loss due to natural disasters, including hurricanes and floods, power outages, fires, explosions, terrorism, equipment failures, sabotage, cyber incidents, adverse weather conditions, labor disputes, critical supply failure, inaccurate downtime forecast, political disruption, and other reasons, which can result in undesirable consequences, including financial losses and damaged relationships with customers. public health crises, like a regional or global pandemic, could disrupt our supply chain, distribution channels, production facilities, operations and customer demand, which could negatively impact our operations and adversely affect our business. we employ information technology systems and networks to support the business and rely on them to process, transmit and store electronic information, and to manage or support a variety of business processes and activities. disruptions to our information technology infrastructure from system failures, shutdowns, power outages, telecommunication or utility failures, cybersecurity incidents, and other events, including disruptions at our cloud computing, server, systems and other third party it service providers, could interfere with our operations, interrupt production and shipments, damage customer and business partner relationships, and negatively impact our reputation.
concentrations of credit and market risk may adversely affect our results of operations.
we maintain long-term contract relationships with many of our customers, suppliers, and other counterparties. while we monitor the financial health of these counterparties, we are exposed to credit and market risks to the extent that customers, suppliers, and other counterparties are concentrated in similar industries and geographic regions. changes in economic conditions in these industries or geographic regions could result in the credit deterioration or insolvency of a significant counterparty, which may lead to concerns about the creditworthiness of other counterparties in the same industry or geography, impacting our ability to renew our long-term contract arrangements or collect amounts due under these arrangements.
legal and regulatory risks our u.s. and non-u.s. tax liabilities are dependent, in part, upon the distribution of income among various jurisdictions in which we operate.
our future results of operations could be adversely affected by changes in the effective tax rate as a result of a change in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in tax laws, regulations and judicial rulings (or changes in the interpretation thereof), potential taxation of digital services, changes in generally accepted accounting principles, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, changes in the amount of earnings permanently reinvested offshore, the results of audits and examinations of previously filed tax returns and continuing assessments of our tax exposures and various other governmental enforcement initiatives. our tax expense includes estimates of tax reserves and reflects other estimates and assumptions, including assessments of future earnings of the company which could impact the valuation of our deferred tax assets. changes in tax laws or regulations, including further regulatory developments arising from u.s. tax reform legislation as well as multi-jurisdictional changes enacted in response to the action items provided by the organization for economic co-operation and development (oecd), will increase tax uncertainty and impact our provision for income taxes.
changes in legislation or government regulations or policies can have a significant impact on our results of operations.
the sales and margins of each of our segments are directly impacted by government regulations including safety, performance and product certification regulations. within aerospace, the operating results of commercial original equipment and commercial aftermarket may be impacted by, among other things, mandates of the federal aviation administration and other similar international regulatory bodies requiring the installation of equipment on aircraft. our defense and space business unit may be affected by changes in government procurement regulations. within honeywell building technologies and safety and productivity solutions, the demand for and cost of providing products, services and solutions can be impacted by fire, security, safety, health care, environmental and energy efficiency standards and regulations. performance materials and technologies' results of operations can be impacted by environmental standards, regulations, and judicial determinations. growth in all our businesses within emerging markets may be adversely impacted by the inability to acquire and retain qualified employees where local employment law mandates may be restrictive. noncompliance with legislation and regulations can result in fines and penalties.
increased public awareness and concern regarding global climate change may result in more international, regional and/or federal or other stakeholder requirements or expectations that could mandate more restrictive or expansive standards, such as stricter limits on greenhouse gas emissions or more prescriptive reporting of environmental, social, and governance metrics, than the voluntary commitments, that the company has adopted or require such changes on a more accelerated time frame. there continues to be a lack of consistent climate legislation, which creates economic and regulatory uncertainty. if environmental laws or regulations are either changed or adopted and impose significant operational restrictions and compliance requirements upon the company or its products, they could negatively impact the company's business, capital expenditures, results of operations, financial condition and competitive position.
we cannot predict with certainty the outcome of litigation matters, government proceedings and other contingencies and uncertainties.
we are subject to a number of lawsuits, investigations and disputes (some of which involve substantial amounts claimed) arising out of the conduct of our business, including matters relating to commercial transactions, government contracts, product liability (including asbestos), prior acquisitions and divestitures, employment, employee benefits plans, intellectual property, antitrust, accounting, import and export, and environmental, health and safety matters. our potential liabilities are subject to change over time due to new developments, changes in settlement strategy or the impact of evidentiary requirements, and we may become subject to or be required to pay damage awards or settlements that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. while we maintain insurance for certain risks, the amount of our insurance coverage may not be adequate to cover the total amount of all insured claims and liabilities. the incurrence of significant liabilities for which there is no or insufficient insurance coverage could adversely affect our results of operations, cash flows, liquidity and financial condition.
item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations
the following management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is intended to help the reader understand the results of operations and financial condition of honeywell international inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries ("honeywell" or "the company") for the three years ended december 31, 2019. all references to notes relate to notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8. financial statements and supplementary data.
on october 1, 2018, we completed the tax-free spin-off to honeywell shareowners of our transportation systems business, previously part of aerospace, into a standalone publicly-traded company, garrett motion inc. ("garrett").
on october 29, 2018, we completed the tax-free spin-off to honeywell shareowners of our homes and global distribution business, previously part of home and building technologies (renamed honeywell building technologies following the spin-off), into a standalone publicly-traded company, resideo technologies, inc. ("resideo").
we removed the assets and liabilities associated with garrett and resideo from our consolidated balance sheet as of the effective dates of the respective spin-offs. we included the results of operations for garrett and resideo in our consolidated statement of operations through the effective dates of the respective spin-offs. total sales and total cost of products and services sold attributable to these spin-offs, impacting segment profit, were $6.6 billion and $4.8 billion for the year ended december 31, 2018.
a detailed discussion of the prior year 2018 to 2017 year-over-year changes are not included herein and can be found in the management's discussion and analysis section in the 2018 annual report on form 10-k filed february 8, 2019.
executive summary during 2019, we continued to deliver on our financial commitments and to create long-term shareowner value. income before taxes grew 1% to $7.6 billion despite the spin-offs. the improvement in year over year income before taxes was attributable to both sales growth as well as operational improvements that increased operating margins. we believe our ability to drive continuous earnings growth over a long history results from consistently identifying and investing in productivity initiatives. we continue to focus on commercial excellence and improvements in our manufacturing and operational processes, including our integrated supply chain and honeywell digital transformations, to drive higher sales at better margins.
we are careful not to allow the attainment of short-term financial results to imperil the creation of long-term, sustainable shareowner value. we are committed to a strategy to become one of the world's leading software industrial companies. our technology investments allow us to introduce new technology solutions in high growth businesses in broad-based, attractive industrial end markets. each of these end markets is characterized by favorable global mega-trends including energy efficiency, infrastructure investment, urbanization and safety.
in 2019 we deployed capital of $7.8 billion, including capital expenditures, dividends, share repurchases, mergers and acquisitions, and venture investments.
business objectives our businesses are focused on the following objectives:
•   driving profitable growth through delivering innovative products through research and development and technological excellence, and through continued enhancement of our footprint in high growth regions;
•   continuing to execute on our strategy to become the premier software-industrial, including the ongoing expansion of honeywell forge connected solutions for aircraft, buildings, cybersecurity, plants, and workers and driving a recurring revenue model across the company;
•   expanding margins by optimizing the company's cost structure through supply chain and honeywell digital transformation initiatives, commercial excellence, repositioning, and other manufacturing and operational process improvements;
•   executing disciplined, rigorous m&amp;a and integration processes to deliver growth through acquisitions;
•   controlling corporate costs, including costs incurred for asbestos and environmental matters, pension and other post-retirement benefits; and
•   increasing availability of capital through strong cash flow generation and conversion from effective working capital management and proactively managing debt to enable the company to smartly deploy capital for strategic acquisitions, dividends, share repurchases and capital expenditures.
consolidated results of operations net sales
% change compared with prior period         (12   )%               3   %
net sales decreased in 2019 compared to 2018 due to the spin-offs. our 2018 results included $6,550 million of sales related to the transportation systems and homes and global distribution businesses. absent the impact of the spin-offs during 2018, sales grew 4% from $35,252 in 2018 to $36,709 in 2019.
the change in net sales is attributable to the following:
a discussion of net sales by segment can be found in the review of business segments section of this management's discussion and analysis.
the unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation in 2019 compared with 2018 was principally driven by the strengthening of the u.s. dollar against the currencies of the majority of our international markets, primarily the euro, british pound and chinese renminbi.
cost of products and services sold
cost of products and services sold      $24,339              $29,046             $28,144
% change compared with prior period         (16   )%               3   %
cost of products and services sold decreased in 2019 compared to 2018 due to lower direct and indirect material costs of approximately $3,920 million, lower labor costs of approximately $160 million (both driven by the spin-offs of the transportation systems and homes and global distribution businesses), and lower repositioning and other charges of approximately $530 million, largely due to lower asbestos and environmental related charges net of the reimbursements. absent the impact of these items during 2018, cost of products and services sold increased approximately 3%.
gross margin percentage increased in 2019 compared with 2018 primarily due to higher gross margin in the segments (approximately 1.4 percentage points), with higher aerospace, honeywell building technologies and performance materials and technologies gross margins, including the favorable impact following the spin-offs, partially offset by lower safety and productivity solutions gross margin. additionally, gross margin percentage increased due to the lower costs within cost of products and services sold for repositioning and other charges (approximately 1.5 percentage point impact) and pension service costs (approximately 0.2 percentage point impact).
% of sales                                          15.0   %            14.5   %            15.0   %
selling, general and administrative expenses decreased in 2019 compared with 2018 primarily due to the impact of the spin-offs. in addition, selling, general and administrative expenses decreased due to productivity and the favorable impact of foreign currency translation, partially offset by labor inflation.
other (income) expense decreased in 2019 compared with 2018 primarily due to lower pension non-service income, partially offset by lower separation costs.
the effective tax rate for 2019 was lower than the u.s. federal statutory rate of 21% primarily resulting from the impacts of revised guidance related to u.s. tax reform and internal restructuring initiatives that resulted in a $281 million reduction of accrued withholding taxes related to unremitted foreign earnings.
the effective tax rate for 2018 was lower than the u.s. federal statutory rate of 21% primarily attributable to internal restructuring initiatives that resulted in a reduction of accrued withholding taxes of approximately $1.1 billion related to unremitted foreign earnings. in addition, we recorded a tax benefit of approximately $440 million as a reduction to our 2017 provisional estimate of impacts from what is commonly referred to as the u.s. tax cuts and jobs act ("u.s. tax reform"), which was partially offset by $411 million of tax costs associated with the internal restructuring of the homes and global distribution business and the transportation systems business in advance of their spin-offs.
for further discussion of changes in the effective tax rate, see note 5 income taxes of notes to consolidated financial statements.
earnings per share of common stock-assuming dilution       $8.41               $8.98               $2.00
earnings per share of common stock-assuming dilution decreased in 2019 compared with 2018 primarily driven by the absence of profit attributable to the spin-offs, higher income tax expense (attributable to a lower income tax benefit related to u.s. tax reform and internal restructuring initiatives when compared to the prior year), partially offset by increased operational segment profit and lower repositioning and other charges.
review of business segments we globally manage our business operations through four segments: aerospace, honeywell building technologies, performance materials and technologies, and safety and productivity solutions.

repositioning charges see note 3 repositioning and other charges of notes to consolidated financial statements for a discussion of our repositioning actions and related charges incurred in 2019, 2018 and 2017. cash spending related to our repositioning actions was $249 million, $285 million and $177 million in 2019, 2018 and 2017, and was funded through operating cash flows. in 2020, we expect cash spending for repositioning actions to be approximately $300 million and to be funded through operating cash flows.
liquidity and capital resources we continue to manage our businesses to maximize operating cash flows as the primary source of liquidity. in addition to our available cash and operating cash flows, we maintain additional sources of liquidity, including committed credit lines, short-term debt from the commercial paper market, long-term borrowings, access to the public debt and equity markets and the ability to access non-u.s. cash as a result of the u.s. tax reform. we use cash generated through operations to invest in our existing core businesses, acquisitions, share repurchases and dividends.
cash flow summary our cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities, as reflected in the consolidated statement of cash flows, are summarized as follows:
operating activities                                      $6,897                $6,434                $5,966
effect of exchange rate changes on cash                       16                  (201    )              340
cash provided by operating activities increased by $463 million primarily due to $276 million decrease in net payments for repositioning and other charges, largely due to asbestos and environmental related reimbursement receipts, and a $35 million favorable impact from working capital (favorable inventory and accounts receivable partially offset by accounts payable).
cash used by investing activities increased by $1,560 million primarily due to a net $1,762 million increase in investments, primarily short-term marketable securities.
cash used for financing activities increased by $1,568 million primarily due to the prior year pre-spin separation funding of $2,622 million net of spin-off cash, an increase in cash dividends paid of $170 million and an increase in net repurchases of common stock of $169 million, partially offset by a decrease in net debt payments of $1,330 million.
liquidity each of our businesses is focused on increasing operating cash flows through revenue growth, margin expansion and improved working capital turnover. we believe that cash balances and operating cash flow will continue to be our principal source of liquidity. in addition to the available cash and operating cash flows, additional sources of liquidity include committed credit lines, short-term debt from the commercial paper markets, long-term borrowings, and access to the public debt and equity markets. to date, the company has not experienced any limitations in our ability to access these sources of liquidity.
we monitor the third-party depository institutions that hold our cash and cash equivalents on a daily basis. our emphasis is primarily safety of principal and secondarily maximizing yield of those funds. we diversify our cash and cash equivalents among counterparties to minimize exposure to any one of these entities.
a source of liquidity is our ability to access the commercial paper market. commercial paper notes are sold at a discount or premium and have a maturity of not more than 365 days from date of issuance. borrowings under the commercial paper program are available for general corporate purposes as well as for financing acquisitions. the weighted average interest rate on short-term borrowings and commercial paper outstanding as of december 31, 2019 was (0.37%) and as of december 31, 2018 was (0.31%).
our ability to access the commercial paper market, and the related cost of these borrowings, is affected by the strength of our credit rating and market conditions. our credit ratings are periodically reviewed by the major independent debt-rating agencies. as of december 31, 2019, standard and poor's (s&p), fitch, and moody's have ratings on our long-term debt of a, a and a2 and short-term debt of a-1, f1 and p1. s&p, fitch and moody's have honeywell's rating outlook as "stable."
we also have a current shelf registration statement filed with the securities and exchange commission under which we may issue additional debt securities, common stock and preferred stock that may be offered in one or more offerings on terms to be determined at the time of the offering. net proceeds of any offering would be used for general corporate purposes, including repayment of existing indebtedness, share repurchases, capital expenditures and acquisitions.
see note 2 acquisitions and divestitures and note 13 long-term debt and credit agreements of notes to consolidated financial statements for additional discussion of items impacting our liquidity.
in 2019, we repurchased $4,400 million of outstanding shares to offset the dilutive impact of employee stock based compensation plans, including option exercises, restricted unit vesting and matching contributions under our savings plans, and to reduce share count when attractive opportunities arise. on april 29, 2019, the board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to a total of $10.0 billion of honeywell common stock, of which $7.0 billion remained available as of december 31, 2019 for additional share repurchases. this authorization included amounts remaining under and replaced the previously approved share repurchase program. we expect to repurchase outstanding shares from time to time to offset the dilutive impact of employee stock based compensation plans, including option exercises, restricted unit vesting and matching contributions under our savings plans. we will continue to seek to reduce share count via share repurchases when attractive opportunities arise.
in addition to our normal operating cash requirements, our principal future cash requirements will be to fund capital expenditures, share repurchases, dividends, strategic acquisitions and debt repayments.
specifically, we expect our primary cash requirements in 2020 to be as follows:
•   capital expenditures-we expect to spend approximately $900 million for capital expenditures in 2020 primarily for growth, production and capacity expansion, cost reduction, maintenance, and replacement.
•   share repurchases-under our share repurchase program, $7.0 billion is available as of december 31, 2019 for additional share repurchases. we expect to repurchase outstanding shares from time to time to offset the dilutive impact of employee stock-based compensation plans, including option exercises, restricted unit vesting and matching contributions under our savings plans. additionally, we will seek to reduce share count via share repurchases as and when attractive opportunities arise. the amount and timing of future repurchases may vary depending on market conditions and our level of operating, financing and other investing activities.
•   dividends-we increased our quarterly dividend rate by 10% to $0.90 per share of common stock effective with the fourth quarter 2019 dividend. we intend to continue to pay quarterly dividends in 2020.
we continuously assess the relative strength of each business in our portfolio as to strategic fit, market position, profit and cash flow contribution in order to identify target investment and acquisition opportunities in order to upgrade our combined portfolio. we identify acquisition candidates that will further our strategic plan and strengthen our existing core businesses. we also identify businesses that do not fit into our long-term strategic plan based on their market position, relative profitability or growth potential. these businesses are considered for potential divestiture, restructuring or other repositioning actions subject to regulatory constraints.
based on past performance and current expectations, we believe that our operating cash flows will be sufficient to meet our future operating cash needs. our available cash, committed credit lines and access to the public debt and equity markets, provide additional sources of short-term and long-term liquidity to fund current operations, debt maturities, and future investment opportunities.
contractual obligations following is a summary of our significant contractual obligations and probable liability payments at december 31, 2019:

asbestos matters payments, net of insurance recoveries, related to known asbestos matters was $163 million, $216 million and $239 million in 2019, 2018 and 2017 and is estimated to be approximately $320 million in 2020. we expect to pay these asbestos matters from operating cash flows. the timing of these payments depends on several factors, including the timing of litigation and settlements of liability claims.
see note 20 commitments and contingencies of notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion of our asbestos matters and the indemnification and reimbursement agreement entered into with garrett.
environmental matters accruals for environmental matters deemed probable and reasonably estimable were $213 million, $395 million and $287 million in 2019, 2018 and 2017. in addition, in 2019, 2018 and 2017 we incurred operating costs for ongoing businesses of approximately $99 million, $95 million and $82 million relating to compliance with environmental regulations.
payments related to known environmental matters was $256 million, $218 million and $212 million in 2019, 2018 and 2017 and is estimated to be approximately $220 million in 2020. we expect to pay these environmental matters from operating cash flows. the timing of these payments depends on several factors, including the timing of litigation and settlements of remediation liability, personal injury and property damage claims, regulatory approval of cleanup projects, execution timeframe of projects, remedial techniques to be utilized and agreement with other parties.
reimbursements from resideo for payments related to environmental matters at certain sites, as defined in the indemnification and reimbursement agreement, was $140 million in 2019 and is expected to be $140 million in 2020. we received approximately $35 million in january 2020.

critical accounting estimates the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles is based on the selection and application of accounting policies that require us to make significant estimates and assumptions about the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain. many estimates and assumptions involved in the application of accounting principles have a material impact on reported financial condition and operating performance and on the comparability of such reported information over different reporting periods. critical accounting estimates or assumptions are those where the nature of the estimates or assumptions is material due to the levels of subjectivity and judgment necessary to account for highly uncertain matters or the susceptibility of such matters to change, and the impact of the estimates and assumptions on financial condition or operating performance is material. we consider the estimates and assumptions discussed below to be critical to the understanding of our financial statements. actual results could differ from our estimates and assumptions, and any such differences could be material to our consolidated financial statements.
contingent liabilities-we are subject to a number of lawsuits, investigations and claims (some of which involve substantial dollar amounts) that arise out of the conduct of our global business operations or those of previously owned entities, including matters relating to commercial transactions, government contracts, product liability (including asbestos), prior acquisitions and divestitures, employee benefit plans, intellectual property, legal and environmental, health and safety matters. we continually assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to our contingencies, as well as potential amounts or ranges of probable losses, and recognize a liability, if any, for these contingencies based on a thorough analysis of each matter with the assistance of outside legal counsel and, if applicable, other experts. such analysis includes making judgments concerning matters such as the costs associated with environmental matters, the outcome of negotiations, the number and cost of pending and future asbestos claims, and the impact of evidentiary requirements. because most contingencies are resolved over long periods of time, liabilities may change in the future due to new developments (including new discovery of facts, changes in legislation and outcomes of similar cases through the judicial system), changes in assumptions or changes in our settlement strategy. see note 20 commitments and contingencies of notes to consolidated financial statements for a discussion of management's judgment applied in the recognition and measurement of our environmental and asbestos liabilities which represent our most significant contingencies.
asbestos related liabilities and insurance recoveries-in connection with the recognition of liabilities for asbestos related matters, we record asbestos related insurance recoveries that are deemed probable. in assessing the probability of insurance recovery, we make judgments concerning insurance coverage that we believe are reasonable and consistent with our historical dealings and our knowledge of any pertinent solvency issues surrounding insurers. while the substantial majority of our insurance carriers are solvent, some of our individual carriers are insolvent, which has been considered in our analysis of probable recoveries. projecting future events is subject to various uncertainties that could cause the insurance recovery on asbestos related liabilities to be higher or lower than that projected and recorded. given the inherent uncertainty in making future projections, we reevaluate our projections concerning our probable insurance recoveries considering any changes to the projected liability, our recovery experience or other relevant factors that may impact future insurance recoveries.
our involvement in asbestos related personal injury actions relates to two predecessor companies. regarding north american refractories company ("narco") asbestos related claims, we accrue for pending claims based on terms and conditions in agreements with narco, its former parent company, and certain asbestos claimants, and an estimate of the unsettled claims pending as of the time narco filed for bankruptcy protection. we also accrue for the estimated value of future narco asbestos related claims expected to be asserted against the narco trust. the estimate of future narco claims was prepared in 2002, in the same year narco filed for bankruptcy protection, using narco tort system litigation experience based on a commonly accepted methodology used by numerous bankruptcy courts addressing 524(g) trusts. accordingly, the estimated value of future narco asbestos claims was prepared before there was data on claims filings and payment rates in the narco trust under the trust distribution procedures and prepared when the stay of all narco asbestos claims was in effect (which remained in effect until narco emerged from bankruptcy protection). some critical assumptions underlying this commonly accepted methodology included claims filing rates, disease criteria and payment values contained in the trust distribution procedures, estimated approval rates of claims submitted to the narco trust and epidemiological studies estimating disease instances. this estimate resulted in a range of estimated liability of $743 million to $961 million. we believe that no amount within this range is a better estimate than any other amount and accordingly, we have recorded the minimum amount in the range. given the trust's lack of sufficiently reliable claims data since narco emerged from bankruptcy protection, it is not yet possible to update our estimated future claim costs based on actual narco trust experience. when sufficiently reliable claims data exists, we will update our estimate of the narco trust liability and it is possible that a material change may need to be recognized. regarding bendix friction materials ("bendix") asbestos related claims, we accrued for the estimated value of pending claims using average resolution values for the previous five years. we also accrued for the estimated value of future claims related to bendix over the full term of epidemiological projections through 2059 based on historic and anticipated claims filing experience and dismissal rates, disease classifications, and average resolution values in the tort system for the previous five years.

reimbursement receivables-in conjunction with the garrett and resideo spin-offs, the company entered into reimbursement agreements under which honeywell receives cash payments as reimbursement primarily for asbestos related liability payments related to the bendix business in the u.s. (garrett) and net spending for environmental matters at certain sites as defined in the agreement (resideo). accordingly, the company has recorded a receivable based on estimates in the underlying reimbursable honeywell spend, and we monitor the recoverability of such receivable, which is subject to terms of applicable credit agreements and general ability to pay.
see note 20 commitments and contingencies of notes to consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the recognition and measurement of our reimbursement receivables.
defined benefit pension plans-we sponsor both funded and unfunded u.s. and non-u.s. defined benefit pension plans. for financial reporting purposes, net periodic pension (income) expense is calculated annually based upon a number of actuarial assumptions, including a discount rate for plan obligations and an expected long-term rate of return on plan assets. changes in the discount rate and expected long-term rate of return on plan assets could materially affect the annual pension (income) expense amount. annual pension (income) expense is comprised of service and interest cost, assumed return on plan assets, prior service amortization (pension ongoing (income) expense) and a potential mark-to-market adjustment (mtm adjustment).
projected benefit obligation                              4.35   %        3.68    %      4.20   %

expected rate of return                                   6.75   %        7.75    %      7.75   %
actual rate of return                                     21.2   %        (1.8   )%      20.5   %
actual 10 year average annual compounded rate of return   11.1   %        11.0    %       7.4   %
the mtm adjustment represents the recognition of net actuarial gains or losses in excess of 10% of the greater of the fair value of plan assets or the plans' projected benefit obligation (the corridor). net actuarial gains and losses occur when the actual experience differs from any of the various assumptions used to value our pension plans or when assumptions change. the primary factors contributing to actuarial gains and losses are changes in the discount rate used to value pension obligations as of the measurement date each year and the difference between expected and actual returns on plan assets. the mark-to-market accounting method results in the potential for volatile and difficult to forecast mtm adjustments. mtm charges were $123 million, $37 million and $87 million in 2019, 2018 and 2017.
we determine the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets utilizing historical plan asset returns over varying long-term periods combined with our expectations of future market conditions and asset mix considerations (see note 21 pension and other postretirement benefits of notes to consolidated financial statements for details on the actual various asset classes and targeted asset allocation percentages for our pension plans). we plan to use an expected rate of return on plan assets of 6.15% for 2020 down from 6.75% for 2019 reflecting a decline in interest rates and additional re-balancing of assets to more fixed income.
the discount rate reflects the market rate on december 31 (measurement date) for high-quality fixed-income investments with maturities corresponding to our benefit obligations and is subject to change each year. the discount rate can be volatile from year to year as it is determined based upon prevailing interest rates as of the measurement date. we used a 3.22% discount rate to determine benefit obligations as of december 31, 2019, reflecting a decrease in the market interest rate environment since the prior year-end.
in addition to the potential for mtm adjustments, changes in our expected rate of return on plan assets and discount rate resulting from economic events also affects future pension ongoing (income) expense. the following table highlights the sensitivity of our u.s. pension obligations and ongoing (income) expense to changes in these assumptions, assuming all other assumptions remain constant. these estimates exclude any potential mtm adjustment:
change in assumption   impact on 2020pension ongoingexpense   impact on pbo
0.25 percentage point decrease in expected rate of return on assets   increase $46 million                   -
0.25 percentage point increase in expected rate of return on assets   decrease $46 million                   -
pension ongoing income for our world-wide pension plans is expected to be approximately $786 million in 2020 compared with pension ongoing income of $592 million in 2019. the expected increase in pension income is primarily due to lower interest cost from a decrease in discount rates in our u.s. and uk plans, and higher expected return on plan assets (lower rate of return on a higher asset base). also, if required, an mtm adjustment will be recorded in the fourth quarter of 2020 in accordance with our pension accounting method as previously described. it is difficult to reliably forecast or predict whether there will be a mtm adjustment in 2020, and if one is required, what the magnitude of such adjustment will be. mtm adjustments are primarily driven by events and circumstances beyond the control of the company such as changes in interest rates and the performance of the financial markets.
finite-lived intangible assets-the determination of useful lives (for depreciation/amortization purposes) and whether or not intangible assets are impaired involves the use of accounting estimates and assumptions, changes in which could materially impact our financial condition or operating performance if actual results differ from such estimates and assumptions. we evaluate the recoverability of the carrying amount of our finite-lived intangible assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of a finite-lived intangible asset group may not be fully recoverable. the principal factors in considering when to perform an impairment review are as follows:
•   significant under-performance (i.e., declines in sales, earnings or cash flows) of a business or product line in relation to expectations;
•   annual operating plans or strategic plan outlook that indicate an unfavorable trend in operating performance of a business or product line;
•   significant negative industry or economic trends; or
•   significant changes or planned changes in our use of the assets.
once it is determined that an impairment review is necessary, recoverability of assets is measured by comparing the carrying amount of the asset grouping to the estimated future undiscounted cash flows. if the carrying amount exceeds the estimated future undiscounted cash flows, the asset grouping is considered to be impaired. the impairment is then measured as the difference between the carrying amount of the asset grouping and its fair value. we endeavor to utilize the best information available to measure fair value, which is usually either market prices (if available), level 1 or level 2 of the fair value hierarchy, or an estimate of the future discounted cash flow, level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. the key estimates in our discounted cash flow analysis include assumptions as to expected industry and business growth rates, sales volume, selling prices and costs, cash flows, and the discount rate selected. these estimates are subject to changes in the economic environment, including market interest rates and expected volatility. management believes the estimates of future cash flows and fair values are reasonable; however, changes in estimates due to variance from assumptions could materially affect the valuations.
goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets impairment testing-goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives are not amortized, but are subject to annual, or more frequent if necessary, impairment testing. in testing goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, the fair value is estimated utilizing a discounted cash flow approach utilizing cash flow forecasts, including strategic and annual operating plans, adjusted for terminal value assumptions. these impairment tests involve the use of accounting estimates and assumptions, changes in which could materially impact our financial condition or operating performance if actual results differ from such estimates and assumptions. to address this uncertainty, we perform sensitivity analysis on key estimates and assumptions.
income taxes-on a recurring basis, we assess the need for a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets by considering all available positive and negative evidence, such as past operating results, projections of future taxable income, enacted tax law changes and the feasibility and impact of tax planning initiatives. our projections of future taxable income include a number of estimates and assumptions regarding our volume, pricing and costs, as well as the timing and amount of reversals of taxable temporary differences.
we recognize tax benefits from uncertain tax positions only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities including resolution of any related appeals and litigation. we assess our income tax positions based upon our evaluation of the facts, circumstances and information available at the reporting date. the tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such positions are then measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information. for those income tax positions where it is not more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained, no tax benefit has been recognized in the financial statements.
for further discussion of additional income tax policies, see note 1 summary of significant accounting policies and note 5 income taxes of notes to consolidated financial statements.
sales recognition on long-term contracts-we recognize sales for long-term contracts with performance obligations satisfied over time using either an input or output method. we recognize revenue over time as we perform on these contracts based on the continuous transfer of control to the customer. with control transferring over time, revenue is recognized based on the extent of progress towards completion of the performance obligation. we generally use the cost-to-cost input method of progress for our contracts because it best depicts the transfer of control to the customer that occurs as we incur costs. under the cost-to-cost method, the extent of progress towards completion is measured based on the proportion of costs incurred to date to the total estimated costs at completion of the performance obligation. due to the nature of the work required to be performed on many of our performance obligations, the estimation of total revenue and cost at completion requires judgment. contract revenues are largely determined by negotiated contract prices and quantities, modified by our assumptions regarding contract options, change orders, incentive and award provisions associated with technical performance and price adjustment clauses (such as inflation or index-based clauses). cost estimates are largely based on negotiated or estimated purchase contract terms, historical performance trends and other economic projections. significant factors that influence these estimates include inflationary trends, technical and schedule risk, internal and subcontractor performance trends, business volume assumptions, asset utilization, and anticipated labor agreements. revenue and cost estimates are regularly monitored and revised based on changes in circumstances. impacts from changes in estimates of net sales and cost of sales are recognized on a cumulative catch-up basis, which recognizes in the current period the cumulative effect of the changes on current and prior periods based on a performance obligation's percentage of completion. anticipated losses on long-term contracts are recognized when such losses become evident. we maintain financial controls over the customer qualification, contract pricing and estimation processes to reduce the risk of contract losses.

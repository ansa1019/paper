item 1a. risk factors risks relating to our business if we do not design and price our products properly and competitively, if the premiums we charge are insufficient to cover the cost of health care services delivered to our members, if we are unable to implement clinical initiatives to provide a better health care experience for our members, lower costs and appropriately document the risk profile of our members, or if our estimates of benefits expense are inadequate, our profitability may be materially adversely affected. we estimate the costs of our benefits expense payments, and design and price our products accordingly, using actuarial methods and assumptions based upon, among other relevant factors, claim payment patterns, medical cost inflation, and historical developments such as claim inventory levels and claim receipt patterns. we continually review these estimates, however these estimates involve extensive judgment, and have considerable inherent variability because they are extremely sensitive to changes in claim payment patterns and medical cost trends. any reserve, including a premium deficiency reserve, may be insufficient.
we use a substantial portion of our revenues to pay the costs of health care services delivered to our members. these costs include claims payments, capitation payments to providers (predetermined amounts paid to cover services), and various other costs incurred to provide health insurance coverage to our members. these costs also include estimates of future payments to hospitals and others for medical care provided to our members. generally, premiums in the health care business are fixed for one-year periods. accordingly, costs we incur in excess of our benefit cost projections generally are not recovered in the contract year through higher premiums. we estimate the costs of our future benefit claims and other expenses using actuarial methods and assumptions based upon claim payment patterns, medical inflation, historical developments, including claim inventory levels and claim receipt patterns, and other relevant factors. we also record benefits payable for future payments. we continually review estimates of future payments relating to benefit claims costs for services incurred in the current and prior periods and make necessary adjustments to our reserves, including premium deficiency reserves where appropriate. however, these estimates involve extensive judgment, and have considerable inherent variability that is sensitive to claim payment patterns and medical cost trends. many factors may and often do cause actual health care costs to exceed what was estimated and used to set our premiums. these factors may include:
•   increased use of medical facilities and services;
•   increased cost of such services;
•   increased use or cost of prescription drugs, including specialty prescription drugs;
•   the introduction of new or costly treatments, including new technologies;
•   variances in actual versus estimated levels of cost associated with new products, benefits or lines of business, product changes or benefit level changes;
•   changes in the demographic characteristics of an account or market;
•   changes or reductions of our utilization management functions such as preauthorization of services, concurrent review or requirements for physician referrals;
•   changes in our pharmacy volume rebates received from drug manufacturers;
•   catastrophes, including acts of terrorism, public health epidemics, or severe weather (e.g. hurricanes and earthquakes);
•   government mandated benefits, member eligibility criteria, or other legislative, judicial, or regulatory changes, including any that result from the health care reform law.
key to our operational strategy is the implementation of clinical initiatives that we believe provide a better health care experience for our members, lower the cost of healthcare services delivered to our members, and appropriately document the risk profile of our members. our profitability and competitiveness depend in large part on our ability to appropriately manage health care costs through, among other things, the application of medical management programs such as our chronic care management program.
while we proactively attempt to effectively manage our operating expenses, increases or decreases in staff-related expenses, any costs associated with exiting products, additional investment in new products (including our opportunities in the medicare programs, state-based contracts, and expansion of clinical capabilities as part of our integrated care delivery model), investments in health and well-being product offerings, acquisitions, new taxes and assessments (including the non-deductible health insurance industry fee), and implementation of regulatory requirements may increase our operating expenses.
failure to adequately price our products or estimate sufficient benefits payable or effectively manage our operating expenses, may result in a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position, and cash flows.
we are in a highly competitive industry. some of our competitors are more established in the health care industry in terms of a larger market share and have greater financial resources than we do in some markets. in addition, other companies may enter our markets in the future, including emerging competitors in the medicare program or competitors in the delivery of health care services. we believe that barriers to entry in our markets are not substantial, so the addition of new competitors can occur relatively easily, and customers enjoy significant flexibility in moving between competitors. contracts for the sale of commercial products are generally bid upon or renewed annually. while health plans compete on the basis of many factors, including service and the quality and depth of provider networks, we expect that price will continue to be a significant basis of competition. in addition to the challenge of controlling health care costs, we face intense competitive pressure to contain premium prices. factors such as business consolidations, strategic alliances, legislative reform, and marketing practices create pressure to contain premium price increases, despite being faced with increasing medical costs.
the policies and decisions of the federal and state governments regarding the medicare, military and medicaid programs in which we participate have a substantial impact on our profitability. these governmental policies and decisions, which we cannot predict with certainty, directly shape the premiums or other revenues to us under the programs, the eligibility and enrollment of our members, the services we provide to our members, and our administrative, health care services, and other costs associated with these programs. legislative or regulatory actions, such as changes to the programs in which we participate, those resulting in a reduction in premium payments to us, an increase in our cost of administrative and health care services, or additional fees, taxes or assessments, may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position, and cash flows.
premium increases, introduction of new product designs, and our relationships with our providers in various markets, among other issues, could also affect our membership levels. other actions that could affect membership levels include our possible exit from or entrance into medicare or commercial markets, or the termination of a large contract.
if we do not compete effectively in our markets, if we set rates too high or too low in highly competitive markets to keep or increase our market share, if membership does not increase as we expect, if membership declines, or if we lose membership with favorable medical cost experience while retaining or increasing membership with unfavorable medical cost experience, our results of operations, financial position, and cash flows may be materially adversely affected.
if we fail to effectively implement our operational and strategic initiatives, including our medicare initiatives and our state-based contracts strategy, our business may be materially adversely affected, which is of particular importance given the concentration of our revenues in these products. in addition, there can be no assurances that we will be successful in maintaining or improving our star ratings in future years.
our future performance depends in large part upon our ability to execute our strategy, including opportunities created by the expansion of our medicare programs, the successful implementation of our integrated care delivery model and our strategy with respect to state-based contracts, including those covering members dually eligible for the medicare and medicaid programs.
we have made substantial investments in the medicare program to enhance our ability to participate in these programs. we have increased the size of our medicare geographic reach through expanded medicare product offerings. we offer both stand-alone medicare prescription drug coverage and medicare advantage health plans with prescription drug coverage in addition to our other product offerings. we offer a medicare prescription drug plan in 50 states as well as puerto rico and the district of columbia. the growth of our medicare products is an important part of our business strategy. any failure to achieve this growth may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position, or cash flows. in addition, the expansion of our medicare products in relation to our other businesses may intensify the risks to us inherent in medicare products. there is significant concentration of our revenues in medicare products, with approximately 82% of our total premiums and services revenue for the year ended december 31, 2019 generated from our medicare products, including 15% derived from our individual medicare advantage contracts with cms in florida. these expansion efforts may result in less diversification of our revenue stream and increased risks associated with operating in a highly regulated industry, as discussed further below.
the achievement of star ratings of 4-star or higher qualifies medicare advantage plans for premium bonuses. our medicare advantage plans' operating results may be significantly affected by their star ratings. despite our operational efforts to improve our star ratings, there can be no assurances that we will be successful in maintaining or improving our star ratings in future years. in addition, audits of our performance for past or future periods may result in downgrades to our star ratings. accordingly, our plans may not be eligible for full level quality bonuses, which could adversely affect the benefits such plans can offer, reduce membership and/or reduce profit margins.
if we fail to properly maintain the integrity of our data, to strategically implement new information systems, or to protect our proprietary rights to our systems, our business may be materially adversely affected.
our business depends significantly on effective information systems and the integrity and timeliness of the data we use to run our business. our business strategy involves providing members and providers with easy to use products that leverage our information to meet their needs. our ability to adequately price our products and services, provide effective and efficient service to our customers, and to timely and accurately report our financial results depends significantly on the integrity of the data in our information systems. as a result of our past and on-going acquisition activities, we have acquired additional information systems. we have reduced the number of systems we operate, have upgraded and expanded our information systems capabilities, and are gradually migrating existing business to fewer systems. our information systems require an ongoing commitment of significant resources to maintain, protect, and enhance existing systems and develop new systems to keep pace with continuing changes in information processing technology, evolving industry and regulatory standards, and changing customer preferences. if the information we rely upon to run our businesses was found to be inaccurate or unreliable or if we fail to maintain effectively our information systems and data integrity, we could have operational disruptions, have problems in determining medical cost estimates and establishing appropriate pricing, have customer and physician and other health care provider disputes, have regulatory or other legal problems, have increases in operating expenses, lose existing customers, have difficulty in attracting new customers, or suffer other adverse consequences.
we depend on independent third parties for significant portions of our systems-related support, equipment, facilities, and certain data, including data center operations, data network, voice communication services and pharmacy data processing. this dependence makes our operations vulnerable to such third parties' failure to perform adequately under the contract, due to internal or external factors. a change in service providers could result in a decline in service quality and effectiveness or less favorable contract terms which may adversely affect our operating results.
we rely on our agreements with customers, confidentiality agreements with employees, and our trade secrets and copyrights to protect our proprietary rights. these legal protections and precautions may not prevent misappropriation of our proprietary information. in addition, substantial litigation regarding intellectual property rights exists in the software industry, including litigation involving end users of software products. we expect software products to be increasingly subject to third-party infringement claims as the number of products and competitors in this area grows.
there can be no assurance that our information technology, or it, process will successfully improve existing systems, develop new systems to support our expanding operations, integrate new systems, protect our proprietary information, defend against cybersecurity attacks, or improve service levels. in addition, there can be no assurance that additional systems issues will not arise in the future. failure to adequately protect and maintain the integrity of our information systems and data, or to defend against cybersecurity attacks, may result in a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position, and cash flows.
if we are unable to defend our information technology security systems against cybersecurity attacks or prevent other privacy or data security incidents that result in security breaches that disrupt our operations or in the unintended dissemination of sensitive personal information or proprietary or confidential information, we could be exposed to significant regulatory fines or penalties, liability or reputational damage, or experience a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position, and cash flows.
in the ordinary course of our business, we process, store and transmit large amounts of data, including sensitive personal information as well as proprietary or confidential information relating to our business or a third-party. we have been, and will likely continue to be, regular targets of attempted cybersecurity attacks and other security threats and may be subject to breaches of our information technology security systems. although the impact of such attacks has not been material to our operations or results of operations, financial position, or cash flow through december 31, 2019, we can provide no assurance that we will be able to detect, prevent, or contain the effects of such cybersecurity attacks or other information security risks or threats in the future. a cybersecurity attack may penetrate our layered security controls and misappropriate or compromise sensitive personal information or proprietary or confidential information or that of third-parties, create system disruptions, cause shutdowns, or deploy viruses, worms, and other malicious software programs that attack our systems. a cybersecurity attack that bypasses our it security systems successfully could materially affect us due to the theft, destruction, loss, misappropriation or release of confidential data or intellectual property, operational or business delays resulting from the disruption of our it systems, or negative publicity resulting in reputation or brand damage with our members, customers, providers, and other stakeholders. in certain circumstances we may rely on third party vendors to process, store and transmit large amounts of data for our businesses whose operations are subject to similar risks.
the costs to eliminate or address cybersecurity threats and vulnerabilities before or after an incident could be substantial. our remediation efforts may not be successful and could result in interruptions, delays, or cessation of service, and loss of existing or potential members. in addition, breaches of our security measures and the unauthorized dissemination of sensitive personal information or proprietary or confidential information about us or our members or other third-parties, could expose our associates' or members' private information and result in the risk of financial or medical identity theft, or expose us or other third-parties to a risk of loss or misuse of this information, result in significant regulatory fines or penalties, litigation and potential liability for us, damage our brand and reputation, or otherwise harm our business.
we are involved in various legal actions and governmental and internal investigations, any of which, if resolved unfavorably to us, could result in substantial monetary damages or changes in our business practices. increased litigation and negative publicity could increase our cost of doing business.
we are or may become a party to a variety of legal actions that affect our business, including breach of contract actions, employment compensation and other labor and employment practice suits, employee benefit claims, stockholder suits and other securities laws claims, intellectual and other property claims, and tort claims.
in addition, because of the nature of the health care business, we are subject to a variety of legal actions relating to our business operations, including the design, management, and offering of products and services. these include and could include in the future:
•   claims relating to the denial of health care benefit payments;
•   claims relating to the denial or rescission of insurance coverage;
•   challenges to the use of some software products used in administering claims;
•   claims relating to our administration of our medicare part d offerings;
•   medical malpractice actions based on our medical necessity decisions or brought against us on the theory that we are liable for providers' alleged malpractice;
•   claims arising from any adverse medical consequences resulting from our recommendations about the appropriateness of providers' proposed medical treatment plans for patients;
•   allegations of anti-competitive and unfair business activities;
•   provider disputes over compensation or non-acceptance or termination of provider contracts;
•   disputes related to aso business, including actions alleging claim administration errors;
•   qui tam litigation brought by individuals who seek to sue on behalf of the government, alleging that we, as a government contractor, submitted false claims to the government including, among other allegations, resulting from coding and review practices under the medicare risk-adjustment model;
•   claims related to the failure to disclose some business practices;
•   claims relating to customer audits and contract performance;
•   claims relating to dispensing of drugs associated with our in-house dispensing pharmacies; and
•   professional liability claims arising out of the delivery of healthcare and related services to the public.
in some cases, substantial non-economic or punitive damages as well as treble damages under the federal false claims act, racketeer influenced and corrupt organizations act and other statutes may be sought.
while we currently have insurance coverage for some of these potential liabilities, other potential liabilities may not be covered by insurance, insurers may dispute coverage, or the amount of our insurance may not be enough to cover the damages awarded. in addition, some types of damages, like punitive damages, may not be covered by insurance. in some jurisdictions, coverage of punitive damages is prohibited. insurance coverage for all or some forms of liability may become unavailable or prohibitively expensive in the future.
the health benefits industry continues to receive significant negative publicity reflecting the public perception of the industry. this publicity and perception have been accompanied by increased litigation, including some large jury awards, legislative activity, regulation, and governmental review of industry practices. these factors may materially adversely affect our ability to market our products or services, may require us to change our products or services or otherwise change our business practices, may increase the regulatory burdens under which we operate, and may require us to pay large judgments or fines. any combination of these factors could further increase our cost of doing business and adversely affect our results of operations, financial position, and cash flows.
see "legal proceedings and certain regulatory matters" in note 17 to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8. - financial statements and supplementary data. we cannot predict the outcome of these matters with certainty.
as a government contractor, we are exposed to risks that may materially adversely affect our business or our willingness or ability to participate in government health care programs.
a significant portion of our revenues relates to federal and state government health care coverage programs, including the medicare, military, and medicaid programs. these programs accounted for approximately 87% of our total premiums and services revenue for the year ended december 31, 2019. these programs involve various risks, as described further below.
•   at december 31, 2019, under our contracts with cms we provided health insurance coverage to approximately 701,400 individual medicare advantage members in florida. these contracts accounted for approximately 15% of our total premiums and services revenue for the year ended december 31, 2019. the loss of these and other cms contracts or significant changes in the medicare program as a result of legislative or regulatory action, including reductions in premium payments to us or increases in member benefits or changes to member eligibility criteria without corresponding increases in premium payments to us, may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position, and cash flows.
•   at december 31, 2019, our military services business, which accounted for approximately 1% of our total premiums and services revenue for the year ended december 31, 2019, primarily consisted of the tricare t2017 east region contract. the t2017 east region contract is a consolidation of the former t3 north and south regions, comprising thirty-two states and approximately 6 million tricare beneficiaries, under which delivery of health care services commenced on january 1, 2018. the t2017 east region contract is a 5 -year contract set to expire on december 31, 2022 and is subject to renewals on january 1 of each year during its term at the government's option. the loss of the tricare t2017 east region contract may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position, and cash flows.
•   there is a possibility of temporary or permanent suspension from participating in government health care programs, including medicare and medicaid, if we are convicted of fraud or other criminal conduct in the performance of a health care program or if there is an adverse decision against us under the federal false claims act. as a government contractor, we may be subject to qui tam litigation brought by individuals who seek to sue on behalf of the government, alleging that the government contractor submitted false claims to the government. litigation of this nature is filed under seal to allow the government an opportunity to investigate and to decide if it wishes to intervene and assume control of the litigation. if the government does not intervene, the lawsuit is unsealed, and the individual may continue to prosecute the action on his or her own.
•   cms uses a risk-adjustment model which adjusts premiums paid to medicare advantage, or ma, plans according to health status of covered members. the risk-adjustment model, which cms implemented pursuant to the balanced budget act of 1997 (bba) and the benefits improvement and protection act of 2000 (bipa), generally pays more where a plan's membership has higher expected costs. under this model, rates paid to ma plans are based on actuarially determined bids, which include a process whereby our prospective payments are based on our estimated cost of providing standard medicare-covered benefits to an enrollee with a "national average risk profile." that baseline payment amount is adjusted to reflect the health status of our enrolled membership. under the risk-adjustment methodology, all ma plans must collect and submit the necessary diagnosis code information from hospital inpatient, hospital outpatient, and physician providers to cms within prescribed deadlines. the cms risk-adjustment model uses the diagnosis data to calculate the risk-adjusted premium payment to ma plans, which cms adjusts for coding pattern differences between the health plans and the government fee-for-service program. we generally rely on providers, including certain providers in our network who are our employees, to code their claim submissions with appropriate diagnoses, which we send to cms as the basis for our payment received from cms under the actuarial risk-adjustment model. we also rely on these providers to document appropriately all medical data, including the diagnosis data submitted with claims. in addition, we conduct medical record reviews as part of our data and payment accuracy compliance efforts, to more accurately reflect diagnosis conditions under the risk adjustment model. these compliance efforts include the internal contract level audits described in more detail below, as well as ordinary course reviews of our internal business processes.
cms is phasing-in the process of calculating risk scores using diagnoses data from the risk adjustment processing system, or raps, to diagnoses data from the encounter data system, or eds. the raps process requires ma plans to apply a filter logic based on cms guidelines and only submit diagnoses that satisfy those guidelines. for submissions through eds, cms requires ma plans to submit all the encounter data and cms will apply the risk adjustment filtering logic to determine the risk scores. for 2019, 25% of the risk score was calculated from claims data submitted through eds. cms will increase that percentage to 50% in 2020 and has proposed to increase that percentage to 75% in 2021. the phase-in from raps to eds could result in different risk scores from each dataset as a result of plan processing issues, cms processing issues, or filtering logic differences between raps and eds, and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position, or cash flows.
cms and the office of the inspector general of health and human services, or hhs-oig, are continuing to perform audits of various companies' selected ma contracts related to this risk adjustment diagnosis data.
we refer to these audits as risk-adjustment data validation audits, or radv audits. radv audits review medical records in an attempt to validate provider medical record documentation and coding practices which influence the calculation of premium payments to ma plans.
in 2012, cms released a "notice of final payment error calculation methodology for part c medicare advantage risk adjustment data validation (radv) contract-level audits." the payment error calculation methodology provided that, in calculating the economic impact of audit results for an ma contract, if any, the results of the radv audit sample would be extrapolated to the entire ma contract after a comparison of the audit results to a similar audit of the government's traditional fee-for-service medicare program, or medicare ffs. we refer to the process of accounting for errors in ffs claims as the "ffs adjuster." this comparison of radv audit results to the ffs error rate is necessary to determine the economic impact, if any, of radv audit results because the government used the medicare ffs program data set, including any attendant errors that are present in that data set, to estimate the costs of various health status conditions and to set the resulting adjustments to ma plans' payment rates in order to establish actuarial equivalence in payment rates as required under the medicare statute. cms already makes other adjustments to payment rates based on a comparison of coding pattern differences between ma plans and medicare ffs data (such as for frequency of coding for certain diagnoses in ma plan data versus the medicare ffs program dataset).
the final radv extrapolation methodology, including the first application of extrapolated audit results to determine audit settlements, is expected to be applied to cms radv contract level audits conducted for contract year 2011 and subsequent years. cms is currently conducting radv contract level audits for certain of our medicare advantage plans.
estimated audit settlements are recorded as a reduction of premiums revenue in our consolidated statements of income, based upon available information. we perform internal contract level audits based on the radv audit methodology prescribed by cms. included in these internal contract level audits is an audit of our private fee-for service business which we used to represent a proxy of the ffs adjuster which has not yet been finalized. we based our accrual of estimated audit settlements for each contract year on the results of these internal contract level audits and update our estimates as each audit is completed. estimates derived from these results were not material to our results of operations, financial position, or cash flows. we report the results of these internal contract level audits to cms, including identified overpayments, if any.
on october 26, 2018, cms issued a proposed rule and accompanying materials (which we refer to as the "proposed rule") related to, among other things, the radv audit methodology described above. if implemented, the proposed rule would use extrapolation in radv audits applicable to payment year 2011 contract-level audits and all subsequent audits, without the application of a ffs adjuster to audit findings. we believe that the proposed rule fails to address adequately the statutory requirement of actuarial equivalence, and have provided substantive comments to cms on the proposed rule as part of the notice-and-comment rulemaking process. whether, and to what extent, cms finalizes the proposed rule, and any related regulatory, industry or company reactions, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position, or cash flows.
in addition, as part of our internal compliance efforts, we routinely perform ordinary course reviews of our internal business processes related to, among other things, our risk coding and data submissions in connection with the risk- adjustment model. these reviews may also result in the identification of errors and the submission of corrections to cms, that may, either individually or in the aggregate, be material. as such, the result of these reviews may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position, or cash flows.
we believe that cms' statements and policies regarding the requirement to report and return identified overpayments received by ma plans are inconsistent with cms' 2012 radv audit methodology, and the medicare statute's requirements. these statements and policies, such as certain statements contained in the preamble to cms' final rule release regarding medicare advantage and part d prescription drug benefit program regulations for contract year 2015 (which we refer to as the "overpayment rule"), and the proposed rule, appear to equate each medicare advantage risk adjustment data error with an "overpayment" without addressing the principles underlying the ffs adjuster referenced above. on september 7, 2018, the federal district court for the district of columbia vacated cms's overpayment rule, concluding that it violated the medicare statute, including the requirement for actuarial equivalence, and that the overpayment rule was also arbitrary and capricious in departing from cms's radv methodology without adequate explanation (among other reasons). cms has appealed the decision to the circuit court of appeals.
we will continue to work with cms to ensure that ma plans are paid accurately and that payment model principles are in accordance with the requirements of the social security act, which, if not implemented correctly could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position, or cash flows.
•   our cms contracts which cover members' prescription drugs under medicare part d contain provisions for risk sharing and certain payments for prescription drug costs for which we are not at risk. these provisions, certain of which are described below, affect our ultimate payments from cms.
the premiums from cms are subject to risk corridor provisions which compare costs targeted in our annual bids to actual prescription drug costs, limited to actual costs that would have been incurred under the standard coverage as defined by cms. variances exceeding certain thresholds may result in cms making additional payments to us or require us to refund to cms a portion of the premiums we received (known as a "risk corridor"). we estimate and recognize an adjustment to premiums revenue related to the risk corridor payment settlement based upon pharmacy claims experience. the estimate of the settlement associated with these risk corridor provisions requires us to consider factors that may not be certain, including member eligibility differences with cms. our estimate of the settlement associated with the medicare part d risk corridor provisions was a net payable of $170 million at december 31, 2019 and 2018.
reinsurance and low-income cost subsidies represent payments from cms in connection with the medicare part d program for which we assume no risk. reinsurance subsidies represent payments for cms's portion of claims costs which exceed the member's out-of-pocket threshold, or the catastrophic coverage level. low-income cost subsidies represent payments from cms for all or a portion of the deductible, the coinsurance and co-payment amounts above the out-of-pocket threshold for low-income beneficiaries. monthly prospective payments from cms for reinsurance and low-income cost subsidies are based on assumptions submitted with our annual bid. a reconciliation and settlement of cms's prospective subsidies against actual prescription drug costs we paid is made after the end of the applicable year.
settlement of the reinsurance and low-income cost subsidies as well as the risk corridor payment is based on a reconciliation made approximately 9 months after the close of each calendar year. this reconciliation process requires us to submit claims data necessary for cms to administer the program. our claims data may not pass cms's claims edit processes due to various reasons, including discrepancies in eligibility or classification of low-income members. to the extent our data does not pass cms's claim edit processes, we may bear the risk for all or a portion of the claim which otherwise may have been subject to the risk corridor provision or payment which we would have otherwise received as a low-income subsidy or reinsurance claim. in addition, in the event the settlement represents an amount cms owes us, there is a negative impact on our cash flows and financial condition as a result of financing cms's share of the risk. the opposite is true in the event the settlement represents an amount we owe cms.
•   we are also subject to various other governmental audits and investigations. under state laws, our hmos and health insurance companies are audited by state departments of insurance for financial and contractual compliance. our hmos are audited for compliance with health services by state departments of health. audits and investigations, including audits of risk adjustment data, are also conducted by state attorneys general, cms, hhs-oig, the office of personnel management, the department of justice, the department of labor, and the defense contract audit agency. all of these activities could result in the loss of licensure or the right to participate in various programs, including a limitation on our ability to market or sell products, the imposition of fines, penalties and other civil and criminal sanctions, or changes in our business practices. the outcome of any current or future governmental or internal investigations cannot be accurately predicted, nor can we predict any resulting penalties, fines or other sanctions that may be imposed at the discretion of federal or state regulatory authorities. nevertheless, it is reasonably possible that any such outcome of litigation, penalties, fines or other sanctions could be substantial, and the outcome of these matters may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position, and cash flows. certain of these matters could also affect our reputation. in addition, disclosure of any adverse investigation or audit results or sanctions could negatively affect our industry or our reputation in various markets and make it more difficult for us to sell our products and services.
our business activities are subject to substantial government regulation. new laws or regulations, or legislative, judicial, or regulatory changes in existing laws or regulations or their manner of application could increase our cost of doing business and may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations (including restricting revenue, enrollment and premium growth in certain products and market segments, restricting our ability to expand into new markets, increasing our medical and operating costs by, among other things, requiring a minimum benefit ratio on insured products, lowering our medicare payment rates and increasing our expenses associated with assessments); our financial position (including our ability to maintain the value of our goodwill); and our cash flows.
the health care reform law and other current or future legislative, judicial or regulatory changes the patient protection and affordable care act and the health care and education reconciliation act of 2010 (which we collectively refer to as the health care reform law) enacted significant reforms to various aspects of the u.s. health insurance industry. certain significant provisions of the health care reform law include, among others, mandated coverage requirements, mandated benefits and guarantee issuance associated with commercial medical insurance, rebates to policyholders based on minimum benefit ratios, adjustments to medicare advantage premiums, the establishment of federally facilitated or state-based exchanges coupled with programs designed to spread risk among insurers, and the introduction of plan designs based on set actuarial values. in addition, the health care reform law established insurance industry assessments, including an annual health insurance industry fee. the annual health insurance industry fee was suspended in 2019, but will resume for calendar year 2020, not be deductible for income tax purposes, and significantly increase our effective tax rate. in 2018, the fee levied on the health insurance industry was $14.3 billion. under current law, the health industry fee will be permanently repealed beginning in calendar year 2021.
it is reasonably possible that the health care reform law and related regulations, as well as other current or future legislative, judicial or regulatory changes, including restrictions on our ability to manage our provider network or otherwise operate our business, or restrictions on profitability, including reviews by regulatory bodies that may compare our medicare advantage business profitability to our non-medicare advantage business profitability, or compare the profitability of various products within our medicare advantage business, and require that they remain within certain ranges of each other, increases in member benefits or changes to member eligibility criteria without corresponding increases in premium payments to us, or increases in regulation of our prescription drug benefit businesses, may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations (including restricting revenue, enrollment and premium growth in certain products and market segments, restricting our ability to expand into new markets, increasing our medical and operating costs, further lowering our medicare payment rates and increasing our expenses associated with assessments); our financial position (including our ability to maintain the value of our goodwill); and our cash flows.
additionally, potential legislative changes or judicial determinations, including activities to repeal or replace the health care reform law or declare all or certain portions of the health care reform law unconstitutional, creates uncertainty for our business, and we cannot predict when, or in what form, such legislative changes or judicial determinations may occur.
health insurance portability and accountability act (hipaa) and the health information technology for economic and clinical health act (hitech act)
the use of individually identifiable health data by our business is regulated at federal and state levels. these laws and rules are changed frequently by legislation or administrative interpretation. various state laws address the use and maintenance of individually identifiable health data. most are derived from the privacy provisions in the federal gramm-leach-bliley act and the health insurance portability and accountability act, or hipaa. hipaa includes administrative provisions directed at simplifying electronic data interchange through standardizing transactions, establishing uniform health care provider, payer, and employer identifiers, and seeking protections for confidentiality and security of patient data. the rules do not provide for complete federal preemption of state laws, but rather preempt all inconsistent state laws unless the state law is more stringent.
these regulations set standards for the security of electronic health information, including requirements that insurers provide customers with notice regarding how their non-public personal information is used, including an opportunity to "opt out" of certain disclosures. violations of these rules could subject us to significant criminal and civil penalties, including significant monetary penalties. compliance with hipaa regulations requires significant systems enhancements, training and administrative effort. hipaa can also expose us to additional liability for violations by our business associates (e.g., entities that provide services to health plans and providers).
the hitech act, one part of the american recovery and reinvestment act of 2009, significantly broadened the scope of the privacy and security regulations of hipaa. among other requirements, the hitech act and hipaa mandate individual notification in the event of a breach of unsecured, individually identifiable health information, provides enhanced penalties for hipaa violations, requires business associates to comply with certain provisions of the hipaa privacy and security rule, and grants enforcement authority to state attorneys general in addition to the hhs office of civil rights.
in addition, there are numerous federal and state laws and regulations addressing patient and consumer privacy concerns, including unauthorized access or theft of personal information. state statutes and regulations vary from state to state and could impose additional penalties. violations of hipaa or applicable federal or state laws or regulations could subject us to significant criminal or civil penalties, including significant monetary penalties. compliance with hipaa and other privacy regulations requires significant systems enhancements, training and administrative effort.
american recovery and reinvestment act of 2009 (arra)
on february 17, 2009, the american recovery and reinvestment act of 2009, or arra, was enacted into law. in addition to including a temporary subsidy for health care continuation coverage issued pursuant to the consolidated omnibus budget reconciliation act, or cobra, arra also expands and strengthens the privacy and security provisions of hipaa and imposes additional limits on the use and disclosure of protected health information, or phi. among other things, arra requires us and other covered entities to report any unauthorized release or use of or access to phi to any impacted individuals and to hhs in those instances where the unauthorized activity poses a significant risk of financial, reputational or other harm to the individuals, and to notify the media in any states where 500 or more people are impacted by any unauthorized release or use of or access to phi. arra also requires business associates to comply with certain hipaa provisions. arra also establishes higher civil and criminal penalties for covered entities and business associates who fail to comply with hipaa's provisions and requires hhs to issue regulations implementing its privacy and security enhancements.
corporate practice of medicine and other laws as a corporate entity, humana inc. is not licensed to practice medicine. many states in which we operate through our subsidiaries limit the practice of medicine to licensed individuals or professional organizations comprised of licensed individuals, and business corporations generally may not exercise control over the medical decisions of physicians. statutes and regulations relating to the practice of medicine, fee-splitting between physicians and referral sources, and similar issues vary widely from state to state. under management agreements between certain of our subsidiaries and affiliated physician-owned professional groups, these groups retain sole responsibility for all medical decisions, as well as for hiring and managing physicians and other licensed healthcare providers, developing operating policies and procedures, implementing professional standards and controls, and maintaining malpractice insurance. we believe that our health services operations comply with applicable state statutes regarding corporate practice of medicine, fee-splitting, and similar issues. however, any enforcement actions by governmental officials alleging non-compliance with these statutes, which could subject us to penalties or restructuring or reorganization of our business, may result in a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position, or cash flows.
anti-kickback, physician self-referral, and other fraud and abuse laws a federal law commonly referred to as the "anti-kickback statute" prohibits the offer, payment, solicitation, or receipt of any form of remuneration to induce, or in return for, the referral of medicare or other governmental health program patients or patient care opportunities, or in return for the purchase, lease, or order of items or services that are covered by medicare or other federal governmental health programs. because the prohibitions contained in the anti-kickback statute apply to the furnishing of items or services for which payment is made in "whole or in part," the anti-kickback statute could be implicated if any portion of an item or service we provide is covered by any of the state or federal health benefit programs described above. violation of these provisions constitutes a felony criminal offense and applicable sanctions could include exclusion from the medicare and medicaid programs.
section 1877 of the social security act, commonly known as the "stark law," prohibits physicians, subject to certain exceptions described below, from referring medicare or medicaid patients to an entity providing "designated health services" in which the physician, or an immediate family member, has an ownership or investment interest or with which the physician, or an immediate family member, has entered into a compensation arrangement. these prohibitions, contained in the omnibus budget reconciliation act of 1993, commonly known as "stark ii," amended prior federal physician self-referral legislation known as "stark i" by expanding the list of designated health services to a total of 11 categories of health services. the professional groups with which we are affiliated provide one or more of these designated health services. persons or entities found to be in violation of the stark law are subject to denial of payment for services furnished pursuant to an improper referral, civil monetary penalties, and exclusion from the medicare and medicaid programs.
many states also have enacted laws similar in scope and purpose to the anti-kickback statute and, in more limited instances, the stark law, that are not limited to services for which medicare or medicaid payment is made. in addition, most states have statutes, regulations, or professional codes that restrict a physician from accepting various kinds of remuneration in exchange for making referrals. these laws vary from state to state and have seldom been interpreted by the courts or regulatory agencies. in states that have enacted these statutes, we believe that regulatory authorities and state courts interpreting these statutes may regard federal law under the anti-kickback statute and the stark law as persuasive.
we believe that our operations comply with the anti-kickback statute, the stark law, and similar federal or state laws addressing fraud and abuse. these laws are subject to modification and changes in interpretation, and are enforced by authorities vested with broad discretion. we continually monitor developments in this area. if these laws are interpreted in a manner contrary to our interpretation or are reinterpreted or amended, or if new legislation is enacted with respect to healthcare fraud and abuse, illegal remuneration, or similar issues, we may be required to restructure our affected operations to maintain compliance with applicable law. there can be no assurances that any such restructuring will be possible or, if possible, would not have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position, or cash flows.
environmental we are subject to various federal, state, and local laws and regulations relating to the protection of human health and the environment. if an environmental regulatory agency finds any of our facilities to be in violation of environmental laws, penalties and fines may be imposed for each day of violation and the affected facility could be forced to cease operations. we could also incur other significant costs, such as cleanup costs or claims by third parties, as a result of violations of, or liabilities under, environmental laws. although we believe that our environmental practices, including waste handling and disposal practices, are in material compliance with applicable laws, future claims or violations, or changes in environmental laws, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position or cash flows.
state regulation of insurance-related products laws in each of the states (and puerto rico) in which we operate our hmos, ppos and other health insurance-related services regulate our operations including: capital adequacy and other licensing requirements, policy language describing benefits, mandated benefits and processes, entry, withdrawal or re-entry into a state or market, rate increases, delivery systems, utilization review procedures, quality assurance, complaint systems, enrollment requirements, claim payments, marketing, and advertising. the hmo, ppo, and other health insurance-related products we offer are sold under licenses issued by the applicable insurance regulators.
our licensed insurance subsidiaries are also subject to regulation under state insurance holding company and puerto rico regulations. these regulations generally require, among other things, prior approval and/or notice of new products, rates, benefit changes, and certain material transactions, including dividend payments, purchases or sales of assets, intercompany agreements, and the filing of various financial and operational reports.
any failure by us to manage acquisitions, divestitures and other significant transactions successfully may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position, and cash flows.
as part of our business strategy, we frequently engage in discussions with third parties regarding possible investments, acquisitions, divestitures, strategic alliances, joint ventures, and outsourcing transactions and often enter into agreements relating to such transactions in order to further our business objectives. in order to pursue our acquisition strategy successfully, we must identify suitable candidates for and successfully complete transactions, some of which may be large and complex, and manage post-closing issues such as the integration of acquired companies or employees. integration and other risks can be more pronounced for larger and more complicated transactions, transactions outside of our core business space, or if multiple transactions are pursued simultaneously. the failure to successfully integrate acquired entities and businesses or failure to produce results consistent with the financial model used in the analysis of our acquisitions, investments, joint ventures or strategic alliances may cause asset write-offs, restructuring costs or other expenses and may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position, and cash flows. if we fail to identify and complete successfully transactions that further our strategic objectives, we may be required to expend resources to develop products and technology internally. in addition, from time to time, we evaluate alternatives for our businesses that do not meet our strategic, growth or profitability objectives, and we may divest or wind down such businesses. there can be no assurance that we will be able to complete any such divestiture on terms favorable to us. the divestiture of certain businesses could result, individually or in the aggregate, in the recognition of material losses and a material adverse effect on our results of operations. in addition, divestitures may result in continued financial exposure to the divested businesses following the completion of the transaction. for example, in connection with a disposition, we may enter into transition or administrative service agreements, coinsurance arrangements, vendor relationships or other strategic relationships with the divested business, or we may agree to provide certain indemnities to the purchaser in any such transaction, each of which may result in additional expense and could have a material adverse effect on our result of operations.
if we fail to develop and maintain satisfactory relationships with the providers of care to our members, our business may be adversely affected.
we employ or contract with physicians, hospitals and other providers to deliver health care to our members. our products encourage or require our customers to use these contracted providers. a key component of our integrated care delivery strategy is to increase the number of providers who share medical cost risk with us or have financial incentives to deliver quality medical services in a cost-effective manner.
in any particular market, providers could refuse to contract with us, demand higher payments, or take other actions that could result in higher health care costs for us, less desirable products for customers and members or difficulty meeting regulatory or accreditation requirements. in some markets, some providers, particularly hospitals, physician specialty groups, physician/hospital organizations, or multi-specialty physician groups, may have significant market positions and negotiating power. in addition, physician or practice management companies, which aggregate physician practices for administrative efficiency and marketing leverage, may compete directly with us. if these providers refuse to contract with us, use their market position to negotiate unfavorable contracts with us or place us at a competitive disadvantage, or do not enter into contracts with us that encourage the delivery of quality medical services in a cost-effective manner, our ability to market products or to be profitable in those areas may be adversely affected.
in some situations, we have contracts with individual or groups of primary care providers for an actuarially determined, fixed fee per month to provide a basket of required medical services to our members. this type of contract is referred to as a "capitation" contract. the inability of providers to properly manage costs under these capitation arrangements can result in the financial instability of these providers and the termination of their relationship with us. in addition, payment or other disputes between a primary care provider and specialists with whom the primary care provider contracts can result in a disruption in the provision of services to our members or a reduction in the services available to our members. the financial instability or failure of a primary care provider to pay other providers for services rendered could lead those other providers to demand payment from us even though we have made our regular fixed payments to the primary provider. there can be no assurance that providers with whom we contract will properly manage the costs of services, maintain financial solvency or avoid disputes with other providers. any of these events may have a material adverse effect on the provision of services to our members and our results of operations, financial position, and cash flows.
our pharmacy business is highly competitive and subjects us to regulations in addition to those we face with our core health benefits businesses.
our in-house dispensing pharmacy business competes with locally owned drugstores, retail drugstore chains, supermarkets, discount retailers, membership clubs, internet companies and other mail-order and long-term care pharmacies. our pharmacy business also subjects us to extensive federal, state, and local regulation. the practice of pharmacy is generally regulated at the state level by state boards of pharmacy. many of the states where we deliver pharmaceuticals, including controlled substances, have laws and regulations that require out-of-state mail-order pharmacies to register with that state's board of pharmacy. federal agencies further regulate our pharmacy operations, requiring registration with the u.s. drug enforcement administration and individual state controlled substance authorities in order to dispense controlled substances. in addition, the fda inspects facilities in connection with procedures to effect recalls of prescription drugs. the federal trade commission also has requirements for mail-order sellers of goods. the u.s. postal service, or usps, has statutory authority to restrict the transmission of drugs and medicines through the mail to a degree that may have an adverse effect on our mail-order operations. the usps historically has exercised this statutory authority only with respect to controlled substances. if the usps restricts our ability to deliver drugs through the mail, alternative means of delivery are available to us. however, alternative means of delivery could be significantly more expensive. the u.s. department of transportation has regulatory authority to impose restrictions on drugs inserted in the stream of commerce. these regulations generally do not apply to the usps and its operations. in addition, we are subject to cms rules regarding the administration of our pdp plans and intercompany pricing between our pdp plans and our pharmacy business.
we are also subject to risks inherent in the packaging and distribution of pharmaceuticals and other health care products, including manufacturing or other supply issues that could impact the availability of such products, and the application of state laws related to the operation of internet and mail-order pharmacies. the failure to adhere to these laws and regulations may expose us to civil and criminal penalties.
changes in the prescription drug industry pricing benchmarks may adversely affect our financial performance.
contracts in the prescription drug industry generally use certain published benchmarks to establish pricing for prescription drugs. these benchmarks include average wholesale price, which is referred to as "awp," average selling price, which is referred to as "asp," and wholesale acquisition cost. it is uncertain whether payors, pharmacy providers, pharmacy benefit managers, or pbms, and others in the prescription drug industry will continue to utilize awp as it has previously been calculated, or whether other pricing benchmarks will be adopted for establishing prices within the industry. legislation may lead to changes in the pricing for medicare and medicaid programs. regulators have conducted investigations into the use of awp for federal program payment, and whether the use of awp has inflated drug expenditures by the medicare and medicaid programs. federal and state proposals have sought to change the basis for calculating payment of certain drugs by the medicare and medicaid programs. adoption of asp in lieu of awp as the measure for determining payment by medicare or medicaid programs for the drugs sold in our in-house dispensing pharmacy business may reduce the revenues and gross margins of this business which may result in a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position, and cash flows.
if we do not continue to earn and retain purchase discounts and volume rebates from pharmaceutical manufacturers at current levels, our gross margins may decline.
we have contractual relationships with pharmaceutical manufacturers or wholesalers that provide us with purchase discounts and volume rebates on certain prescription drugs dispensed through our in-house dispensing and specialty pharmacies. these discounts and volume rebates are generally passed on to clients in the form of steeper price discounts. changes in existing federal or state laws or regulations or in their interpretation by courts and agencies or the adoption of new laws or regulations relating to patent term extensions, and purchase discount and volume rebate arrangements with pharmaceutical manufacturers, may reduce the discounts or volume rebates we receive and materially adversely impact our results of operations, financial position, and cash flows.
our ability to obtain funds from certain of our licensed subsidiaries is restricted by state insurance regulations.
because we operate as a holding company, we are dependent upon dividends and administrative expense reimbursements from our subsidiaries to fund the obligations of humana inc., our parent company. certain of our insurance subsidiaries operate in states that regulate the payment of dividends, loans, administrative expense reimbursements or other cash transfers to humana inc., and require minimum levels of equity as well as limit investments to approved securities. the amount of dividends that may be paid to humana inc. by these insurance subsidiaries, without prior approval by state regulatory authorities, or ordinary dividends, is limited based on the entity's level of statutory income and statutory capital and surplus. in most states, prior notification is provided before paying a dividend even if approval is not required. actual dividends paid may vary due to consideration of excess statutory capital and surplus and expected future surplus requirements related to, for example, premium volume and product mix. dividends from our non-insurance companies such as in our healthcare services segment are generally not restricted by departments of insurance. in the event that we are unable to provide sufficient capital to fund the obligations of humana inc., our results of operations, financial position, and cash flows may be materially adversely affected.
downgrades in our debt ratings, should they occur, may adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition.
claims paying ability, financial strength, and debt ratings by recognized rating organizations are an increasingly important factor in establishing the competitive position of insurance companies. ratings information is broadly disseminated and generally used throughout the industry. we believe our claims paying ability and financial strength ratings are an important factor in marketing our products to certain of our customers. in addition, our debt ratings impact both the cost and availability of future borrowings. each of the rating agencies reviews its ratings periodically and there can be no assurance that current ratings will be maintained in the future. our ratings reflect each rating agency's opinion of our financial strength, operating performance, and ability to meet our debt obligations or obligations to policyholders, but are not evaluations directed toward the protection of investors in our common stock and should not be relied upon as such.
historically, rating agencies take action to lower ratings due to, among other things, perceived concerns about liquidity or solvency, the competitive environment in the insurance industry, the inherent uncertainty in determining reserves for future claims, the outcome of pending litigation and regulatory investigations, and possible changes in the methodology or criteria applied by the rating agencies. in addition, rating agencies have come under regulatory and public scrutiny over the ratings assigned to various fixed-income products. as a result, rating agencies may (i) become more conservative in their methodology and criteria, (ii) increase the frequency or scope of their credit reviews, (iii) request additional information from the companies that they rate, or (iv) adjust upward the capital and other requirements employed in the rating agency models for maintenance of certain ratings levels.
we believe that some of our customers place importance on our credit ratings, and we may lose customers and compete less successfully if our ratings were to be downgraded. in addition, our credit ratings affect our ability to obtain investment capital on favorable terms. if our credit ratings were to be lowered, our cost of borrowing likely would increase, our sales and earnings could decrease, and our results of operations, financial position, and cash flows may be materially adversely affected.
the securities and credit markets may experience volatility and disruption, which may adversely affect our business.
volatility or disruption in the securities and credit markets could impact our investment portfolio. we evaluate our investment securities for impairment on a quarterly basis. this review is subjective and requires a high degree of judgment. for the purpose of determining gross realized gains and losses, the cost of investment securities sold is based upon specific identification. for debt securities held, we recognize an impairment loss in income when the fair value of the debt security is less than the carrying value and we have the intent to sell the debt security or it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the debt security before recovery of our amortized cost basis, or if a credit loss has occurred. when we do not intend to sell a security in an unrealized loss position, potential other-than-temporary impairments are considered using variety of factors, including the length of time and extent to which the fair value has been less than cost; adverse conditions specifically related to the industry, geographic area or financial condition of the issuer or underlying collateral of a security; payment structure of the security; changes in credit rating of the security by the rating agencies; the volatility of the fair value changes; and changes in fair value of the security after the balance sheet date. for debt securities, we take into account expectations of relevant market and economic data. we continuously review our investment portfolios and there is a continuing risk that declines in fair value may occur and additional material realized losses from sales or other-than-temporary impairments may be recorded in future periods.
we believe our cash balances, investment securities, operating cash flows, and funds available under our credit agreement or from other public or private financing sources, taken together, provide adequate resources to fund ongoing operating and regulatory requirements, acquisitions, future expansion opportunities, and capital expenditures for at least the next twelve months, as well as to refinance or repay debt, and repurchase shares. however, continuing adverse securities and credit market conditions may significantly affect the availability of credit. while there is no assurance in the current economic environment, we have no reason to believe the lenders participating in our credit agreement will not be willing and able to provide financing in accordance with the terms of the agreement.
our access to additional credit will depend on a variety of factors such as market conditions, the general availability of credit, both to the overall market and our industry, our credit ratings and debt capacity, as well as the possibility that customers or lenders could develop a negative perception of our long or short-term financial prospects. similarly, our access to funds could be limited if regulatory authorities or rating agencies were to take negative actions against us. if a combination of these factors were to occur, we may not be able to successfully obtain additional financing on favorable terms or at all.
item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for discussion of 2017 items and year-over-year comparisons between 2018 and 2017 that are not included in this 2019 form 10-k, refer to "item 7. - management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations" found in our form 10-k for the year ended december 31, 2018, that was filed with the securities and exchange commission on february 21, 2019.
executive overview general humana inc., headquartered in louisville, kentucky, is a leading health and well-being company committed to helping our millions of medical and specialty members achieve their best health. our successful history in care delivery and health plan administration is helping us create a new kind of integrated care with the power to improve health and well‐being and lower costs. our efforts are leading to a better quality of life for people with medicare, families, individuals, military service personnel, and communities at large. to accomplish that, we support physicians and other health care professionals as they work to deliver the right care in the right place for their patients, our members. our range of clinical capabilities, resources and tools, such as in‐home care, behavioral health, pharmacy services, data analytics and wellness solutions, combine to produce a simplified experience that makes health care easier to navigate and more effective.
our industry relies on two key statistics to measure performance. the benefit ratio, which is computed by taking total benefits expense as a percentage of premiums revenue, represents a statistic used to measure underwriting profitability. the operating cost ratio, which is computed by taking total operating costs, excluding merger termination fee and related costs, net, and depreciation and amortization, as a percentage of total revenue less investment income, represents a statistic used to measure administrative spending efficiency.
business segments we manage our business with three reportable segments: retail, group and specialty, and healthcare services. beginning january 1, 2018, we exited the individual commercial fully-insured medical health insurance business, as well as certain other business in 2018, and therefore no longer report separately the individual commercial segment and the other businesses category in the current year. previously, the other businesses category included businesses that were not individually reportable because they did not meet the quantitative thresholds required by generally accepted accounting principles, primarily our closed-block of commercial long-term care insurance policies which were sold in 2018. the reportable segments are based on a combination of the type of health plan customer and adjacent businesses centered on well-being solutions for our health plans and other customers, as described below. these segment groupings are consistent with information used by our chief executive officer, the chief operating decision maker, to assess performance and allocate resources. see note 18 to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8. - financial statements and supplementary data for segment financial information.
the retail segment consists of medicare benefits, marketed to individuals or directly via group medicare accounts. in addition, the retail segment also includes our contract with cms to administer the limited income newly eligible transition, or li-net, prescription drug plan program and contracts with various states to provide medicaid, dual eligible, and long-term support services benefits, which we refer to collectively as our state-based contracts. the group and specialty segment consists of employer group commercial fully-insured medical and specialty health insurance benefits marketed to individuals and employer groups, including dental, vision, and other supplemental health benefits, as well as administrative services only, or aso products. in addition, our group and specialty segment includes our military services business, primarily our tricare t2017 east region contract. the healthcare services segment includes our services offered to our health plan members as well as to third parties, including pharmacy solutions, provider services, and clinical care service, such as home health and other services and capabilities to promote wellness and advance population health, including our minority investment in kindred at home.
the results of each segment are measured by income before income taxes and equity in net earnings from kindred at home, or segment earnings. transactions between reportable segments primarily consist of sales of services rendered by our healthcare services segment, primarily pharmacy, provider, and clinical care services, to our retail and group and specialty segment customers. intersegment sales and expenses are recorded at fair value and eliminated in consolidation. members served by our segments often use the same provider networks, enabling us in some instances to obtain more favorable contract terms with providers. our segments also share indirect costs and assets. as a result, the profitability of each segment is interdependent. we allocate most operating expenses to our segments. assets and certain corporate income and expenses are not allocated to the segments, including the portion of investment income not supporting segment operations, interest expense on corporate debt, and certain other corporate expenses. these items are managed at a corporate level. these corporate amounts are reported separately from our reportable segments and are included with intersegment eliminations.
seasonality one of the product offerings of our retail segment is medicare stand-alone prescription drug plans, or pdps, under the medicare part d program. our quarterly retail segment earnings and operating cash flows are impacted by the medicare part d benefit design and changes in the composition of our membership. the medicare part d benefit design results in coverage that varies as a member's cumulative out-of-pocket costs pass through successive stages of a member's plan period, which begins annually on january 1 for renewals. these plan designs generally result in us sharing a greater portion of the responsibility for total prescription drug costs in the early stages and less in the latter stages. as a result, the pdp benefit ratio generally decreases as the year progresses. in addition, the number of low income senior members as well as year-over-year changes in the mix of membership in our stand-alone pdp products affects the quarterly benefit ratio pattern.
in addition, the retail segment also experiences seasonality in the operating cost ratio as a result of costs incurred in the second half of the year associated with the medicare marketing season.
our group and specialty segment also experiences seasonality in the benefit ratio pattern. however, the effect is opposite of medicare stand-alone pdp in the retail segment, with the group and specialty segment's benefit ratio increasing as fully-insured members progress through their annual deductible and maximum out-of-pocket expenses.
aetna merger on february 16, 2017, under the terms of the agreement and plan of merger, or merger agreement, with aetna inc., and certain wholly owned subsidiaries of aetna inc., which we collectively refer to as aetna, we received a breakup fee of $1 billion from aetna, which is included in our consolidated statement of income in the line captioned "merger termination fee and related costs, net."
acquisitions and divestitures in the first quarter of 2020, we acquired privately held enclara healthcare, or enclara, one of the nation's largest hospice pharmacy and benefit management providers for cash consideration of approximately $707 million, net of cash received. the purchase accounting is incomplete due to the timing of the availability of information.
also in the first quarter of 2020, our partners in primary care wholly-owned subsidiary entered into a strategic partnership with welsh, carson, anderson & stowe, or wcas, to accelerate the expansion of our primary care model. the wcas partnership is expected to open approximately 50 payor-agnostic, senior-focused primary care centers over 3 years beginning in 2020. partners in primary care committed to the acquisition of a non-controlling interest in the approximately $600 million entity. in addition, the agreement includes a series of put and call options through which wcas may require us to purchase their interest in the entity and, through which we may acquire wcas's interest over the next 5 - 10 years.
in the third quarter of 2018, we completed the sale of our wholly-owned subsidiary kmg america corporation, or kmg, to continental general insurance company, or cgic, a texas-based insurance company wholly owned by hc2 holdings, inc., a diversified holding company. kmg's subsidiary, kanawha insurance company, or kic, included our closed block of non-strategic commercial long-term care policies. upon closing, we funded the transaction with approximately $190 million of parent company cash contributed into kmg, subject to customary adjustments, in addition to the transfer of approximately $160 million of statutory capital with the sale.
also in the third quarter of 2018, we, along with tpg capital, or tpg, and wcas (together, the "sponsors"), completed the acquisitions of kindred and curo, respectively, merging curo with the hospice business of kindred at home. as part of these transactions, we acquired a 40% minority interest in kindred at home, a leading home health and hospice company, for total cash consideration of approximately $1.1 billion.
in the second quarter of 2018, we acquired family physicians group, or fpg, for cash consideration of approximately $185 million, net of cash received. fpg is one of the largest at-risk providers serving medicare advantage and managed medicaid hmo patients in greater orlando, florida with a footprint that includes clinics located in lake, orange, osceola and seminole counties. the acquisition of fpg advances our strategy of helping physicians and clinicians evolve from treating health episodically to managing health holistically.
in the first quarter of 2018, we acquired the remaining equity interest in mcci holdings, llc, or mcci, a privately held management service organization headquartered in miami, florida, which primarily coordinates medical care for medicare advantage beneficiaries in florida and texas. the purchase price consisted primarily of $169 million cash, as well as our existing investment in mcci and a note receivable and a revolving note with an aggregate balance of $383 million.
these transactions are more fully discussed in note 3 and note 4 to the consolidated financial statements.
•   our 2019 results reflect the continued implementation of our strategy to offer our members affordable health care combined with a positive consumer experience in growing markets. at the core of this strategy is our integrated care delivery model, which unites quality care, high member engagement, and sophisticated data analytics. our approach to primary, physician-directed care for our members aims to provide quality care that is consistent, integrated, cost-effective, and member-focused, provided by both employed physicians and physicians with network contract arrangements. the model is designed to improve health outcomes and affordability for individuals and for the health system as a whole, while offering our members a simple, seamless healthcare experience. we believe this strategy is positioning us for long-term growth in both membership and earnings. we offer providers a continuum of opportunities to increase the integration of care and offer assistance to providers in transitioning from a fee-for-service to a value-based arrangement. these include performance bonuses, shared savings and shared risk relationships. at december 31, 2019, approximately 2,407,000 members, or 67%, of our individual medicare advantage members were in value-based relationships under our integrated care delivery model, as compared to 2,039,100 members, or 67%, at december 31, 2018. medicare advantage and dual demonstration program membership enrolled in a humana chronic care management program was 868,800 at december 31, 2019, an increase of 21.3% from 716,000 at december 31, 2018. these members may not be unique to each program since members have the ability to enroll in multiple programs. the increase is driven by our improved process for identifying and enrolling members in the appropriate program at the right time, coupled with growth in special needs plans, or snp, membership.
•   on february 5, 2020, after the stock market closed, the centers for medicare and medicaid services ("cms") issued part ii of the 2021 advance notice of methodological changes for medicare advantage capitation rates and part c and part d payment policies (the "advance notice"). cms has invited public comment on the advance notice before publishing final rates on april 6, 2020 (the "final notice").
in the advance notice, cms estimates medicare advantage plans across the sector will, on average, experience a 0.93 percent increase in benchmark funding based on proposals included therein. as indicated by cms, its estimate excludes the impact of fee-for-service county rebasing/repricing because the related impact is dependent upon finalization of certain data, which will be available with the publication of the final notice.  based on our preliminary analysis using the same factors cms included in its estimate, the components of which are detailed on cms' website, we anticipate that the proposals in the advance notice would result in a change to our benchmark funding relatively in line with cms' estimate.
also on february 5, 2020, cms issued a proposed rule (which we refer to as the "2021 proposed rule") related to the administration of the ma and part d programs, including, among other things, the agency's implementation of recent legislation removing the limitation on ma eligibility for end-stage-renal-disease, or esrd, medicare-eligible beneficiaries beginning in 2021, allowing for medicare advantage plans to offer additional supplemental benefits including telehealth, and addressing opioid recovery and treatment. the 2021 proposed rule also recognizes the potential opportunity to create new options for beneficiaries, including esrd beneficiaries, and their access to care through greater flexibility around current network adequacy requirements.  cms has invited public comments to the 2021 proposed rule on or before april 6, 2020.
the advance notice and the 2021 proposed rule are subject to the required notice and comment period, and we cannot predict when or to what extent cms will adopt the proposals in the advance notice or the 2021 proposed rule. we will be drawing upon our program expertise to provide cms formal commentary on the impact of both the advance notice and the 2021 proposed rule and the related impact upon medicare beneficiaries' quality of care and service to our members through the ma and part d programs.
•   net income was $2.7 billion for 2019 compared to $1.7 billion in 2018 and earnings per diluted common share increased $7.94 from $12.16 earnings per diluted common share in 2018 to $20.10 earnings per diluted common share in 2019. this comparison was primarily impacted by higher segment earnings in our retail and healthcare services segments, partially offset by lower group and specialty segment earnings. these changes were further favorably impacted by the put/call valuation adjustments associated with our investment in kindred at home and by a lower number of shares used to compute dilutive earnings per share, primarily reflecting share repurchases. in addition, year-over-year comparison to 2019 was impacted by the loss on the sale of kmg of $786 million recognized in 2018.
•   contributing to our retail segment revenue growth was our individual and group medicare advantage membership, which increased 550,700 members, or 15.5%, from 3,561,800 members at december 31, 2018 to 4,112,500 members at december 31, 2019.
•   our operating cash flow of $5.3 billion for 2019 improved from $2.2 billion for 2018, reflecting the significant impact of increasing premiums and enrollment, as premiums generally are collected in advance of claim payments by a period of up to several months. the year-over-year comparison was further impacted by the timing of other working capital changes, higher earnings in 2019 versus 2018, and the negative impact on 2018 cash flows resulting from the funding of reinsurance transactions in connection with the sale of kmg.
•   in july 2019, the board of directors approved a $3.0 billion share repurchase authorization with an expiration date of june 30, 2022. we subsequently entered into an agreement with a third-party financial institution on july 31, 2019, to effect a $1.0 billion asr program under the authorization. under the terms of this program, which was completed in the fourth quarter of 2019, we repurchased approximately 3,376,200 shares at an average price, after a discount, of $296.19. aside from the completion of the asr program, we have not completed any open market stock repurchases. as of february 19, 2020, we had a remaining repurchase authorization of $2.0 billion.
•   in august 2019, we issued $500 million of 3.125% senior notes due august 15, 2029, and $500 million of 3.950% senior notes due august 15, 2049. our net proceeds, reduced for the underwriters discount and commission and offering expenses, were $987 million. we used the net proceeds from this offering, together with available cash, to repay the $650 million outstanding amount due under our term note in august 2019, and the $400 million aggregate principal amount of our 2.625% senior notes due on its maturity date of october 1, 2019.
•   in 2019 we initiated an involuntary workforce optimization program that will allow us to promote operational excellence, accelerate our strategy, fund critical initiatives and advance our growth objectives. as a result we recorded estimated charges of $47 million, or $0.26 per diluted common share, on the corporate level, included with operating costs in the condensed consolidated statements of income. we expect this liability to be primarily paid within 12 months.
health care reform the health care reform law enacted significant reforms to various aspects of the u.s. health insurance industry. certain significant provisions of the health care reform law include, among others, mandated coverage requirements, mandated benefits and guarantee issuance associated with commercial medical insurance, rebates to policyholders based on minimum benefit ratios, adjustments to medicare advantage premiums, the establishment of federally facilitated or state-based exchanges coupled with programs designed to spread risk among insurers, and the introduction of plan designs based on set actuarial values. in addition, the health care reform law established insurance industry assessments, including an annual health insurance industry fee. the annual health insurance industry fee was suspended in 2019, but will resume for calendar year 2020, not be deductible for income tax purposes, and significantly increase our effective tax rate. in 2018, the fee levied on the health insurance industry was $14.3 billion. under current law, the health industry fee will be permanently repealed beginning in calendar year 2021.
it is reasonably possible that the health care reform law and related regulations, as well as other current or future legislative, judicial or regulatory changes, including restrictions on our ability to manage our provider network or otherwise operate our business, or restrictions on profitability, including reviews by regulatory bodies that may compare our medicare advantage profitability to our non-medicare advantage business profitability, or compare the profitability of various products within our medicare advantage business, and require that they remain within certain ranges of each other, increases in member benefits or changes to member eligibility criteria without corresponding increases in premium payments to us, or increases in regulation of our prescription drug benefit businesses, in the aggregate may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations (including restricting revenue, enrollment and premium growth in certain products and market segments, restricting our ability to expand into new markets, increasing our medical and operating costs, further lowering our medicare payment rates and increasing our expenses associated with assessments); our financial position (including our ability to maintain the value of our goodwill); and our cash flows.
we intend for the discussion of our financial condition and results of operations that follows to assist in the understanding of our financial statements and related changes in certain key items in those financial statements from year to year, including the primary factors that accounted for those changes. transactions between reportable segments primarily consist of sales of services rendered by our healthcare services segment, primarily pharmacy, provider, and clinical care services, to our retail and group and specialty segment customers and are described in note 18 to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8. - financial statements and supplementary data in this 2019 form 10-k.

summary net income for 2019 was $2.7 billion, or $20.10 per diluted common share, compared to $1.7 billion, or $12.16 per diluted common share, in 2018. this increase primarily was impacted by our medicare advantage business and healthcare services segment, as well as by previously implemented productivity initiatives that led to significant operating cost efficiencies in 2019. these impacts were partially offset by strategic investments in our integrated care delivery model, the impact of higher compensation accruals for the annual incentive plan, or aip, offered to employees across all levels of the company, lower group and specialty segment earnings, increased spending associated with the 2020 medicare annual election period, or aep, and the impact of workforce optimization. these changes were further favorably impacted by the put/call valuation adjustments associated with our investment in kindred at home and by a lower number of shares used to compute dilutive earnings per share, primarily reflecting share repurchases. in addition, 2019 was impacted by the loss on the sale of kmg recognized in 2018.
premiums revenue consolidated premiums increased $8.0 billion, or 14.6%, from $54.9 billion for 2018 to $62.9 billion for 2019 primarily due to higher premiums in the retail segment, driven by higher premium revenues from our medicare advantage business resulting from membership growth and higher per member premiums associated with individual medicare advantage. these increases were partially offset by the impact of declining stand-alone pdp membership, as well as lower premiums in the group and specialty segment as discussed in the detailed segment results discussion that follows.
services revenue consolidated services revenue decreased $18 million, or 1.2%, from $1.5 billion for 2018 to $1.4 billion for 2019, primarily due to a decrease in services revenue in the group and specialty segment, partially offset by an increase in the healthcare services segment as detailed in the segment results discussion that follows.
investment income investment income was $501 million for 2019, decreasing $13 million, or 2.5%, from 2018, primarily due to lower realized capital gains, partially offset by higher average invested balances and interest rates.
benefits expense consolidated benefits expense was $53.9 billion for 2019, an increase of $8.0 billion, or 17.4%, from 2018 reflecting an increase in the retail and group and specialty segments benefits expense as discussed in the detailed segment results discussion that follows. as more fully described herein under the section entitled "benefits expense recognition", actuarial standards require the use of assumptions based on moderately adverse experience, which generally results in favorable reserve development, or reserves that are considered redundant. we experienced favorable medical claims reserve development related to prior fiscal years of $336 million in 2019 and $503 million in 2018.
the consolidated benefit ratio for 2019 was 85.6%, an increase of 210 basis points from 2018 primarily due to the suspension of the health insurance industry fee in 2019, which was contemplated in the pricing and benefit design of our products, lower favorable prior-period medical claims reserve development, an increase in the group and specialty benefit ratio as discussed in the detailed segment results discussion that follows, and the shift in medicare membership mix due to the loss of stand-alone pdp members and significant growth in medicare advantage members. these increases were partially offset by engaging our medicare advantage members in clinical programs, as well as ensuring they are appropriately documented under the cms risk-adjustment model, and lower than expected medical costs as compared to the assumptions used in the pricing of our individual medicare advantage business for 2019. favorable prior-period medical claims reserve development decreased the consolidated benefit ratio by approximately 50 basis points in 2019 and 90 basis points in 2018.
operating costs our segments incur both direct and shared indirect operating costs. we allocate the indirect costs shared by the segments primarily as a function of revenues. as a result, the profitability of each segment is interdependent.
consolidated operating costs decreased $144 million, or 1.9%, from 2018 to $7.4 billion in 2019 reflecting a decrease in operating costs in the retail and the group and specialty segments as discussed in the detailed segment results discussion that follows.
the consolidated operating cost ratio for 2019 was 11.5%, decreasing 180 basis points from 13.3% in 2018 primarily due to the suspension of the health insurance industry fee in 2019, scale efficiencies associated with growth in our medicare advantage membership, and significant operating cost efficiencies in 2019 driven by previously implemented productivity initiatives. these improvements were partially offset by strategic investments in our integrated care delivery model, the impact of higher compensation expense accruals in 2019 for the aip offered to employees across all levels, increased spending associated with the medicare aep, and charges associated with workforce optimization. the higher compensation accruals resulted from our continued strong performance, including customer satisfaction as measured by the net promoter score, along with higher than anticipated individual medicare advantage membership growth. the nondeductible health insurance industry fee impacted the operating cost ratio by approximately 180 basis points in 2018.
depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization in 2019 totaled $458 million compared to $405 million in 2018, an increase of 13.1%, primarily due to capital expenditures.
interest expense interest expense was $242 million for 2019 compared to $218 million for 2018, an increase of $24 million, or 11.0% the increase was primarily due to the higher average borrowings outstanding including the impact of the borrowings under the november 2018 term loan agreement and senior notes issued in august 2019.
income taxes our effective tax rate during 2019 was 22.0% compared to the effective tax rate of 18.9% in 2018. this change primarily reflects the impact of the suspension of the non-deductible health insurance industry fee in 2019 as well as the deferred tax benefit recognized in 2018 from the loss on sale of kmg. the effective income tax rate in 2018 reflected a $430 million deferred tax benefit, resulting from the loss on the sale of kmg attributable to its original tax basis and subsequent capital contributions to fund accumulated losses. see note 12 to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8. - financial statements and supplementary data for a complete reconciliation of the federal statutory rate to the effective tax rate.

•   retail segment earnings were $2.2 billion in 2019, an increase of $502 million, or 29.0%, compared to $1.7 billion in 2018 primarily reflecting a lower operating cost ratio, partially offset by the higher benefit ratio as more fully described below. as expected, the higher-than-anticipated individual medicare advantage membership growth during the previous aep had a muted impact on the segment's earnings in 2019. while new medicare advantage members increase revenue, on average, they have a break even impact on segment earnings in the first year as they were not previously engaged in clinical programs or appropriately documented under the cms risk adjustment model, and accordingly, carry a higher benefit ratio.
•   individual medicare advantage membership increased 523,200 members, or 17.1%, from 3,064,000 members as of december 31, 2018 to 3,587,200 members as of december 31, 2019, primarily due to membership additions associated with the 2019 aep and open election period, or oep, for medicare beneficiaries. the oep sales period, which ran from january 1 to march 31, added approximately 43,700 members. since the conclusion of the oep, enrollment continued to increase due to strong sales to age-ins and those eligible for dual eligible special need plans, or d-snp. individual medicare advantage membership includes 288,200 d-snp members as of december 31, 2019, a net increase of 69,600, or 31.8%, from 218,600 december 31, 2018. for the full year 2020, we anticipate a net membership increase in our individual medicare advantage offerings of 270,000 members to 330,000 members.
•   group medicare advantage membership increased 27,500 members, or 5.5%, from 497,800 members as of december 31, 2018 to 525,300 members as of december 31, 2019, primarily due to net membership additions associated with the 2019 aep for medicare beneficiaries. for the full year 2020, we anticipate a net membership increase in our group medicare advantage offerings of approximately 90,000 members.
•   medicare stand-alone pdp membership decreased 639,100 members, or 12.8%, from 5,004,300 members as of december 31, 2018 to 4,365,200 members as of december 31, 2019, primarily reflecting net declines during the 2019 aep for medicare beneficiaries. the anticipated decline primarily was due to the competitive nature of the industry and the pricing discipline we have employed, which resulted in us no longer being the low cost plan in any market for 2019. for the full year 2020, we anticipate a net membership decline in our medicare stand-alone pdp offerings of approximately 550,000 members.
•   state-based medicaid membership increased 127,900 members, or 37.5%, from 341,100 members as of december 31, 2018 to 469,000 members as of december 31, 2019, primarily driven by the statewide award of a comprehensive contract under the managed medical assistance, or mma, program in florida. our january 31, 2020 state-based contracts membership was 608,000, representing growth of 139,000, or 30%, from december 31, 2019. this growth primarily reflects the impact of terminating the reinsurance agreement with caresource effective january 1, 2020, which ceded all risk for our kentucky medicaid contract.
•   retail segment premiums increased $8.1 billion, or 16.9%, from 2018 to 2019 period primarily due to medicare advantage membership growth and higher per member premiums, as well as increased state-based contracts membership. these favorable items were partially offset by the decline in membership in our stand-alone pdp offerings.
benefits expense
•   the retail segment benefit ratio of 86.4% for 2019 increased 130 basis points from 85.1% in 2018 primarily due to the suspension of the health insurance industry fee in 2019 which was contemplated in the pricing and benefit design of our products, lower favorable prior-period medical claims reserve development, as well as the shift in medicare membership mix due to the loss of stand-alone pdp members and the significant growth in medicare advantage members. these increases were partially offset by engaging our medicare advantage members in clinical programs as well as ensuring they are appropriately documented under the cms risk adjustment model, lower than expected medical costs as compared to the assumptions used in the pricing of our individual medicare advantage business for 2019, and the impact of a less severe flu season experienced in the first quarter of 2019 compared to that in the first quarter of 2018.
•   the retail segment's benefits expense for 2019 included the beneficial effect of $386 million in favorable prior-year medical claims reserve development versus $398 million in 2018. this favorable prior-year medical claims reserve development decreased the retail segment benefit ratio by approximately 70 basis points in 2019 versus approximately 80 basis points in 2018.
operating costs
•   the retail segment operating cost ratio of 9.4% for 2019 decreased 170 basis points from 11.1% in 2018 primarily due to the suspension of the health insurance industry fee in 2019, as well as scale efficiencies associated with growth in our medicare advantage membership, and significant operating cost efficiencies in 2019 driven by previously implemented productivity initiatives. these improvements were partially offset by the strategic investments in our integrated care delivery model, the impact of higher compensation expense accruals in 2019 for the aip as a result of our continued strong performance, and increased spending associated with the medicare aep.
•   the non-deductible health insurance industry fee increased the operating cost ratio by approximately 190 basis points in 2018.

•   group and specialty segment earnings were $28 million in 2019, a decrease of $333 million, or 92.2%, from $361 million in 2018 primarily due to a higher benefit ratio, along with lower military services business earnings. earnings comparisons related to the military services business were unfavorably impacted by the receipt of certain contractual incentives and adjustments in 2018 related to the previous tricare contract which did not recur in 2019. these decreases were partially offset by the improvement in the operating cost ratio as more fully described below.
•   fully-insured commercial group medical membership decreased 96,100 members, or 9.6% from 1,004,700 members as of december 31, 2018 primarily reflecting lower membership in small group accounts due in part to more small group accounts selecting level-funded aso products in 2019, as well as the loss of certain large group accounts due to the competitive pricing environment. the portion of group fully-insured commercial medical membership in small group accounts was approximately 59% at december 31, 2019 and 61% at december 31, 2018.
•   group aso commercial medical membership increased 47,300 members, or 9.8%, from 481,900 members as of december 31, 2018 to 529,200 members as of december 31, 2019 reflecting more small group accounts selecting level-funded aso products in 2019, partially offset by the loss of certain large group accounts as a
result of continued discipline in pricing of services for self-funded accounts amid a highly competitive environment.
•   military services membership increased 55,700 members, or 0.9%, from 5,928,600 members as of december 31, 2018 to 5,984,300 members as of december 31, 2019. membership includes military service members, retirees, and their families to whom we provide healthcare services under the current t2017 tricare east region contract. the current contract, which covers thirty-two states, became effective on january 1, 2018.
•   specialty membership decreased 646,400 members, or 10.6%, from 6,072,300 as of december 31, 2018 to 5,425,900 members as of december 31, 2019 primarily due to the loss of certain group accounts, including one jumbo account, offering stand-alone dental and vision products.
•   group and specialty segment premiums decreased $109 million, or 1.6%, from $6.8 billion in 2018 to $6.7 billion in 2019, primarily due to a decline in our fully-insured group commercial and specialty membership as well as the exit of our voluntary benefit and financial protection products in connection with the sale of kmg in 2018. these decreases were partially offset by higher stop-loss revenues related to our level-funded aso accounts resulting from membership growth in this product and higher per member premiums across the fully-insured business.
services revenue
•   group and specialty segment services revenue decreased $45 million, or 5.4%, from 2018 to 2019 primarily due to the impact of certain contractual incentives and adjustments related to the previous tricare contract received in 2018, which did not recur in 2019.

•   the group and specialty segment benefit ratio increased 630 basis points from 79.7% in 2018 to 86.0% in 2019 primarily due to the impact of the continued migration of fully-insured group members to level-funded aso products in 2019 resulting in a membership mix transformation, the suspension of the health insurance industry fee in 2019 which was contemplated in the pricing and benefit design of our products, and unfavorable prior-year medical claims reserve development driven by provider settlements. the benefit ratio was further negatively impacted by adjustments to dental network contracted rates resulting from dental network recontracting and expansion to position the business for the future.
•   the group and specialty segment's benefits expense included the unfavorable effect of $50 million in prior-year medical claims reserve development in 2019 versus the beneficial effect of $46 million in favorable prior-year medical claims reserve development in 2018. this unfavorable prior-year medical claims reserve development increased the group and specialty segment benefit ratio by approximately 70 basis points in 2019 while the favorable prior-year medical claims reserve development decreased the group and specialty segment benefit ratio by approximately 70 basis points in 2018.
operating costs
•   the group and specialty segment operating cost ratio of 22.0% for 2019 decreased 160 basis points from 23.6% for 2018, primarily due to the suspension of the health insurance industry fee in 2019, significant operating cost efficiencies in 2019 driven by previously implemented productivity initiatives, as well as the exit of our voluntary benefit and financial protection products in connection with the sale of kmg in 2018, which carried a higher operating cost ratio. these improvements were offset by the higher compensation expense accruals in 2019 for the aip as a result of our continued strong consolidated performance.
•   the non-deductible health insurance industry fee increased the operating cost ratio by approximately 160 basis points in 2018.

•   healthcare services segment earnings were $789 million in 2019, an increase of $35 million, or 4.6%, from 2018. this increase primarily was due to higher earnings from our pharmacy operations and clinical operations, and higher earnings from kindred at home operations. these factors were partially offset by additional investments in new clinical assets associated with our provider services business.
•   humana pharmacy solutions® script volumes for the retail and group and specialty segment membership increased to approximately 456 million in 2019, up 3.6% versus scripts of approximately 440 million in 2018. the increase primarily reflects growth associated with higher medicare advantage and state-based contracts membership, partially offset by the decline in stand-alone pdp membership.
services revenue
•   services revenue increased $25 million, or 4.1%, from 2018 to $632 million for 2019 primarily due to revenue growth from our provider services business.
•   intersegment revenues increased $1.98 billion, or 8.5%, from 2018 to $25 billion for 2019 primarily due to strong medicare advantage membership growth, partially offset by the loss of intersegment revenues associated with the decline in stand-alone pdp membership. intersegment revenues in 2019 were further impacted by higher revenues associated with our provider services business reflecting the previously disclosed acquisitions of mcci and fpg.
operating costs
•   the healthcare services segment operating cost ratio of 96.4% for 2019 was relatively unchanged from 96.3% for 2018.
liquidity historically, our primary sources of cash have included receipts of premiums, services revenue, and investment and other income, as well as proceeds from the sale or maturity of our investment securities, and borrowings. our primary uses of cash historically have included disbursements for claims payments, operating costs, interest on borrowings, taxes, purchases of investment securities, acquisitions, capital expenditures, repayments on borrowings, dividends, and share repurchases. because premiums generally are collected in advance of claim payments by a period of up to several months, our business normally should produce positive cash flows during periods of increasing premiums and enrollment. conversely, cash flows would be negatively impacted during periods of decreasing premiums and enrollment. from period to period, our cash flows may also be affected by the timing of working capital items including premiums receivable, benefits payable, and other receivables and payables. our cash flows are impacted by the timing of payments to and receipts from cms associated with medicare part d subsidies for which we do not assume risk. the use of cash flows may be limited by regulatory requirements of state departments of insurance (or comparable state regulators) which require, among other items, that our regulated subsidiaries maintain minimum levels of capital and seek approval before paying dividends from the subsidiaries to the parent. our use of cash flows derived from our non-insurance subsidiaries, such as in our healthcare services segment, is generally not restricted by state departments of insurance (or comparable state regulators).
for additional information on our liquidity risk, please refer to item 1a. - risk factors in this 2019 form 10-k.
cash and cash equivalents increased to $4.1 billion at december 31, 2019 from $2.3 billion at december 31, 2018. the change in cash and cash equivalents for the years ended december 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017 is summarized as follows:
net cash provided by operating activities             $5,284              $2,173              $4,051
cash flow from operating activities the change in operating cash flows over the three year period primarily results from the corresponding change in the timing of working capital items, earnings, and enrollment activity as discussed below. the increase in operating cash flows in 2019 reflect the significant impacts of increasing premiums and enrollment, as premiums generally are collected in advance of claim payments by a period of up to several months, higher earnings, the timing of other working capital items, and the impact of an approximately $245 million payment related to reinsuring certain voluntary benefit and financial protection products to a third party in connection with the sale of kmg in 2018.
the decrease in operating cash flows in 2018 primarily was due to the receipt of the merger termination fee in 2017, net of related expenses and taxes paid, funding the reinsurance of certain voluntary benefit and financial protection products to a third party in connection with the sale of kmg in 2018 and the timing of working capital items.
the most significant drivers of changes in our working capital are typically the timing of payments of benefits expense and receipts for premiums. we illustrate these changes with the following summaries of benefits payable and receivables.
the detail of benefits payable was as follows at december 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017:

(1)   ibnr represents an estimate of benefits payable for claims incurred but not reported (ibnr) at the balance sheet date and includes unprocessed claim inventories. the level of ibnr is primarily impacted by membership levels, medical claim trends and the receipt cycle time, which represents the length of time between when a claim is initially incurred and when the claim form is received and processed (i.e. a shorter time span results in a lower ibnr). ibnr includes unprocessed claims inventories.
(2)   reported claims in process represents the estimated valuation of processed claims that are in the post claim adjudication process, which consists of administrative functions such as audit and check batching and handling, as well as amounts owed to our pharmacy benefit administrator which fluctuate due to bi-weekly payments and the month-end cutoff.
(3)   other benefits payable include amounts owed to providers under capitated and risk sharing arrangements.
the increase in benefits payable in 2019 and 2018 was primarily due to an increase in ibnr, mainly as a result of medicare advantage membership growth. in addition, 2019 was impacted by an increase in the amounts owed to providers under capitated and risk sharing arrangements.

resulting in cash used by operations medicare receivables are impacted by changes in revenue associated with individual and group medicare membership changes as well as the timing of accruals and related collections associated with the cms risk-adjustment model.
the decrease in commercial and other receivables in 2018 as compared to 2017, was due primarily to a decrease in our receivable associated with the commercial risk adjustment provision of the health care reform law. this decrease corresponds with our exit from the individual commercial business.
military services receivables at december 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017 primarily consist of administrative services only fees owed from the federal government for administrative services provided under our tricare contracts. the 2017 balance also includes transition-in receivables under our t2017 east region contract collected in 2018.
many provisions of the health care reform law became effective in 2014, including the non-deductible health insurance industry fee. the annual health insurance industry fee was suspended for the calendar year 2017, but resumed in calendar year 2018.the annual health insurance industry fee was again suspended in 2019, but will resume for calendar year 2020, not be deductible for income tax purposes, and significantly increase our effective tax rate. under current law, the health industry fee will be permanently repealed beginning in calendar year 2021. we paid the federal government annual health insurance industry fees of $1.04 billion in 2018.
in addition to the timing of payments of benefits expense, receipts for premiums and services revenues, and amounts due under the health insurance industry fee provisions of the health care reform law, other items impacting operating cash flows include income tax payments and the timing of payroll cycles.
cash flow from investing activities our ongoing capital expenditures primarily relate to our information technology initiatives, support of services in our provider services operations including medical and administrative facility improvements necessary for activities such as the provision of care to members, claims processing, billing and collections, wellness solutions, care coordination, regulatory compliance and customer service. total capital expenditures, excluding acquisitions, were $736 million in 2019, $612 million in 2018, and $524 million in 2017.
in 2018, we completed the sale of our wholly-owned subsidiary kmg to cgic. upon closing, we funded the transaction with approximately $190 million of parent company cash contributed into kmg, subject to customary adjustments, in addition to the transfer of approximately $160 million of statutory capital with the sale. total cash and cash equivalents, including parent company funding, disposed at the time of sale, was $805 million. see note 3 to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8. - financial statements and supplementary data during 2018 we paid cash consideration of approximately $1.1 billion to acquire a 40% minority interest in kindred at home, $169 million to acquire the remaining interest in mcci, and $185 million to acquire all of fpg, as discussed in notes 3 and 4 to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8. - financial statements and supplementary data.
we reinvested a portion of our operating cash flows in investment securities, primarily investment-grade fixed income securities, totaling $542 million, $221 million, and $2.4 billion, during 2019, 2018 and 2017 respectively.
cash flow from financing activities our financing cash flows are significantly impacted by the timing of claims payments and the related receipts from cms associated with medicare part d claim subsidies for which we do not assume risk. monthly prospective payments from cms for reinsurance and low-income cost subsidies are based on assumptions submitted with our annual bid. settlement of the reinsurance and low-income cost subsidies is based on a reconciliation made approximately 9 months after the close of each calendar year. claims payments were $560 million higher than receipts from cms associated with medicare part d claim subsidies for which we do not assume risk during 2019 and $653 million higher during 2018. receipts from cms associated with medicare part d claims subsidies for which we do not assume risk were $1.9 billion higher than claims payments during 2017. our net payable for cms subsidies and brand name prescription drug discounts was $229 million at december 31, 2019 compared to a net payable of $331 million at december 31, 2018.
under our administrative services only tricare contract, health care cost payments for which we do not assume risk exceeded reimbursements from the federal government by $63 million in 2019 and reimbursements from the federal government exceeded health care cost payments for which we do not assume risk by $38 million in 2018 and $11 million in 2017.
claims payments associated with cost sharing provisions of the health care reform law for which we do not assume risk were $25 million in 2018. claims payments associated with cost sharing provisions of the health care reform law for which we do not assume risk were higher than reimbursements from hhs by $44 million in 2017.
we repurchased common shares for $1.07 billion, $1.09 billion and $3.37 billion in 2019, 2018 and 2017 under share repurchase plans authorized by the board of directors and in connection with employee stock plans.
as discussed further below, we paid dividends to stockholders of $291 million in 2019, $265 million in 2018, and $220 million in 2017.
we entered into a commercial paper program in october 2014. net repayments of commercial paper were $360 million in 2019 and the maximum principal amount outstanding at any one time during 2019 was $801 million. net proceeds from the issuance of commercial paper were $485 million in 2018 and the maximum principal amount outstanding at any one time during 2018 was $923 million. net repayments of commercial paper were $153 million in 2017 and the maximum principal amount outstanding at any one time during 2017 was $500 million.
in november 2018, we entered into a $1.0 billion term note agreement with a bank at a variable rate of interest due within one year. for a detailed discussion of our debt please refer to note 13 to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8. - financial statements and supplementary data.
in august 2019, we issued $500 million of 3.125% senior notes due august 15, 2029 and $500 million of 3.950% senior notes due august 15, 2049. our net proceeds, reduced for the underwriters' discount and commission and offering expenses paid were $987 million. we used the net proceeds from this offering, together with available cash, to repay the $650 million outstanding amount due under our term note in august 2019, and the $400 million aggregate principal amount of our 2.625% senior notes due on maturity at october 1, 2019. in december 2017, we issued $400 million of 2.50% senior notes due december 15, 2020 and $400 million of 2.90% senior notes due december 15, 2022. our net proceeds, reduced for the underwriters' discount and commission and offering expenses paid as of december 31, 2017, were $794 million. we used the net proceeds, together with available cash, to fund the redemption of our $300 million aggregate principal amount of 6.30% senior notes maturing in august 2018 and our $500 million aggregate principal amount of 7.20% senior notes maturing in june 2018 at 100% of the principal amount plus applicable premium for early redemption and accrued and unpaid interest to the redemption date, for cash totaling approximately $829 million.
the remainder of the cash used in or provided by financing activities in 2019, 2018, and 2017 primarily resulted from proceeds from stock option exercises and the change in book overdraft.

stock repurchases for a detailed discussion of stock repurchases, please refer to note 16 to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8. - financial statements and supplementary data.
debt in february 2020, we entered into a new $1 billion term loan commitment with a bank that allows for up to three draws with the initial draw at a minimum of $300 million that matures 1 year after the first draw, subject to a 1 year extension.  following any initial draw, any unused commitments in excess of $300 million expire on june 30, 2020, with the remaining commitments of up to $300 million available until september 30, 2020. if the initial draw has not been made by june 30, 2020, then all commitments expire on june 30, 2020. the facility fee, interest rate and financial covenants are consistent with those of our revolving credit agreement. there is no prepayment penalty.

acquisitions and divestiture for a detailed discussion of our acquisitions and divestitures, please refer to notes 3 and 4 to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8. - financial statements and supplementary data liquidity requirements we believe our cash balances, investment securities, operating cash flows, and funds available under our credit agreement and our commercial paper program or from other public or private financing sources, taken together, provide adequate resources to fund ongoing operating and regulatory requirements, acquisitions, future expansion opportunities, and capital expenditures for at least the next twelve months, as well as to refinance or repay debt, and repurchase shares.
adverse changes in our credit rating may increase the rate of interest we pay and may impact the amount of credit available to us in the future. our investment-grade credit rating at december 31, 2019 was bbb+ according to standard & poor's rating services, or s&p, and baa3 according to moody's investors services, inc., or moody's. a downgrade by s&p to bb+ or by moody's to ba1 triggers an interest rate increase of 25 basis points with respect to $250 million of our senior notes. successive one notch downgrades increase the interest rate an additional 25 basis points, or annual interest expense by $1 million, up to a maximum 100 basis points, or annual interest expense by $3 million.
in addition, we operate as a holding company in a highly regulated industry. humana inc., our parent company, is dependent upon dividends and administrative expense reimbursements from our subsidiaries, most of which are subject to regulatory restrictions. we continue to maintain significant levels of aggregate excess statutory capital and surplus in our state-regulated operating subsidiaries. cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments at the parent company increased to $1.4 billion at december 31, 2019 from $578 million at december 31, 2018. this increase primarily reflects insurance subsidiaries dividends, non-insurance subsidiaries' profits and net proceeds from debt issuance, partially offset by common stock repurchases, insurance subsidiaries' capital contributions, repayment of debt and capital expenditures. our use of operating cash derived from our non-insurance subsidiaries, such as our healthcare services segment, is generally not restricted by departments of insurance (or comparable state regulatory agencies). our regulated insurance subsidiaries paid dividends to the parent of $1.8 billion in 2019, $2.3 billion in 2018, and $1.4 billion in 2017. refer to our parent company financial statements and accompanying notes in schedule i - parent company financial information. the amount of ordinary dividends that may be paid to our parent company in 2020 is approximately $1 billion, in the aggregate. actual dividends paid may vary due to consideration of excess statutory capital and surplus and expected future surplus requirements related to, for example, premium volume and product mix.

(1)   interest includes the estimated contractual interest payments under our debt agreements.
(2)   we lease facilities, computer hardware, and other furniture and equipment under long-term operating leases that are noncancelable and expire on various dates through 2046 . we sublease facilities or partial facilities to third party tenants for space not used in our operations which partially mitigates our operating lease commitments. see also note 10 to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8. - financial statements and supplementary data.
(3)   purchase obligations include agreements to purchase services, primarily information technology related services, or to make improvements to real estate, in each case that are enforceable and legally binding on us and that specify all significant terms, including: fixed or minimum levels of service to be purchased; fixed, minimum or variable price provisions; and the appropriate timing of the transaction. purchase obligations exclude agreements that are cancelable without penalty.
(4)   includes future policy benefits payable ceded to third parties through 100% coinsurance agreements as more fully described in note 19 to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8. - financial statements and supplementary data. we expect the assuming reinsurance carriers to fund these obligations and reflected these amounts as reinsurance recoverables included in other long-term assets on our consolidated balance sheet. amounts payable in less than one year are included in trade accounts payable and accrued expenses in the consolidated balance sheet.
off-balance sheet arrangements as of december 31, 2019, we were not involved in any special purpose entity, or spe, transactions. for a detailed discussion of off-balance sheet arrangements, please refer to note 17 to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8. - financial statements and supplementary data.

critical accounting policies and estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america. the preparation of these financial statements and accompanying notes requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. we continuously evaluate our estimates and those critical accounting policies primarily related to benefits expense and revenue recognition as well as accounting for impairments related to our investment securities, goodwill, and long-lived assets. these estimates are based on knowledge of current events and anticipated future events and, accordingly, actual results ultimately may differ from those estimates. we believe the following critical accounting policies involve the most significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.
benefits expense recognition benefits expense is recognized in the period in which services are provided and includes an estimate of the cost of services which have been incurred but not yet reported, or ibnr. ibnr represents a substantial portion of our benefits payable as follows:
december 31, 2019           percentageof total           december 31, 2018           percentageof total
other benefits payable               1,226                     20.4           %                 884                     18.2           %
total benefits payable              $6,004                    100.0           %              $4,862                    100.0           %
our reserving practice is to consistently recognize the actuarial best point estimate within a level of confidence required by actuarial standards. for further discussion of our reserving methodology, including our use of completion and claims per member per month trend factors to estimate ibnr, refer to note 2 to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8. - financial statements and supplementary data.
the completion and claims per member per month trend factors are the most significant factors impacting the ibnr estimate. the portion of ibnr estimated using completion factors for claims incurred prior to the most recent two months is generally less variable than the portion of ibnr estimated using trend factors. the following table illustrates the sensitivity of these factors assuming moderately adverse experience and the estimated potential impact on our operating results caused by reasonably likely changes in these factors based on december 31, 2019 data:
completion factor (a):                         claims trend factor (b):

(a)   reflects estimated potential changes in benefits payable at december 31, 2019 caused by changes in completion factors for incurred months prior to the most recent two months.
(b)   reflects estimated potential changes in benefits payable at december 31, 2019 caused by changes in annualized claims trend used for the estimation of per member per month incurred claims for the most recent two months.
(c)   the factor change indicated represents the percentage point change.
the following table provides a historical perspective regarding the accrual and payment of our benefits payable, excluding military services. components of the total incurred claims for each year include amounts accrued for current year estimated benefits expense as well as adjustments to prior year estimated accruals. refer to note 11 to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8. - financial statements and supplementary data for retail and group and specialty segment tables including information about incurred and paid claims development as of december 31, 2019, net of reinsurance, as well as cumulative claim frequency and the total of ibnr included within the net incurred claims amounts.
the following table summarizes the changes in estimate for incurred claims related to prior years attributable to our key assumptions. as previously described, our key assumptions consist of trend and completion factors estimated using an assumption of moderately adverse conditions. the amounts below represent the difference between our original estimates and the actual benefits expense ultimately incurred as determined from subsequent claim payments.

as previously discussed, our reserving practice is to consistently recognize the actuarial best estimate of our ultimate liability for claims. actuarial standards require the use of assumptions based on moderately adverse experience, which generally results in favorable reserve development, or reserves that are considered redundant. we experienced favorable medical claims reserve development related to prior fiscal years of $336 million in 2019, $503 million in 2018, and $483 million in 2017. the table below details our favorable medical claims reserve development related to prior fiscal years by segment for 2019, 2018, and 2017.
(favorable) unfavorable medical claims reserve                                                          change development
other businesses                -                           (2            )             (1            )                2           (1        )
the favorable medical claims reserve development for 2019, 2018, and 2017 primarily reflects the consistent application of trend and completion factors estimated using an assumption of moderately adverse conditions. our favorable development for each of the years presented above is discussed further in note 11 to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8. - financial statements and supplementary data.
we continually adjust our historical trend and completion factor experience with our knowledge of recent events that may impact current trends and completion factors when establishing our reserves. because our reserving practice is to consistently recognize the actuarial best point estimate using an assumption of moderately adverse conditions as required by actuarial standards, there is a reasonable possibility that variances between actual trend and completion factors and those assumed in our december 31, 2019 estimates would fall towards the middle of the ranges previously presented in our sensitivity table.
there was no benefit expense excluded from the previous table for the years ended december 31, 2019 and 2018. benefits expense reduced by $22 million associated with future policy benefits for the year ended december 31, 2017 was excluded from the previous table.
revenue recognition we generally establish one-year commercial membership contracts with employer groups, subject to cancellation by the employer group on 30-day written notice. our medicare contracts with cms renew annually. our military services contracts with the federal government and certain contracts with various state medicaid programs generally are multi-year contracts subject to annual renewal provisions.
we receive monthly premiums from the federal government and various states according to government specified payment rates and various contractual terms. we bill and collect premium from employer groups and members in our medicare and other individual products monthly. changes in premium revenues resulting from the periodic changes in risk-adjustment scores derived from medical diagnoses for our membership are estimated by projecting the ultimate annual premium and recognized ratably during the year with adjustments each period to reflect changes in the ultimate premium.
premiums revenue is estimated by multiplying the membership covered under the various contracts by the contractual rates. premiums revenue is recognized as income in the period members are entitled to receive services, and is net of estimated uncollectible amounts, retroactive membership adjustments, and adjustments to recognize rebates under the minimum benefit ratios required under the health care reform law. we estimate policyholder rebates by projecting calendar year minimum benefit ratios for the small group and large group markets, as defined by the health care reform law using a methodology prescribed by hhs, separately by state and legal entity. medicare advantage products are also subject to minimum benefit ratio requirements under the health care reform law. estimated calendar year rebates recognized ratably during the year are revised each period to reflect current experience. retroactive membership adjustments result from enrollment changes not yet processed, or not yet reported by an employer group or the government. we routinely monitor the collectability of specific accounts, the aging of receivables, historical retroactivity trends, estimated rebates, as well as prevailing and anticipated economic conditions, and reflect any required adjustments in current operations. premiums received prior to the service period are recorded as unearned revenues.
medicare risk-adjustment provisions cms utilizes a risk-adjustment model which apportions premiums paid to medicare advantage, or ma, plans according to health severity. the risk-adjustment model, which cms implemented pursuant to the balanced budget act of 1997(bba) and the benefits improvement and protection act of 2000 (bipa), generally pays more for enrollees with predictably higher costs. under the risk-adjustment methodology, all ma plans must collect and submit the necessary diagnosis code information from hospital inpatient, hospital outpatient, and physician providers to cms within prescribed deadlines. the cms risk-adjustment model uses this diagnosis data to calculate the risk-adjusted premium payment to ma plans. rates paid to ma plans are established under an actuarial bid model, including a process that bases our payments on a comparison of our beneficiaries' risk scores, derived from medical diagnoses, to those enrolled in the government's medicare ffs program. we generally rely on providers, including certain providers in our network who are our employees, to code their claim submissions with appropriate diagnoses, which we send to cms as the basis for our payment received from cms under the actuarial risk-adjustment model. we also rely on providers to appropriately document all medical data, including the diagnosis data submitted with claims. cms is phasing-in the process of calculating risk scores using diagnoses data from the risk adjustment processing system, or raps, to diagnoses data from the encounter data system, or eds. the raps process requires ma plans to apply a filter logic based on cms guidelines and only submit diagnoses that satisfy those guidelines. for submissions through eds, cms requires ma plans to submit all the encounter data and cms will apply the risk adjustment filtering logic to determine the risk scores. for 2019, 25% of the risk score was calculated from claims data submitted through eds. cms will increase that percentage to 50% in 2020 and has proposed to increase that percentage to 75% in 2021. the phase-in from raps to eds could result in different risk scores from each dataset as a result of plan processing issues, cms processing issues, or filtering logic differences between raps and eds, and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position, or cash flows. we estimate risk-adjustment revenues based on medical diagnoses for our membership. the risk-adjustment model, including cms changes to the submission process, is more fully described in item 1. - business under the section titled "individual medicare," and in item 1a. - risk factors.
investment securities investment securities totaled $11.4 billion, or 39% of total assets at december 31, 2019, and $10.4 billion, or 41% of total assets at december 31, 2018. the investment portfolio was primarily comprised of debt securities, detailed below, at december 31, 2019 and entirely at december 31, 2018. the fair value of debt securities were as follows at december 31, 2019 and 2018:
12/31/2019           percentage            12/31/2018           percentage of total                                   of total
u.s. treasury and agency obligations                                          $354                3.1       %            $417                4.0       %
approximately 96% of our debt securities were investment-grade quality, with a weighted average credit rating of aa by s&p at december 31, 2019. most of the debt securities that were below investment-grade were rated bb, the higher end of the below investment-grade rating scale. tax-exempt municipal securities were diversified among general obligation bonds of states and local municipalities in the united states as well as special revenue bonds issued by municipalities to finance specific public works projects such as utilities, water and sewer, transportation, or education. our general obligation bonds are diversified across the united states with no individual state exceeding 1% of our total debt securities. our investment policy limits investments in a single issuer and requires diversification among various asset types.
gross unrealized losses and fair values aggregated by investment category and length of time that individual securities have been in a continuous unrealized loss position were as follows at december 31, 2019:
u.s. treasury and agency obligations            $48             $-                          $23             $-                          $71          $-
under the other-than-temporary impairment model for debt securities held, we recognize an impairment loss in income in an amount equal to the full difference between the amortized cost basis and the fair value when we have the intent to sell the debt security or it is more likely than not we will be required to sell the debt security before recovery of our amortized cost basis. however, if we do not intend to sell the debt security, we evaluate the expected cash flows to be received as compared to amortized cost and determine if a credit loss has occurred. in the event of a credit loss, only the amount of the impairment associated with the credit loss is recognized currently in income with the remainder of the loss recognized in other comprehensive income.
when we do not intend to sell a security in an unrealized loss position, potential other-than-temporary impairment is considered using a variety of factors, including the length of time and extent to which the fair value has been less than cost; adverse conditions specifically related to the industry, geographic area or financial condition of the issuer or underlying collateral of a security; payment structure of the security; changes in credit rating of the security by the rating agencies; the volatility of the fair value changes; and changes in fair value of the security after the balance sheet date. for debt securities, we take into account expectations of relevant market and economic data. for example, with respect to mortgage and asset-backed securities, such data includes underlying loan level data and structural features such as seniority and other forms of credit enhancements. a decline in fair value is considered other-than-temporary when we do not expect to recover the entire amortized cost basis of the security. we estimate the amount of the credit loss component of a debt security as the difference between the amortized cost and the present value of the expected cash flows of the security. the present value is determined using the best estimate of future cash flows discounted at the implicit interest rate at the date of purchase. the risks inherent in assessing the impairment of an investment include the risk that market factors may differ from our expectations, facts and circumstances factored into our assessment may change with the passage of time, or we may decide to subsequently sell the investment. the determination of whether a decline in the value of an investment is other than temporary requires us to exercise significant diligence and judgment. the discovery of new information and the passage of time can significantly change these judgments. the status of the general economic environment and significant changes in the national securities markets influence the determination of fair value and the assessment of investment impairment. there is a continuing risk that declines in fair value may occur and additional material realized losses from sales or other-than-temporary impairments may be recorded in future periods.
all issuers of securities we own that were trading at an unrealized loss at december 31, 2019 remain current on all contractual payments. after taking into account these and other factors previously described, we believe these unrealized losses primarily were caused by an increase in market interest rates in the current markets since the time the securities were purchased. at december 31, 2019, we did not intend to sell the securities with an unrealized loss position in accumulated other comprehensive income, and it is not likely that we will be required to sell these securities before recovery of their amortized cost basis. as a result, we believe that the securities with an unrealized loss were not other-than-temporarily impaired at december 31, 2019. there were no material other-than-temporary impairments in 2019, 2018, or 2017.
goodwill and long-lived assets at december 31, 2019, goodwill and other long-lived assets represented 21% of total assets and 50% of total stockholders' equity, compared to 23% and 58%, respectively, at december 31, 2018.
we are required to test at least annually for impairment at a level of reporting referred to as the reporting unit, and more frequently if adverse events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset may be impaired. a reporting unit either is our operating segments or one level below the operating segments, referred to as a component, which comprise our reportable segments. a component is considered a reporting unit if the component constitutes a business for which discrete financial information is available that is regularly reviewed by management. we are required to aggregate the components of an operating segment into one reporting unit if they have similar economic characteristics. goodwill is assigned to the reporting unit that is expected to benefit from a specific acquisition.
we use the one-step process to review goodwill for impairment to determine both the existence and amount of goodwill impairment, if any. our strategy, long-range business plan, and annual planning process support our goodwill impairment tests. these tests are performed, at a minimum, annually in the fourth quarter, and are based on an evaluation of future discounted cash flows. we rely on this discounted cash flow analysis to determine fair value. however outcomes from the discounted cash flow analysis are compared to other market approach valuation methodologies for reasonableness. we use discount rates that correspond to a market-based weighted-average cost of capital and terminal growth rates that correspond to long-term growth prospects, consistent with the long-term inflation rate. key assumptions in our cash flow projections, including changes in membership, premium yields, medical and operating cost trends, and certain government contract extensions, are consistent with those utilized in our long-range business plan and annual planning process. if these assumptions differ from actual, including the impact of the health care reform law or changes in government rates, the estimates underlying our goodwill impairment tests could be adversely affected. goodwill impairment tests completed in each of the last three years did not result in an impairment loss. the fair value of our reporting units with significant goodwill exceeded carrying amounts by a substantial margin. a 100 basis point increase in the discount rate would not have a significant impact on the amount of margin for any of our reporting units with significant goodwill, with the exception of our clinical and provider reporting units in our healthcare services segment. our clinical and provider reporting units primarily provide services to our retail members. a significant increase in the discount rate, decrease in the long-term growth rate, or substantial reductions in our underlying cash flow assumptions, including revenue growth rates, medical and operating cost trends, and projected operating income, could have a negative impact on the estimated fair value of these reporting units. the clinical reporting unit had a fair value of $544 million which exceeded its carrying value of $533 million by $11 million or 2%. if the discount rate increased 100 basis points, then the clinical reporting unit would incur an impairment loss of approximately $62 million. the provider reporting unit had a fair value of $2.3 billion which exceeded its carrying value of $1.3 billion by $1.0 billion or 78%. the provider reporting unit estimate of fair value relies on multiple assumptions regarding the underlying long-term cash flows, any one of which may be significantly impacted by future changes in estimates and may negatively impact fair value. the clinical and provider reporting units account for $524 million and $761 million, respectively, of goodwill. impairment tests completed for 2019, 2018, and 2017 did not result in an impairment loss.
long-lived assets consist of property and equipment and other finite-lived intangible assets. these assets are depreciated or amortized over their estimated useful life, and are subject to impairment reviews. we periodically review long-lived assets whenever adverse events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable. in assessing recoverability, we must make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors to determine if an impairment loss may exist, and, if so, estimate fair value. we also must estimate and make assumptions regarding the useful life we assign to our long-lived assets. if these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future, we may be required to record impairment losses or change the useful life, including accelerating depreciation or amortization for these assets. there were no material impairment losses in the last three years.

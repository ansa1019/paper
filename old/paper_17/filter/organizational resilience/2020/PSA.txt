at december 31, 2020, b. wayne hughes, our former chairman and his family, which includes his daughter, tamara hughes gustavson, a current member of our board of trustees (our "board"), and his son, b. wayne hughes, jr., a former member of the board who retired effective december 31, 2020, (collectively, the "hughes family"), owned approximately 13.0% of our aggregate outstanding common shares. our declaration of trust permits the hughes family to own up to 35.66% of our outstanding common shares while it generally restricts the ownership by other persons and entities to 3% of our outstanding common shares unless our board grants an ownership waiver, as has occurred in certain cases for large mutual fund companies. consequently, the hughes family may significantly influence matters submitted to a vote of our shareholders, including electing trustees, amending our organizational documents, dissolving and approving other extraordinary transactions, such as a takeover attempt, which may result in an outcome that may not be favorable to other shareholders.
reits are subject to a range of complex organizational and operational requirements. a qualifying reit does not generally incur u.s. federal corporate income tax on its "reit taxable income" (generally, taxable income subject to specified adjustments, including a deduction for dividends paid and excluding net capital gain) that it distributes to its shareholders. our reit status is also dependent upon the ongoing reit qualification of psb as a result of our substantial ownership interest in it. we believe we have qualified as a reit and we intend to continue to maintain our reit status.

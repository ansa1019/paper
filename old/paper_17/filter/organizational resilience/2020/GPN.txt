item 1a - risk factors an investment in our common stock involves a high degree of risk. you should consider carefully the following risks and other information contained in this annual report on form 10-k and other sec filings before you decide whether to buy our common stock. the risks identified below are not all encompassing but should be considered in establishing an opinion of our future operations. if any of the events contemplated by the following discussion of risks should occur, our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows could suffer significantly. as a result, the market price of our common stock could decline and you may lose all or part of your investment in our common stock.
risks related to our business model and operations including the use of technology our ability to protect our systems and data from continually evolving cybersecurity risks or other technological risks could affect our reputation among our customers and cardholders, adversely affect our continued card network registration or membership and financial institution sponsorship, and expose us to penalties, fines, liabilities and legal claims.
in order to provide our services, we process and store sensitive business and personal information, which may include credit and debit card numbers, bank account numbers, social security numbers, driver's license numbers, names and addresses, and other types of personal information or sensitive business information. some of this information is also processed and stored by financial institutions, merchants and other entities, as well as third-party service providers to whom we outsource certain functions and other agents, which we refer to collectively as our associated third parties. we may have responsibility to the card networks, financial institutions, and in some instances, our merchants, isos and/or individuals, for our failure or the failure of our associated third parties (as applicable) to protect this information.
we are a regular target of malicious third-party attempts to identify and exploit system vulnerabilities, and/or penetrate or bypass our security measures, in order to gain unauthorized access to our networks and systems or those of our associated third parties. such access could lead to the compromise of sensitive, business, personal or confidential information. as a result, we follow a defense-in-depth model for cybersecurity, meaning we proactively seek to employ multiple methods at different layers to defend our systems against intrusion and attack and to protect the data we collect. however, we cannot be certain that these measures will be successful and will be sufficient to counter all current and emerging technology threats.
our computer systems and/or our associated third parties' computer systems could be subject to penetration, and our data protection measures may not prevent unauthorized access. the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, disable or degrade service or sabotage systems change frequently and are often difficult to detect and continually evolve and become more sophisticated. threats to our systems and our associated third parties' systems can derive from human error, fraud or malice on the part of employees or third parties, including state-sponsored organizations with significant financial and technological resources. computer viruses and other malware can be distributed and could infiltrate our systems or those of our associated third parties. in addition, denial of service, ransomware or other attacks could be launched against us for a variety of purposes, including to interfere with our services or create a diversion for other malicious activities. our defensive measures may not prevent downtime, unauthorized access or use of sensitive data. while we maintain first- and third-party insurance coverage that may cover certain aspects of cyber risks, such insurance coverage may be insufficient to cover all losses. companies we acquire may require post-closing implementation of additional cyber defense methods to align with our standards and, as a result, there may be a period of increased risk between the closing of an acquisition and the completion of such implementation. further, certain of our third-party relationships are subject to our vendor management program and governed by written contracts; however, we do not control the actions of our associated third parties, and any problems experienced by these third parties, including those resulting from breakdowns or other disruptions in the services provided by such parties or cyberattacks and security breaches, could adversely affect our ability to service our customers or otherwise conduct our business.
in addition, we cannot provide assurance that the contractual requirements related to use, security and privacy that we impose on our associated third parties who have access to this data will be followed or will be adequate to prevent the misuse of this data. any misuse or compromise of personal information or failure to adequately enforce these contractual requirements could result in liability, protracted and costly litigation and, with respect to misuse of personal information of our customers, lost revenue and reputational harm.
any type of security breach, attack or misuse of data described above or otherwise, whether experienced by us or an associated third party, could harm our reputation and deter existing and prospective customers from using our services or from making electronic payments generally, increase our operating expenses in order to contain and remediate the incident, expose us to unanticipated or uninsured liability, disrupt our operations (including potential service interruptions), distract our management, increase our risk of litigation or regulatory scrutiny, result in the imposition of penalties and fines under state, federal and foreign laws or by the card networks, and adversely affect our continued card network registration or membership and financial institution sponsorship. our removal from networks' lists of payment card industry data security standard compliant service providers could mean that existing customers, sales partners or other third parties may cease using or referring our services. also, prospective merchant customers, financial institutions, sales partners or other third parties may choose to terminate negotiations with us, or delay or choose not to consider us for their processing needs. in addition, the card networks could refuse to allow us to process through their networks.
we may experience software defects, undetected errors, and development delays, which could damage customer relations, decrease our potential profitability and expose us to liability.
our services are based on software and computing systems that often encounter development delays, and the underlying software may contain undetected errors, viruses or defects. defects in our software services and errors or delays in our processing of electronic transactions could result in additional development costs, diversion of technical and other resources from our other development efforts, loss of credibility with current or potential customers, harm to our reputation and exposure to liability claims.
in addition, we rely on technologies and software supplied by third parties that may also contain undetected errors, viruses or defects that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
our systems or our third-party providers' systems may fail, which could interrupt our service, cause us to lose business, increase our costs and expose us to liability.
we depend on the efficient and uninterrupted operation of our computer systems, software, data centers and telecommunications networks, as well as the systems and services of third parties. a system outage or data loss could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. not only could we suffer damage to our reputation in the event of a system outage or data loss, but we may also be liable to third parties. many of our contractual agreements with financial institutions and certain other customers require the payment of penalties if we do not meet certain operating standards. our systems and operations or those of our third-party providers could be exposed to damage or interruption from, among other things, fire, natural disaster, power loss, telecommunications failure, terrorist acts, war, unauthorized entry, human error, and computer viruses or other defects. defects in our systems or those of third parties, errors or delays in the processing of payment transactions, telecommunications failures, or other difficulties (including those related to system relocation) could result in loss of revenues, loss of customers, loss of merchant and cardholder data, harm to our business or reputation, exposure to fraud losses or other liabilities, negative publicity, additional operating and development costs, fines and other sanctions imposed by card networks, and/or diversion of technical and other resources.
the payments technology industry is highly competitive, and some of our competitors are larger and have greater financial and operational resources than we do, which may give them an advantage with respect to the pricing of services offered to customers and the ability to develop new technologies.
we operate in the payments technology industry, which is highly competitive. in this industry, our primary competitors include other independent payment processors, credit card processing firms, as well as financial institutions, isos, prepaid programs managers and, potentially, card networks. we compete with many larger companies that have greater financial and operational resources than we have. our competitors that are financial institutions or subsidiaries of financial institutions do not incur the costs associated with being sponsored by a direct member for participation in the card networks, as we do in certain jurisdictions, and may be able to settle transactions more quickly for merchants than we can. these financial institutions may also provide payment processing services to merchants at a loss in order to generate banking fees from the merchants. it is also possible that larger financial institutions, including some who are customers of ours, could decide to perform in-house some or all of the services that we currently provide or could provide. these attributes may provide them with a competitive advantage in the market.
additionally, the market for prepaid cards, demand deposit accounts and alternative financial services is similarly highly competitive and competition is increasing as more companies endeavor to address the needs of underbanked consumers. we anticipate increased competition from alternative financial services providers who are often well positioned to service the underbanked and who may wish to develop their own prepaid card or demand deposit account programs. we also face strong price competition. to stay competitive, we may have to increase the incentives that we offer to our distributors and reduce the prices of our services, which could adversely affect our financial position, operating results and cash flows.
furthermore, we are facing increasing competition from nontraditional competitors, including new entrant technology companies who offer certain innovations in payment methods. some of these competitors utilize proprietary software and service solutions. some of these nontraditional competitors have significant financial resources and robust networks and are highly regarded by consumers. in addition, some nontraditional competitors, such as private companies or startup companies, may be less risk averse than we are and, therefore, may be able to respond more quickly to market demands. these competitors may compete in ways that minimize or remove the role of traditional card networks, acquirers, issuers and processors in the electronic payments process. if these nontraditional competitors gain a greater share of total electronic payments transactions, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
in order to remain competitive and to continue to increase our revenues and earnings, we must continually and quickly update our services, a process that could result in higher costs and the loss of revenues, earnings and customers if the new services do not perform as intended or are not accepted in the marketplace.
the payments technology industry in which we compete is characterized by rapid technological change, new product introductions, evolving industry standards and changing customer needs. in order to remain competitive, we are continually involved in a number of projects, including the development of new platforms, mobile payment applications, ecommerce services and other new offerings emerging in the payments technology industry. these projects carry the risks associated with any development effort, including cost overruns, delays in delivery and performance problems. in the payments technology markets, these risks are even more acute. any delay in the delivery of new services or the failure to differentiate our services could render our services less desirable to customers, or possibly even obsolete. furthermore, as the market for alternative payment processing services evolves, it may develop too rapidly or not rapidly enough for us to recover the costs we have incurred in developing new services targeted at this market.
in addition, certain of the services we deliver to the payments technology markets are designed to process very complex transactions and deliver reports and other information on those transactions, all at very high volumes and processing speeds. any failure to deliver an effective and secure product or any performance issue that arises with a new product or service could result in significant processing or reporting errors or other losses. we rely in part on third parties, including some of our competitors and potential competitors, for the development of and access to new technologies. as a result of these factors, our development efforts could result in higher costs that could reduce our earnings in addition to a loss of revenues and earnings if promised new services are not delivered timely to our customers or do not perform as anticipated.
our revenues from the sale of services to merchants that accept visa and mastercard are dependent upon our continued visa and mastercard registrations, financial institution sponsorship and, in some cases, continued membership in certain card networks.
in order to provide our visa and mastercard transaction processing services, we must be either a direct member or be registered as a merchant processor or service provider of visa and mastercard, respectively. registration as a merchant processor or service provider is dependent upon our being sponsored by members of each organization in certain jurisdictions. if our sponsor financial institution in any market should stop providing sponsorship for us, we would need to find another financial institution to provide those services or we would need to attain direct membership with the card networks, either of which could prove to be difficult and expensive. if we are unable to find a replacement financial institution to provide sponsorship or attain direct membership, we may no longer be able to provide processing services to affected customers and potential customers in that market, which would negatively affect our revenues, earnings and cash flows. furthermore, some agreements with our financial institution sponsors give them substantial discretion in approving certain aspects of our business practices, including our solicitation, application and qualification procedures for merchants and the terms of our agreements with merchants. our sponsors' discretionary actions under these agreements could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. in connection with direct membership, the rules and regulations of various card associations and networks prescribe certain capital requirements. any increase in the capital level required would limit our use of capital for other purposes.
the termination of our registration, or any changes in the visa or mastercard rules that would impair our registration, could require us to stop providing visa and mastercard payment processing services, which would make it impossible for us to conduct our business on its current scale. the rules of the card networks may be influenced by card issuers, and some of those issuers also provide acquiring services and are our competitors or our customers in both the merchant solutions and issuer solutions segments. if we fail to comply with the applicable requirements of the card networks, the card networks could seek to fine us, suspend us or terminate our registrations or membership. the termination of our registrations or our membership or our status as a service provider or a merchant processor, or any changes in card association or other network rules or standards, including interpretation and implementation of the rules or standards, that increase the cost of doing business or limit our ability to provide transaction processing services to our customers, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. if a merchant or an iso customer fails to comply with the applicable requirements of the card associations and networks, we or the merchant or iso could be subject to a variety of fines or penalties that may be levied by the card associations or networks. if we cannot collect or pursue collection of such amounts from the applicable merchant or iso, we may have to bear the cost of such fines or penalties, resulting in lower earnings for us.
our business and consumer solutions segment relies on certain relationships with issuing banks, distributors, marketers and brand partners. the loss of such relationships, or if we are unable to maintain such relationships on terms that are favorable to us, may materially adversely affect our business, financial position, operating results and cash flows.
our business and consumer solutions segment relies on arrangements that we have with issuing banks to provide us with critical products and services, including the fdic-insured depository accounts tied to the cards and accounts we manage, access to the atm networks, membership in the card associations and network organizations and other banking services. the majority of our active business and consumer solutions cards and accounts are issued or opened through meta payment systems ("metabank"). if any material adverse event were to affect metabank's or another of our critical issuing banks, or we were to lose metabank or another critical bank, or metabank or another critical bank grew to a size such that it was no longer able to avail itself of certain regulatory exemptions for small banks, we may be forced to find an alternative provider for these critical banking services. it may not be possible to find a replacement bank on terms that are acceptable to us or at all. any change in the issuing banks could disrupt the business or result in arrangements with new banks that are less favorable to us than those we have with our existing issuing banks, either of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, operating results and cash flows.
furthermore, our business and consumer solutions segment depends in large part on establishing agreements with distributors, marketers and brand partners, primarily alternative financial services providers, as well as grocery and convenience stores and other traditional retailers. some of these companies may endeavor to internally develop their own programs or enter into exclusive relationships with our competitors to distribute or market their products. the loss of, or a substantial decrease in revenues from, one or more of our top distributors, marketers or brand partners could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, operating results and cash flows.
we rely on various financial institutions to provide clearing services in connection with our settlement activities. if we are unable to maintain clearing services with these financial institutions and are unable to find a replacement, our business may be adversely affected.
we rely on various financial institutions to provide clearing services in connection with our settlement activities. if such financial institutions should stop providing clearing services, we would have to find other financial institutions to provide those services. if we were unable to find a replacement financial institution we may no longer be able to provide processing services to certain customers, which could negatively affect our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.
increased merchant, referral partner or iso attrition could cause our financial results to decline.
we experience attrition in merchant credit and debit card processing volume resulting from several factors, including business closures, transfers of merchants accounts to our competitors, unsuccessful contract renewal negotiations and account closures that we initiate for various reasons, such as heightened credit risks or contract breaches by merchants. our referral partners are a significant source of new business. if a referral partner or an iso switches to another transaction processor, terminates our services, internalizes payment processing functions that we perform, merges with or is acquired by one of our competitors, or shuts down or becomes insolvent, we may no longer receive new merchant referrals from such referral partner, and we risk losing existing merchants that were originally enrolled by the referral partner or iso. we cannot predict the level of attrition in the future and it could increase. higher than expected attrition could negatively affect our results, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
our future growth depends in part on the continued expansion within markets in which we already operate, the emergence of new markets, and the continued availability of alliance relationships and strategic acquisition opportunities.
our future growth and profitability depend upon our continued expansion within the markets in which we currently operate, the further expansion of these markets, the emergence of other markets for payment technology and software solutions and our ability to penetrate these markets. as part of our strategy to achieve this expansion, we look for acquisition opportunities, investments and alliance relationships with other businesses that will allow us to increase our market penetration, technological capabilities, product offerings and distribution capabilities. we may not be able to successfully identify suitable acquisition, investment and alliance candidates in the future, and if we do, they may not provide us with the value and benefits we anticipate.
our expansion into new markets is also dependent upon our ability to apply our existing technology or to develop new applications to meet the particular service needs of each new market. we may not have adequate financial or technological resources to develop effective and secure services and distribution channels that will satisfy the demands of these new markets. if we fail to expand into new and existing markets for payment technology and software solutions, we may not be able to continue to grow our revenues and earnings.
our ability to acquire other businesses or technologies, make strategic investments or integrate acquired businesses effectively may also be impaired by the effects of the covid-19 pandemic, government actions in light of the pandemic, trade tensions and increased global scrutiny of foreign investments. for example, a number of countries, including the u.s. and countries in europe and the asia-pacific region, are considering or have adopted restrictions on foreign investments. governments may continue to adopt or tighten restrictions of this nature, and such restrictions could negatively affect our business and financial results.
further, our future success will depend, in part, upon our ability to manage our expanded business, which could pose substantial challenges for our management, including challenges related to the management and monitoring of new operations and associated costs and complexity. we may also face increased scrutiny from governmental authorities as a result of increasing the size of our business.
there may be a decline in the use of cards and other electronic payments as a payment mechanism for consumers or other adverse developments with respect to the card industry in general.
if consumers do not continue to use credit, debit or gpr prepaid debit cards or other electronic payment methods of the type we process as a payment mechanism for their transactions or if there is a change in the mix of payments between cash, checks, credit cards and debit or gpr prepaid debit cards, which is adverse to us, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. consumer credit risk may make it more difficult or expensive for consumers to gain access to credit facilities such as credit cards. regulatory changes may result in financial institutions seeking to charge their customers additional fees for use of credit or debit cards. such fees may result in decreased use of credit or debit cards by cardholders. in each case, our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows may be adversely affected.
consolidation among financial institutions or among retail customers, including the merger of our customers with entities that are not our customers or the sale of portfolios by our customers to entities that are not our customers, could materially affect our financial position, results of operation and cash flows.
consolidation among financial institutions, particularly in the area of credit card operations, and consolidation in the retail industry, is a risk that could negatively affect our existing agreements and future revenues with these customers. in addition, consolidation among financial institutions has led to an increasingly concentrated customer base, which results in a changing mix toward larger customers. continued consolidation among financial institutions could increase the bargaining power of our current and future customers and further increase our customer concentration. consolidation among financial institutions and retail customers and the resulting loss of any significant number of customers by us could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.
if we do not renew or renegotiate our agreements on favorable terms with our customers within the issuer solutions segment, our business will suffer. the timing of the conversions or deconversions of card portfolio may also affect our revenues and expenses.
a significant amount of our issuer solutions segment revenues is derived from long-term contracts with large financial institutions and other financial service providers. the financial position of these customers and their willingness to pay for our services are affected by general market positions, competitive pressures and operating margins within their industries. when our long-term contracts expire, the time of renewal or renegotiation presents our customers with the opportunity to consider other providers, transition all or a portion of the services we provide in-house or seek lower rates for our services. additionally, as we modernize the technology platform we use to deliver services, some issuer solutions customers may not be agreeable to our modernization effort, and may choose to end their contracts prematurely, or not renew their contracts, as a result. the loss of our contracts with existing customers or renegotiation of contracts at reduced rates or reduced service levels could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.
in addition, the timing of the conversion of card portfolios of new payment processing customers to our processing systems and the deconversion of existing customers to other systems affects our revenues and expenses. due to a variety of factors, conversions and deconversions may not occur as scheduled and this may have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations.
we incur chargeback losses when our merchants refuse or cannot reimburse us for chargebacks resolved in favor of their customers. any increase in chargebacks not paid by our merchants may adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
in the event a dispute between a cardholder and a merchant is not resolved in favor of the merchant, the transaction is normally charged back to the merchant and the purchase price is credited or otherwise refunded to the cardholder. if we are unable to collect such amounts from the merchant's account or reserve account (if applicable), or if the merchant refuses or is unable, due to closure, bankruptcy or other reasons, to reimburse us for a chargeback, we bear the loss for the amount of the refund paid to the cardholder. the risk of chargebacks is typically greater with those merchants that promise future delivery of goods and services rather than delivering goods or rendering services at the time of payment. we may experience significant losses from chargebacks in the future. any increase in chargebacks not paid by our merchants could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. we have policies to manage merchant-related credit risk and often mitigate such risk by requiring collateral and monitoring transaction activity. notwithstanding our programs and policies for managing credit risk, it is possible that a default on such obligations by one or more of our merchants could have a material adverse effect on our business.
fraud by merchants, prepaid cardholders or others and losses from overdrawn cardholder accounts could have an adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
we have potential liability for fraudulent electronic payment transactions or credits initiated by merchants or others, and our prepaid card programs expose us to threats involving the misuse of cards, collusion, fraud and identity theft. criminals are using increasingly sophisticated methods to engage in illegal activities such as counterfeiting and fraud. failure to effectively manage risk and prevent fraud could increase our chargeback losses or cause us to incur other liabilities. it is possible that incidents of fraud could increase in the future. increases in chargebacks or other liabilities could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
additionally, covid-19 has negatively affected the financial viability and operations of certain merchants. these consolidated financial statements reflect management's estimates and assumptions related to allowances for transaction and credit losses utilizing the most currently available information. the future magnitude, duration and effects of the covid-19 pandemic are difficult to predict at this time, and the ultimate effect could result in additional charges related to the recoverability of assets. actual losses could differ materially from those estimates.
increases in card network fees may result in the loss of customers and/or a reduction in our earnings.
from time-to-time, the card networks, including visa and mastercard, increase the fees that they charge processors. we could attempt to pass these increases along to our merchant customers, but this strategy might result in the loss of customers to our competitors who may not pass along the increases, thereby reducing our revenues and earnings. if competitive practices prevent us from passing along the higher fees to our merchant customers in the future, we may have to absorb all or a portion of such increases, thereby reducing our earnings.
the integration and conversion of our acquired operations or other future acquisitions, if any, could result in increased operating costs if the anticipated synergies of operating these businesses as one are not achieved, a loss of strategic opportunities if management is distracted by the integration process, and a loss of customers if our service levels drop during or following the integration process.
the acquisition, integration, and conversion of businesses and the formation or operation of alliances, such as the merger or joint ventures and other partnering arrangements, involve a number of risks. core risks are in the area of valuation (negotiating a fair price for the business based on sometimes limited diligence) and integration and conversion (managing the complex process of integrating the acquired company's people, services, information security and technology and other assets to realize the projected value of the acquired company and the synergies projected to be realized in connection with the acquisition). in addition, international acquisitions and alliances often involve additional or increased risks, including, for example: managing geographically separated organizations, systems, and facilities; integrating personnel with diverse business backgrounds and organizational cultures; complying with foreign regulatory requirements; fluctuations in currency exchange rates; enforcement of intellectual property rights in some foreign countries; difficulty entering new foreign markets due to, among other things, customer acceptance and business knowledge of those new markets; and general economic and political conditions.
if the integration and conversion process does not proceed smoothly, the following factors, among others, could reduce our revenues and earnings, increase our operating costs, and result in us not achieving projected synergies:
•if we are unable to successfully integrate the benefits plans, duties and responsibilities, and other factors of interest to the management and employees of the acquired business, we could lose employees to our competitors in the region, which could significantly affect our ability to operate the business and complete the integration;
•if the integration process causes any delays with the delivery of our services, or the quality of those services, we could lose customers to our competitors;
•the acquisition may otherwise cause disruption to the acquired company's business and operations and relationships with financial institution sponsors, customers, merchants, employees and other partners;
•the acquisition and the related integration could divert the attention of our management from other strategic matters including possible acquisitions and alliances and planning for new product development or expansion into new markets for payments technology and software solutions; and
•the costs related to the integration of the acquired company's business and operations into ours may be greater than anticipated.
legal, regulatory compliance and tax risks our business is subject to government regulation and oversight. any new implementation of or changes made to laws, regulations or other industry standards affecting our business in any of the geographic regions in which we operate may require significant development efforts or have an unfavorable effect on our financial results and our cash flows.
our business is affected by laws and regulations and examinations that affect us and our industry in the countries in which we operate. regulation and proposed regulation of the payments industry has increased significantly in recent years. failure to comply with regulations or guidelines may result in the suspension or revocation of a license or registration, the limitation, suspension or termination of service, and the imposition of civil and criminal penalties, including fines, or may cause customers or potential customers to be reluctant to do business with us, any of which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition.
interchange fees are subject to intense legal, regulatory and legislative scrutiny worldwide. for instance, the dodd-frank act restricts the amounts of debit card fees that certain issuing institutions can charge merchants and allows merchants to set minimum amounts for the acceptance of credit cards and to offer discounts for different payment methods. these types of restrictions could negatively affect the number of debit transactions, which would adversely affect our business. the dodd-frank act also created the cfpb, which has assumed responsibility for enforcing federal consumer protection laws, and the financial stability oversight council, which has the authority to determine whether any nonbank financial company, such as us, should be supervised by the board of governors of the federal reserve on the ground that it is "systemically important" to the u.s. financial system. any such designation would result in increased regulatory burdens on our business, which increases our risk profile and may have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
all persons offering or providing financial services or products to consumers, directly or indirectly, can be subject to prohibitions against unfair, deceptive, or abusive acts or practices under the dodd-frank act. more generally, all persons engaged in commerce, including, but not limited to, us and our merchant and financial institution customers, are also subject to section 5 of the federal trade commission ("ftc") act prohibiting unfair or deceptive acts or practices ("udap"). in addition, there are other laws, rules and or regulations, including the telemarketing sales act, that may directly affect us or the activities of our merchant customers and in some cases may subject us to investigations, fees, fines and disgorgement of funds in the event we are deemed to have aided and abetted or otherwise provided the means and instrumentalities to facilitate the illegal activities of the merchant through our payment processing services. various federal and state regulatory enforcement agencies, including the ftc, the cfpb and the states' attorneys general have the authority to take action against nonbanks that engage in udap or violate other laws, rules or regulations and, to the extent we are in violation of these laws, rules or regulations or processing payments for a merchant that may be in violation of these laws, rules or regulations, we may be subject to enforcement actions and as a result may incur losses and liabilities.
in many countries, we are legally or contractually required to comply with the anti-money laundering laws and regulations, such as, in the united states, the bank secrecy act and similar laws of other countries, which require that customer identifying information be obtained and verified. in some countries, we are directly subject to these requirements; in other countries, we have contractually agreed to assist our financial institution customers with their obligation to comply with anti-money laundering requirements that apply to them. in addition, we and our sponsor financial institutions are subject to the laws and regulations enforced by ofac, which prohibit u.s. persons from engaging in transactions with certain prohibited persons or entities. similar requirements apply in other countries. our failure to comply with any of these contractual requirements or laws could adversely affect our business, financial credit results of operations and cash flows.
we are also subject to a variety of foreign and domestic laws, and their implementing regulations, which establish requirements for the collection, processing, storage, use and disclosure of personal information, require notice to individuals of privacy practices, and provide individuals with certain rights to prevent use and disclosure of protected information. for example, we are subject to applicable privacy and information security regulations in the regions where we operate; the payment services directive in europe; the e.u. general data protection regulation; the code of conduct for the credit and debit card industry in canada (issued by canada's department of finance); the california consumer protection act; the housing assistance tax act of 2008 in the united states; hipaa and other health privacy regulations and a myriad of u.s. federal and state consumer protection laws and state escheat regulations. in addition, the u.k. payment systems regulator has increased its oversight of the card acquiring industry. we are also subject to examination by the ffiec as a result of our provision of data processing services to financial institutions. it is possible that these laws may be interpreted and applied in a manner that is inconsistent with our data privacy practices or operations model, which could result in potential liability for fines, damages or a need to incur substantial costs to modify our operations. compliance with these laws and regulations can be costly and time consuming, adding a layer of complexity to business practices and innovation. as with other regulatory schemes, our failure to comply could result in public or private enforcement action and accompanying litigation costs, losses, fines and penalties.
portions of our business may be subject to the fdcpa, the fcra and similar state laws. these debt collection laws are designed to eliminate abusive, deceptive and unfair debt collection practices and may require licensing at the state level. if we fail to comply with any of these laws, to the extent they are applicable to us, we may be subject to fines, penalties and litigation.
with respect to our business and consumer solutions segment, because each distributor offers prepaid cards, reload services and/or money remittance services as an agent of business and consumer solutions, or another third party, we do not believe that the distributors themselves are required to become licensed as money transmitters in order to engage in such activity. however, there is a risk that a federal or state regulator will take a contrary position and initiate enforcement or other proceedings against a distributor, us, our issuing banks or our other service providers. if we are unsuccessful in making a persuasive argument that a distributor should not be subject to such licensing requirements and it is therefore deemed to be in violation of one or more of the state money transmitter statutes, it could result in the imposition of fines, the suspension of the distributor's ability to offer some or all of our related services in the relevant jurisdiction, civil liability and criminal liability, each of which could negatively affect our financial position and results of operations. furthermore, if the federal government or one or more state governments impose additional legislative or regulatory requirements on our business and consumer solutions segment, the issuing banks or the distributors, or prohibit or limit the activities of our business and consumer solutions segment as currently conducted, we may be required to modify or terminate some or all of our business and consumer solutions services offered in the relevant jurisdiction or certain of the issuing banks may terminate their relationship with us. moreover, as a number of our business and consumer solutions distributors are engaged in offering payday, title and/or installment loans, current and future legislative and regulatory restrictions that negatively affect their ability to continue their operations could have a corresponding negative effect on our revenue and earnings from these relationships, potentially resulting in a significant decline in revenue from the business and consumer solutions segment.
changes to legal rules and regulations, or interpretation or enforcement thereof, even if not directed at us, may require significant efforts to change our systems and services and may require changes to how we price our services to customers, adversely affecting our business. even an inadvertent failure to comply with laws and regulations, as well as rapidly evolving social expectations of corporate fairness, could damage our business or our reputation.
new or revised tax regulations, unfavorable resolution of tax contingencies or changes to enacted tax rates could adversely affect our tax expense.
changes in tax laws or their interpretations could result in changes to enacted tax rates and may require complex computations to be performed that were not previously required, significant judgments to be made in interpretation of the new or revised tax regulations and significant estimates in calculations, as well as the preparation and analysis of information not previously relevant or regularly produced. future changes in enacted tax rates could negatively affect our results of operations.
our tax returns and positions are subject to review and audit by federal, state, local and international taxing authorities. an unfavorable outcome to a tax audit could result in higher tax expense, thereby negatively affecting our results of operations and cash flows. we have recognized estimated liabilities on the balance sheet for material known tax exposures relating to deductions, transactions and other matters involving some uncertainty as to the proper tax treatment of the item. these liabilities reflect what we believe to be reasonable assumptions as to the likely final resolution of each issue if raised by a taxing authority. while we believe that the liabilities are adequate to cover reasonably expected tax risks, there can be no assurance that, in all instances, an issue raised by a tax authority will be finally resolved at a financial amount no more than any related liability. an unfavorable resolution, therefore, could negatively affect our financial position, results of operations and cash flows in the current and/or future periods.
our risk management policies and procedures may not be fully effective in mitigating our risk exposure in all market environments or against all types of risk.
we operate in a rapidly changing industry. accordingly, our risk management policies and procedures may not be fully effective to identify, monitor and manage our risks. if our policies and procedures are not fully effective or if we are not always successful in identifying and mitigating all risks to which we are or may be exposed, we may suffer uninsured liability, harm to our reputation or be subject to litigation or regulatory actions that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
financial risks we are subject to risks associated with changes in interest rates or currency exchange rates, which could adversely affect our business, financial position, results of operations and cash flows, and we may not effectively hedge against these risks.
a portion of our current indebtedness bears interest at a variable rate, and we may incur additional variable-rate indebtedness in the future. increases in interest rates will reduce our operating cash flows and could hinder our ability to fund our operations, capital expenditures, acquisitions, share repurchases or dividends.
we are also subject to risks related to the changes in currency exchange rates as a result of our investments in foreign operations and from revenues generated in currencies other than the u.s. dollar. revenues and profit generated by international operations will increase or decrease compared to prior periods as a result of changes in currency exchange rates. volatility in currency exchange rates has affected and may continue to affect our financial results.
in certain of the jurisdictions in which we operate, we may become subject to exchange control regulations that might restrict or prohibit the conversion of our foreign currencies into u.s. dollars or limit our ability to freely move currency in or out of particular jurisdictions. the occurrence of any of these factors could decrease the value of revenues we receive from our international operations and have a material adverse effect on our business.
we may seek to reduce our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates or currency exchange rates through the use of hedging arrangements. to the extent that we hedge our interest rate or currency exchange rate exposures, we forgo the benefits we would otherwise experience if interest rates or currency exchange rates were to change in our favor. developing an effective strategy for dealing with movements in interest rates and currency exchange rates is complex, and no strategy can completely insulate us from risks associated with such fluctuations. in addition, a counterparty to the arrangement could default on its obligation, thereby exposing us to credit risk. we may have to repay certain costs, such as transaction fees or breakage costs, if we terminate these arrangements.
a downgrade in the ratings of our debt could restrict our ability to access the debt capital markets and increase our interest costs.
we currently maintain investment credit ratings with moody's investors service and standard & poor's ratings services. unfavorable changes in the ratings that rating agencies assign to our debt may ultimately negatively affect our access to the debt capital markets and increase the costs we incur to borrow funds. if ratings for our debt fall below investment grade, our access to the capital markets could become restricted and our relationships with certain customers of our issuer solutions segment could also be affected. future tightening in the credit markets and a reduced level of liquidity in many financial markets due to turmoil in the financial and banking industries could affect our access to the debt capital markets or the price we pay to issue debt. additionally, our credit facilities include an increase in interest rates if the ratings for our debt are downgraded.
the alteration or replacement of the london interbank offered rate ("libor") benchmark interest rate could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
a portion of our current indebtedness bears interest at a variable rate based on libor, and we may incur additional variable indebtedness based on libor. furthermore, we have entered into hedging instruments to manage our exposure to fluctuations in the libor benchmark interest rate. in july 2017, the united kingdom's financial conduct authority ("fca"), a regulator of financial services firms and financial markets in the united kingdom, stated that they will plan for a phase out of regulatory oversight of libor interest rates indices. the fca has indicated they will support the libor indices through 2021, to allow for an orderly transition to an alternative reference rate. it is possible that the ice benchmark administration limited (formerly nyse euronext rate administration limited) and the panel banks which contribute to libor could continue to produce libor on the current basis after 2021. the ice benchmark administration limited recently announced that it will consult on its intention to extend the publication of most tenors libor to june 30, 2023. the alternative reference rates committee has proposed the secured overnight financing rate ("sofr") as its recommended alternative to libor, and the federal reserve bank of new york began publishing sofr rates in april 2018. at this time, it is not possible to predict when libor will be replaced as the reference rate in the agreements governing the company's indebtedness and hedging agreements or the effect any discontinuance, modification or other reforms to libor, or the establishment of alternative reference rates such as sofr, or any other reference rate, will have on the company. however, if libor ceases to exist or if the methods of calculating libor change from their current form, the company's borrowing costs may be adversely affected.
failure to maintain effective internal controls in accordance with section 404 of the sarbanes-oxley act could have a material adverse effect on our business.
section 404 of the sarbanes-oxley act requires us to evaluate annually the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of the end of each year and to include a management report assessing the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting in our annual report. if we fail to maintain the adequacy of our internal controls, including, but not limited to, preventing unauthorized access to our systems, we may not be able to ensure that we can conclude on an ongoing basis that we have effective internal control over financial reporting. furthermore, this assessment may be complicated by any acquisitions we have completed or may complete.
in certain markets, including, without limitation, china and spain, our member sponsors perform payment processing operations and related support services pursuant to services agreements. we expect that the member sponsors will continue to provide these services until such time as we may integrate these functions into our operations. accordingly, we rely on our member sponsors to provide financial data, such as amounts billed to merchants, to assist us with compiling our accounting records. as such, our internal control over financial reporting could be materially affected, or is reasonably likely to be materially affected, by the internal control and procedures of our member sponsors in these markets.
while we continue to dedicate resources and management time to ensuring that we have effective internal control over financial reporting, failure to achieve and maintain an effective internal control environment could have a material adverse effect on the market's perception of our business and on our stock price.
intellectual property risks we may not be able to successfully manage our intellectual property and may be subject to infringement claims.
in our rapidly developing legal framework, we rely on a combination of contractual rights and copyright, trademark, patent and trade secret laws to establish and protect our proprietary technology. despite our efforts to protect our intellectual property, third parties may infringe or misappropriate our intellectual property or may develop software or technology that competes with ours. our competitors may independently develop similar technology, duplicate our services or design around our intellectual property rights. we may have to litigate to enforce and protect our intellectual property rights, trade secrets and know-how or to determine their scope, validity or enforceability, which is expensive and could cause a diversion of resources and may not prove to be successful. the loss of intellectual property protection or the inability to secure or enforce intellectual property protection could harm our business and ability to compete.
we may also be subject to costly litigation in the event our services and technology infringe upon another party's proprietary rights. third parties may have, or may eventually be issued, patents that could be infringed by our services or technology. any of these third parties could make a claim of infringement against us with respect to our services or technology. we may also be subject to claims by third parties for breach of copyright, trademark or license usage rights. any such claims and any resulting litigation could subject us to significant liability for damages. an adverse determination in any litigation of this type could limit our ability to use the intellectual property subject to these claims and require us to design around a third party's patent, which may not be possible, or to license alternative technology from another party, which may be costly. in addition, such litigation is often time consuming and expensive to defend and could result in the diversion of the time and attention of our employees.
risks related to our capital structure our substantial indebtedness could adversely affect us and limit our business flexibility.
we have a significant amount of indebtedness and may incur other debt in the future. our level of debt and the covenants to which we agreed could have negative consequences on us, including, among other things, (1) requiring us to dedicate a large portion of our cash flow from operations to servicing and repayment of the debt; (2) limiting funds available for strategic initiatives and opportunities, working capital and other general corporate needs, and (3) limiting our ability to incur certain kinds or amounts of additional indebtedness, which could restrict our flexibility to react to changes in our business, our industry and economic conditions.
we may not be able to raise additional funds to finance our future capital needs.
we may need to raise additional funds to finance our future capital needs, including developing new products and technologies or to fund future acquisitions or operating needs. if we raise additional funds through the sale of equity securities, these transactions may dilute the value of our outstanding common stock. we may also decide to issue securities, including debt securities that have rights, preferences and privileges senior to our common stock. we may be unable to raise additional funds on terms favorable to us or at all. if financing is not available or is not available on acceptable terms, we may be unable to fund our future needs. this may prevent us from increasing our market share, capitalizing on new business opportunities or remaining competitive in our industry.
our balance sheet includes significant amounts of goodwill and other intangible assets. the impairment of a portion of these assets could negatively affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
as a result of our acquisitions, a significant portion of our total assets are intangible assets (including goodwill). goodwill and intangible assets, net of amortization, together accounted for approximately 81% of our total assets as of december 31, 2020. we expect to engage in additional acquisitions, which may result in our recognition of additional intangible assets, including goodwill. we evaluate on a regular basis whether all or a portion of our goodwill and other intangible assets may be impaired. under current accounting rules, any determination that impairment has occurred would require us to record an impairment charge, which would negatively affect our earnings. an impairment of a portion of our goodwill or other intangible assets could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
the extent to which we pay dividends on our common stock and repurchase our common stock in the future is at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend on, among other factors, our results of operations, financial condition, capital requirements and such other factors as our board of directors deems relevant. no assurance can be given that we will be able to or will choose to pay any dividends or repurchase any shares in the foreseeable future.
risks related to the covid-19 pandemic our business has been and will likely continue to be negatively affected by the covid-19 pandemic.
the covid-19 pandemic continues to adversely affect global commercial activity and has contributed to significant volatility in the financial markets. we experienced revenue declines in fiscal 2020 related to covid-19 due to a reduction in spending and closures of or slowdowns of certain of our customer businesses throughout north america, europe and asia pacific. while we expect the covid-19 pandemic will continue to have an adverse effect on our revenues and earnings in 2021, we do expect a steady and progressive economic recovery throughout the year.
we have experienced and may continue to experience adverse effects due to a number of operational factors, including but not limited to:
•third-party disruptions due to covid-19, including potential outages and service effects at network providers, call centers and other suppliers due to restrictions or closures imposed in relation to the pandemic;
•increased cyber and payment fraud risk related to covid-19, as cybercriminals attempt to profit from the disruption, given increased online banking, e-commerce, remote work and other online activity; and
•challenges to the availability and reliability of our solutions and services due to changes to operations, including the possibility of one or more clusters of covid-19 cases occurring at our facilities, affecting key employees or a significant portion of our workforce or third parties on which we depend.
•increased operational, business continuity and cybersecurity risk resulting from the significant increase in the number of our employees working remotely as a result of the pandemic. additionally, covid-19 could require new or modified processes, procedures and controls to respond to changes in our business environment.
any of these developments may remain prevalent for a significant period of time and may continue to adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows even after the covid-19 pandemic has subsided. the full effects of the covid-19 pandemic on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and are difficult to predict at this time. such developments include, but are not limited to, the ultimate severity, scope and duration of the pandemic and the preventative measures implemented to help limit the spread of the illness, the availability and effectiveness of treatments or vaccines and how soon and to what extent normal economic conditions, operations and demand for our services can resume. the continued spread of covid-19 has caused an economic slowdown and recession in the united states and other markets in which we operate, and it is possible that it could cause a global recession. it may also affect financial markets and corporate credit markets which could adversely affect our access to financing or the terms of any such financing. moreover, the global macroeconomic effects of the pandemic may persist for an indefinite period, even after the pandemic has subsided. accordingly, the ultimate effects on our operations, financial condition and cash flows cannot be determined at this time.
in addition, many of the other risk factors described herein are heightened by the effects of the covid-19 pandemic and related economic conditions, which in turn could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, access to financing, results of operations and liquidity.
risks related to general economic conditions we are subject to economic and geopolitical risk, the business cycles and credit risk of our customers and the overall level of consumer, business and government spending, which could negatively affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
the global payments technology industry depends heavily on the overall level of consumer, business and government spending. we are exposed to general economic conditions that affect consumer confidence, spending, and discretionary income and changes in consumer purchasing habits. a sustained deterioration in general economic conditions in the markets in which we operate or increases in interest rates may adversely affect our financial performance by reducing the number or average purchase amount of transactions made using electronic payments. a reduction in the amount of consumer spending could result in a decrease in our revenues and profits. if our merchants make fewer sales to consumers using electronic payments or consumers using electronic payments spend less per transaction, we will have fewer transactions to process or lower transaction amounts, each of which would contribute to lower revenues. additionally, credit card issuers may reduce credit limits and become more selective in their card issuance practices. any of these developments could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations.
a downturn in the economy could force merchants, financial institutions or other customers to close or petition for bankruptcy protection, resulting in lower revenue and earnings for us and greater exposure to potential credit losses and future transaction declines. we also have a certain amount of fixed costs, including rent, debt service, and salaries, which could limit our ability to quickly adjust costs and respond to changes in our business and the economy. changes in economic conditions could also adversely affect our future revenues and profits and cause a materially adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
reject losses arise from the fact that, in most markets, we collect our fees from our merchants on the first day after the monthly billing period. this results in the build-up of a substantial receivable from our customers. if a merchant were to go out of business during the billing period, we may be unable to collect such fees, which could negatively affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
in addition, our business, growth, financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected by instability or changes in a country's or region's economic conditions; inflation; changes in laws or regulations or in the interpretation of existing laws or regulations, whether caused by a change in government or otherwise; increased difficulty of conducting business in a country or region due to actual or potential political or military conflict; or action by the united states or foreign governments that may restrict our ability to transact business in a foreign country or with certain foreign individuals or entities. a possible slowdown in global trade caused by increasing tariffs or other restrictions could decrease consumer or corporate confidence and reduce consumer, government and corporate spending in countries inside or outside the united states, which could adversely affect our operations.
on january 31, 2020, the united kingdom ceased to be a member state of the european union ("brexit"), with a transition period that ended on december 31, 2020. during the transition period, existing arrangements between the u.k. and the e.u. remained in place. following the transition period, the u.k. is no longer a part of the e.u. single market. in december 2020, the u.k and e.u. announced they had entered into a post-brexit deal on certain aspects of trade and other strategic and political issues. this new agreement could potentially avoid some of the anticipated disruption of the u.k.'s exit from the e.u. while we have not experienced significant adverse effects on our u.k. business and its financial condition, results of operations and cash flows to date as a result of the new deal, no assurance can be given regarding the potential future effects of the agreed brexit trade deal, and our u.k. business and our financial conditions, results of operations and cash flows may be adversely affected.
general risk factors if we lose key personnel or are unable to attract additional qualified personnel as we grow, our business could be adversely affected.
all of our businesses function at the intersection of rapidly changing technological, social, economic and regulatory developments that requires a wide ranging set of expertise and intellectual capital. to successfully compete and grow, we must recruit, develop and retain personnel who can provide the needed expertise across the entire spectrum of intellectual capital needs. in addition, we must develop our personnel to fulfill succession plans capable of maintaining continuity in the midst of the inevitable unpredictability of human capital. however, the market for qualified personnel is competitive, and we may not succeed in recruiting additional personnel or may fail to effectively replace current personnel who depart with qualified or effective successors. we cannot assure that key personnel, including executive officers, will continue to be employed or that we will be able to attract and retain qualified personnel in the future. failure to retain or attract key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
the costs and effects of pending and future litigation, investigations or similar matters, or adverse facts and developments related thereto, could materially affect our business, financial position, results of operations and cash flows.
we are from time-to-time involved in various litigation matters and governmental or regulatory investigations or similar matters arising out of our current or future business. our insurance or indemnities may not cover all claims that may be asserted against us, and any claims asserted against us, regardless of merit or eventual outcome, may harm our reputation. litigation could be costly, time-consuming and divert attention of management from daily operational needs. furthermore, there is no guarantee that we will be successful in defending ourselves in pending or future litigation or similar matters under various laws.
should the ultimate judgments or settlements in any pending litigation or future litigation or investigation significantly exceed our insurance coverage, they could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
item 7 - management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with "item 6 - selected financial data" and "item 8 - financial statements and supplementary data." this discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements about our plans and expectations of what may happen in the future. forward-looking statements are based on a number of assumptions and estimates that are inherently subject to significant risks and uncertainties, and our actual results could differ materially from the results anticipated by our forward-looking statements as a result of many known and unknown factors, including but not limited to, those discussed in "item 1a - risk factors." see "cautionary notice regarding forward-looking statements" located above in "item 1 - business."
discussions of our results of operations for the year ended december 31, 2019 compared to the year ended december 31, 2018 that have been omitted under this item can be found in "part ii, item 7 - management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations" in our form 10-k for the year ended december 31, 2019, which was filed with the united states securities and exchange commission on february 21, 2020.
executive overview we are a leading pure play payments technology company delivering innovative software and services to our customers globally. our technologies, services and employee expertise enable us to provide a broad range of solutions that allow our customers to operate their businesses more efficiently across a variety of channels around the world. we operate in three reportable segments: merchant solutions, issuer solutions and business and consumer solutions. see "note 16-segment information" in the notes to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for additional information about our segments.
on september 18, 2019, we consummated our merger with total system services, inc. ("tsys") (the "merger") for total purchase consideration of $24.5 billion, primarily funded with shares of our common stock. prior to the merger, tsys was a leading global payments provider, offering seamless, secure and innovative solutions to issuers, merchants and consumers. consolidated operating results for the year ended december 31, 2020 reflect a full year of the acquired operations of tsys, while the prior year includes the acquired operations of tsys only from the acquisition date through december 31, 2019. we continue to focus on merger and integration activities, such as combining business operations, aligning go-to-market strategies, streamlining technology infrastructure, eliminating duplicative corporate and operational support structures and realizing scale efficiencies. we also continue to invest in software and hardware to support the development of new technologies, infrastructure to support our growing business and continued consolidation and enhancement of our operating platforms. see "note 2-acquisitions" in the notes to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the merger.
effects of covid-19 on our business in march 2020, the world health organization declared the outbreak of the covid-19 virus a global pandemic. during 2020 and continuing into 2021, the global economy has been, and continues to be, affected by covid-19. the pandemic has caused and may continue to cause significant disruptions to businesses and markets worldwide as the virus continues to spread or has a resurgence in certain jurisdictions. the pandemic and measures to prevent its spread affected our financial results during 2020. as governments took actions to encourage social distancing and implement shelter-in-place directives, spending and transaction volumes decreased beginning in mid-march 2020. we saw improvement in our financial results and positive trends during the latter half of 2020 as certain state and local governments in the united states and abroad began to gradually ease restrictions, certain businesses reopened and spending increased. while we continue to see signs of economic recovery, the rate of recovery has been affected by the recent reinstatement of restrictions in certain jurisdictions both in the united states and internationally due to a resurgence of the virus.
we have taken a number of actions to preserve our available capital and provide financial flexibility in response to the effects of covid-19 on our business, including temporarily suspending our share repurchase program during the second and third quarters of 2020 and reducing our planned capital investments in the business. we also implemented cost-saving actions, such as reductions in employee compensation costs and discretionary spending, to help mitigate the financial effects of the covid-19 pandemic. we continue to closely monitor the evolving effects of the covid-19 pandemic; however, the implications on future global economic conditions and related effects on our business and financial condition are difficult to predict due to uncertainties around the ultimate severity, scope and duration of the pandemic, the availability and effectiveness of treatments or vaccines and the direction or extent of current or future restrictive actions that may be imposed by governments or public health authorities. while we expect the covid-19 pandemic will continue to have an adverse effect on our revenues and earnings in 2021, we do expect a steady and progressive recovery throughout the year.
for a further discussion of trends, uncertainties and other factors that could affect our future operating results related to the effects of the covid-19 pandemic, see "item 1a - risk factors."
emerging trends the payments technology industry continues to grow worldwide and as a result, certain large payment technology companies, including us, have expanded operations globally by pursuing acquisitions and creating alliances and joint ventures. we expect to continue to expand into new markets internationally and increase our scale and improve our competitiveness in existing markets by pursuing additional acquisitions and joint ventures.
the industry continues to grow as a result of wider merchant acceptance and increased use of credit and debit cards, advances in payment processing technology and migration to ecommerce, omnichannel and contactless payment solutions. the proliferation of credit and debit cards, as well as other digital payment solutions, has made the acceptance of electronic payments a virtual necessity for many businesses, regardless of size, in order to remain competitive. further, the expanding digitization of the economy and availability and access to financial services increases the demand for cards and electronic payments, which in turn drives growth in acceptance and transaction volumes.
the outbreak of the covid-19 virus in 2020 introduced numerous economic and operational challenges for many industries and businesses. however, the outbreak has also accelerated the use of electronic payments, the need for development of technologies and electronic-based solutions and expansion of ecommerce, omnichannel and contactless payment solutions. we believe that the number of electronic payment transactions will continue to grow and that an increasing percentage of these will be facilitated through emerging technologies. as a result, we expect an increasing portion of our future capital investment will be allocated to support the development of new and emerging technologies.
we also believe new markets will continue to develop in areas that have been previously dominated by paper-based transactions. we expect industries such as education, government and healthcare, as well as recurring payments and business-to-business payments, to continue to see transactions migrate to electronic-based solutions. we anticipate that the continued development of new services and the emergence of new vertical markets will be a factor in the growth of our business and our revenue in the future.
for a further discussion of trends, uncertainties and other factors that could affect our continuing operating results, see the section entitled "risk factors" in item 1a in this annual report on form 10-k.
results of operations revenues merchant solutions. the majority of our merchant solutions segment revenues is generated by services priced as a percentage of transaction value or a specified fee per transaction, depending on card type or the vertical. we also earn software subscription and licensing fees, as well as other fees based on specific value-added services that may be unrelated to the number or value of transactions. these revenues depend upon a number of factors, such as demand for and price of our services, the technological competitiveness of our offerings, our reputation for providing timely and reliable service, competition within our industry and general economic conditions.
we provide payment technology and software solutions to customers and fund settlement either directly, in markets where we have direct membership with the payment networks, or through our relationship with a member financial institution in markets where we are sponsored. revenues are generally recognized in the amount of customer billing, net of interchange fees and payment network fees. we market our services through a variety of relationship-led and technology enabled distribution channels, including a direct sales force, trade associations, agent and enterprise software providers and referral arrangements with value-added resellers ("vars"). we also sell services to isos and financial institutions. in certain of these arrangements, the iso receives a share of the customer profitability in the form of a monthly residual payment, which is reflected as a component of selling, general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of income.
issuer solutions. issuer solutions segment revenues are derived from long-term processing contracts with financial institutions and other financial services providers. payment processing services revenues are generated primarily from charges based on the number of accounts on file, transactions and authorizations processed, statements generated and/or mailed, managed services, cards embossed and mailed, and other processing services for cardholder accounts on file. most of these contracts have prescribed annual minimums, penalties for early termination, and service level agreements that may affect contractual fees if specific service levels are not achieved. issuer solutions revenues also include loyalty redemption services and professional services.
business and consumer solutions. business and consumer solutions segment revenues principally consist of fees collected from cardholders and fees generated by cardholder activity in connection with the programs that we manage. customers are typically charged a fee for each purchase transaction made using their cards, unless the customer is on a monthly or annual service plan, in which case the customer is instead charged a monthly or annual subscription fee, as applicable. customers are also charged a monthly maintenance fee after a specified period of inactivity. we also charge fees associated with additional services offered in connection with certain cards, including the use of overdraft features, a variety of bill payment options, card replacement, foreign exchange and card-to-card transfers of funds initiated through our call centers. revenues are recognized net of fees charged by the payment networks for services they provide in processing transactions routed through them.
operating expenses cost of service cost of service consists primarily of salaries, wages and related expenses paid to operations and technology-related personnel, including those who monitor our transaction processing systems and settlement functions; the cost of transaction processing systems, including third-party services; the cost of network telecommunications capability; depreciation and occupancy costs associated with the facilities supporting these functions; amortization of intangible assets; amortization of costs to fulfill customer contracts; provisions for operating losses; and, when applicable, integration expenses.
selling, general and administrative expenses selling, general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries, wages, commissions and related expenses paid to sales personnel, customer support functions other than those supporting revenue, administrative employees and management; share-based compensation expense; amortization of costs to obtain customer contracts; residuals paid to isos; fees paid to vars, independent contractors and other third parties; other selling expenses; occupancy costs of leased space directly related to these functions; advertising costs; and, when applicable, acquisition and integration expenses.
operating income and operating margin for the purpose of discussing segment operations, we refer to "operating income," which is calculated by subtracting segment direct expenses from segment revenues. overhead and shared expenses, including share-based compensation, are not allocated to segment operations; they are reported in the caption "corporate." similarly, we refer to "operating margin" regarding segment operations, which is calculated by dividing segment operating income by segment revenues.
equity in income of equity method investments as a result of the merger, we have equity method investments, including a 45% investment in china unionpay data co., ltd., which we account for using the equity method of accounting. equity in income of equity method investments reflects our proportional share of earnings from these investments.
the following table sets forth key selected financial data for the years ended december 31, 2020 and 2019, this data as a percentage of total revenues, and the changes between periods in dollars and as a percentage of the prior-period amount. the income statement data for the years ended december 31, 2020 and 2019 are derived from the accompanying consolidated financial statements included in "item 8 - financial statements and supplementary data."

(2) revenues, consolidated operating expenses, operating income (loss) and operating margin reflect the effects of acquired businesses from the respective acquisition dates. for further discussion, see "note 2-acquisitions" in the notes to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.
(3) during the years ended december 31, 2020 and 2019, operating income for our merchant solutions segment reflected the effect of acquisition and integration expenses of $7.0 million and $56.1 million. operating loss for corporate included acquisition and integration expenses of $313.0 million and $199.5 million during the years ended december 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. acquisition and integration expenses were primarily related to the merger.
revenues consolidated revenues for the year ended december 31, 2020 increased by 51.1% to $7,423.6 million, compared to $4,911.9 million for the prior year, primarily due to additional revenues from the acquired operations of tsys. revenues from the acquired operations of tsys were $4,205.2 million for the year ended december 31, 2020, compared to $1,215.0 million for the prior year. starting in mid-march 2020, covid-19 had an unfavorable effect on our revenues; however, we saw improvements throughout the latter half of 2020.
merchant solutions segment. revenues from our merchant solutions segment increased to $4,688.3 million, compared to $4,098.6 million for the prior year, primarily due to additional revenues from the acquired operations of tsys. starting in mid-march, covid-19 had an unfavorable effect on our revenues as a result of a reduction in spending and transaction volumes and closures of certain of our customer businesses throughout north america, europe and asia pacific. we saw improvement in our financial results during the latter half of 2020 as state and local governments in the united states and governments abroad began to gradually ease pandemic-related restrictions and spending increased. while we continue to see signs of economic recovery, the rate of recovery has been affected by the reinstatement of restrictions in certain jurisdictions due to a resurgence of the virus during the fourth quarter.
issuer solutions segment. revenues from our issuer solutions segment for the year ended december 31, 2020 was $1,981.4 million, compared to $604.7 million for the prior year, primarily reflecting revenues from the acquired operations of tsys. starting in mid-march, covid-19 had an unfavorable effect on our revenues as a result of lower transaction volumes, particularly related to the processing of commercial cards. we saw improvement in our financial results during the latter half of 2020 as state and local governments in the united states and governments abroad began to gradually ease pandemic-related restrictions. while we continue to see signs of economic recovery, the rate of recovery has been affected by the reinstatement of restrictions in certain jurisdictions due to a resurgence of the virus during the fourth quarter.
business and consumer solutions segment. revenues from our business and consumer solutions segment for the year ended december 31, 2020 was $829.5 million, compared to $227.4 million for the prior year, reflecting revenues from the acquired operations of tsys. our business and consumer solutions segment experienced an unfavorable effect on revenues starting in mid-march due to reduced consumer spending as a result of covid-19; however, these declines were mitigated by revenues from our customers loading individual stimulus payments and federal supplementary unemployment insurance distributions resulting from the coronavirus aid, relief and economic security act in the second and third quarters. additionally, we saw improvement in our financial results throughout the latter half of 2020 from increases in consumer spending as state and local governments in the united states began to gradually ease restrictions. additional stimulus payment distributions in 2021 to provide relief from the effect of the covid-19 pandemic could have a positive effect on our revenues; however, the ultimate timing and magnitude is difficult to predict.
operating expenses cost of service. cost of service for the year ended december 31, 2020 increased by 76.0% to $3,650.7 million, compared to $2,073.8 million for the prior year, primarily due to additional costs associated with the acquired operations of tsys, including the amortization of intangibles. cost of service for the year ended december 31, 2020 reflects amortization of acquired intangibles of $1,256.9 million, compared to $667.1 million for the prior year. the year ended december 31, 2019 also reflects integration expenses of $41.8 million. cost of service as a percentage of revenues increased to 49.2% for the year ended december 31, 2020, compared to 42.2% for the prior year, primarily due to the increase in amortization of acquired intangibles.
selling, general and administrative expenses. selling, general and administrative expenses for the year ended december 31, 2020 increased by 40.7% to $2,878.9 million, compared to $2,046.7 million for the prior year. the increase in selling, general and administrative expenses compared to the prior year was primarily due to additional costs associated with the acquired operations of tsys. additionally, selling, general and administrative expenses included acquisition and integration expenses of $319.5 million, compared to $213.8 million for the prior year. selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues decreased to 38.8% for the year ended december 31, 2020, compared to 41.7% for the prior year, primarily due to the favorable effects of merger-related cost synergies and cost-saving actions taken to mitigate the financial effects of the covid-19 pandemic.
corporate. corporate expenses increased by $225.9 million to $685.1 million for the year ended december 31, 2020, compared to $459.2 million for the prior year, primarily due to additional expenses associated with the acquired operations of tsys and an increase in acquisition and integration expenses primarily due to the merger. during the years ended december 31, 2020 and 2019, corporate expenses included acquisition and integration expenses of $313.0 million and $199.5 million, respectively. certain of these merger-related integration activities resulted in the recognition of one-time employee termination benefits. during the years ended december 31, 2020 and 2019, corporate expenses included charges for employee termination benefits of $83.3 million and $57.1 million, respectively, which included $6.7 million and $17.3 million, respectively, of share-based compensation expense. in addition, during the year ended december 31, 2019, we wrote-off capitalized software and other assets of $40.2 million for legacy global payments technology that will no longer be utilized for the combined company. we expect to incur additional charges as merger-related integration activities continue in 2021.
operating income and operating margin consolidated operating income for the year ended december 31, 2020 increased to $894.0 million, compared to $791.4 million for the prior year. operating margin for the year ended december 31, 2020 decreased to 12.0%, compared to 16.1% for the prior year. consolidated operating income for the year ended december 31, 2020 includes income from the acquired operations of tsys of $538.0 million compared to $78.7 million for the prior year. consolidated operating income for the year ended december 31, 2020 reflects an increase in amortization of acquired intangibles and acquisition and integration expenses of $589.8 million and $64.4 million, respectively, compared to the prior year. the unfavorable effects of covid-19 on our revenues and incremental expenses directly related to covid-19 also negatively affected consolidated operating income and operating margin compared to the prior year. we saw improvement in our financial results and positive trends throughout the latter half of 2020 as a result of the recovery seen across our markets. further, merger-related cost synergies and cost-saving actions taken to mitigate the financial effects of the covid-19 pandemic had a favorable effect on operating income and operating margin for the year ended december 31, 2020.
merchant solutions segment. operating income in our merchant solutions segment was $1,162.7 million for the year ended december 31, 2020, compared to $1,149.0 million for the prior year. operating income and operating margin in our merchant solutions segment reflect additional income from the acquired operations of tsys, partially offset by the unfavorable effects of covid-19 on our revenues, which negatively affected operating income and operating margin during 2020. we saw improvement in our financial results and positive trends throughout the latter half of 2020 as a result of the recovery seen across our geographic markets. further, merger-related cost synergies and cost-saving actions taken to mitigate the financial effects of the covid-19 pandemic had a favorable effect on operating income and operating margin for the year ended december 31, 2020.
issuer solutions and business and consumer solutions segments. operating income in our issuer solutions and business and consumer solutions segments primarily reflects the additional income from the acquired operations of tsys.
other income/expense, net interest and other income for the year ended december 31, 2020 increased by $12.1 million to $43.6 million, compared to the prior year, primarily due to a gain of $27.7 million in connection with the release and conversion of a portion of our visa convertible preferred shares. see "note 7-other assets" in the notes to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further discussion of this transaction. interest and other income for the year ended december 31, 2019 included interest earned on the net proceeds from the issuance of our unsecured senior notes while they were in escrow.
interest and other expense for the year ended december 31, 2020 increased by $38.6 million to $343.5 million, compared to the prior year, as a result of the increase in our average outstanding borrowings. interest expense for the year ended december 31, 2019 included fees and charges of $30.4 million in connection with financing activities related to the merger. these fees and charges included fees associated with bridge financing and charges for the write-off of unamortized debt issuance costs related to borrowings under the credit facility that was extinguished prior to the completion of the merger.
income tax expense our effective income tax rate for the years ended december 31, 2020 and 2019 was 13.0% and 12.0%, respectively. our effective tax rate for the year ended december 31, 2020 reflects the benefit of tax credits, foreign interest income not subject to tax, excess tax benefits from equity awards and the foreign-derived intangible income deduction. our effective tax rate for the year ended december 31, 2019 reflects the effect of the discrete benefits related to the merger, principally the reduction of our u.s. deferred tax liability resulting from the effects of the merger on the apportionment of income among states, and a benefit from the foreign-derived intangible income deduction and tax credits.
net income attributable to global payments net income attributable to global payments increased to $584.5 million compared to $430.6 million for the prior-year period, reflecting the change in operating income and additional equity in income of equity method investments.
diluted earnings per share diluted earnings per share was $1.95 compared to $2.16 for the prior year. diluted earnings per share for the year ended december 31, 2020 reflects the additional income from the acquired operations of tsys. additionally, diluted earnings per share for the year ended december 31, 2020 reflects an increase in the weighted-average number of shares outstanding as a result of issuing common shares as purchase consideration in the merger.
liquidity and capital resources in the ordinary course of our business, a significant portion of our liquidity comes from operating cash flows and borrowings, including the capacity under our credit facilities. cash flow from operating activities is used to make planned capital investments in our business, to pursue acquisitions that meet our corporate objectives, to pay dividends, to pay principal and interest on our outstanding debt and to repurchase shares of our common stock. accumulated cash balances are invested in high-quality, marketable short-term instruments.
our capital plan objectives are to support our operational needs and strategic plan for long-term growth while maintaining a low cost of capital. we use a combination of bank financing, such as borrowings under our credit facilities and senior note issuances, for general corporate purposes and to fund acquisitions. in addition, specialized lines of credit are also used in certain of our markets to fund merchant settlement prior to receipt of funds from the card network.
we believe that our current level of cash and borrowing capacity under our senior unsecured revolving credit facility, together with expected future cash flows from operations, will be sufficient to meet the needs of our existing operations and planned requirements for the foreseeable future. we temporarily implemented measures to preserve liquidity, taking into account the potential effects of covid-19, including the reduction of certain operating expenses, including compensation costs, other discretionary expenses and planned capital expenditures. we also temporarily suspended repurchases of our common stock during the second and third quarters of 2020. we regularly evaluate our liquidity and capital position relative to cash requirements, and we may elect to raise additional funds in the future, through the issuance of debt or equity or by other means.
at december 31, 2020, we had cash and cash equivalents totaling $1,945.9 million. of this amount, we consider $1,100.9 million to be available for general purposes, of which $32.3 million is undistributed foreign earnings considered to be indefinitely reinvested outside the united states. the available cash of $1,100.9 million does not include the following: (i) settlement-related cash balances, (ii) funds held as collateral for merchant losses ("merchant reserves") and (iii) funds held for customers. settlement-related cash balances represent funds that we hold when the incoming amount from the card networks precedes the funding obligation to the merchant. settlement-related cash balances are not restricted; however, these funds are generally paid out in satisfaction of a processing obligation the following day. merchant reserves serve as collateral to minimize contingent liabilities associated with any losses that may occur under the merchant's agreement. while this cash is not restricted in its use, we believe that designating this cash to collateralize merchant reserves strengthens our fiduciary standing with our member sponsors and is in accordance with the guidelines set by the card networks. funds held for customers and the corresponding liability include amounts collected prior to remittance to or at the direction of our customers.
we also had restricted cash of $143.9 million as of december 31, 2020, representing amounts deposited by customers for prepaid card transactions. these balances are considered cardholder funds held and are subject to local regulatory restrictions requiring appropriate segregation and restriction in their use.
operating activities provided net cash of $2,314.2 million and $1,391.3 million for the years ended december 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, which reflect net income adjusted for noncash items, including depreciation and amortization and changes in operating assets and liabilities. fluctuations in operating assets and liabilities are affected primarily by timing of month-end and transaction volume, including changes in settlement processing assets and obligations, and by the effects of businesses we acquire that have different working capital requirements. changes in settlement processing assets and obligations increased operating cash flows by $125.9 million and $213.7 million during the years ended december 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. the increase in cash flows from operating activities from the prior year was primarily due to the increase in net earnings before certain noncash items, including amortization of acquired intangibles and depreciation and amortization of property and equipment, primarily as a result of the additional income from the acquired operations of tsys.
we used net cash in investing activities of $438.3 million and $917.1 million during the years ended december 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. cash used for investing activities primarily represents cash used to fund acquisitions, net of cash and restricted cash acquired, and capital expenditures. during the year ended december 31, 2020, we used cash of $167.9 million for acquisitions, and recorded a cash inflow of $119.4 million from restricted cash balances acquired during the year. during the year ended december 31, 2019, we used cash of $1,093.6 million for acquisitions. cash from investing activities for the year ended december 31, 2020 also reflects cash received from the sale of visa common shares of $27.7 million.
we made capital expenditures of $436.2 million and $307.9 million to purchase property and equipment during the years ended december 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. these investments include software and hardware to support the development of new technologies, infrastructure to support our growing business and continued consolidation and enhancement of our operating platforms. we will continue to make significant capital investments in the business, and we anticipate capital expenditures and other investments in the business will slowly return to near pre-covid levels. however, we continue to monitor the effects of covid-19 and adjust our future level of capital investments accordingly.
financing activities include borrowings and repayments made under our various debt arrangements, as well as borrowings and repayments made under specialized lines of credit to fund daily settlement activities. our borrowing arrangements are further described in "note 8-long-term debt and lines of credit" in the notes to the accompanying consolidated financial statements and below under "long-term debt and lines of credit." financing activities also include cash flows associated with common stock repurchase programs and share-based compensation programs, cash distributions made to our shareholders, and cash distributions to or purchase of shares from noncontrolling interests. cash flows from financing activities used net cash of $1,546.1 million and $28.7 million during the years ended december 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.
proceeds from long-term debt were $2,401.1 million and $7,203.9 million for the years ended december 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. repayments of long-term debt were $2,342.1 million and $6,484.7 million for the years ended december 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. proceeds from and repayments of long-term debt consist of borrowings and repayments that we make with available cash, from time-to-time, under our revolving credit facility, as well as scheduled principal repayments we make on our term loans. on may 15, 2020, we issued $1.0 billion in aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes. we used the net proceeds from this offering to repay a portion of the outstanding indebtedness on our revolving credit facility and for general corporate purposes. for the year ended december 31, 2019, in connection with financing activities associated with the merger, we received proceeds of $2,973.2 million from the issuance of senior unsecured notes and $2,868.0 million from our senior unsecured credit facility. we used these proceeds to repay tsys' unsecured revolving credit facility, to refinance certain of our existing indebtedness, to fund cash payments made in lieu of fractional shares payable in accordance with the terms of the merger and to pay transaction fees and costs related to the merger. during the year ended december 31, 2019, repayments of long-term debt also included $5,127.5 million for the repayment of all outstanding principal under our secured term loan and revolving credit facility, which we extinguished in connection with the merger.
activity under our settlement lines of credit is affected primarily by timing of month-end and transaction volume. during the years ended december 31, 2020 and 2019, we had net repayments of settlement lines of credit of $133.3 million and $236.5 million, respectively.
we repurchase our common stock, mainly through open market repurchase plans and, at times, through accelerated share repurchase ("asr") programs. during the years ended december 31, 2020 and 2019, we used cash of $631.1 million and $311.4 million, respectively, to repurchase shares of our common stock. we temporarily suspended repurchases of our common stock during the second and third quarters of 2020, and reactivated our repurchase program in the fourth quarter of 2020. as of december 31, 2020, we had $1,020.0 million of share repurchase authority remaining under a share repurchase program authorized by our board of directors. on january 28, 2021, our board of directors approved an increase to our existing share repurchase program authorization, which raised the total available authorization to $1.5 billion. on february 10, 2021, we entered into an asr agreement with a financial institution to repurchase an aggregate of $500 million of our common stock. in exchange for an up-front payment of $500 million, the financial institution committed to deliver a number of shares during the asr program purchase period, which will end on march 31, 2021. on february 12, 2021, 2,090,713 shares were initially delivered to us.
we paid dividends to our common shareholders in the amounts of $233.2 million and $63.5 million during the years ended december 31, 2020 and 2019. during the year ended december 31, 2019, we funded assumed dividends payable (declared by tsys' board of directors prior to consummation of the merger) to former tsys shareholders in the amount of $23.2 million.
during the years ended december 31, 2020 and 2019, we made distributions to noncontrolling interest in the amounts of $26.2 million and $31.6 million, respectively. during the year ended december 31, 2020, we paid $578.2 million to noncontrolling interest holders to increase our controlling financial interest in comercia global payments entidad de pago, s.l. ("comercia") from 51% to 80%. we funded the transaction with a combination of available cash resources and borrowings on our unsecured revolving credit facility.
long-term debt and lines of credit senior unsecured notes we have $7.1 billion in aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes, which mature at various dates ranging from april 2021 to august 2049. interest on the senior notes is payable semi-annually at various dates. each series of the senior notes is redeemable, at our option, in whole or in part, at any time and from time-to-time at the redemption prices set forth in the related indenture.
on may 15, 2020, we issued $1.0 billion in aggregate principal amount of 2.900% senior unsecured notes due may 2030 and received proceeds of $996.7 million. we incurred debt issuance costs of approximately $8.4 million, including underwriting fees, fees for professional services and registration fees, which were capitalized and reflected as a reduction of the related carrying amount of the notes in our consolidated balance sheet at december 31, 2020. interest on the notes is payable semi-annually in arrears on may 15 and november 15 of each year, commencing november 15, 2020. the notes are unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness and rank equally in right of payment with all of our other outstanding unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness. we used the net proceeds from the offering to repay a portion of the outstanding indebtedness on our revolving credit facility and for general corporate purposes.
on august 14, 2019, we completed the public offering and issuance of $3.0 billion aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes, consisting of the following: (i) $1.0 billion aggregate principal amount of 2.650% senior notes due 2025; (ii) $1.25 billion aggregate principal amount of 3.200% senior notes due 2029; and (iii) $750.0 million aggregate principal amount of 4.150% senior notes due 2049. interest on the senior notes is payable semi-annually in arrears on each february 15 and august 15, beginning on february 15, 2020. each series of the senior notes is redeemable, at our option, in whole or in part, at any time and from time-to-time at the redemption prices set forth in the related indenture. we issued the senior notes at a total discount of $6.1 million and capitalized related debt issuance costs of $29.6 million.
from august 14, 2019 until the closing of the merger on september 18, 2019, the proceeds from the issuance of the senior notes were held in escrow. upon closing, the funds were released and used together with borrowings under the term loan facility and the revolving credit facility, as well as cash on hand, to repay tsys' unsecured revolving credit facility, refinance certain of our existing indebtedness, fund cash payments made in lieu of fractional shares and pay transaction fees and costs related to the merger.

senior unsecured credit facilities we have a term loan credit agreement ("term loan credit agreement") and a revolving credit agreement ("unsecured revolving credit agreement") in each case with bank of america, n.a., as administrative agent, and a syndicate of financial institutions, as lenders and other agents. the term loan credit agreement provides for a senior unsecured $2.0 billion term loan facility, and the unsecured revolving credit agreement provides for a senior unsecured $3.0 billion revolving credit facility. borrowings under the term loan facility were made in u.s. dollars and borrowings under the revolving credit facility are available to be made in u.s. dollars, euros, sterling, canadian dollars and, subject to certain conditions, certain other currencies at our option. borrowings in u.s. dollars and certain other london interbank offered rate ("libor")-quoted currencies will bear interest, at our option, at a rate equal to either (1) the rate (adjusted for any statutory reserve requirements for eurocurrency liabilities) for eurodollar deposits in the london interbank market, (2) a floating rate of interest set forth on the applicable libor screen page designated by bank of america or (3) the highest of (a) the federal funds effective rate plus 0.5%, (b) the rate of interest as publicly announced by bank of america as its "prime rate" or (c) libor plus 1.0%, in each case, plus an applicable margin. as of december 31, 2020, borrowings outstanding under the term loan facility and the revolving credit facility were $2.0 billion and $36.0 million, respectively.
we continue to monitor developments related to the anticipated transition from libor to an alternative benchmark reference rate, such as the secured overnight financing rate ("sofr"), beginning january 1, 2022. additionally, we maintain contact with our lenders and other stakeholders to evaluate the potential effects of these changes on any future financing activities.
as of december 31, 2020, the interest rates on the term loan facility and the revolving credit facility were 1.52% and 1.48%, respectively. in addition, we are required to pay a quarterly commitment fee with respect to the unused portion of the revolving credit facility at an applicable rate per annum ranging from 0.125% to 0.300% depending on our credit rating. beginning on december 31, 2022, and at the end of each quarter thereafter, the term loan facility must be repaid in quarterly installments in the amount of 2.50% of original principal through the maturity date with the remaining principal balance due upon maturity in september 2024. the revolving credit facility also matures in september 2024.
we may issue standby letters of credit of up to $250 million in the aggregate under the revolving credit facility. outstanding letters of credit under the revolving credit facility reduce the amount of borrowings available to us. the amounts available to borrow under the revolving credit facility are also determined by a financial leverage covenant. as of december 31, 2020, the total available commitments under the revolving credit facility were $2.1 billion.
bridge facility on may 27, 2019, in connection with our entry into the merger agreement with tsys, we obtained commitments for a $2.75 billion, 364-day senior unsecured bridge facility (the "bridge facility"). on july 9, 2019, upon our entry into the senior unsecured term loan and revolving credit facilities described below, the aggregate commitments under the bridge facility were reduced to approximately $2.1 billion. concurrently with the issuance of our senior unsecured notes, the remaining aggregate commitments under the bridge facility were reduced to zero and terminated. during the year ended december 31, 2019, we recognized $11.7 million of fees associated with the bridge facility in interest expense.
compliance with covenants the senior unsecured term loan and revolving credit facilities contain customary conditions to funding, affirmative covenants, negative covenants, financial covenants and events of default. as of december 31, 2020, financial covenants under the term loan facility required a leverage ratio of 3.50 to 1.00 and an interest coverage ratio of 3.00 to 1.00. we were in compliance with all applicable covenants as of december 31, 2020.
settlement lines of credit in various markets where we do business, we have specialized lines of credit, which are restricted for use in funding settlement. the settlement lines of credit generally have variable interest rates, are subject to annual review and are denominated in local currency but may, in some cases, facilitate borrowings in multiple currencies. for certain of our lines of credit, the available credit is increased by the amount of cash we have on deposit in specific accounts with the lender. accordingly, the amount of the outstanding line of credit may exceed the stated credit limit. as of december 31, 2020 and 2019, a total of $64.5 million and $74.5 million, respectively, of cash on deposit was used to determine the available credit.
as of december 31, 2020, we had $358.7 million outstanding under these lines of credit with additional capacity to fund settlement of $1,507.6 million. during the year ended december 31, 2020, the maximum and average outstanding balances under these lines of credit were $752.5 million and $341.4 million, respectively. the weighted-average interest rate on these borrowings was 2.35% at december 31, 2020.
see "note 6-leases" and "note 8-long-term debt and lines of credit" in the notes to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further information about our borrowing agreements and our lease liabilities.
off-balance sheet arrangements we have not entered into any off-balance sheet arrangements that have, or are reasonably likely to have, a material effect on our financial condition, revenues, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources, other than the guarantee services described in "note 1 - basis of presentation and summary of significant accounting policies" in the notes to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.
bin/ica agreements we have entered into sponsorship or depository and processing agreements with certain banks. these agreements allow us to use the banks' identification numbers, referred to as bank identification number ("bin") for visa transactions and interbank card association ("ica") number for mastercard transactions, to clear credit card transactions through visa and mastercard. certain of such agreements contain financial covenants, and we were in compliance with all such covenants as of december 31, 2020.
commitments and contractual obligations the following table summarizes estimates of our contractual obligations and commitments as of december 31, 2020:
payments due by future period total                    less than 1 year                         1-3 years                         3-5 years               more than 5 years

(1) interest on long-term debt is based on effective rates and amounts borrowed as of december 31, 2020 and includes the estimated effect of interest rate swaps. since the contractual rates for our long-term debt and settlements on our interest rate swaps are variable, actual cash payments may differ from the estimates provided.
(2) operating lease obligations did not include approximately $147.5 million for operating leases that had not yet commenced at december 31, 2020. finance lease obligations did not include approximately $18.1 million for finance leases that has not yet commenced as of december 31, 2020.
(3) includes an estimate of future payments for noncancelable contractual obligations related to service arrangements with suppliers for fixed or minimum amounts.
the table above excludes other obligations that we may have, such as employee benefit obligations and other noncurrent liabilities reflected in our consolidated balance sheet, because the timing of the related payments is not determinable or because there is no contractual obligation associated with the underlying obligations.
critical accounting policies and estimates our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states, which often require the judgment of management in the selection and application of certain accounting principles and methods. we consider the following accounting policies to be critical to understanding our consolidated financial statements because the application of these policies requires significant judgment on the part of management, and as a result, actual future developments may be different from those expected at the time that we make these critical judgments. we have discussed these critical accounting policies with the audit committee of the board of directors.
accounting estimates necessarily require subjective determinations about future events and conditions. therefore, the following descriptions of our critical accounting policies are forward-looking statements, and actual results could differ materially from the results anticipated by these forward-looking statements. you should read the following in conjunction with "note 1-basis of presentation and summary of significant accounting policies" of the notes to the accompanying consolidated financial statements and the risk factors contained in "item 1a - risk factors" of this annual report on form 10-k.
business combinations from time to time, we make strategic acquisitions that may have a material effect on our consolidated results of operations and financial position. the measurement principle for the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed in a business combination is at estimated fair value as of the acquisition date, with certain exceptions. the excess of the total consideration transferred over the amount of the net identifiable assets acquired determined in accordance with the measurement guidance for such items is recorded as goodwill.
the estimates we use to determine the fair value of long-lived assets, such as intangible assets, can be complex and require significant judgments. we use information available to us to make fair value determinations and engage independent valuation specialists, when necessary, to assist in the fair value determination of significant acquired long-lived assets. the estimated fair values of customer-related and contract-based intangible assets are generally determined using the income approach, which is based on projected cash flows discounted to their present value using discount rates that consider the timing and risk of the forecasted cash flows. the discount rates used represented a risk adjusted market participant weighted-average cost of capital, derived using customary market metrics. these measures of fair value also require considerable judgments about future events, including forecasted revenue growth rates, forecasted customer attrition rates, contract renewal estimates and technology changes. acquired technologies are generally valued using the replacement cost method, which requires us to estimate the costs to construct an asset of equivalent utility at prices available at the time of the valuation analysis, with adjustments in value for physical deterioration and functional and economic obsolescence. trademarks and trade names are generally valued using the "relief-from-royalty" approach. this method assumes that trademarks and trade names have value to the extent that their owner is relieved of the obligation to pay royalties for the benefits received from them. this method requires us to estimate the future revenues for the related brands, the appropriate royalty rate and the weighted-average cost of capital. this measure of fair value requires considerable judgment about the value a market participant would be willing to pay in order to achieve the benefits associated with the trade name.
while we use our best estimates and assumptions to determine the fair values of the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed, our estimates are inherently uncertain and subject to refinement. as a result, during the measurement period, which may be up to one year from the acquisition date, we record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed. upon the conclusion of the measurement period, any subsequent adjustments are recorded to our consolidated statements of income. we are also required to estimate the useful lives of intangible assets to determine the period over which to recognize the amount of acquisition-related intangible assets as an expense. certain assets may be considered to have indefinite useful lives. we periodically review the estimated useful lives assigned to our intangible assets to determine whether such estimated useful lives continue to be appropriate.
goodwill- we perform our annual goodwill impairment test as of october 1 each year. we test goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level annually and more often if an event occurs or circumstances change that indicate the fair value of a reporting unit is below its carrying amount. we have the option of performing a qualitative assessment of impairment to determine whether any further quantitative assessment for impairment is necessary. the option of whether or not to perform a qualitative assessment is made annually and may vary by reporting unit.
factors we consider in the qualitative assessment include general macroeconomic conditions, industry and market conditions, cost factors, overall financial performance of our reporting units, events or changes affecting the composition or carrying amount of the net assets of our reporting units, sustained decrease in our share price, and other relevant entity-specific events. if we elect to bypass the qualitative assessment or if we determine, on the basis of qualitative factors, that the fair value of the reporting unit is more likely than not less than the carrying amount, a quantitative test would be required.
the quantitative assessment compares the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying amount, and recognizes an impairment loss for the amount by which a reporting unit's carrying amount exceeds its fair value, without exceeding the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. when applying the quantitative assessment, we determine the fair value of our reporting units based on a weighted average of multiple valuation techniques, principally a combination of an income approach and a market approach. the income approach calculates a value based upon the present value of estimated future cash flows, while the market approach uses earnings multiples of similarly situated guideline public companies. determining the fair value of a reporting unit involves judgment and the use of significant estimates and assumptions, which include assumptions regarding the revenue growth rates and operating margins used to calculate estimated future cash flows, risk-adjusted discount rates and future economic and market conditions.
our reporting units consist of the following: north america payment solutions, integrated solutions, vertical market software solutions, europe merchant solutions, spain merchant solutions, asia-pacific merchant solutions, issuer solutions and business and consumer solutions. as of october 1, 2020, we performed a quantitative assessment of impairment for our issuer solutions and business and consumer solutions reporting units and a qualitative assessment for all other reporting units. we determined on the basis of the quantitative assessment of our issuer solutions and business and consumer solutions reporting units that the fair value of each reporting unit is equal to or greater than its respective carrying amount. additionally, we determined on the basis of the qualitative factors that the fair value of other reporting units was not more likely than not less than the respective carrying amounts. our current year assessments also included consideration of the expected near term effects of the covid-19 pandemic on revenues and our cost mitigation efforts, as well as longer term performance expectations. we believe that the fair value of each of our reporting units is substantially in excess of its carrying amount, except for issuer solutions and business and consumer solutions for which the respective carrying amounts approximate fair value since they were recently acquired in the merger.
intangible and long-lived assets- intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives. the useful lives for customer-related intangible assets are determined based primarily on forecasted cash flows, which include estimates for the revenues, expenses, and customer attrition associated with the assets. the useful lives of contract-based intangible assets are equal to the terms of the agreements. the useful lives of amortizable trademarks and trade names are based on an estimate of the period over which we will earn revenues for the related brands, including contemplation of any future plans to phase out the trademarks and trade names in the applicable markets.
we use the straight-line method of amortization for our amortizable acquired technologies, trademarks and trade names and contract-based intangibles. amortization for most of our customer-related intangible assets is determined using an accelerated method. under this accelerated method, the first step in determining the amortization expense for any period is that we divide the expected cash flows for that period that were used in determining the acquisition-date fair value of the asset divided by the expected total cash flows over the estimated life of the asset. we then multiply that ratio by the initial carrying amount of the asset to arrive at the amortization expense for that period. if the cash flow patterns that we experience differ significantly from our initial estimates, we adjust the amortization schedule prospectively. we believe that our accelerated method reflects the expected pattern of the benefit to be derived from the acquired customer relationships. we did not make any significant adjustments to the amortization schedules of our intangible assets during the year ended december 31, 2020.
we regularly evaluate whether events and circumstances have occurred that indicate the carrying amount of property and equipment and finite-life intangible assets may not be recoverable. when factors indicate that these long-lived assets should be evaluated for possible impairment, we assess the potential impairment by determining whether the carrying amount of such long-lived assets will be recovered through the future undiscounted cash flows expected from use of the asset and its eventual disposition. the evaluation is performed at the asset group level, which is the lowest level of identifiable cash flows. if the carrying amount of the asset group is determined not to be recoverable and exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss is recorded, measured as the difference between the fair value and the carrying amount. fair values are determined based on quoted market prices or discounted cash flow analysis as applicable. we regularly evaluate whether events and circumstances have occurred that indicate the useful lives of property and equipment and finite-life intangible assets may warrant revision.
capitalization of internal-use software we develop software that is used in providing services to customers. capitalization of internal-use software, primarily associated with operating platforms, occurs when we have completed the preliminary project stage, management authorizes the project, management commits to funding the project, it is probable the project will be completed and the project will be used to perform the function intended. the preliminary project stage consists of the conceptual formulation of alternatives, the evaluation of alternatives, the determination of existence of needed technology and the final selection of alternatives. costs incurred during the preliminary project stage are recognized as expense as incurred. currently unforeseen circumstances in software development, such as a significant change in the manner in which the software is intended to be used, obsolescence or a significant reduction in revenues due to merchant attrition, could require us to implement alternative plans with respect to a particular effort, which could result in the impairment of previously capitalized software development costs. the carrying amount of internal-use software, including work-in-progress, at december 31, 2020 was $606.3 million. costs capitalized during the year ended december 31, 2020 totaled $230.3 million. internal-use software is amortized over its estimated useful life, which is typically 2 to 10 years, in a manner that best reflects the pattern of economic use of the assets.
during the fourth quarter of 2019, we preliminarily determined our target technology architecture for the combined company. as a result, we wrote-off capitalized software assets of $31.1 million related to legacy global payments technology that will no longer be utilized.
revenue recognition in accordance with accounting standards codification topic 606, revenue from contracts with customers ("asc 606"), we apply judgment in the determination of performance obligations, in particular related to large customer contracts within the issuer solutions segment. performance obligations in a contract are identified based on the goods or services that will be transferred to the customer that are both capable of being distinct, whereby the customer can benefit from the service either on its own or together with other resources that are readily available from third parties or from us, and are distinct in the context of the contract, whereby the transfer of the services is separately identifiable from other promises in the contract. to the extent a contract includes multiple promised services, we must apply judgment to determine whether promised services are capable of being distinct and are distinct in the context of the contract. if these criteria are not met, the promised services are combined and accounted for as a single performance obligation. in addition, a single performance obligation may comprise a series of distinct goods or services that are substantially the same and that have the same pattern of transfer to the customer.
income taxes we determine our provision for income taxes using management's judgments, estimates and the interpretation and application of complex tax laws in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate. judgment is also required in assessing the timing and amounts of deductible and taxable items. these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet.
we believe our tax return positions are fully supportable; however, we recognize the benefit for tax positions only when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained based on its technical merits. issues raised by a tax authority may be resolved at an amount different than the related benefit recognized. when facts and circumstances change (including an effective settlement of an issue or statute of limitations expiration), the effect is recognized in the period of change. the unrecognized tax benefits that exist at december 31, 2020 would affect our provision for income taxes in the future, if recognized. judgment is required to determine whether or not some portion or all of our deferred tax assets will not be realized. to the extent we determine that we will not realize the benefit of some or all of our deferred tax assets, then these deferred tax assets are adjusted through our provision for income taxes in the period in which this determination is made.
effect of new accounting pronouncements - recently issued pronouncements not yet adopted from time-to-time, new accounting pronouncements are issued by the financial accounting standards board or other standards setting bodies that may affect our current and/or future financial statements. refer to "note 1-basis of presentation and summary of significant accounting policies" in the notes to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for a discussion of recently adopted accounting pronouncements and recently issued accounting pronouncements not yet adopted.

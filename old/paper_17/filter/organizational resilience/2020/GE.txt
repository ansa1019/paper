management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (md&a). the consolidated financial statements of general electric company combine the industrial manufacturing and services businesses of ge industrial with the financial services businesses of ge capital and are prepared in conformity with u.s. generally accepted accounting principles (gaap). unless otherwise noted, tables are presented in u.s. dollars in millions. certain columns and rows within tables may not add due to the use of rounded numbers. percentages presented in this report are calculated from the underlying numbers in millions.
discussions throughout this md&a are based on continuing operations unless otherwise noted. results for the years ended december 31, 2020 versus 2019 are discussed within this report. refer to our annual report on form 10-k for the year ended december 31, 2019 for discussions of results for the years ended december 31, 2019 versus 2018. the md&a should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes to the consolidated financial statements. for purposes of the financial statement display of sales and costs of sales in our consolidated statement of earnings (loss), "goods" is required by sec regulations to include all sales of tangible products, and "services" must include all other sales, including other services activities. in our md&a section of this report, we refer to sales under product services agreements and sales of both goods (such as spare parts and equipment upgrades) and related services (such as monitoring, maintenance and repairs) as sales of "services," which is an important part of our operations.
effective december 31, 2020, in order to enhance our financial statement presentation, we voluntarily made the following reporting changes for all periods presented:
•changed our presentation of ge industrial restructuring program costs. previously these costs were recorded within corporate items and eliminations. now these costs are recorded within segment profit, except for significant, higher-cost programs that continue to be recorded within corporate items and eliminations. this change better aligns restructuring expense with cash spend at the segments, driving accountability in both managing costs and benefits;
•changed the presentation of our statement of financial position to reflect the classification of assets and liabilities into current and non-current and revised the definition of operating working capital in our statement of cash flows, to drive increased transparency to operational drivers for near- and long-term cash needs and enhanced linkage to free cash flows metrics;
•began presenting research and development (r&d) expenses separately as part of costs and expenses in our consolidated statement of earnings (loss) to provide increased transparency to r&d spend and trends as part of ge's total investment in innovation. these costs were previously reported in costs of goods and services sold; and
•ceased reporting ge capital as an equity method investment within the ge industrial column. this change simplified reporting for ge industrial and has no impact on the ge capital or consolidated columns. consistent with our historical practice, all commercial transactions between ge industrial and ge capital continue to be reported on arms-length terms and are eliminated upon consolidation.
we believe investors will gain a better understanding of our company if they understand how we measure and talk about our results. because of the diversity in our businesses, we present our financial statements in a three-column format, which allows investors to see our industrial operations separately from our financial services operations. we believe that this provides useful information to investors. when used in this report, unless otherwise indicated by the context, we use these terms to mean the following:
•consolidated - the adding together of ge industrial and ge capital, giving effect to the elimination of transactions between the two. we present consolidated results in the left-side column of our consolidated statements of earnings (loss), financial position and cash flows.
•ge industrial - the adding together of all industrial affiliates, giving effect to the elimination of transactions among such affiliates. any intercompany profits resulting from transactions between ge industrial and ge capital are eliminated at the ge industrial level. we present the results of ge industrial in the center column of our consolidated statements of earnings (loss), financial position and cash flows.
•ge capital - the adding together of all affiliates of ge capital giving effect to the elimination of transactions among such affiliates. we present the results of ge capital in the right-side column of our consolidated statements of earnings (loss), financial position and cash flows.
in the accompanying analysis of financial information, we sometimes use information derived from consolidated financial data but not presented in our financial statements prepared in accordance with gaap. certain of these data are considered "non-gaap financial measures" under sec rules. see the non-gaap financial measures section for the reasons we use these non-gaap financial measures and the reconciliations to their most directly comparable gaap financial measures.
2020 significant developments. coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) pandemic. the covid-19 pandemic has impacted global economies, resulting in workforce and travel restrictions, supply chain and production disruptions and reduced demand and spending across many sectors. since the latter part of the first quarter of 2020, these factors have had a material adverse impact on our operations and financial performance, as well as on the operations and financial performance of many of the customers and suppliers in industries that we serve. this section provides a brief overview of how we have been responding to current and potential impacts related to covid-19 on ge's operations and financial condition and results, with additional details provided throughout the md&a and other relevant sections of this report.
during 2020, we adopted operational and governance rhythms across the company, and with our board of directors, to coordinate and oversee actions related to the covid-19 pandemic, including an internal task force to protect the health and safety of our employees globally and maintain business continuity; the assessment of financial and operating impacts, financial planning and mitigating cost, cash, and other actions in response; funding and liquidity management and related treasury actions; enterprise risk management and other functional activities across our global commercial, supply chain, human resources, controllership, government affairs, and other organizations. in particular, we took a series of actions to enhance and extend our liquidity at both ge and ge capital (as described under "liability management and deleveraging actions" below), and we continue to evaluate market conditions as they evolve and take precautionary measures to strengthen our financial position. we ended the year with $36.6 billion of consolidated cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash, in addition to our available credit lines of $20.2 billion. see the capital resources and liquidity section for further information.
while factors related directly and indirectly to the covid-19 pandemic have been impacting operations and financial performance at varying levels across all our businesses, the most significant impact to date has been at our aviation segment and our ge capital aviation services (gecas) aircraft leasing business within our capital segment. the pandemic has had and continues to have a material adverse effect on the global airline industry, resulting in reduced flight schedules worldwide, an increased number of idle aircraft, lower utilization, workforce reductions and declining financial performance within the airline industry. this has decreased demand for higher margin service revenues within our aviation segment directly impacting our profitability and cash flows during 2020. our healthcare segment experienced increased demand for certain types of products and services, including ventilators, monitoring solutions, x-ray, anesthesia and point-of-care ultrasound product lines, partially offset by decreased demand in other parts of the business as patients have postponed certain procedures and hospitals have deferred spending. our other businesses were also adversely impacted by market developments, including delays or cancellations of new projects, new orders and related down payments. in addition, workplace, travel and supply chain disruptions have caused delays of deliveries and the achievement of other billing milestones directly impacting our profitability and cash flows for the year ended december 31, 2020. we anticipate many of these impacts related to demand, profitability and cash flows will continue in future periods depending on the severity and duration of the pandemic. for additional details about impacts related to aviation and gecas, healthcare and our other businesses, refer to the respective segment sections within md&a.
each of ge's businesses and corporate are taking cost and cash actions to manage risk and proactively mitigate the financial impact from covid-19, as supply and demand dynamics continue to shift. in 2020, we executed more than $2 billion in operational cost reduction and more than $3 billion in cash preservation actions across the company, including more than $1 billion in operational cost reduction and more than $2 billion in cash preservation actions at aviation, to right-size its cost structure and preserve its ability to serve customers.
the ultimate impact of the covid-19 pandemic on our operations and financial performance, and on those of customers and suppliers in industries that we serve, depends on many factors that are not within our control, including the severity and duration of the pandemic; governmental, business and individuals' actions in response to the pandemic; and the development, availability and public acceptance of effective treatments or vaccines. see the risk factors section for further information about related risks and uncertainties.
biopharma. on march 31, 2020, we completed the sale of our biopharma business within our healthcare segment to danaher corporation for consideration of $21.1 billion, and recognized a pre-tax gain of $12.4 billion. see the segment operations - healthcare section and note 2 for further information.
asset impairments. in the third quarter of 2020, we recognized non-cash pre-tax impairment charges of $0.4 billion related to property, plant and equipment and intangible assets at our steam business within our power segment due to our recent announcement to exit the new build coal power market. we will continue to monitor the operating results and cash flow forecasts for the remaining business. in the second quarter of 2020, we recognized a non-cash pre-tax impairment charge of $0.9 billion related to goodwill at our additive reporting unit within our aviation segment. the steam and additive charges were recorded within earnings from continuing operations at corporate. in the second quarter of 2020, we recognized a non-cash pre-tax impairment charge of $0.8 billion related to goodwill in our gecas reporting unit within our capital segment. in the year ended december 31, 2020, we recognized non-cash pre-tax impairments of $0.5 billion on our gecas leasing portfolio. see segment operations - capital and notes 7 and 8 for further information.
liability management and deleveraging actions. we reduced our consolidated borrowings by $15.8 billion in 2020, driven primarily by debt tenders at ge industrial and ge capital of $4.2 billion and $11.9 billion, respectively, ge capital maturities of $10.5 billion, and repayment of ge industrial commercial paper of $3.0 billion, partially offset by new debt issuances at ge industrial and ge capital of $7.5 billion and $6.0 billion, respectively. ge industrial net debt* ended at $32.3 billion at december 31, 2020, down $15.5 billion from december 31, 2019, primarily driven by lower debt, a higher cash balance, and pension pre-funding of $2.5 billion in the fourth quarter of 2020. see the borrowings section of capital resources and liquidity and note 11 for further information.
sec settlement. as previously reported on december 9, 2020, ge reached a settlement with the sec that concluded and resolved the sec's investigation of ge in its entirety. under the settlement, among other terms, ge paid a civil penalty of $0.2 billion in december 2020, of which $0.1 billion was recorded at corporate and $0.1 billion was recorded at ge capital. see note 23 for further information.
summary of 2020 results. consolidated revenues were $79.6 billion, down $15.6 billion (16%) for the year primarily driven by decreased ge industrial revenues of $14.6 billion and decreased ge capital revenues of $1.5 billion. ge industrial organic revenues* were $73.2 billion, down $10.9 billion (13%) driven by our aviation and power segments, partially offset by our healthcare and renewable energy segments.
continuing earnings per share was $0.59. excluding gains (losses) on business dispositions, non-operating benefit costs, unrealized gains (losses) on investments, goodwill impairments, restructuring and other charges, steam asset impairments, debt extinguishment costs, the sec settlement, and u.s. tax reform, adjusted earnings per share* was $0.01.
for the year ended december 31, 2020, ge industrial profit was $7.3 billion and profit margins were 10.0%, up $5.5 billion, driven by the gain on the sale of our biopharma business of $12.4 billion, lower interest and other financial charges of $0.8 billion, decreased goodwill impairments of $0.6 billion, decreased non-operating benefit cost of $0.4 billion and lower charges for significant, higher-cost restructuring programs of $0.2 billion, partially offset by decreases at our industrial segments, an increase of $2.8 billion in losses on our investment in baker hughes, impairment charges of $0.4 billion related to property, plant and equipment and intangible assets at our steam business, and the sec settlement charges. adjusted ge industrial organic profit* decreased $4.7 billion, primarily as a result of the impacts of covid-19, particularly at our aviation segment, partially offset by an increase at healthcare.
ge industrial cash flows from (used for) operating activities (cfoa) of continuing operations were $(1.3) billion and $4.6 billion for the years ended december 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. ge industrial cfoa decreased primarily due to lower net income, largely as a result of covid-19 impacts, ge pension plan contributions of $2.5 billion in 2020 and higher cash paid for taxes, partially offset by lower cash used for operating working capital. ge industrial free cash flows (fcf)* were $0.6 billion and $2.3 billion for the years ended december 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. ge industrial fcf* decreased primarily due to lower net income, partially offset by lower cash used for operating working capital and a decrease in additions to property, plant and equipment and internal-use software. see the capital resources and liquidity - statement of cash flows section for further information.
orders are contractual commitments with customers to provide specified goods or services for an agreed upon price. backlog is unfilled customer orders for products and product services (expected life of contract sales for product services).
services                      35,137          45,303          45,523
for the year ended december 31, 2020, orders decreased $18.3 billion (20%) on a reported basis and decreased $14.8 billion (17%) organically, with decreases at aviation, primarily driven by declines in both commercial equipment and service orders due to covid-19 and the 737 max grounding; at power primarily driven by a decrease in equipment orders; and at renewable energy primarily due to a decrease in services orders; partially offset by an increase at healthcare. equipment orders were down $5.0 billion (12%) organically and services orders were down $9.8 billion (22%) organically. excluding biopharma, orders decreased $15.0 billion (17%) organically.
services                          313,234           325,605           273,499
(a) backlog as of december 31, 2020 excludes the biopharma business due to its disposition in the first quarter of 2020. backlog as of december 31, 2019 and 2018 included $1,247 million and $905 million, respectively, related to biopharma.
as of december 31, 2020, backlog decreased $18.1 billion (4%) from the prior year primarily driven by aviation due to a reduction in our commercial services backlog and cancellations of commercial equipment orders. the reduction in commercial services reflects lower anticipated engine utilization, the cancellation of equipment unit orders, customer fleet restructuring and contract modifications. power decreased due to sales outpacing new orders; healthcare decreased with the disposition of the biopharma business of $1.2 billion; and renewable energy increased due to new orders outpacing sales. excluding the biopharma disposition, backlog decreased $16.8 billion (4%) from december 31, 2019.
remaining performance obligation (rpo), a defined term under gaap, is backlog excluding any purchase order that provides the customer with the ability to cancel or terminate without incurring a substantive penalty, even if the likelihood of cancellation is remote based on historical experience. we plan to continue reporting backlog as we believe that it is a useful metric for investors, given its relevance to total orders. see note 25 for further information.
december 31, 2020                              equipment           services             total backlog                                    $73,286            $313,234           $386,520
adjustments                               (27,294)           (128,626)          (155,921)
remaining performance obligation           $45,991            $184,608           $230,600
adjustments to reported backlog of $155.9 billion as of december 31, 2020 are largely driven by adjustments of $146.3 billion in our aviation segment: (1) backlog includes engine contracts for which we have received purchase orders that are cancelable; (2) our services backlog includes contracts that are cancelable without substantive penalty, primarily time and materials contracts; (3) backlog includes engines contracted under long-term service agreements, even if the engines have not yet been put into service. these adjustments to reported backlog to the extent realized are generally expected to be satisfied beyond one year.
services                         35,480         44,639          45,359
ge capital revenues              $7,245         $8,741          $9,551
for the year ended december 31, 2020, consolidated revenues decreased $15.6 billion (16%), primarily driven by decreased industrial revenues of $14.6 billion and decreased ge capital revenues of $1.5 billion.
ge industrial revenues decreased $14.6 billion (17%), with decreases in services and equipment. the decrease in services was primarily at aviation, driven by lower commercial spare part shipments, decreased shop visits and the cumulative impact of changes in billing and cost assumptions in our long-term service agreements; and at power, due to declines in transactional part sales and upgrades at gas power. the decrease in equipment was primarily at aviation, due to fewer commercial install and spare engine unit shipments; and at healthcare, due to the disposition of the biopharma business; partially offset by increases at renewable energy, primarily from onshore wind with more wind turbine shipments than in the prior year, and offshore wind; and at gas power, due to an increase in heavy-duty gas turbine unit shipments. this decrease included the net effects of dispositions of $3.6 billion and the effects of a stronger u.s. dollar of $0.3 billion. excluding the effects of acquisitions, dispositions and foreign currency, ge industrial organic revenues* decreased $10.9 billion (13%), with a decrease in services revenues of $8.8 billion (20%) and a decrease in equipment revenues of $2.1 billion (5%). ge industrial organic revenues* decreased at aviation and power, partially offset by increases at healthcare and renewable energy. excluding the biopharma disposition, ge industrial organic revenues* decreased $10.9 billion (13%).
ge capital revenues decreased $1.5 billion (17%), as a result of volume declines and lower gains. these volume declines were primarily at gecas related to lower interest income attributable to the sale of pk airfinance and lower rental revenue on our aircraft leasing portfolio, and at working capital solutions (wcs) related to lower purchases of ge industrial customer receivables and the run-off of the ge capital supply chain finance program (see ge industrial working capital transactions within md&a for further information).
for the year ended december 31, 2020, consolidated continuing earnings increased $5.4 billion, due to increased ge industrial profit of $5.5 billion and decreased provision for ge industrial income taxes of $0.9 billion, partially offset by an increase in ge capital losses of $1.2 billion.
ge industrial profit increased $5.5 billion driven primarily by the gain on the sale of our biopharma business of $12.4 billion, lower interest and other financial charges of $0.8 billion, decreased goodwill impairments of $0.6 billion, decreased non-operating benefit cost of $0.4 billion and lower charges for significant, higher-cost restructuring programs of $0.2 billion; partially offset by decreases at our industrial segments, an increase of $2.8 billion in losses on our investment in baker hughes, impairment charges of $0.4 billion related to property, plant and equipment and intangible assets at our steam business, and the sec settlement charges. ge industrial profit margin was 10.0%, an increase of 790 basis points, primarily due to the same net increases as described above. adjusted ge industrial profit* was $2.5 billion, a decrease of 65% organically*, primarily due to a decrease at our aviation segment, partially offset by an increase at healthcare and a decrease in adjusted corporate operating costs*. adjusted ge industrial profit margin* was 3.4%, a decrease of 520 basis points organically*, primarily due to the same net decreases as described above. at aviation, the primary drivers were lower volume on commercial spare part and commercial spare engine shipments, decreased shop visits and net unfavorable changes of $1.1 billion to the estimated profitability in its long-term service agreements. at healthcare, the primary drivers were cost reductions and increased demand for healthcare systems (hcs) products used directly in response to covid-19, partially offset by decreases in pharmaceutical diagnostics (pdx) volume.
ge capital continuing losses increased $1.2 billion primarily due to an impairment of goodwill of $0.8 billion (pre-tax), volume declines, higher mark-to-market effects and other impairments, including $0.5 billion (pre-tax) on the gecas fixed-wing aircraft portfolio as a result of covid-19 and related market impacts, lower gains, debt tender costs, the sec settlement charge and the nonrecurrence of a 2019 tax reform enactment adjustment. these increased losses were partially offset by the nonrecurrence of a $1.0 billion pre-tax charge identified through the completion of our 2019 annual insurance premium deficiency review, higher tax benefits including the tax benefit related to the biopharma sale and lower excess interest cost. gains were $0.4 billion and $0.7 billion in 2020 and 2019, respectively.
aviation and gecas 737 max. aviation develops, produces, and sells leap aircraft engines to boeing, airbus and comac through cfm international (cfm), a company jointly owned by ge and safran aircraft engines, a subsidiary of the safran group of france. the leap-1b engine is the exclusive engine for the boeing 737 max. in march 2019, global regulatory authorities ordered a temporary fleet grounding of the boeing 737 max. in may 2020, boeing resumed production of the 737 max. in november 2020, the u.s. federal aviation administration (faa) lifted the grounding notice for the 737 max and boeing commenced aircraft deliveries to customers in compliance with faa regulatory requirements in december 2020. a number of other global regulators since the faa's action have also lifted the orders that suspended 737 max operations for airlines under their jurisdictions. aviation commercial equipment backlog as of december 31, 2020 includes approximately 9,600 leap engines, including the impact of approximately 1,500 leap-1b unit order cancellations in 2020. see the segment operations - aviation section for further information. during 2020, cfm and boeing reached an agreement to align production rates for 2020 and secure payment terms for engines delivered in 2019 and 2020. in 2020, aviation received payments, net of progress collections, of $0.5 billion for engines delivered in 2019. a final payment of $0.2 billion, net of progress collections, is expected to be received in the first quarter of 2021 for engines delivered in 2019. cfm and boeing continue to work closely to ensure a successful reentry into service, with a strong commitment to safety while navigating industry disruption.
during 2020, gecas agreed with boeing to restructure its 737 max orderbook including previously canceled positions, resulting in 77 orders now remaining. as of december 31, 2020, gecas owned 29 of these aircraft, 26 of which are contracted for lease to airlines that remain obligated to make contractual rental payments. in addition, gecas has made pre-delivery payments to boeing related to 77 of these aircraft on order and has made financing commitments to acquire a further 16 aircraft under purchase and leaseback contracts with airlines.
as of december 31, 2020, we have approximately $1.7 billion of net assets ($3.2 billion of assets and $1.5 billion of liabilities) related to the 737 max program that primarily comprised aviation accounts receivable offset by progress collections and gecas pre-delivery payments and owned aircraft subject to lease. no impairment charges were incurred related to the 737 max aircraft and related balances, as we continue to believe these assets are recoverable over their contractual or useful lives. we continue to monitor 737 max return to service and return to delivery developments with our airline customers, lessees and boeing.
segment operations. segment revenues include sales of products and services by the segment. industrial segment profit is determined based on performance measures used by our chief operating decision maker (codm), who is our chief executive officer (ceo), to assess the performance of each business in a given period. in connection with that assessment, the ceo may exclude matters, such as charges for impairments, significant, higher-cost restructuring programs, manufacturing footprint rationalization and other similar expenses, acquisition costs and other related charges, certain gains and losses from acquisitions or dispositions, and certain litigation settlements. see the corporate items and eliminations section for additional information about costs excluded from segment profit.
segment profit excludes results reported as discontinued operations and the portion of earnings or loss attributable to noncontrolling interests of consolidated subsidiaries, and as such only includes the portion of earnings or loss attributable to our share of the consolidated earnings or loss of consolidated subsidiaries.
interest and other financial charges, income taxes and non-operating benefit costs are excluded in determining segment profit for the industrial segments. interest and other financial charges, income taxes, non-operating benefit costs and ge capital preferred stock dividends are included in determining segment profit (which we sometimes refer to as net earnings) for the capital segment. other income is included in segment profit for the industrial segments.
certain corporate costs, such as those related to shared services, employee benefits, and information technology, are allocated to our segments based on usage. a portion of the remaining corporate costs is allocated based on each segment's relative net cost of operations.

competition & regulation. worldwide competition for power generation products and services is intense. demand for power generation is global, and as a result, is sensitive to the economic and political environments of each country in which we do business. our products and services sold to end customers are often subject to many regulatory requirements and performance standards under different federal, state, foreign and energy industry standards.
significant trends & developments. we continue to execute for our customers through covid-19, prioritizing safety first and foremost. from an operations perspective, we are working within our supply chain and with our suppliers to catch up on parts and project scope that were delayed as a result of covid-19. despite difficult travel and customer site restrictions, we continue to service our customers' installed base and have completed roughly 90% of all planned outages in the year. from a market perspective, both gas-based electricity generation and ge gas turbine utilization has remained stable. our ability to close transactions, particularly services parts & upgrades, has been impacted by constrained customer budgets and access to financing due to oil prices and economic slowdown, especially in gas power. although there may be market challenges in the near term, we believe gas will play a critical role in the energy transition and our view of the market has not materially changed, albeit timing on new orders is harder to forecast.
power continues to right size its business to better align with market demand and drive its businesses with an operational rigor and discipline that is focused on its customers' lifecycle experience. in gas power, we continue to size the business for a 25-30 gw market, although acknowledge that the size any given year can vary. we remain focused on our underwriting discipline and risk management to ensure we are securing deals that meet our financial hurdles and we have a high confidence to deliver for our customers.
looking ahead, we anticipate the power market to continue to be impacted by overcapacity in the industry, continued price pressure from competition on servicing the installed base, and the uncertain timing of deal closures due to financing and the complexities of working in emerging markets. market factors related to the energy transition such as greater renewable energy penetration and the adoption of climate change-related policies continue to impact long-term demand, to differing degrees across markets globally. as such, we announced in the third quarter of 2020 that we will be exiting the new build coal power market, while continuing to service our customers' installed base.
we continue to invest in new product development, such as our ha-turbines, and upgrades as these are critical to our customers and the long-term strategy of the business. in 2020, we supplied the first purpose-built hydrogen-burning power plant in the u.s. with gas power's 7ha.02 turbine. our fundamentals remain strong with approximately $80 billion in backlog and a gas turbine installed base greater than 7,000 units, including approximately 1,800 units under long-term service agreements.

for the year ended december 31, 2020, segment orders were down $0.9 billion (5%), segment revenues were down $1.0 billion (6%) and segment profit was down 6%.
backlog as of december 31, 2020 decreased $5.7 billion (7%) from december 31, 2019, primarily driven by sales outpacing new orders.
orders decreased $0.8 billion (4%) organically, primarily due to decreases in gas power heavy-duty gas turbine unit and services orders and steam equipment orders.
revenues decreased $0.9 billion (5%) organically*, primarily due to decreases in gas power services revenues, primarily related to decreases in transactional part sales and upgrades, partially offset by increases in gas power equipment revenues related to 13 more heavy-duty gas turbine unit shipments. steam equipment and service revenues also decreased.
profit decreased 7% organically* due to lower revenues, charges of approximately $0.3 billion related to an under-performing jv in china, charges related to contracts, a charge for a specific customer credit event at gas power, and a quality reserve at power portfolio on the legacy product line that we have since exited in power conversion, partially offset by continued efforts to right size the business across gas power and power portfolio.

hybrid solutions - provides reliable, affordable and dispatchable integration of renewable energies that drive vital stability to the grid and includes unique applications to integrate storage and renewable energy generation sources, such as wind, hydropower and solar.
competition & regulation. while many factors, including government incentives and specific market rules, affect how renewable energy can deliver outcomes for customers in a given region, renewable energy is increasingly able to compete with fossil fuels in terms of levelized cost of electricity. however, continued competitive pressure from other wind and hydro turbine manufacturers as well as from other energy sources, such as solar photovoltaic, reinforced by a general move to electricity auction mechanisms, has driven price pressure and the need for innovation.
we continue to invest in generating wind turbine product improvements, including larger rotors, taller towers and higher nameplate ratings that continue to drive down the cost of wind energy, and in exploring new ways to further improve the efficiency and flexibility of our hydropower technology with new innovative turbine designs and digital solutions. as industry models continue to evolve, our digital strategy and investments in technical innovation will position us to add value for customers looking for clean, renewable energy.
significant trends & developments. renewable energy is in a rapid transition period and competes in the marketplace against existing and new conventional energy sources. wind energy is currently the second-largest contributor to renewable capacity growth with hydropower projected to remain the largest renewable electricity source through 2023.
we continue to observe growth across the global onshore wind market together with a positive impact on deliveries and installations in the u.s. from the production tax credit (ptc) cycle and customer preference shifting to larger, more efficient units to drive down costs and compete with other power generation options. despite the competitive nature of the market, onshore wind order pricing has stabilized globally. several energy-related tax credit extensions were passed into law in december 2020 further extending the phase-down of u.s. ptcs. under the current legislation, onshore wind projects that begin construction in 2021 will also qualify for a 60% ptc. we expect high levels of production observed in 2020 to continue for 2021 deliveries at onshore wind and are closely monitoring our execution during this period.
additionally, offshore wind projects that begin construction before 2026 are eligible to elect either the ptc or the investment tax credit (itc), with the itc extended by five years at the full rate. we have received full certification for our haliade-x 12- and 13mw prototypes and during the fourth quarter of 2020 reported orders within offshore wind for the supply of 95 haliade-x 13mw units for the first phase of the dogger bank wind farm in the u.k.
new product introductions remain important to our onshore and offshore customers who are demonstrating the willingness to adopt the new technology of larger turbines that decrease the levelized cost of energy. during 2020, we delivered our first onshore 5mw cypress units and have reported more than 600 of these units in backlog. we have observed significant market demand for our offshore haliade-x units and based on existing customer commitments, expect to report additional orders and backlog for the next two phases of dogger bank and for offshore projects in the u.s. upon obtaining final notification to proceed. we are preparing for large scale production of haliade-x in response to this market demand.
the grid market remains challenging as we continue to experience pricing pressure in the high voltage direct current (hvdc) and high voltage (hv) product lines. the hydropower industry continues to maximize value and grid flexibility with refurbishments, repower and pumped storage projects to support both wind and solar expansion. the grid and hydro businesses are executing their turnaround plans and we are expecting improved operating results in 2021.
despite the covid-19 pandemic, we have continued to deliver for our customers, while taking all necessary precautions for our employees, and returned our manufacturing locations and long-term project sites to pre-covid-19 capacity levels and operations. while we do not believe the long-term outlook for renewable energy products and services has materially changed, we are monitoring the impact of the pandemic on the renewable energy industry, including electricity consumption forecasts and customer capital expenditure levels, supply chain, availability of financing and our ability to execute on equipment and long-term projects, including the impact of possible customer related delays. in response to volume declines in certain of our businesses, we implemented additional cost reduction measures, restructuring and cash preservation actions.

for the year ended december 31, 2020, segment orders were down $0.6 billion (3%), segment revenues were up $0.3 billion (2%) and segment profit was up $0.1 billion (10%).
backlog as of december 31, 2020 increased $2.5 billion (9%) from december 31, 2019, primarily from offshore wind due to our first haliade-x order from dogger bank wind farm, new cypress platform orders mainly in onshore wind europe and an increase in hydro. these increases were partially offset by sales exceeding new orders at grid, primarily as a result of increased commercial selectivity in certain product lines.
orders decreased $0.4 billion (3%) organically, primarily due to lower onshore wind turbine and repower unit orders in north america compared to the prior year due to the ptc phase down and lower orders at grid. these decreases were partially offset by increased orders at offshore wind of haliade-x, other regions of onshore wind, lm wind, hybrid solutions and hydro.
revenues increased $0.6 billion (4%) organically*, primarily from onshore wind with 300 more wind turbine shipments on a unit basis, and 13% more on a megawatt basis, and at offshore wind and hybrid solutions compared to the prior year. these increases were partially offset by lower grid revenues, primarily attributable to lower volumes in the power transformer product line, and lower hydro revenues.
profit increased $0.1 billion (6%) organically*, as the impact of higher sales volume at onshore wind, the favorable impact of cost reduction measures and improved project execution exceeded higher restructuring costs and the nonrecurrence of a $0.1 billion non-cash gain from the termination of two offshore wind contracts in 2019.

competition & regulation. the global businesses for aircraft jet engines, maintenance, component repair and overhaul services (including parts sales) are highly competitive. both domestic and international markets are important to the growth and success of the business. product development cycles are long and product quality and efficiency are critical to success. research and development expenditures are important in this business, as are focused intellectual property strategies and protection of key aircraft engine design, manufacture, repair and product upgrade technologies. aircraft engine and systems orders tend to follow civil air travel and demand and military procurement cycles.
our product, services and activities are subject to a number of global regulators such as the u.s. federal aviation administration (faa), european union aviation safety agency (easa), civil aviation administration of china (caac) and other regulatory bodies.
significant trends & developments. the global covid-19 pandemic continues to have a material adverse effect on the global airline industry. a key underlying driver of aviation's commercial engine and services businesses is global commercial air traffic, which in turn is driven by economic activity and consumer and business propensity to travel. since the beginning of the pandemic in the first quarter of 2020, we have seen varied levels of recovery in global markets. government travel restrictions, public health advisories, individuals' propensity to travel and continued cases of the virus have all impacted the level of air travel. due to the global airline industry contraction, aviation's airline and airframe customers are taking measures to address reduced demand, which, in turn, continue to materially impact aviation's business operations and financial performance. as a result, our long-term service agreement billings decreased approximately 19% from the prior year, partially mitigated by customer billings for contract terminations, modifications and annual contractual minimum engine flight hours. aviation is closely monitoring government actions and economic and industry forecasts, although such forecasts continue to evolve and reflect the uncertainty about the severity and duration of the decline in commercial air traffic. aviation regularly tracks global departures, which as of december 31, 2020, were approximately 40% below the pre-covid-19 baseline. more broadly, we are in frequent dialogue with our airline and airframe customers about the outlook for commercial air travel, new aircraft production, and after-market services. given the current trend, we expect domestic travel routes primarily served by narrowbody aircraft to recover before long-haul, international travel routes which are primarily served by widebody aircraft. we continue to expect the engine aftermarket recovery to lag departure trends across regions and fleets, which would result in long-term service agreement billings and cash to recover prior to associated revenues and profits. consistent with industry projections, aviation continues to estimate the duration of the market recovery to be prolonged over multiple years dependent on containing the spread of the virus, effective inoculation programs and government collaboration to encourage travel, particularly around quarantine requirements.
aviation has taken several business actions to respond to the current adverse environment, including a reduction of approximately 25% of its total global workforce. for the year ended december 31, 2020, aviation realized more than $1 billion in operational cost reduction and $2 billion in cash preservation actions, including a headcount reduction of over 11,000 employees. aviation expects to realize cost and cash savings in 2021 as a result of the actions taken in 2020 and further initiatives in 2021. the business is actively monitoring the pace of demand recovery to ensure the business is appropriately sized for the future. in addition, we continue to partner with our airline and leasing customers and are working closely with our airframe partners to align production rates for 2021 and beyond.
aviation's operational and financial performance is impacted by commercial air traffic, shop visit and spare part demand, fleet retirements, and demand for new aircraft. we monitor and forecast each of these factors as part of aviation's long-term planning process, which may result in additional business restructuring actions. given the uncertainty related to the severity and length of the global covid-19 pandemic and the impact on these factors across the aviation sector and specific customers, aviation could be required to record charges, impairments, or other adverse financial impacts in future periods if actual results differ significantly from aviation's current estimates.
as it relates to the military environment, aviation continues to forecast strong military demand creating future growth opportunities for our military business as the u.s. department of defense and foreign governments have continued flight operations, and have allocated budgets to upgrade and modernize their existing fleets. during 2020, aviation experienced supply chain execution challenges which resulted in fewer engine and spare part shipments than the prior year. the business is actively addressing these matters to enable future growth in military.
total engineering, comprised of company, customer and partner-funded and nonrecurring engineering costs, decreased compared to prior year in line with the changes in the commercial environment. for the year ended december 31, 2020, company-funded research and development spend decreased compared to 2019, and we expect the reduction to continue in line with the actions outlined above. however, customer and partner-funded engineering efforts, primarily in our military business, increased compared to the prior year. in september 2020, aviation announced it received certification from the faa for the ge9x engine, the world's largest and most powerful commercial aircraft engine.
aviation is taking actions to protect its ability to serve its customers now and as the global airline industry recovers. while its near-term focus remains on navigating the covid-19 pandemic, aviation's deep history of innovation and technology leadership, commercial engine installed base of approximately 37,700 units, military engine installed base of approximately 26,500 units, with approximately 12,500 units under long-term service agreements, and $260 billion backlog represents strong long-term fundamentals. aviation is taking actions to protect and strengthen its business and seeks to emerge from this crisis stronger and drive long-term cash and profitable growth over time.

(a)aviation segment revenues represent 30% and 27% of total industrial revenues and total segment revenues, respectively, for the year ended december 31, 2020.
(b)aviation segment profit represents 17% of total industrial profit for the year ended december 31, 2020.
(c)included restructuring charges of $26 million, $8 million and $12 million for the years ended december 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively, that were previously reported within the corporate segment and were reclassified into the aviation segment results in the fourth quarter of 2020 for all periods presented. for a summary of all restructuring charges by segment, see the other consolidated information section.
for the year ended december 31, 2020, segment orders were down $15.1 billion (41%), segment revenues were down $10.8 billion (33%) and segment profit was down $5.6 billion (82%).
backlog as of december 31, 2020 decreased $12.8 billion (5%) from december 31, 2019, primarily due to a reduction in our commercial services backlog and cancellations of commercial equipment orders, which included approximately 1,500 leap 1-b unit order cancellations and 22 ge9x unit order cancellations. the reduction to commercial services backlog reflects estimates of lower engine utilization, the partial cancellation of long-term service agreements related to the equipment unit order cancellations, and anticipated customer fleet restructuring and contract modifications. backlog adjustments could be necessary in future periods for additional cancellations of new commercial engine orders, fleet retirements, or changes to customer aircraft utilization and operating behavior.
orders decreased $14.8 billion (41%) organically, primarily driven by lower commercial equipment and service orders as airline customers have slowed or deferred new engine orders, as well as delayed maintenance and repair operations while existing fleets have lower utilization or been grounded. military orders increased 21% compared to the prior year primarily driven by equipment and new development orders.
revenues decreased $10.5 billion (32%) organically*. equipment revenues decreased, primarily due to 1,376 fewer commercial install and spare engine unit shipments, including 921 fewer leap units and 228 fewer cfm56 units versus the prior year, in part due to the 737 max grounding and production slowdown. commercial services revenues decreased, primarily due to lower commercial spare part shipments, decreased shop visits and the cumulative impact of changes in billing and cost assumptions in our long-term service agreements. military revenues increased primarily due to increased revenues on development contracts and engine shipment mix, partially offset by fewer engine and spare part shipments due to supply chain execution challenges.
profit decreased $5.6 billion (82%) organically*, primarily due to lower volume on commercial spare part and commercial spare engine shipments, and decreased shop visits in our service agreements. during the year ended december 31, 2020, aviation recorded expenses of $0.5 billion due to lower production volumes and initiated restructuring actions given decreases in demand primarily related to commercial engines. aviation also recorded pre-tax charges totaling $0.2 billion due to expected future losses related primarily to customer credit risk given the current environment. in addition, aviation recorded net unfavorable changes of $1.1 billion to the estimated profitability in its long-term service agreements. this decrease includes a $0.6 billion pre-tax charge to reflect the cumulative covid-19 pandemic-related impacts of changes to billing and cost assumptions for certain long-term service agreements, reflecting lower engine utilization, anticipated customer fleet restructuring and contract modifications as a result of current and forecasted market conditions. additional adjustments could occur in future periods and could be material for certain long-term service agreements if actual customer operating behavior differs significantly from aviation's current estimates.

competition & regulation. healthcare competes with a variety of u.s. and non-u.s. manufacturers and services providers. customers require products and services that allow them to provide better access to healthcare, improve the affordability of care and improve the quality of patient outcomes. key factors affecting competition include technological innovations, productivity solutions, competitive pricing and the ability to provide lifecycle services. new technologies and solutions could make our products and services obsolete unless we continue to develop new and improved offerings. our products are subject to regulation by numerous government agencies, as well as laws and regulations that apply to various reimbursement schemes or other government funded healthcare programs.
significant trends & developments. during the first half of 2020, there was an increase in demand for certain of our products that are highly correlated in response to the covid-19 pandemic, including ventilators, monitoring solutions, x-ray, anesthesia and point-of-care ultrasound product lines. however, we also saw reduction in demand and delays in procurement in other products and services that were not critical to the response efforts or where procedures could be postponed (magnetic resonance, contrast agents and nuclear tracers). we have experienced some moderation in covid-19 related demand in the second half of 2020 and have experienced some recovery in overall hospital spending, though this varies by market. the pandemic is still driving uncertainty in our markets globally, as well as additional supply chain and logistics costs, and we expect this to continue. we expect capital expenditures, particularly in private markets, to remain under pressure from revenue declines and cautious spending related to covid-19 impacts. in response to continuing near-term volatility and cost pressures, we have driven structural cost reduction and cash optimization actions that began in the first quarter of 2020.
the global healthcare market has continued to expand, driven by macro trends relating to growing and aging populations, increasing chronic and lifestyle-related diseases, accelerating demand for healthcare in emerging markets, and increasing use of diagnostic imaging. technological innovation that makes it possible to address an increasing number of diseases, conditions and patients in a more cost-effective manner has also driven growth across each of our global markets.
the healthcare systems (hcs) equipment market over the long term continues to expand at low single-digit rates or better, while demand continues for services on new equipment as well as on our existing installed base. however, there is short-term variation driven by market-specific political, environmental and economic cycles. there has been some moderation in tariffs in both u.s. and china, however, this is subject to changes in u.s.-china trade regulations. long-term growth in emerging markets is driven by trends of expanding demand and access to healthcare. developed markets are expected to remain steady in the near term driven by macro trends in the healthcare industry.
the pharmaceutical diagnostics (pdx) business is well positioned in the contrast agent and nuclear tracer markets. this market is expected to grow over the long-term, driven by continued diagnostic imaging procedure growth and increasing contrast and tracer-enhanced biomarkers of these same procedures, as these products help to increase the precision of the diagnostic information provided to clinicians. after we experienced reduced demand in the first half of 2020, we saw an increase in the second half of 2020 for pdx products as procedure volume increased.
we continue focusing on creating new products and digital solutions as well as expanding uses of existing offerings that are tailored to the different needs of our global customers. ge healthcare recently introduced the volusontm swift, an industry-first sono-automation tool, which leverages artificial intelligence to automatically identify fetal anatomy, enhancing workflow by more than 70%. in addition, we launched the next version of mural virtual care solution, which provides clinical decision support with a view of patients' status across a care area, hospital or system. we also completed the acquisition of prismatic sensors ab, which specializes in photon counting computed tomography (ct).

(a)healthcare segment revenues represent 25% and 22% of total industrial revenues and total segment revenues, respectively, for the year ended december 31, 2020.
(b)healthcare segment profit represents 42% of total industrial profit for the year ended december 31, 2020.
(c)included restructuring charges of $134 million, $159 million and $176 million for the years ended december 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively, that were previously reported within the corporate segment and were reclassified into the healthcare segment results in the fourth quarter of 2020 for all periods presented. for a summary of all restructuring charges by segment, see the other consolidated information section.
for the year ended december 31, 2020, segment orders were down $2.5 billion (12%), segment revenues were down $1.9 billion (10%) and segment profit was down $0.7 billion (18%).
backlog as of december 31, 2020 decreased $1.4 billion (7%) from december 31, 2019, primarily due to the biopharma disposition. excluding biopharma, backlog decreased $0.1 billion.
orders increased $0.3 billion (1%) organically, due to increases in demand for covid-19 related products, including a $0.3 billion order from the u.s. department of health and human services to deliver 50,000 ventilators in partnership with ford, partially offset by pdx. excluding biopharma, orders were up $0.1 billion organically.
revenues increased $0.7 billion (4%) organically*, driven by increased demand in hcs products used directly in response to covid-19, partially offset by reduced volume in pdx from a decrease in non-essential routine procedures. excluding biopharma, revenues increased $0.6 billion (4%) organically*.
profit increased $0.5 billion (17%) organically*, primarily due to cost reductions and increased demand for hcs products used directly in response to covid-19, partially offset by decreases in pdx volume. excluding biopharma, profits increased $0.4 billion (17%) organically*.
capital. capital is the financial services division of ge focused on customers and markets aligned with ge's industrial businesses across developed and emerging markets. we provide financial products and services around the globe that build on ge's industry specific expertise in aviation, power, renewables and other activities to capitalize on market-specific opportunities. while there are customer benefits and knowledge sharing advantages linking ge's industrial and capital businesses, the financial and operational relationships are maintained with arms-length terms as though the businesses were independent.
ge capital aviation services (gecas) - an aviation lessor and financier with over 50 years of experience. gecas provides a wide range of assets including narrow- or widebody aircraft, regional jets, turboprops, freighters, engines, helicopters, financing and materials. gecas offers a broad array of financing products and services on these assets including operating leases, sale-leasebacks, asset trading and servicing, and airframe parts management. gecas owns, services or has on order more than 1,600 aircraft and serves approximately 205 customers in 73 countries from a network of 15 offices around the world.
energy financial services (efs) - a global energy investor that provides financial solutions and underwriting capabilities for power and renewable energy to meet rising demand and sustainability imperatives.
working capital solutions (wcs) - provides working capital services primarily by purchasing ge industrial customer receivables.
insurance - refer to the other items - insurance section for a detailed business description.
competition & regulation. the businesses in which we engage are highly competitive and are subject to competition from various types of financial institutions including banks, investors, such as sovereign wealth funds, hedge funds and private equity investors, leasing companies, finance companies associated with manufacturers and insurance and reinsurance companies. for our gecas operations, competition is based on lease rate financing terms, aircraft delivery dates, condition and availability, as well as available capital demand for financing. for our efs operations, competition is primarily based on deal structure and terms. as we compete globally, efs' success is sensitive to project execution and merchant electricity prices, as well as the economic and political environment of each country in which we do business.
the businesses in which we engage are subject to a variety of u.s. federal and state laws and regulations. our insurance operations are regulated by the insurance departments in the states in which they are domiciled or licensed, with the kansas insurance department (kid) being our primary state regulator.
significant trends & developments. we continue to evaluate strategic options to accelerate the further reduction in the size of ge capital, some of which could result in material financial charges depending on the timing, negotiated terms and conditions of any ultimate arrangements.
at ge capital, the primary effect of the covid-19 pandemic pertains to its gecas business. the pandemic has led to worldwide reduction of flight schedules and it is difficult to predict its longer-term impact. additionally, the related market volatility resulted in higher credit spreads on the investment securities held by our run-off insurance business, which resulted in marks and impairments taken in the first quarter, which, starting in the second quarter more than recovered in 2020.
as of december 31, 2020, gecas owned 917 fixed-wing aircraft, of which 27 with a book value of $0.6 billion were available to lease to customers (aircraft on the ground). we test recoverability of each fixed-wing aircraft in our operating lease portfolio at least annually. additionally, we perform quarterly evaluations in circumstances such as when assets are re-leased or current lease terms have changed.
given the environment, we accelerated our review in the second quarter to focus on leases with higher risk of repossession based on our assessment of customer credit risk default and any unplaced leased assets rolling-off over the next 12 months, which represented approximately 20% of our fixed-wing aircraft operating lease portfolio. in addition, we performed our detailed annual portfolio review in the third quarter of 2020, which incorporated third-party appraisal data, updates to all cash flow assumptions as well as evolving market and customer dynamics that we are monitoring. these analyses resulted in pre-tax impairments of $0.5 billion in 2020, primarily on our fixed-wing aircraft operating lease portfolio. pre-tax impairments were $0.1 billion in 2019. the increase in pre-tax impairments was driven by declining cash flow projections of the future collectability of rents on aircraft and engines currently under contract related to market impacts resulting from the pandemic. continued deterioration in cash flow projections, including current rents, downtime, release rates and residual assumptions could result in future impairments in the operating lease portfolio.
based on the resulting pressure on its airline customers, gecas continues to work with customers on restructuring requests as they arise. as a result of these requests, we have executed agreements with customers to reschedule certain lease payments. as of december 31, 2020, we have a contractually deferred balance of $0.4 billion. in addition, we have invoiced $0.3 billion under these agreements and collected about 84%. we expect to continue to receive requests for rent deferrals and/or lease restructures from our global airline customers as a result of covid-19 and related market impacts. an extended disruption of regional or international travel could result in an increase in these types of requests in future periods, which could result in an increase to the trade receivable balance. as gecas evaluates future lease restructures, there is a risk of lease modifications that could have a material adverse effect on gecas operations, financial position and cash flows.
in october 2020, pacific investment management company (pimco), one of the world's premier fixed income investment managers, and gecas announced they had reached a preliminary agreement to develop an aviation leasing venture to support up to $3 billion in aircraft asset financings. pimco and gecas have executed certain of the definitive agreements and obtained relevant regulatory clearances for the venture.
we annually perform premium deficiency testing in the aggregate across our run-off insurance portfolio in the third quarter. as a result of the testing, we identified no premium deficiency. see the other items section and note 12 for further information.
ge capital received $2 billion of additional capital contributions from ge in the fourth quarter of 2020. see the capital resources and liquidity section for further information.
as previously mentioned, ge reached a settlement with the sec and paid a civil penalty of $0.2 billion in december 2020, of which $0.1 billion was recorded and paid at ge capital. see note 23 for further information.
ge capital debt to equity ratio        3.4:1       3.9:1
(a)    in the first quarter of 2020, the remaining industrial finance assets of $268 million were transferred to other continuing operations.
(b)    included cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash of $13,245 million as of december 31, 2020 and $17,618 million as of december 31, 2019.
total segment profit (loss)               $(1,710)          $(530)          $(489)
(a)    capital segment revenues represent 9% of total segment revenues for the year ended december 31, 2020.
(b)    other continuing operations primarily comprised excess interest costs from debt previously allocated to assets that have been sold as part of the ge capital exit plan, preferred stock dividend costs and interest costs not allocated to ge capital businesses, which are driven by ge capital's interest allocation process. interest costs are allocated to ge capital businesses based on the tenor of their assets using the market rate at the time of origination, which differs from the asset profile when the debt was originated. as a result, actual interest expense is higher than interest expense allocated to the remaining ge capital businesses. all preferred stock dividend costs have become a ge industrial obligation in january 2021. see note 16 for further information. in addition, we anticipate unallocated interest costs to gradually decline as debt matures and/or is refinanced.
capital revenues decreased $1.5 billion (17%), as a result of volume declines and lower gains. these volume declines were primarily at gecas related to lower interest income attributable to the sale of pk airfinance and lower rental revenue on our aircraft leasing portfolio, and at wcs related to lower purchases of ge industrial customer receivables and the run-off of the ge capital supply chain finance program (see ge industrial working capital transactions for further information). capital losses increased $1.2 billion, primarily due to an impairment of goodwill of $0.8 billion (pre-tax), volume declines, higher mark-to-market effects and other impairments, including $0.5 billion (pre-tax) on the gecas fixed-wing aircraft portfolio as a result of covid-19 and related market impacts, lower gains, debt tender costs, the sec settlement charge and the nonrecurrence of a 2019 tax reform enactment adjustment. these increased losses were partially offset by the nonrecurrence of a $1.0 billion pre-tax charge identified through the completion of our 2019 annual insurance premium deficiency review, higher tax benefits including the tax benefit related to the biopharma sale and lower excess interest cost. gains were $0.4 billion and $0.7 billion in 2020 and 2019, respectively, which primarily related to sales of certain gecas aircraft and engines resulting in gains of $0.2 billion and $0.4 billion in 2020 and 2019, respectively, and the sale of equity method investments resulting in gains of $0.1 billion and $0.2 billion in 2020 and 2019, respectively, at efs.
corporate items and eliminations. corporate items and eliminations is a caption used in the segment operations - summary of reportable segments table to reconcile the aggregated results of our segments to the consolidated results of the company. the corporate items and eliminations amounts related to revenues and earnings include the results of disposed businesses, certain amounts not included in industrial operating segment results because they are excluded from measurement of their operating performance for internal and external purposes and the elimination of intersegment activities. in addition, the corporate items and eliminations amounts related to earnings include certain costs of our principal retirement plans, significant, higher-cost restructuring programs and other costs reported in corporate.
corporate items and eliminations includes the results of our lighting segment, through its disposition in the second quarter of 2020, and ge digital business for all periods presented.

(a) included non-cash pre-tax impairment charges of $429 million, net of $65 million attributable to noncontrolling interests for the steam business within our power segment in 2020.
(b) ge reached a settlement with the sec and paid a civil penalty of $200 million in december 2020, of which $100 million was recorded and paid at corporate and $100 million was recorded and paid at ge capital.
(c) included non-cash pre-tax impairment charge of $877 million, net of $149 million attributable to noncontrolling interests for the additive reporting unit within our aviation segment in 2020.
adjusted total corporate operating costs* excludes gains (losses) on disposals and held for sale businesses, significant, higher-cost restructuring programs, unrealized gains (losses) and goodwill impairments. we believe that adjusting corporate costs to exclude the effects of items that are not closely associated with ongoing corporate operations provides management and investors with a meaningful measure that increases the period-to-period comparability of our ongoing corporate costs.
for the year ended december 31, 2020, revenues decreased by $0.6 billion, primarily as a result of a $0.5 billion decrease in revenues due to the sale of our current and lighting businesses in april 2019 and june 2020, respectively, and $0.1 billion of higher inter-segment eliminations. corporate costs decreased by $10.7 billion due to $12.5 billion of higher net gains, primarily driven by $12.4 billion of gains from the sale of our biopharma business in 2020. corporate costs also decreased by $0.8 billion due to $1.5 billion of goodwill impairment charges related to our renewable energy segment in 2019 as compared to $0.7 billion of net goodwill impairment charges related to our aviation segment in 2020. in addition, corporate costs decreased by $0.2 billion due to lower restructuring and other charges in 2020, primarily at corporate and power, partially offset by higher restructuring at aviation. these decreases were partially offset by $2.7 billion of higher net unrealized losses, primarily related to a $1.8 billion mark-to-market loss on our baker hughes shares and a $0.1 billion impairment on our ventures portfolio in 2020, as compared to a $0.8 billion mark-to-market gain on our baker hughes shares in 2019. corporate recognized $0.4 billion of non-cash impairment charges related to property, plant and equipment and intangible assets at our steam business within our power segment in 2020. in addition, corporate costs increased by $0.1 billion due to the settlement of the sec investigation in 2020.
adjusted total corporate operating costs* decreased by $0.4 billion in 2020 primarily as the result of $0.3 billion of cost reductions within our digital business and functions and $0.2 billion of lower costs primarily associated with existing ehs matters. overall, eliminations were relatively flat due to higher intercompany elimination activity from project financing investments associated with wind energy projects in our renewable energy segment and higher ge industrial inter-segment eliminations, offset by lower spare engine sales from our aviation segment to our gecas business.
costs and gains not included in segment results. as discussed in the segment operations section, certain amounts are not included in industrial segment results because they are excluded from measurement of their operating performance for internal and external purposes. these amounts relate primarily to significant, higher-cost restructuring programs, goodwill impairment charges and gains/(losses) on acquisition and disposition activities.

other consolidated information restructuring. restructuring actions are essential to our cost improvement efforts for both existing operations and those acquired. restructuring and other charges relate primarily to workforce reductions, facility exit costs associated with the consolidation of sales, service and manufacturing facilities, the integration of acquisitions, and certain other asset write-downs such as those associated with product line exits. we also recognize an obligation for severance benefits that vest or accumulate with service. we continue to closely monitor the economic environment and expect to undertake further restructuring actions to more closely align our cost structure with earnings goals. this table is inclusive of all restructuring charges in our segments.

total restructuring and other charges by business           $1,254          $1,343          $3,050
liabilities associated with restructuring activities were approximately $1.3 billion, $1.7 billion, and $2.6 billion, including actuarial determined post-employment severance benefits of $0.7 billion, $1.0 billion, and $1.6 billion as of december 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively.

the decrease in ge industrial interest and other financial charges for the year ended december 31, 2020 was driven primarily by lower interest on borrowings due to repayments of intercompany loans from ge capital and lower losses related to the completion of tender offers to purchase ge industrial senior notes (including fees and other costs associated with the tenders), and lower expenses on sales of ge industrial current receivables mainly driven by lower sales of receivables and lower benchmark interest rates. the primary components of ge industrial interest and other financial charges are interest on short- and long-term borrowings and financing costs on sales of receivables. total ge industrial interest and other financial charges of $0.9 billion and $1.3 billion were recorded at corporate and $0.5 billion and $0.8 billion were recorded by ge industrial segments for the years ended december 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.
the decrease in ge capital interest and other financial charges for the year ended december 31, 2020 was primarily due to lower average borrowings balances due to maturities and a decrease in average interest rates due to changes in market rates, partially offset by higher net interest on assumed debt resulting from a decrease in intercompany loans to ge industrial which bear the right of offset (see the borrowings section of capital resources and liquidity for an explanation of assumed debt and right-of-offset loans), and the $0.2 billion loss resulting from the completion of tender offers to purchase ge capital senior notes (including fees and other costs associated with the tenders). ge capital average borrowings were $55.8 billion, $61.8 billion and $78.7 billion in 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. the ge capital average composite effective interest rate (including interest allocated to discontinued operations) was 4.0%, 4.2% and 3.9% in 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.
postretirement benefit plans. refer to note 13 for our pension and retiree benefit plans.
provision (benefit) for income taxes            $(474)          $726           $93
for the year ended december 31, 2020, the consolidated income tax benefit was $0.5 billion. the change in tax from a tax provision in 2019 to a tax benefit for 2020 was primarily due to the decrease in pre-tax income excluding the gain from the sale of our biopharma business and non-deductible goodwill impairment charges and a decrease in valuation allowances on non-u.s. deferred tax assets partially offset by the increase in tax expense associated with the disposition of the biopharma business in 2020 compared to the amount recognized on preparatory steps for the planned disposition in 2019 and a decrease in benefit from the completion of the internal revenue service (irs) audits.
absent additional taxes enacted as part of u.s. tax reform and non-u.s. losses without a tax benefit, our consolidated income tax provision is generally reduced because of the benefits of lower-taxed global operations as certain non-u.s. income is subject to local country tax rates that are below the u.s. statutory tax rate.
the rate of tax on our profitable non-u.s. earnings is below the u.s. statutory tax rate because we have significant business operations subject to tax in countries where the tax on that income is lower than the u.s. statutory rate and because ge funds certain non-u.s. operations through foreign companies that are subject to low foreign taxes. most of these earnings have been reinvested in active non-u.s. business operations and as of december 31, 2020, we have not decided to repatriate these earnings to the u.s. given u.s. tax reform, substantially all of our net prior unrepatriated earnings were subject to u.s. tax and accordingly we generally expect to have the ability to repatriate available non-u.s. cash without additional u.s. federal tax cost and any foreign withholding taxes on a repatriation to the u.s. would potentially be partially offset by a u.s. foreign tax credit.
a substantial portion of the benefit for lower-taxed non-u.s. earnings related to business operations subject to tax in countries where the tax on that income is lower than the u.s. statutory rate is derived from our gecas aircraft leasing operations located in ireland where the earnings are taxed at 12.5%, our power operations located in switzerland where the earnings are taxed at between 9% and 18.6% and our aviation operations located in singapore where the earnings are primarily taxed at a rate of 8%.
the rate of tax on non-u.s. operations is increased, however, because we also incur losses in foreign jurisdictions where it is not likely that the losses can be utilized and no tax benefit is provided for those losses and valuation allowances against loss carryforwards are provided when it is no longer likely that the losses can be utilized. in addition, as part of u.s. tax reform, the u.s. has enacted a tax on "base eroding" payments from the u.s. we are continuing to undertake restructuring actions to mitigate the impact from this provision. the u.s. has also enacted a minimum tax on foreign earnings (global intangible low tax income). because we have tangible assets outside the u.s. and pay significant foreign taxes, we generally do not expect a significant increase in tax liability from this new u.s. minimum tax. overall, these newly enacted provisions increase the rate of tax on our non-u.s. operations.

the amounts reported above exclude the impact of u.s. tax reform which is reported as a separate line in the reconciliation of the u.s. federal statutory income tax rate to the actual tax rate in note 15.
for the year ended december 31, 2020, the change from an expense from global operations in 2019 to a benefit from global operations in 2020 reflects the lower rate of tax on the disposition of the biopharma business in 2020 compared to an amount of tax recognized on preparatory steps for the planned disposition in 2019 and a decrease in valuation allowances on non-u.s. deferred tax assets.
a more detailed analysis of differences between the u.s. federal statutory rate and the consolidated effective rate, as well as other information about our income tax provisions, is provided in the critical accounting estimates section and note 15. the nature of business activities and associated income taxes differ for ge industrial and for ge capital; therefore, a separate analysis of each is presented in the paragraphs that follow.
for the year ended december 31, 2020, the ge industrial provision for income taxes decreased primarily due to the decrease in pre-tax income excluding the gain from the sale of our biopharma business and non-deductible goodwill impairment charges and a decrease in valuation allowances on non-u.s. deferred tax assets partially offset by the increase in tax expense associated with the disposition of the biopharma business in 2020 compared to the amount recognized on preparatory steps for the planned disposition in 2019 and a decrease in benefit from the completion of the irs audits.

ge capital provision (benefit) for income taxes          $(862)          $(582)          $(374)
for the year ended december 31, 2020, the ge capital tax benefit increased primarily due to the decrease in pre-tax income excluding non-deductible goodwill impairment charges and due to larger benefits on global operations including a tax benefit associated with the disposition of the biopharma business in 2020.
research and development. we conduct research and development (r&d) activities to continually enhance our existing products and services, develop new products and services to meet our customers' changing needs and requirements, and address new market opportunities. in addition to funding r&d internally, we also receive funding externally from our customers and partners, which contributes to the overall r&d for the company.

(b) customer funded is principally u.s. government funded in our aviation segment.
discontinued operations. discontinued operations primarily include certain businesses in our ge capital segment (our mortgage portfolio in poland and trailing liabilities associated with the sale of our ge capital businesses) and our baker hughes and transportation segments. see notes 2 and 23 for further financial information regarding our businesses in discontinued operations.
the mortgage portfolio in poland (bank bph) comprises floating-rate residential mortgages, 87% of which are indexed to or denominated in foreign currencies (primarily swiss francs). at december 31, 2020, the total portfolio had a carrying value of $2.4 billion with a 1.61% 90-day delinquency rate and an average loan to value ratio of approximately 63.0%. the portfolio is recorded at the lower of cost or fair value, less cost to sell, and included a $0.3 billion impairment, which reflected market yields as well as estimates with respect to ongoing litigation in poland related to foreign currency-denominated mortgages and other factors. see note 23 for additional information about this litigation and the potential for further adverse developments to result in further losses related to these loans in future reporting periods.
capital resources and liquidity financial policy. we intend to maintain a disciplined financial policy, including maintaining a high cash balance. we are targeting a sustainable long-term credit rating in the single-a range, achieving a ge industrial net debt*-to-ebitda ratio of less than 2.5x and a dividend in line with our peers over time, as well as maintaining a less than 4-to-1 debt-to-equity ratio for ge capital. in addition to net debt*-to-ebitda, we also evaluate other leverage measures, including gross debt-to-ebitda, and we will ultimately size our deleveraging actions across a range of measures to ensure we are operating the company based on a strong balance sheet. we intend to continue to decrease our ge industrial leverage over time as we navigate this period of uncertainty, although we now expect to achieve our ge industrial leverage target over time.
liquidity policy. we maintain a strong focus on liquidity and define our liquidity risk tolerance based on sources and uses to maintain a sufficient liquidity position to meet our obligations under both normal and stressed conditions. we intend to maintain a high level of cash and maximize flexibility as we navigate the current environment. at both ge industrial and ge capital, we manage our liquidity to provide access to sufficient funding to meet our business needs and financial obligations, as well as capital allocation and growth objectives, throughout business cycles.
ge industrial has continued to enhance its cash management operations, targeting increased linear cash flow, lower factoring, and reducing restricted cash. as a result, we reduced our intra-quarter borrowings by $3.6 billion in 2020 and reduced our ge industrial cash needs to below approximately $13 billion on a go-forward basis. however, we will continue holding elevated cash levels through this period of uncertainty.
at ge capital, we continue to hold cash levels to cover at least 12 months of long-term debt maturities.
we believe that our consolidated liquidity and availability under our revolving credit facilities will be sufficient to meet our liquidity needs.
consolidated liquidity. following is a summary of cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash at december 31, 2020.
ge capital                  13,421           non-u.s.                    17,696
cash held in non-u.s. entities has generally been reinvested in active foreign business operations; however, substantially all of our unrepatriated earnings were subject to u.s. federal tax and, if there is a change in reinvestment, we would expect to be able to repatriate available cash (excluding amounts held in countries with currency controls) without additional federal tax cost. any foreign withholding tax on a repatriation to the u.s. would potentially be partially offset by a u.s. foreign tax credit.
ge industrial liquidity. ge industrial's primary sources of liquidity consist of cash and cash equivalents, free cash flows from our operating businesses, monetization of receivables, and short-term borrowing facilities, including revolving credit facilities. cash generation can be subject to variability based on many factors, including seasonality, receipt of down payments on large equipment orders, timing of billings on long-term contracts, market conditions and our ability to execute dispositions. additionally, as previously reported, we launched a program in the third quarter of 2020 to fully monetize our baker hughes position over approximately three years. consistent with the program's design, we received initial proceeds of approximately $0.4 billion in the fourth quarter of 2020 and $0.7 billion in january 2021. see note 26 for further information.
ge industrial cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash totaled $23.2 billion at december 31, 2020, including $2.2 billion of cash held in countries with currency control restrictions and $0.4 billion of restricted use cash. cash held in countries with currency controls represents amounts held in countries that may restrict the transfer of funds to the u.s. or limit our ability to transfer funds to the u.s. without incurring substantial costs. restricted use cash represents amounts that are not available to fund operations, and primarily comprised funds restricted in connection with certain ongoing litigation matters.
in the fourth quarter of 2020, ge industrial took actions to continue to solidify its financial position through a $2.5 billion pre-funding to the ge pension plan as well as the repayment of $1.5 billion of intercompany loans to ge capital. based on our current assumptions, we do not anticipate further contributions to the ge pension plan through 2023.
as previously communicated, ge industrial provided a capital contribution to ge capital in the fourth quarter of 2020 of $2.0 billion, in line with the first quarter 2020 insurance statutory funding. in 2021, ge industrial expects to provide an additional contribution to ge capital in line with the existing insurance statutory funding requirement of approximately $2.0 billion. further 2021 capital contributions will depend on ge capital's performance, including gecas operations and the insurance statutory asset adequacy testing results, in light of the uncertain environment. going forward, we anticipate ge capital's liquidity and capital needs will be met through a combination of ge capital liquidity, ge capital asset sales, ge capital future earnings and capital contributions from ge industrial.
ge capital liquidity. ge capital's primary sources of liquidity consist of cash and cash equivalents, cash generated from asset sales and cash flows from our businesses, as well as ge industrial repayments of intercompany loans and capital contributions from ge industrial. we expect to maintain a sufficient liquidity position to fund our insurance obligations and debt maturities. see the segment operations - capital section for further information regarding allocation of ge capital interest expense to the ge capital businesses.
ge capital cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash totaled $13.4 billion at december 31, 2020, excluding $0.5 billion of cash in insurance entities, which was classified as all other assets on the ge capital statement of financial position. see note 10 for further information about classification of cash in insurance entities.
ge capital provided capital contributions to its insurance subsidiaries of $2.0 billion, $1.9 billion and $3.5 billion in the first quarters of 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively, and expects to provide further capital contributions of approximately $7 billion through 2024, including approximately $2.0 billion in the first quarter of 2021, pending completion of our december 31, 2020 statutory reporting process, which includes asset adequacy testing. these contributions are subject to ongoing monitoring by kid, and the total amount to be contributed could increase or decrease, or the timing could be accelerated, based upon the results of reserve adequacy testing or a decision by kid to modify the schedule of contributions set forth in january 2018. we will continue to monitor the interest rate environment, including the impact of reinvestment rates and our investment portfolio performance, and other factors in determining the related effect on our expected future capital contributions. see the critical accounting estimates section for discussion of the sensitivity of interest rate changes to our insurance liabilities. ge is required to maintain specified capital levels at these insurance subsidiaries under capital maintenance agreements. going forward, we anticipate funding any capital needs for insurance through a combination of ge capital liquidity, ge capital asset sales, ge capital future earnings and capital contributions from ge industrial.
borrowings. consolidated total borrowings were $75.1 billion and $90.9 billion at december 31, 2020 and december 31, 2019, respectively, a decrease of $15.8 billion ($16.3 billion excluding intercompany eliminations). see the following table for a summary of ge industrial and ge capital borrowings.

(a) consolidated total borrowings of $75,067 million and $90,882 million at december 31, 2020 and december 31, 2019, respectively, are net of intercompany eliminations of $600 million and $1,036 million, respectively, of other ge industrial borrowings from ge capital, primarily related to timing of cash settlements associated with ge industrial receivables monetization programs.
(b) included $5,687 million and $4,234 million at december 31, 2020 and december 31, 2019, respectively, of fair value adjustments for debt in fair value hedge relationships. see note 21 for further information.
the reduction in ge industrial adjusted borrowings at december 31, 2020 compared to december 31, 2019, was driven primarily by $9.0 billion (including $1.5 billion in the fourth quarter of 2020) of repayments of intercompany loans from ge capital, debt repurchases of $4.2 billion, lower commercial paper of $3.0 billion, and net repayments and maturities of other debt of $1.1 billion, partially offset by issuances of new long-term debt of $7.5 billion and $0.6 billion related to changes in foreign exchange rates.
ge industrial net debt* was $32.3 billion and $47.9 billion at december 31, 2020 and december 31, 2019, respectively. the reduction was driven primarily by $9.0 billion of repayments of intercompany loans from ge capital, an increase in the net cash deduction of $4.2 billion due to a higher cash balance, the repurchase of $4.2 billion of debt, a reduction in after-tax pension and principal retiree benefit plan liabilities of $1.8 billion, a reduction in commercial paper of $3.0 billion, and net repayments and maturities of other debt of $1.1 billion, partially offset by new issuances of new long-term debt of $7.5 billion and $0.6 billion related to changes in foreign exchange rates.
the reduction in ge capital adjusted borrowings at december 31, 2020 compared to december 31, 2019, was driven primarily by debt repurchases of $11.9 billion (including $2.2 billion in the fourth quarter of 2020), long-term debt maturities and other repayments of $10.7 billion (including $2.8 billion in the fourth quarter of 2020), and lower non-recourse borrowings of $0.8 billion, partially offset by ge industrial repayments of intercompany loans of $9.0 billion (which has the effect of increasing ge capital borrowings), issuances of new long-term debt of $6.0 billion, $1.4 billion of fair value adjustments for debt in fair value hedge relationships, and $0.5 billion related to changes in foreign exchange rates.
liability management actions. in 2020, we took a series of actions to enhance and extend our liquidity at both ge industrial and ge capital, issuing a total of $13.5 billion of longer-dated debt and reducing near-term maturities by $10.5 billion in the second quarter, with the remaining $3 billion to be leverage neutral in ge capital by the end of 2021. following are details of these and other actions.
in the second quarter of 2020, ge industrial issued a total of $7.5 billion of senior notes, and used the proceeds to complete a tender offer to purchase $4.2 billion of ge senior notes, to reduce commercial paper and other debt by $1.8 billion, and to repay $1.5 billion of intercompany loans from ge capital. the total of these transactions was leverage neutral for ge industrial within the second quarter.
in the second quarter of 2020, ge capital issued a total of $6.0 billion of senior notes and used the proceeds to complete a tender offer to purchase a total of $9.8 billion of debt. in the fourth quarter of 2020, ge capital completed a tender offer to purchase a total of $2.2 billion of debt with maturities from 2021 through 2023 using the $1.5 billion of proceeds from the ge industrial repayment of intercompany loans as well as existing cash.
the following table provides a reconciliation of total short- and long-term borrowings as reported on the respective ge industrial and ge capital statements of financial position to borrowings adjusted for assumed debt and intercompany loans:
december 31, 2020                                                                        ge industrial        ge capital   consolidated total short- and long-term borrowings                                                   $42,736            $32,931         $75,067

intercompany loans with right of offset                                                   3,177            (3,177)         -
total intercompany payable (receivable) between ge industrial and ge capital           (19,213)             19,213         -
in 2015, senior unsecured notes and commercial paper were assumed by ge industrial upon its merger with ge capital. under the conditions of the 2015 assumed debt agreement, ge capital agreed to continue making required principal and interest payments on behalf of ge industrial, resulting in the establishment of an intercompany receivable and payable between ge industrial and ge capital. in addition, ge capital has periodically made intercompany loans to ge industrial with maturity terms that mirror the assumed debt. as these loans qualify for right-of-offset presentation, they reduce the assumed debt intercompany receivable and payable between ge industrial and ge capital, as noted in the table above.
the remaining intercompany loans from ge capital to ge industrial bear the right of offset against amounts owed by ge capital to ge industrial under the assumed debt agreement and can be prepaid by ge industrial at any time, in whole or in part, without premium or penalty. these loans are priced at market terms and have a collective weighted average interest rate of 3.7% and term of approximately 15.2 years at december 31, 2020.
ge industrial has in place committed revolving credit lines. the following table provides a summary of committed and available credit lines.
less offset provisions                                                              -                   6,700
under the terms of an agreement between ge capital and ge industrial, ge capital has the right to compel ge industrial to borrow under the $15.0 billion unused back-up revolving syndicated credit facility. under this agreement, ge industrial would transfer the proceeds to ge capital as intercompany loans, which would be subject to the same terms and conditions as those between ge industrial and the lending banks. ge capital has not exercised this right.
the following table provides a summary of the activity in the primary external sources of short-term borrowings for ge industrial in the fourth quarters of 2020 and 2019. ge industrial uses its bilateral revolving credit facilities from time to time to meet its short-term liquidity needs.
in the third quarter of 2020, we reduced our ending commercial paper balance to zero. total average and maximum borrowings in the table above are calculated based on the daily outstanding balance of the sum of commercial paper and revolving credit facilities.
credit ratings and conditions. we have relied, and may continue to rely, on the short- and long-term debt capital markets to fund, among other things, a significant portion of our operations. the cost and availability of debt financing is influenced by our credit ratings. moody's investors service (moody's), standard and poor's global ratings (s&p), and fitch ratings (fitch) currently issue separate ratings on ge industrial and ge capital short- and long-term debt. the credit ratings of ge industrial and ge capital as of the date of this filing are set forth in the table below.
long term         baa1           bbb+           bbb ge capital           outlook           negative       negative       stable short term        p-2            a-2            f3
long term         baa1           bbb+           bbb we are disclosing our credit ratings and any current quarter updates to these ratings to enhance understanding of our sources of liquidity and the effects of our ratings on our costs of funds and access to liquidity. our ratings may be subject to a revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating organization, and each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating. for a description of some of the potential consequences of a reduction in our credit ratings, see the financial risks section of risk factors in this report.
substantially all of the company's debt agreements in place at december 31, 2020 do not contain material credit rating covenants. ge's unused back-up revolving syndicated credit facility and certain of our bilateral revolving credit facilities contain a customary net debt-to-ebitda financial covenant, which ge satisfied at december 31, 2020.
the company may from time to time enter into agreements that contain minimum ratings requirements. the following table provides a summary of the maximum estimated potential liquidity impact in the event of further downgrades with regards to the most significant contractual credit ratings conditions of the company.
the amounts in the table above represent the incremental estimated liquidity impact that could occur if we were to fall below each given ratings level.
our most significant contractual ratings requirements are related to ordinary course commercial activities, our receivables sales programs, and our derivatives portfolio. the timing within the quarter of the potential liquidity impact of these areas may differ, as can the remedies to resolving any potential breaches of required ratings levels.
foreign exchange and interest rate risks. as a result of our global operations, we generate and incur a significant portion of our revenues and expenses in currencies other than the u.s. dollar. such principal currencies include the euro, the chinese renminbi, the british pound sterling and the indian rupee, among others. the effects of foreign currency fluctuations on earnings, excluding the earnings impact of the underlying hedged item, was less than $0.1 billion, $0.1 billion, and $0.3 billion for the years ended december 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. this analysis excludes any offsetting effect from the forecasted future transactions that are economically hedged.
exchange rate and interest rate risks are managed with a variety of techniques, including selective use of derivatives. we apply policies to manage each of these risks, including prohibitions on speculative activities. following is an analysis of the potential effects of changes in interest rates and currency exchange rates.
it is our policy to minimize exposure to interest rate changes with regards to our borrowings and their impact to interest and other financial charges. we fund our financial investments using a combination of debt and hedging instruments so that the interest rates of our borrowings match the expected interest rate profile on our assets. it is our policy to minimize currency exposures and to conduct operations either within functional currencies or using the protection of hedge strategies. to test the effectiveness of our hedging actions, for interest rate risk we assumed that, on january 1, 2021, interest rates increased by 100 basis points and the increase remained in place for the next 12 months and for currency risk of assets and liabilities denominated in other than their functional currencies, we evaluated the effect of a 10% shift in exchange rates against the u.s. dollar. the analyses indicated that our 2020 consolidated net earnings would decline by less than $0.1 billion for interest rate risk and approximately $0.1 billion for foreign exchange risk.
libor reform. in connection with the potential transition away from the use of the london interbank offered rate (libor) as an interest rate benchmark, on november 30, 2020, the ice benchmark administration limited (iba) announced a consultation on its intention to cease the publication of the one-week and two-month usd libor settings immediately following the libor publication on december 31, 2021, and the remaining usd libor settings immediately following the libor publication on june 30, 2023. this followed an announcement on november 18, 2020, that iba would consult on its intention to cease the publication of all gbp, eur, chf and jpy libor settings immediately following the libor publication on december 31, 2021.
the company's most significant exposures to libor relate to preferred stock issued by ge industrial and certain floating-rate debt securities issued by ge capital, for which contractual fallback language exists. additionally, with respect to our derivatives portfolio, we are managing the transition from libor based on industry-wide libor reform efforts, including the recently released libor protocols issued by the international swaps and derivatives association. none of these exposures are benchmarked to one-week or two-month usd libor.
we are in the process of managing the transition and any financial impact will be accounted for under accounting standards update (asu) 2020-04, reference rate reform (topic 848): facilitation of the effects of reference rate reform on financial reporting, which we adopted in the fourth quarter of 2020. see note 1 for further information.
statement of cash flows. we manage the cash flow performance of our industrial and financial services businesses separately, in order to enable us and our investors to evaluate the cash from operating activities of our industrial businesses separately from the cash flows of our financial services business.
transactions between ge industrial and ge capital are reported in the respective columns of our statement of cash flows, but are eliminated in deriving our consolidated statement of cash flows. intercompany loans from ge capital to ge industrial are reflected as cash from (used for) financing activities at ge industrial and cash from (used for) investing activities at ge capital. capital contributions from ge industrial to ge capital are reflected as cash used for investing activities at ge industrial and cash from financing activities at ge capital. see the ge industrial working capital transactions section and notes 4 and 24 for further information regarding certain transactions affecting our consolidated statement of cash flows.
the following provides information on our cash flows in 2020 compared with 2019. refer to our annual report on form 10-k for the year ended december 31, 2019 for information regarding cash flows in 2019 compared with 2018.
ge industrial cash flows from continuing operations. the most significant source of cash in ge industrial cfoa is customer-related activities, the largest of which is collecting cash resulting from product or services sales. the most significant operating use of cash is to pay our suppliers, employees, tax authorities, contribute to post retirement plans and pay others for a wide range of material, services and taxes.
ge industrial measures itself on a ge industrial free cash flows* basis. this metric includes ge industrial cfoa plus investments in property, plant and equipment and additions to internal-use software; this metric excludes any dividends received from ge capital and any cash received from dispositions of property, plant and equipment. we believe that investors may also find it useful to compare ge's industrial free cash flows* performance without the effects of cash used for taxes related to business sales and contributions to the ge pension plan. we believe that this measure better allows management and investors to evaluate the capacity of our industrial operations to generate free cash flows.

ge industrial cash used for operating activities was $1.3 billion in 2020, an increase of $5.9 billion compared with 2019, primarily due to: a general decrease in net income (after adjusting for the gain on the sale of biopharma and non-cash losses related to our interest in baker hughes), primarily due to covid-19 impacts in our aviation segment; ge pension plan contributions (which are excluded from ge industrial free cash flows*) of $2.5 billion; partially offset by a decrease in cash used for operating working capital of $2.0 billion; lower provisions for income taxes of $0.9 billion; and an increase in cash paid for income taxes of $0.5 billion. increases in aviation-related customer allowance accruals (which is a component of all other operating activities) of $0.5 billion were $0.2 billion higher compared with 2019.
we utilized the provision of the coronavirus aid, relief, and economic security act (cares act) which allows employers to defer the payment of social security taxes and, as a result, we deferred $0.3 billion as of december 31, 2020.
the decrease in cash used for working capital was due to: a decrease in cash used for current receivables of $3.3 billion, which was primarily driven by lower volume, partially offset by a higher decrease in sales of receivables; an increase in cash generated by inventories, including deferred inventory, of $2.5 billion, which was primarily driven by lower material purchases, partially offset by lower liquidations; and changes in current contract assets of $0.7 billion, primarily due to a net unfavorable change in estimated profitability of $1.1 billion at aviation (see note 9). these decreases in cash used for working capital were partially offset by: an increase in cash used for accounts payable and equipment project accruals of $2.9 billion, which was primarily as a result of lower volume in 2020 and higher disbursements related to purchases of materials in prior periods; and lower progress collections and current deferred income of $1.7 billion, which included a partial offset due to early payments received at our aviation military equipment business of $0.7 billion in 2020 as part of the u.s. department of defense's efforts to support vendors in its supply chain during the pandemic.
ge industrial cash from investing activities was $17.7 billion in 2020, an increase of $13.7 billion compared with 2019, primarily due to: net proceeds from the sale of our biopharma business of $20.3 billion; lower capital contributions from ge industrial to ge capital of $2.0 billion; partially offset by the nonrecurrence of proceeds from the spin-off of our transportation business of $6.2 billion (including the sale of our retained ownership interests in wabtec); and lower proceeds from sales of our stake in baker hughes of $2.6 billion (including the sale of a portion of our retained ownership interests in 2020). cash used for additions to property, plant and equipment and internal-use software, which is a component of ge industrial free cash flows*, was $1.7 billion in 2020, down $0.8 billion compared with 2019.
ge industrial cash used for financing activities was $10.9 billion in 2020, an increase of $3.3 billion compared with 2019, primarily due to: higher repayments of intercompany loans from ge capital of $7.5 billion; a reduction in commercial paper of $3.0 billion; reductions of other debt of $0.8 billion; partially offset by new principal issuances of long-term debt of $7.5 billion in the second quarter of 2020 and lower repurchases of long-term debt of $0.6 billion.
ge industrial cash flows from discontinued operations. ge industrial cash used for investing activities in 2019 was primarily due to the deconsolidation of baker hughes cash as a result of the reduction in our ownership interest in the segment in the third quarter of 2019. ge industrial cash used for financing activities in 2019 primarily reflects payments of baker hughes dividends to noncontrolling interests.
ge capital cash flows from continuing operations. ge capital cash from operating activities was $3.5 billion in 2020, an increase of $1.6 billion compared with 2019, primarily due to: cash collateral received, which is a standard market practice to minimize derivative counterparty exposures, and settlements received on derivative contracts (components of all other operating activities) of $1.9 billion in 2020, an increase of $0.6 billion compared with 2019 as well as a general increase in cash generated from earnings (loss) from continuing operations. these are partially offset by an increase in trade receivables due to short-term extensions of payment terms to customers of $0.3 billion driven primarily by covid-19 and other market related effects.
ge capital cash from investing activities was $8.2 billion in 2020, a decrease of $1.2 billion compared with 2019, primarily due to: lower proceeds from business dispositions of $3.9 billion; lower net collections of financing receivables of $3.2 billion; a decrease in cash related to our current receivables and supply chain finance programs with ge industrial of $1.9 billion; higher net purchases of equity investments of $1.5 billion and a decrease of gecas sales deposits of $1.1 billion primarily driven by covid-19 and other market related effects; partially offset by repayments of ge capital intercompany loans (a component of all other investing activities) by ge industrial of $9.0 billion in 2020, an increase of $7.5 billion compared with 2019; an increase in cash received related to net settlements between our continuing operations (primarily our corporate function) and businesses in discontinued operations of $2.2 billion and a decrease in net purchases of investment securities of $0.3 billion.
ge capital cash used for financing activities was $16.7 billion in 2020, an increase of $9.7 billion compared with 2019, primarily due to: higher net repayments of borrowings of $8.5 billion and a lower capital contribution from ge industrial to ge capital of $2.0 billion; partially offset by lower cash settlements on derivatives hedging foreign currency debt of $1.1 billion.
ge industrial working capital transactions. sales of receivables. in order to manage short-term liquidity and credit exposure, ge industrial may sell current customer receivables to ge capital and third parties. these transactions are made on arms- length terms and any discount related to time value of money is recognized within the respective ge industrial business in the period these receivables were sold to ge capital or third parties. see note 4 for further information.
supply chain finance programs. ge industrial facilitates voluntary supply chain finance programs with third parties, which provide participating ge industrial suppliers the opportunity to sell their ge industrial receivables to third parties at the sole discretion of both the suppliers and the third parties.
at december 31, 2020 and 2019, included in ge industrial's accounts payable is $2.9 billion and $2.4 billion, respectively, of supplier invoices that are subject to the third-party programs. total ge industrial supplier invoices paid through these third-party programs were $4.9 billion and $1.4 billion for the years ended december 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.
previously, ge capital operated a supply chain finance program for suppliers to ge industrial's businesses. the remaining ge industrial liability associated with the funded participation in the ge capital program is presented as accounts payable and amounted to $0.1 billion and $2.1 billion at december 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. cash flows associated with the decrease in this liability are reflected as cash used for operating activities at ge industrial and cash from investing activities at ge capital, and are eliminated in our consolidated statement of cash flows.
intercompany transactions between ge industrial and ge capital. transactions between related companies are made on arms-length terms and are reported in the ge industrial and ge capital columns of our financial statements, which we believe provide useful supplemental information to our consolidated financial statements. consistent with our historical practice, all commercial transactions between ge industrial and ge capital continue to be reported on arms-length terms and are eliminated upon consolidation. see note 24 for further information.
ge capital finance transactions. during the years ended december 31, 2020 and 2019, ge capital acquired from third parties 20 aircraft with a list price totaling $1.7 billion and 51 aircraft with a list price totaling $6.4 billion, respectively, that will be leased to others and are powered by engines manufactured by ge aviation and affiliates. ge capital also made payments to ge aviation and affiliates related to spare engines and engine parts of $0.2 billion and $0.7 billion, which included $0.1 billion and $0.6 billion to cfm international, during the years ended december 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. additionally, ge capital had $2.1 billion and $2.0 billion of net book value of engines, originally manufactured by ge aviation and affiliates and subsequently leased back to ge aviation and affiliates at december 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.
also, during the years ended december 31, 2020 and 2019, ge industrial recognized equipment revenues of $2.3 billion and $1.6 billion, respectively, from customers within our power and renewable energy segments in which ge capital has been an investee or is committed to be an investee in the underlying projects. at december 31, 2020 and 2019, ge capital had funded related investments of $1.3 billion and $0.6 billion, respectively.
for certain of these investments, in order to meet its underwriting criteria, ge capital may obtain a direct guarantee from ge industrial related to the performance of the third party. ge industrial guarantees include direct performance or payment guarantees, return on investment guarantees and asset value guarantees. as of december 31, 2020, ge industrial had outstanding guarantees to ge capital on $0.9 billion of funded exposure and $0.1 billion of unfunded commitments, which included guarantees issued by industrial businesses. the recorded contingent liability for these guarantees was insignificant as of december 31, 2020 and is based on individual transaction level defaults, losses and/or returns.
critical accounting estimates. accounting estimates and assumptions discussed in this section are those that we consider to be the most critical to an understanding of our financial statements because they involve significant judgments and uncertainties. actual results in these areas could differ from management's estimates. see note 1 for further information on our most significant accounting policies.
revenue recognition on long-term services agreements. we have long-term service agreements with our customers predominately within our power and aviation segments that require us to maintain the customers' assets over the contract terms, which generally range from 5 to 25 years. however, contract modifications that extend or revise contracts are not uncommon. we recognize revenue as we perform under the arrangements using the percentage of completion method which is based on our costs incurred to date relative to our estimate of total expected costs. this requires us to make estimates of customer payments expected to be received over the contract term as well as the costs to perform required maintenance services.
customers generally pay us based on the utilization of the asset (per hour of usage for example) or upon the occurrence of a major event within the contract such as an overhaul. as a result, a significant estimate in determining expected revenues of a contract is estimating how customers will utilize their assets over the term of the agreement. the estimate of utilization, which can change over the contract life, impacts both the amount of customer payments we expect to receive and our estimate of future contract costs. customers' asset utilization will influence the timing and extent of overhauls and other service events over the life of the contract. we generally use a combination of both historical utilization trends as well as forward-looking information such as market conditions and potential asset retirements in developing our revenue estimates.
to develop our cost estimates, we consider the timing and extent of future maintenance and overhaul events, including the amount and cost of labor, spare parts and other resources required to perform the services. in developing our cost estimates, we utilize a combination of our historical cost experience and expected cost improvements. cost improvements are only included in future cost estimates after savings have been observed in actual results or proven effective through an extensive regulatory or engineering approval process.
we routinely review estimates under long-term service agreements and regularly revise them to adjust for changes in outlook. these revisions are based on objectively verifiable information that is available at the time of the review. contract modifications that change the rights and obligations, as well as the nature, timing and extent of future cash flows, are evaluated for potential price concessions, contract asset impairments and significant financing to determine if adjustments of earnings are required before effectively accounting for a modified contract as a new contract.
we regularly assess expected billings adjustments and customer credit risk inherent in the carrying amounts of receivables and contract assets, including the risk that contractual penalties may not be sufficient to offset our accumulated investment in the event of customer termination. we gain insight into future utilization and cost trends, as well as credit risk, through our knowledge of the installed base of equipment and fleet management strategies through close interaction with our customers that comes with supplying critical services and parts over extended periods. revisions may affect a long-term services agreement's total estimated profitability resulting in an adjustment of earnings.
on december 31, 2020, our net long-term service agreements balance of $1.3 billion represents approximately 0.7% of our total estimated life of contract billings of $188.4 billion. our contracts (on average) are approximately 20.9% complete based on costs incurred to date and our estimate of future costs. revisions to our estimates of future billings or costs that increase or decrease total estimated contract profitability by one percentage point would increase or decrease the long-term service agreements balance by $0.4 billion. cash billings collected on these contracts were $8.9 billion and $11.5 billion during the years ended december 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.

impairment of goodwill and other identified intangible assets. we perform our annual goodwill impairment testing in the fourth quarter. in assessing the possibility that a reporting unit's fair value has been reduced below its carrying amount due to the occurrence of events or circumstances between annual impairment testing dates, we consider all available evidence, including (i) the results of our impairment testing from the most recent testing date (in particular, the magnitude of the excess of fair value over carrying value observed), (ii) downward revisions to internal forecasts or decreases in market multiples (and the magnitude thereof), if any, and (iii) declines in market capitalization below book value (and the magnitude and duration of those declines), if any.
we determine fair value for each of the reporting units using the market approach, when available and appropriate, or the income approach, or a combination of both. we assess the valuation methodology based upon the relevance and availability of the data at the time we perform the valuation. if multiple valuation methodologies are used, the results are weighted appropriately.
valuations using the market approach are derived from metrics of publicly traded companies or historically completed transactions of comparable businesses. the selection of comparable businesses is based on the markets in which the reporting units operate giving consideration to risk profiles, size, geography, and diversity of products and services. a market approach is limited to reporting units for which there are publicly traded companies that have the characteristics similar to our businesses.
under the income approach, fair value is determined based on the present value of estimated future cash flows, discounted at an appropriate risk-adjusted rate. we use our internal forecasts to estimate future cash flows and include an estimate of long-term future growth rates based on our most recent views of the long-term outlook for each business. we derive our discount rates using a capital asset pricing model and analyzing published rates for industries relevant to our reporting units to estimate the cost of equity financing. we use discount rates that are commensurate with the risks and uncertainty inherent in the respective businesses and in our internally developed forecasts. discount rates used in our annual reporting unit valuations ranged from 10.5% to 22.5%.
estimating the fair value of reporting units requires the use of significant judgments that are based on a number of factors including actual operating results, internal forecasts, market observable pricing multiples of similar businesses and comparable transactions, possible control premiums, determining the appropriate discount rate and long-term growth rate assumptions, and, if multiple approaches are being used, determining the appropriate weighting applied to each approach. it is reasonably possible that the judgments and estimates described above could change in future periods.
we review identified intangible assets with defined useful lives and subject to amortization for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the related carrying amounts may not be recoverable. determining whether an impairment loss has occurred requires the use of our internal forecast to estimate future cash flows and the useful life over which these cash flows will occur. to determine fair value, we use our internal cash flow estimates discounted at an appropriate discount rate.

pension assumptions. refer to note 13 for our accounting estimates and assumptions related to our postretirement benefit plans.
income taxes. our annual tax rate is based on our income, statutory tax rates and tax planning opportunities available to us in the various jurisdictions in which we operate. tax laws are complex and subject to different interpretations by the taxpayer and respective governmental taxing authorities. significant judgment is required in determining our tax expense and in evaluating our tax positions, including evaluating uncertainties. we review our tax positions quarterly and adjust the balances as new information becomes available. our income tax rate is significantly affected by the tax rate on our global operations. in addition to local country tax laws and regulations, this rate can depend on the extent earnings are indefinitely reinvested outside the u.s. historically u.s. taxes were due upon repatriation of foreign earnings. due to the enactment of u.s. tax reform, repatriations of available cash from foreign earnings are expected to be free of u.s. federal income tax but may incur withholding or state taxes. indefinite reinvestment is determined by management's judgment about and intentions concerning the future operations of the company. most of these earnings have been reinvested in active non-u.s. business operations. at december 31, 2020, we have not changed our indefinite reinvestment decision as a result of tax reform but will reassess this on an ongoing basis.
we evaluate the recoverability of deferred income tax assets by assessing the adequacy of future expected taxable income from all sources, including reversal of taxable temporary differences, forecasted operating earnings and available tax planning strategies, which heavily rely on estimates. we use our historical experience and our short- and long-range business forecasts to provide insight. further, our global and diversified business portfolio gives us the opportunity to employ various prudent and feasible tax planning strategies to facilitate the recoverability of future deductions. amounts recorded for deferred tax assets related to non-u.s. net operating losses, net of valuation allowances, were $2.1 billion and $2.2 billion at december 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. of this, $0.1 billion and $0.2 billion at december 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, were associated with losses reported in discontinued operations, primarily related to our legacy financial services businesses, and $0.2 billion was related to held for sale assets at december 31, 2019.
see other consolidated information - income taxes section and notes 1 and 15 for further information.
loss contingencies. loss contingencies are uncertain and unresolved matters that arise in the ordinary course of business and result from events or actions by others that have the potential to result in a future loss. such contingencies include, but are not limited to, environmental obligations, litigation, regulatory investigations and proceedings, product quality and losses resulting from other events and developments. when a loss is considered probable and reasonably estimable, we record a liability in the amount of our best estimate for the ultimate loss. when there appears to be a range of possible costs with equal likelihood, liabilities are based on the low-end of such range. however, the likelihood of a loss with respect to a particular contingency is often difficult to predict and determining a meaningful estimate of the loss or a range of loss may not be practicable based on the information available and the potential effect of future events and negotiations with or decisions by third parties that will determine the ultimate resolution of the contingency. moreover, it is not uncommon for such matters to be resolved over many years, during which time relevant developments and new information must be continuously evaluated to determine both the likelihood of potential loss and whether it is possible to reasonably estimate a range of possible loss. disclosure is provided for material loss contingencies when a loss is probable but a reasonable estimate cannot be made, and when it is reasonably possible that a loss will be incurred or the amount of a loss will exceed the recorded provision. we regularly review contingencies to determine whether the likelihood of loss has changed and to assess whether a reasonable estimate of the loss or range of loss can be made. see note 23 for further information.
other items insurance. the run-off insurance operations of north american life and health (nalh) primarily include employers reassurance corporation (erac) and union fidelity life insurance company (uflic). erac was formerly part of employers reinsurance corporation (erc) until the sale of erc to swiss re in 2006. uflic was formerly part of genworth financial inc. (genworth) but was retained by ge after genworth's initial public offering in 2004.
erac primarily assumes long-term care insurance and life insurance from numerous cedents under various types of reinsurance treaties and stopped accepting new policies after 2008. uflic primarily assumes long-term care insurance, structured settlement annuities with and without life contingencies and variable annuities from genworth and has been closed to new business since 2004.
the vast majority of nalh's reinsurance exposures are long-duration arrangements that still involve substantial levels of premium collections and benefit payments even though erac and uflic have not entered into new reinsurance treaties in about a decade. these long-duration arrangements involve a number of direct writers and contain a range of risk transfer provisions and other contractual elements. in many instances, these arrangements do not transfer to us 100 percent of the risk embodied in the encompassed underlying policies issued by the direct writers. furthermore, we cede insurance risk to third-party reinsurers for a portion of our insurance contracts, primarily on long-term care insurance policies.
our run-off insurance liabilities and annuity benefits primarily comprise a liability for future policy benefits for those insurance contract claims not yet incurred and claim reserves for claims that have been incurred or are estimated to have been incurred but not yet reported. the insurance liabilities and annuity benefits amounted to $42.2 billion and $39.8 billion and primarily relate to individual long-term care insurance reserves of $21.3 billion and $21.0 billion and structured settlement annuities and life insurance reserves of $10.7 billion and $11.1 billion, at december 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. the increase in insurance liabilities and annuity benefits of $2.4 billion from december 31, 2019 to december 31, 2020 is primarily due to an adjustment of $2.5 billion resulting from an increase in unrealized gains on investment securities that would result in a premium deficiency should those gains be realized.
in addition to nalh, electric insurance company (eic) is a property and casualty insurance company primarily providing insurance to ge and its employees with net claim reserves of $0.3 billion at both december 31, 2020 and 2019.
we regularly monitor emerging experience in our run-off insurance operations and industry developments to identify trends that may help us refine our reserve assumptions. we believe recent elevated mortality across our portfolio and lower long-term care insurance claims are short term in nature and attributable to covid-19. however, the effects of covid-19, including the timing and success of vaccinations, remain uncertain and may result in variability in levels of future mortality and long-term care insurance claims activity, including changes in policyholder behavior (e.g., policyholder willingness to enter long-term care facilities or seek care at home), among others.
these monitoring activities also allow us to evaluate opportunities to reduce our insurance risk profile and improve the results of our run-off insurance operations. such opportunities may include the pursuit of future premium rate increases and benefit reductions on long-term care insurance contracts in accordance with our reinsurance contracts with our ceding companies; recapture and reinsurance transactions to reduce risk where economically justified; investment strategies to improve asset and liability matching and enhance investment portfolio yields; and managing our expense levels.
key portfolio characteristics long-term care insurance contracts. the long-term care insurance contracts we reinsure provide coverage at varying levels of benefits to policyholders and may include attributes that could result in claimants being on claim for longer periods or at higher daily claim costs, or alternatively limiting the premium paying period, compared to contracts with a lower level of benefits. for example, policyholders with a lifetime benefit period could receive coverage up to the specified daily maximum as long as the policyholder is claim eligible and receives care for covered services; inflation protection options increase the daily maximums to protect the policyholder from the rising cost of care with some options providing automatic annual increases of 3% to 5% or policyholder elected inflation-indexed increases for increased premium; joint life policies provide coverage for two lives which permit either life under a single contract to receive benefits at the same time or separately; and premium payment options may limit the period over which the policyholder pays premiums while still receiving coverage after premium payments cease, which may limit the impact of our benefit from future premium rate increases.
the erac long-term care insurance portfolio comprises more than two-thirds of our total long-term care insurance reserves and is assumed from approximately 30 ceding companies through various types of reinsurance and retrocession contracts having complex terms and conditions. compared to the overall long-term care insurance block, it has a lower average attained age with a larger number of policies (and covered lives, as over one-third of the policies are joint life policies), with lifetime benefit periods and/or with inflation protection options which may result in a higher potential for future claims.
the uflic long-term care insurance block comprises the remainder of our total long-term care insurance reserves and is more mature with policies that are more uniform, as it is assumed from a single ceding company, genworth, and has fewer policies with lifetime benefit periods, no joint life policies and slightly more policies with inflation protection options.
as further described within the premium deficiency testing section below, we reconstructed our future claim cost projections in 2017 utilizing trends observed in our emerging experience for older claimant ages and later duration policies. also described within that section are key assumption changes in 2020.
presented in the table below are gaap and statutory reserve balances and key attributes of our long-term care insurance portfolio.

structured settlement annuities and life insurance contracts. we reinsure approximately 29,100 structured settlement annuities with an average attained age of 53. these structured settlement annuities were primarily underwritten on impaired lives (i.e., shorter-than-average life expectancies) at origination and have projected payments extending decades into the future. our primary risks associated with these contracts include mortality (i.e., life expectancy or longevity), mortality improvement (i.e., assumed rate that mortality is expected to reduce over time), which may extend the duration of payments on life contingent contracts beyond our estimates, and reinvestment risk (i.e., a low interest rate environment may reduce our ability to achieve our targeted investment margins). unlike long-term care insurance, structured settlement annuities offer no ability to require additional premiums or reduce benefits.
our life reinsurance business typically covers the mortality risk associated with various types of life insurance policies that we reinsure from approximately 150 ceding company relationships where we pay a benefit based on the death of a covered life. as of december 31, 2020, across our u.s. and canadian life insurance blocks, we reinsure approximately $80 billion of net amount at risk (i.e., difference between the death benefit and any accrued cash value) from approximately 2 million policies with an average attained age of 59. in 2020, our incurred claims were approximately $0.6 billion with an average individual claim of approximately $50,000. the largest product types covered are 20-year level term policies, which represent approximately 35% of the net amount at risk and a significant portion are anticipated to lapse (i.e., the length of time a policy will remain in force) over the next 3 years as the policies reach the end of their 20-year level premium period.
investment portfolio and other adjustments. our insurance liabilities and annuity benefits are primarily supported by investment securities of $42.0 billion and $38.0 billion and commercial mortgage loans of $1.8 billion and $1.9 billion at december 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. additionally, we expect to purchase approximately $7 billion of new assets through 2024 in conjunction with expected capital contributions from ge capital to our insurance subsidiaries, of which approximately $2.0 billion is expected to be contributed in the first quarter of 2021, pending completion of our december 31, 2020 statutory reporting process, which includes asset adequacy testing. our investment securities are classified as available-for-sale and comprise mainly investment-grade debt securities. the portfolio includes $8.2 billion of net unrealized gains that are recorded within other comprehensive income, net of applicable taxes and other adjustments as of december 31, 2020.
in calculating our future policy benefit reserves, we are required to consider the impact of net unrealized gains and losses on our available-for-sale investment securities supporting our insurance contracts as if those unrealized amounts were realized. to the extent that the realization of gains would result in a premium deficiency, an adjustment is recorded to increase future policy benefit reserves with an after-tax offset to other comprehensive income. at december 31, 2020, the entire $8.2 billion balance of net unrealized gains on our investment securities required a related increase to future policy benefit reserves. this adjustment increased from $5.7 billion in 2019 to $8.2 billion in 2020 primarily from higher unrealized gains within the investment security portfolio supporting our insurance contracts as a result of decreased market yields. see note 3 for further information about our investment securities.
we manage the investments in our run-off insurance operations under strict investment guidelines, including limitations on asset class concentration, single issuer exposures, asset-liability duration variances, and other factors to meet credit quality, yield, liquidity and diversification requirements associated with servicing our insurance liabilities under reasonable circumstances. this process includes consideration of various asset allocation strategies and incorporates information from several external investment advisors to improve our investment yield subject to maintaining our ability to satisfy insurance liabilities when due, as well as considering our risk-based capital requirements, regulatory constraints, and tolerance for surplus volatility. with the expected capital contributions from ge capital through 2024, we intend to add new asset classes to further diversify our portfolio, including private equity, senior secured loans and infrastructure debt, among others. asset allocation planning is a dynamic process that considers changes in market conditions, risk appetite, liquidity needs and other factors which are reviewed on a periodic basis by our investment team. investing in these assets exposes us to both credit risk (i.e., debtor's ability to make timely payments of principal and interest) and interest rate risk (i.e., market price, cash flow variability, and reinvestment risk due to changes in market interest rates). we regularly review investment securities for impairment using both quantitative and qualitative criteria.
our run-off insurance operations have approximately $0.8 billion of assets held by states or other regulatory bodies in statutorily required deposit accounts, and approximately $32.2 billion of assets held in trust accounts associated with reinsurance contracts and reinsurance security trust agreements in place between either erac or uflic as the reinsuring entity and a number of ceding insurers. assets in these trusts are held by an independent trustee for the benefit of the ceding insurer, and are subject to various investment guidelines as set forth in the respective reinsurance contacts and trust agreements. some of these trust agreements may allow a ceding company to withdraw trust assets from the trust and hold these assets on its balance sheet, in an account under its control for the benefit of erac or uflic which might allow the ceding company to exercise investment control over such assets.
future policy benefit reserves. future policy benefit reserves represent the present value of future policy benefits less the present value of future gross premiums based on actuarial assumptions including, but not limited to, morbidity (i.e., frequency and severity of claim, including claim termination rates and benefit utilization rates); morbidity improvement (i.e., assumed rate of improvement in morbidity in the future); mortality (i.e., life expectancy or longevity); mortality improvement (i.e., assumed rate that mortality is expected to reduce over time); policyholder persistency or lapses (i.e., the length of time a policy will remain in force); anticipated premium increases or benefit reductions associated with future in-force rate actions, including actions that are: (a) approved and not yet implemented, (b) filed but not yet approved, and (c) estimated on future filings through 2028, on long-term care insurance policies; and interest rates. assumptions are locked-in throughout the remaining life of a contract unless a premium deficiency develops.
claim reserves. claim reserves are established when a claim is incurred and represents our best estimate of the present value of the ultimate obligations for future claim payments and claim adjustment expenses. key inputs include actual known facts about the claim, such as the benefits available and cause of disability of the claimant, as well as assumptions derived from our actual historical experience and expected future changes in experience factors. claim reserves are evaluated periodically for potential changes in loss estimates with the support of qualified actuaries, and any changes are recorded in earnings in the period in which they are determined.
reinsurance recoverables. we cede insurance risk to third-party reinsurers for a portion of our insurance contracts, primarily on long-term care insurance policies, and record receivables for estimated recoveries as we are not relieved from our primary obligation to policyholders or cedents. these receivables are estimated in a manner consistent with the future policy benefit reserves and claim reserves. reserves ceded to reinsurers, net of allowance, were $2.6 billion and $2.4 billion at december 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, and are included in the caption other ge capital receivables in our consolidated statement of financial position.
premium deficiency testing. we annually perform premium deficiency testing in the third quarter in the aggregate across our run-off insurance portfolio. the premium deficiency testing assesses the adequacy of future policy benefit reserves, net of unamortized capitalized acquisition costs, using current assumptions without provision for adverse deviation. a comprehensive review of premium deficiency assumptions is a complex process and depends on a number of factors, many of which are interdependent and require evaluation individually and in the aggregate across all insurance products. the vast majority of our run-off insurance operations consists of reinsurance from multiple ceding insurance entities pursuant to treaties having complex terms and conditions. premium deficiency testing relies on claim and policy information provided by these ceding entities and considers the reinsurance treaties and underlying policies. in order to utilize that information for purposes of completing experience studies covering all key assumptions, we perform detailed procedures to conform and validate the data received from the ceding entities. our long-term care insurance business includes coverage where credible claim experience for higher attained ages is still emerging, and to the extent future experience deviates from current expectations, new projections of claim costs extending over the expected life of the policies may be required. significant uncertainties exist in making projections for these long-term care insurance contracts, which requires that we consider a wide range of possible outcomes.
the primary assumptions used in the premium deficiency tests include:
morbidity. morbidity assumptions used in estimating future policy benefit reserves are based on estimates of expected incidences of disability among policyholders and the costs associated with these policyholders asserting claims under their contracts, and these estimates account for any expected future morbidity improvement. for long-term care exposures, estimating expected future costs includes assessments of incidence (probability of a claim), utilization (amount of available benefits expected to be incurred) and continuance (how long the claim will last). prior to 2017, premium deficiency assumptions considered the risk of anti-selection by including issue age adjustments to morbidity based on an actuarial assumption that long-term care policies issued to younger individuals would exhibit lower expected incidences and claim costs than those issued to older policyholders. recent claim experience and the development of reconstructed claim cost curves indicated issue age differences had minimal impact on claim cost projections, and, accordingly, beginning in 2017, issue age adjustments were eliminated in developing morbidity assumptions. higher morbidity increases, while lower morbidity decreases, the present value of expected future benefit payments.
rate of change in morbidity. our annual premium deficiency testing incorporates our best estimates of projected future changes in the morbidity rates reflected in our base claim cost curves. these estimates draw upon a number of inputs, some of which are subjective, and all of which are interpreted and applied in the exercise of professional actuarial judgment in the context of the characteristics specific to our portfolios. this exercise of judgment considers factors such as the work performed by internal and external independent actuarial experts engaged to advise us in our annual testing, the observed actual experience in our portfolios measured against our base projections, industry developments, and other trends, including advances in the state of medical care and health-care technology development. with respect to industry developments, we take into account that there are differences between and among industry peers in portfolio characteristics (such as demographic features of the insured populations), the aggregate effect of morbidity improvement or deterioration as applied to base claim cost projections, the extent to which such base cost projections reflect the most current experience, and the accepted diversity of practice in actuarial professional judgment. we assess the potential for any change in morbidity with reference to our existing base claim cost projections, reconstructed in 2017. projected improvement or deterioration in morbidity can have a material impact on our future claim cost projections, both on a stand-alone basis and also by virtue of influencing other variables such as discount rate and premium rate increases.
mortality. mortality assumptions used in estimating future policy benefit reserves are based on published mortality tables as adjusted for the results of our experience studies and estimates of expected future mortality improvement. for life insurance products, higher mortality increases the present value of expected future benefit payments, while for annuity and long-term care insurance contracts, higher mortality decreases the present value of expected future benefit payments.
discount rate. interest rate assumptions used in estimating the present value of future policy benefit reserves are based on expected investment yields, net of related investment expenses and expected defaults. in estimating future investment yields, we consider the actual yields on our current investment securities held by our run-off insurance operations and the future rates at which we expect to reinvest any proceeds from investment security maturities, net of other operating cash flows, and the projected future capital contributions into our run-off insurance operations. lower future investment yields result in a lower discount rate and a higher present value of future policy benefit reserves.
future long-term care premium rate increases. long-term care insurance policies allow the issuing insurance entity to increase premiums, or alternatively allow the policyholder the option to decrease benefits, with approval by state regulators, should actual experience emerge worse than what was projected when such policies were initially underwritten. as a reinsurer, we rely upon the primary insurers that issued the underlying policies to file proposed premium rate increases on those policies with the relevant state insurance regulators. while we have no direct ability to seek or to institute such premium rate increases, we often collaborate with the primary insurers in accordance with reinsurance contractual terms to file proposed premium rate increases. the amount of times that rate increases have occurred varies by ceding company. we consider recent experience of rate increase filings made by our ceding companies along with state insurance regulatory processes and precedents in establishing our current expectations. higher future premium rate increases lower the present value of future policy benefit reserves and lower future premium rate increases increase the present value of future policy benefit reserves.
terminations. terminations refers to the rate at which the underlying policies are cancelled due to either mortality, lapse (non-payment of premiums by a policyholder), or, in the case of long-term care insurance, benefit exhaustion. termination rate assumptions used in estimating the present value of future policy benefit reserves are based on the results of our experience studies and reflect actuarial judgment. lower termination rates increase, while higher termination rates decrease, the present value of expected future benefit payments.
in 2017, based on elevated claim experience for a portion of our long-term care insurance contracts, we initiated a comprehensive review of all premium deficiency testing assumptions across all insurance products, resulting in a reconstruction of our future claim cost projections for long-term care insurance products. while our long-term care insurance claim experience has shown some emerging modest favorable experience, it remains largely in-line with those reconstructed projections. however, the extent of actual experience since 2017 to date is limited in the context of a long-tailed, multi-decade portfolio.
2020 premium deficiency testing. we completed our annual premium deficiency testing in the aggregate across our run-off insurance portfolio in the third quarter of 2020. these procedures included updating experience studies since our last test completed in the third quarter of 2019, independent actuarial analysis and review of industry benchmarks. as we experienced a premium deficiency in 2019, our 2020 premium deficiency testing started with a zero margin and, accordingly, any net adverse development would result in a future premium deficiency. using our most recent future policy benefit reserve assumptions, including changes to our assumptions related to morbidity, future premium rate increases and discount rate, the 2020 premium deficiency testing results indicated there was a positive margin of less than 2% of the recorded future policy benefit reserves, excluding other adjustments, at september 30, 2020. as a result, the assumptions updated in connection with the premium deficiency recognized in 2019 remain locked-in and will remain so unless another premium deficiency occurs in the future.
the increase in the premium deficiency testing margin from our 2019 testing was primarily attributable to modestly favorable emerging morbidity experience in our long-term care insurance portfolio, primarily at the older attained ages, in the period since the 2017 reconstruction of our future claim cost projections ($0.4 billion) and higher projected future premium rate increase approvals ($0.2 billion), partially offset by a decline in the overall discount rate to a weighted average rate of 5.70% compared to 5.74% in 2019 ($0.2 billion). this decline in the discount rate from 2019 to 2020 reflects a lower expected reinvestment rate, due to lower benchmark interest rates in the u.s, increasing to a lower expected long-term average investment yield over a longer period and slightly lower actual yields on our investment security portfolio, partially offset by increased allocations to higher yielding asset classes introduced with our 2018 strategic initiatives, which included a modest decline in expected yield compared to 2019 assumptions.
as noted above, while our observed long-term care insurance claim experience has shown some emerging modest favorable experience in the period since the 2017 reconstruction of our future claim cost projections, it remains largely in-line with those reconstructed projections. based on the application of professional actuarial judgment to the factors discussed above, we have made no substantial change to our assumptions concerning morbidity improvement, mortality, mortality improvement, or terminations in 2020.
as with all assumptions underlying our premium deficiency testing, we will continue to monitor these factors, which may result in future changes in our assumptions.
since our premium deficiency testing performed in 2019, we have implemented approximately $0.3 billion of previously approved long-term care insurance premium rate increase actions and expect higher projected future premium rate increase approvals of approximately $0.2 billion. our 2020 premium deficiency test includes approximately $1.9 billion of anticipated future premium increases or benefit reductions associated with future in-force rate actions. this represents a decrease of $0.1 billion from our 2019 premium deficiency test to account for actions that are: (a) approved and not yet implemented, (b) filed but not yet approved, and (c) estimated on future filings through 2028 and includes the effects of the lower discount rate mentioned above and longer anticipated timing to achieve certain premium rate approvals.
as a result of exposure period cut-off dates to permit experience to develop and lags in ceding company data reporting from our ceding companies, the impact of covid-19 is not reflected in the experience studies data used in our 2020 premium deficiency testing. however, we assessed certain scenarios to understand potential impacts associated with covid-19 and, due to the insignificance and short-term nature of such uncertain future impacts, including the natural offsets from mortality in the aggregate across our run-off insurance products, concluded adjustments to our primary assumptions used in the premium deficiency testing were not warranted.
when results of the premium deficiency testing indicate overall reserves are sufficient, we are also required to assess whether additional future policy benefit reserves are required to be accrued over time in the future. such an accrual would be required if profits are projected in earlier future periods followed by losses projected in later future years (i.e., profits followed by losses). when this pattern of profits followed by losses is projected, we would be required to accrue a liability in the expected profitable years by the amount necessary to offset projected losses in later future years. we noted our projections as of third quarter 2020 indicate the present value of projected earnings in each future year to be positive, and therefore, no further adjustments to our future policy benefit reserves were required at this time.
gaap reserve sensitivities. the results of our premium deficiency testing are sensitive to the assumptions described above. considering the results of the 2020 premium deficiency test which resulted in a small margin, any future net adverse changes in our assumptions may reduce the margin or result in a premium deficiency requiring an increase to future policy benefit reserves. for example, adverse changes in key assumptions related to our future policy benefits reserves, holding all other assumptions constant, would have the following effects on the projected present value of future cash flows as presented in the table below. any future net favorable changes to these assumptions could result in a lower projected present value of future cash flows and additional margin in our premium deficiency test and higher income over the remaining duration of the portfolio, including higher investment income. the assumptions within our future policy benefit reserves are subject to significant uncertainties, including those inherent in the complex nature of our reinsurance treaties. many of our assumptions are interdependent and require evaluation individually and in the aggregate across all insurance products. small changes in the amounts used in the sensitivities or the use of different factors could result in materially different outcomes from those reflected below.

statutory considerations. our run-off insurance subsidiaries are required to prepare statutory financial statements in accordance with statutory accounting practices. statutory accounting practices, not gaap, determine the required statutory capital levels of our insurance legal entities.
statutory accounting practices are set forth by the national association of insurance commissioners (naic) as well as state laws, regulation and general administrative rules and differ in certain respects from gaap. under statutory accounting practices, base formulaic reserve assumptions typically do not change unless approved by our primary regulator, kid. in addition to base reserves, statutory accounting practices require additional actuarial reserves (aar) be established based on results of asset adequacy testing reflecting moderately adverse conditions (i.e., assumptions include a provision for adverse deviation (pad) rather than current assumptions without a pad as required for premium deficiency testing under gaap). as a result, our statutory asset adequacy testing assumptions reflect less long-term care insurance morbidity improvement and for shorter durations, restrictions on future long-term care insurance premium rate increases, no life insurance mortality improvement and a lower discount rate, among other differences. as a result, several of the sensitivities described in the table above would be less impactful on our statutory reserves.
the adverse impact on our statutory aar arising from our revised assumptions in 2017, including the collectability of reinsurance recoverables, is expected to require ge capital to contribute approximately $14.5 billion additional capital, to its run-off insurance operations in 2018-2024. for statutory accounting purposes, kid approved our request for a permitted accounting practice to recognize the 2017 aar increase over a seven-year period. ge capital provided capital contributions to its insurance subsidiaries of $2.0 billion, $1.9 billion and $3.5 billion in the first quarter of 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. ge capital expects to provide further capital contributions of approximately $7 billion through 2024 (of which approximately $2.0 billion is expected to be contributed in the first quarter of 2021, pending completion of our december 31, 2020 statutory reporting process, which includes asset adequacy testing), subject to ongoing monitoring by kid. ge is a party to capital maintenance agreements with erac and uflic under which ge is required to maintain their minimum statutory capital levels at 300% of their year-end authorized control level risk-based capital requirements as defined from time to time by the naic.
if our future policy benefit reserves established under gaap are realized over the estimated remaining life of our run-off insurance obligations, we would expect the $14.5 billion of capital contributed to the run-off insurance operations over the 2018 to 2024 period to be considered statutory capital surplus at the end of the estimated remaining life with no additional charge to gaap earnings. however, should the more conservative statutory assumptions be realized, we would be required to record the difference between gaap assumptions and statutory assumptions as a charge to gaap earnings in the future periods.

new accounting standards. the financial accounting standards board (fasb) issued asu no. 2018-12, financial services - insurance (topic 944): targeted improvements to the accounting for long-duration contracts with an effective date for periods beginning after december 31, 2021, with an election to adopt early. on november 5, 2020, the fasb issued asu 2020-11, financial services - insurance (topic 944): effective date and early application which defers the effective date for all insurance entities by one year and allows the early application transition date to be either the beginning of the prior period or the earliest prior period presented. we are evaluating the effect of the standard on our consolidated financial statements and anticipate that its adoption will significantly change the accounting for measurements of our long-duration insurance liabilities. the asu requires cash flow assumptions used in the measurement of various insurance liabilities to be reviewed at least annually and updated if actual experience or other evidence indicates previous assumptions need to be revised with any required changes recorded in earnings. under the current accounting guidance, the discount rate is based on expected investment yields, while under the asu the discount rate will be equivalent to the upper-medium grade (i.e., single a) fixed-income instrument yield reflecting the duration characteristics of the liability and is required to be updated in each reporting period with changes recorded in other comprehensive income. in measuring the insurance liabilities under the new standard, contracts shall not be grouped together from different issue years. these changes result in the elimination of premium deficiency testing and shadow adjustments. while we continue to evaluate the effect of the standard on our ongoing financial reporting, we anticipate that the adoption of the asu will materially affect our financial statements. as the asu is only applicable to the measurements of our long-duration insurance liabilities under gaap, it will not affect the accounting for our insurance reserves or the levels of capital and surplus under statutory accounting practices.
non-gaap financial measures. we believe that presenting non-gaap financial measures provides management and investors useful measures to evaluate performance and trends of the total company and its businesses. this includes adjustments in recent periods to gaap financial measures to increase period-to-period comparability following actions to strengthen our overall financial position and how we manage our business.
in addition, management recognizes that certain non-gaap terms may be interpreted differently by other companies under different circumstances. in various sections of this report we have made reference to the following non-gaap financial measures in describing our (1) revenues, specifically ge industrial organic revenues by segment; biopharma organic revenues, ge industrial organic revenues, and ge industrial equipment and services organic revenues (2) profit, specifically ge industrial organic profit and profit margin by segment; biopharma organic profit and profit margin, adjusted ge industrial profit and profit margin (excluding certain items); adjusted ge industrial organic profit and profit margin; adjusted earnings (loss); and adjusted earnings (loss) per share (eps), and (3) debt balances, specifically ge industrial net debt. the reasons we use these non-gaap financial measures and the reconciliations to their most directly comparable gaap financial measures follow.

(a) earnings for per-share calculation includes allocation of participating securities pursuant to the two-class method. see note 18 for further information. earnings-per-share amounts are computed independently. as a result, the sum of per-share amounts may not equal the total.
(b) see the corporate items and eliminations section for further information.
the service cost for our pension and other benefit plans are included in adjusted earnings*, which represents the ongoing cost of providing pension benefits to our employees. the components of non-operating benefit costs are mainly driven by capital allocation decisions and market performance. we believe the retained costs in adjusted earnings* and adjusted eps* provides management and investors a useful measure to evaluate the performance of the total company and increases period-to-period comparability. we also use adjusted eps* as a performance metric at the company level for our annual executive incentive plan for 2020. we believe presenting adjusted industrial earnings* and adjusted industrial eps* separately for our financial services businesses also provides management and investors with useful information about the relative size of our industrial and financial services businesses in relation to the total company.

management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (md&a). the consolidated financial statements of general electric company combine the industrial manufacturing and services businesses of ge industrial with the financial services businesses of ge capital and are prepared in conformity with u.s. generally accepted accounting principles (gaap). unless otherwise noted, tables are presented in u.s. dollars in millions. certain columns and rows within tables may not add due to the use of rounded numbers. percentages presented in this report are calculated from the underlying numbers in millions.
discussions throughout this md&a are based on continuing operations unless otherwise noted. results for the years ended december 31, 2020 versus 2019 are discussed within this report. refer to our annual report on form 10-k for the year ended december 31, 2019 for discussions of results for the years ended december 31, 2019 versus 2018. the md&a should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes to the consolidated financial statements. for purposes of the financial statement display of sales and costs of sales in our consolidated statement of earnings (loss), "goods" is required by sec regulations to include all sales of tangible products, and "services" must include all other sales, including other services activities. in our md&a section of this report, we refer to sales under product services agreements and sales of both goods (such as spare parts and equipment upgrades) and related services (such as monitoring, maintenance and repairs) as sales of "services," which is an important part of our operations.
effective december 31, 2020, in order to enhance our financial statement presentation, we voluntarily made the following reporting changes for all periods presented:
•changed our presentation of ge industrial restructuring program costs. previously these costs were recorded within corporate items and eliminations. now these costs are recorded within segment profit, except for significant, higher-cost programs that continue to be recorded within corporate items and eliminations. this change better aligns restructuring expense with cash spend at the segments, driving accountability in both managing costs and benefits;
•changed the presentation of our statement of financial position to reflect the classification of assets and liabilities into current and non-current and revised the definition of operating working capital in our statement of cash flows, to drive increased transparency to operational drivers for near- and long-term cash needs and enhanced linkage to free cash flows metrics;
•began presenting research and development (r&d) expenses separately as part of costs and expenses in our consolidated statement of earnings (loss) to provide increased transparency to r&d spend and trends as part of ge's total investment in innovation. these costs were previously reported in costs of goods and services sold; and
•ceased reporting ge capital as an equity method investment within the ge industrial column. this change simplified reporting for ge industrial and has no impact on the ge capital or consolidated columns. consistent with our historical practice, all commercial transactions between ge industrial and ge capital continue to be reported on arms-length terms and are eliminated upon consolidation.
we believe investors will gain a better understanding of our company if they understand how we measure and talk about our results. because of the diversity in our businesses, we present our financial statements in a three-column format, which allows investors to see our industrial operations separately from our financial services operations. we believe that this provides useful information to investors. when used in this report, unless otherwise indicated by the context, we use these terms to mean the following:
•consolidated - the adding together of ge industrial and ge capital, giving effect to the elimination of transactions between the two. we present consolidated results in the left-side column of our consolidated statements of earnings (loss), financial position and cash flows.
•ge industrial - the adding together of all industrial affiliates, giving effect to the elimination of transactions among such affiliates. any intercompany profits resulting from transactions between ge industrial and ge capital are eliminated at the ge industrial level. we present the results of ge industrial in the center column of our consolidated statements of earnings (loss), financial position and cash flows.
•ge capital - the adding together of all affiliates of ge capital giving effect to the elimination of transactions among such affiliates. we present the results of ge capital in the right-side column of our consolidated statements of earnings (loss), financial position and cash flows.
in the accompanying analysis of financial information, we sometimes use information derived from consolidated financial data but not presented in our financial statements prepared in accordance with gaap. certain of these data are considered "non-gaap financial measures" under sec rules. see the non-gaap financial measures section for the reasons we use these non-gaap financial measures and the reconciliations to their most directly comparable gaap financial measures.
2020 significant developments. coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) pandemic. the covid-19 pandemic has impacted global economies, resulting in workforce and travel restrictions, supply chain and production disruptions and reduced demand and spending across many sectors. since the latter part of the first quarter of 2020, these factors have had a material adverse impact on our operations and financial performance, as well as on the operations and financial performance of many of the customers and suppliers in industries that we serve. this section provides a brief overview of how we have been responding to current and potential impacts related to covid-19 on ge's operations and financial condition and results, with additional details provided throughout the md&a and other relevant sections of this report.
during 2020, we adopted operational and governance rhythms across the company, and with our board of directors, to coordinate and oversee actions related to the covid-19 pandemic, including an internal task force to protect the health and safety of our employees globally and maintain business continuity; the assessment of financial and operating impacts, financial planning and mitigating cost, cash, and other actions in response; funding and liquidity management and related treasury actions; enterprise risk management and other functional activities across our global commercial, supply chain, human resources, controllership, government affairs, and other organizations. in particular, we took a series of actions to enhance and extend our liquidity at both ge and ge capital (as described under "liability management and deleveraging actions" below), and we continue to evaluate market conditions as they evolve and take precautionary measures to strengthen our financial position. we ended the year with $36.6 billion of consolidated cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash, in addition to our available credit lines of $20.2 billion. see the capital resources and liquidity section for further information.
while factors related directly and indirectly to the covid-19 pandemic have been impacting operations and financial performance at varying levels across all our businesses, the most significant impact to date has been at our aviation segment and our ge capital aviation services (gecas) aircraft leasing business within our capital segment. the pandemic has had and continues to have a material adverse effect on the global airline industry, resulting in reduced flight schedules worldwide, an increased number of idle aircraft, lower utilization, workforce reductions and declining financial performance within the airline industry. this has decreased demand for higher margin service revenues within our aviation segment directly impacting our profitability and cash flows during 2020. our healthcare segment experienced increased demand for certain types of products and services, including ventilators, monitoring solutions, x-ray, anesthesia and point-of-care ultrasound product lines, partially offset by decreased demand in other parts of the business as patients have postponed certain procedures and hospitals have deferred spending. our other businesses were also adversely impacted by market developments, including delays or cancellations of new projects, new orders and related down payments. in addition, workplace, travel and supply chain disruptions have caused delays of deliveries and the achievement of other billing milestones directly impacting our profitability and cash flows for the year ended december 31, 2020. we anticipate many of these impacts related to demand, profitability and cash flows will continue in future periods depending on the severity and duration of the pandemic. for additional details about impacts related to aviation and gecas, healthcare and our other businesses, refer to the respective segment sections within md&a.
each of ge's businesses and corporate are taking cost and cash actions to manage risk and proactively mitigate the financial impact from covid-19, as supply and demand dynamics continue to shift. in 2020, we executed more than $2 billion in operational cost reduction and more than $3 billion in cash preservation actions across the company, including more than $1 billion in operational cost reduction and more than $2 billion in cash preservation actions at aviation, to right-size its cost structure and preserve its ability to serve customers.
the ultimate impact of the covid-19 pandemic on our operations and financial performance, and on those of customers and suppliers in industries that we serve, depends on many factors that are not within our control, including the severity and duration of the pandemic; governmental, business and individuals' actions in response to the pandemic; and the development, availability and public acceptance of effective treatments or vaccines. see the risk factors section for further information about related risks and uncertainties.
biopharma. on march 31, 2020, we completed the sale of our biopharma business within our healthcare segment to danaher corporation for consideration of $21.1 billion, and recognized a pre-tax gain of $12.4 billion. see the segment operations - healthcare section and note 2 for further information.
asset impairments. in the third quarter of 2020, we recognized non-cash pre-tax impairment charges of $0.4 billion related to property, plant and equipment and intangible assets at our steam business within our power segment due to our recent announcement to exit the new build coal power market. we will continue to monitor the operating results and cash flow forecasts for the remaining business. in the second quarter of 2020, we recognized a non-cash pre-tax impairment charge of $0.9 billion related to goodwill at our additive reporting unit within our aviation segment. the steam and additive charges were recorded within earnings from continuing operations at corporate. in the second quarter of 2020, we recognized a non-cash pre-tax impairment charge of $0.8 billion related to goodwill in our gecas reporting unit within our capital segment. in the year ended december 31, 2020, we recognized non-cash pre-tax impairments of $0.5 billion on our gecas leasing portfolio. see segment operations - capital and notes 7 and 8 for further information.
liability management and deleveraging actions. we reduced our consolidated borrowings by $15.8 billion in 2020, driven primarily by debt tenders at ge industrial and ge capital of $4.2 billion and $11.9 billion, respectively, ge capital maturities of $10.5 billion, and repayment of ge industrial commercial paper of $3.0 billion, partially offset by new debt issuances at ge industrial and ge capital of $7.5 billion and $6.0 billion, respectively. ge industrial net debt* ended at $32.3 billion at december 31, 2020, down $15.5 billion from december 31, 2019, primarily driven by lower debt, a higher cash balance, and pension pre-funding of $2.5 billion in the fourth quarter of 2020. see the borrowings section of capital resources and liquidity and note 11 for further information.
sec settlement. as previously reported on december 9, 2020, ge reached a settlement with the sec that concluded and resolved the sec's investigation of ge in its entirety. under the settlement, among other terms, ge paid a civil penalty of $0.2 billion in december 2020, of which $0.1 billion was recorded at corporate and $0.1 billion was recorded at ge capital. see note 23 for further information.
summary of 2020 results. consolidated revenues were $79.6 billion, down $15.6 billion (16%) for the year primarily driven by decreased ge industrial revenues of $14.6 billion and decreased ge capital revenues of $1.5 billion. ge industrial organic revenues* were $73.2 billion, down $10.9 billion (13%) driven by our aviation and power segments, partially offset by our healthcare and renewable energy segments.
continuing earnings per share was $0.59. excluding gains (losses) on business dispositions, non-operating benefit costs, unrealized gains (losses) on investments, goodwill impairments, restructuring and other charges, steam asset impairments, debt extinguishment costs, the sec settlement, and u.s. tax reform, adjusted earnings per share* was $0.01.
for the year ended december 31, 2020, ge industrial profit was $7.3 billion and profit margins were 10.0%, up $5.5 billion, driven by the gain on the sale of our biopharma business of $12.4 billion, lower interest and other financial charges of $0.8 billion, decreased goodwill impairments of $0.6 billion, decreased non-operating benefit cost of $0.4 billion and lower charges for significant, higher-cost restructuring programs of $0.2 billion, partially offset by decreases at our industrial segments, an increase of $2.8 billion in losses on our investment in baker hughes, impairment charges of $0.4 billion related to property, plant and equipment and intangible assets at our steam business, and the sec settlement charges. adjusted ge industrial organic profit* decreased $4.7 billion, primarily as a result of the impacts of covid-19, particularly at our aviation segment, partially offset by an increase at healthcare.
ge industrial cash flows from (used for) operating activities (cfoa) of continuing operations were $(1.3) billion and $4.6 billion for the years ended december 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. ge industrial cfoa decreased primarily due to lower net income, largely as a result of covid-19 impacts, ge pension plan contributions of $2.5 billion in 2020 and higher cash paid for taxes, partially offset by lower cash used for operating working capital. ge industrial free cash flows (fcf)* were $0.6 billion and $2.3 billion for the years ended december 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. ge industrial fcf* decreased primarily due to lower net income, partially offset by lower cash used for operating working capital and a decrease in additions to property, plant and equipment and internal-use software. see the capital resources and liquidity - statement of cash flows section for further information.
orders are contractual commitments with customers to provide specified goods or services for an agreed upon price. backlog is unfilled customer orders for products and product services (expected life of contract sales for product services).
services                      35,137          45,303          45,523
for the year ended december 31, 2020, orders decreased $18.3 billion (20%) on a reported basis and decreased $14.8 billion (17%) organically, with decreases at aviation, primarily driven by declines in both commercial equipment and service orders due to covid-19 and the 737 max grounding; at power primarily driven by a decrease in equipment orders; and at renewable energy primarily due to a decrease in services orders; partially offset by an increase at healthcare. equipment orders were down $5.0 billion (12%) organically and services orders were down $9.8 billion (22%) organically. excluding biopharma, orders decreased $15.0 billion (17%) organically.
services                          313,234           325,605           273,499
(a) backlog as of december 31, 2020 excludes the biopharma business due to its disposition in the first quarter of 2020. backlog as of december 31, 2019 and 2018 included $1,247 million and $905 million, respectively, related to biopharma.
as of december 31, 2020, backlog decreased $18.1 billion (4%) from the prior year primarily driven by aviation due to a reduction in our commercial services backlog and cancellations of commercial equipment orders. the reduction in commercial services reflects lower anticipated engine utilization, the cancellation of equipment unit orders, customer fleet restructuring and contract modifications. power decreased due to sales outpacing new orders; healthcare decreased with the disposition of the biopharma business of $1.2 billion; and renewable energy increased due to new orders outpacing sales. excluding the biopharma disposition, backlog decreased $16.8 billion (4%) from december 31, 2019.
remaining performance obligation (rpo), a defined term under gaap, is backlog excluding any purchase order that provides the customer with the ability to cancel or terminate without incurring a substantive penalty, even if the likelihood of cancellation is remote based on historical experience. we plan to continue reporting backlog as we believe that it is a useful metric for investors, given its relevance to total orders. see note 25 for further information.

adjustments                               (27,294)           (128,626)          (155,921)
remaining performance obligation           $45,991            $184,608           $230,600
adjustments to reported backlog of $155.9 billion as of december 31, 2020 are largely driven by adjustments of $146.3 billion in our aviation segment: (1) backlog includes engine contracts for which we have received purchase orders that are cancelable; (2) our services backlog includes contracts that are cancelable without substantive penalty, primarily time and materials contracts; (3) backlog includes engines contracted under long-term service agreements, even if the engines have not yet been put into service. these adjustments to reported backlog to the extent realized are generally expected to be satisfied beyond one year.
services                         35,480         44,639          45,359
ge capital revenues              $7,245         $8,741          $9,551
for the year ended december 31, 2020, consolidated revenues decreased $15.6 billion (16%), primarily driven by decreased industrial revenues of $14.6 billion and decreased ge capital revenues of $1.5 billion.
ge industrial revenues decreased $14.6 billion (17%), with decreases in services and equipment. the decrease in services was primarily at aviation, driven by lower commercial spare part shipments, decreased shop visits and the cumulative impact of changes in billing and cost assumptions in our long-term service agreements; and at power, due to declines in transactional part sales and upgrades at gas power. the decrease in equipment was primarily at aviation, due to fewer commercial install and spare engine unit shipments; and at healthcare, due to the disposition of the biopharma business; partially offset by increases at renewable energy, primarily from onshore wind with more wind turbine shipments than in the prior year, and offshore wind; and at gas power, due to an increase in heavy-duty gas turbine unit shipments. this decrease included the net effects of dispositions of $3.6 billion and the effects of a stronger u.s. dollar of $0.3 billion. excluding the effects of acquisitions, dispositions and foreign currency, ge industrial organic revenues* decreased $10.9 billion (13%), with a decrease in services revenues of $8.8 billion (20%) and a decrease in equipment revenues of $2.1 billion (5%). ge industrial organic revenues* decreased at aviation and power, partially offset by increases at healthcare and renewable energy. excluding the biopharma disposition, ge industrial organic revenues* decreased $10.9 billion (13%).
ge capital revenues decreased $1.5 billion (17%), as a result of volume declines and lower gains. these volume declines were primarily at gecas related to lower interest income attributable to the sale of pk airfinance and lower rental revenue on our aircraft leasing portfolio, and at working capital solutions (wcs) related to lower purchases of ge industrial customer receivables and the run-off of the ge capital supply chain finance program (see ge industrial working capital transactions within md&a for further information).
for the year ended december 31, 2020, consolidated continuing earnings increased $5.4 billion, due to increased ge industrial profit of $5.5 billion and decreased provision for ge industrial income taxes of $0.9 billion, partially offset by an increase in ge capital losses of $1.2 billion.
ge industrial profit increased $5.5 billion driven primarily by the gain on the sale of our biopharma business of $12.4 billion, lower interest and other financial charges of $0.8 billion, decreased goodwill impairments of $0.6 billion, decreased non-operating benefit cost of $0.4 billion and lower charges for significant, higher-cost restructuring programs of $0.2 billion; partially offset by decreases at our industrial segments, an increase of $2.8 billion in losses on our investment in baker hughes, impairment charges of $0.4 billion related to property, plant and equipment and intangible assets at our steam business, and the sec settlement charges. ge industrial profit margin was 10.0%, an increase of 790 basis points, primarily due to the same net increases as described above. adjusted ge industrial profit* was $2.5 billion, a decrease of 65% organically*, primarily due to a decrease at our aviation segment, partially offset by an increase at healthcare and a decrease in adjusted corporate operating costs*. adjusted ge industrial profit margin* was 3.4%, a decrease of 520 basis points organically*, primarily due to the same net decreases as described above. at aviation, the primary drivers were lower volume on commercial spare part and commercial spare engine shipments, decreased shop visits and net unfavorable changes of $1.1 billion to the estimated profitability in its long-term service agreements. at healthcare, the primary drivers were cost reductions and increased demand for healthcare systems (hcs) products used directly in response to covid-19, partially offset by decreases in pharmaceutical diagnostics (pdx) volume.
ge capital continuing losses increased $1.2 billion primarily due to an impairment of goodwill of $0.8 billion (pre-tax), volume declines, higher mark-to-market effects and other impairments, including $0.5 billion (pre-tax) on the gecas fixed-wing aircraft portfolio as a result of covid-19 and related market impacts, lower gains, debt tender costs, the sec settlement charge and the nonrecurrence of a 2019 tax reform enactment adjustment. these increased losses were partially offset by the nonrecurrence of a $1.0 billion pre-tax charge identified through the completion of our 2019 annual insurance premium deficiency review, higher tax benefits including the tax benefit related to the biopharma sale and lower excess interest cost. gains were $0.4 billion and $0.7 billion in 2020 and 2019, respectively.
aviation and gecas 737 max. aviation develops, produces, and sells leap aircraft engines to boeing, airbus and comac through cfm international (cfm), a company jointly owned by ge and safran aircraft engines, a subsidiary of the safran group of france. the leap-1b engine is the exclusive engine for the boeing 737 max. in march 2019, global regulatory authorities ordered a temporary fleet grounding of the boeing 737 max. in may 2020, boeing resumed production of the 737 max. in november 2020, the u.s. federal aviation administration (faa) lifted the grounding notice for the 737 max and boeing commenced aircraft deliveries to customers in compliance with faa regulatory requirements in december 2020. a number of other global regulators since the faa's action have also lifted the orders that suspended 737 max operations for airlines under their jurisdictions. aviation commercial equipment backlog as of december 31, 2020 includes approximately 9,600 leap engines, including the impact of approximately 1,500 leap-1b unit order cancellations in 2020. see the segment operations - aviation section for further information. during 2020, cfm and boeing reached an agreement to align production rates for 2020 and secure payment terms for engines delivered in 2019 and 2020. in 2020, aviation received payments, net of progress collections, of $0.5 billion for engines delivered in 2019. a final payment of $0.2 billion, net of progress collections, is expected to be received in the first quarter of 2021 for engines delivered in 2019. cfm and boeing continue to work closely to ensure a successful reentry into service, with a strong commitment to safety while navigating industry disruption.
during 2020, gecas agreed with boeing to restructure its 737 max orderbook including previously canceled positions, resulting in 77 orders now remaining. as of december 31, 2020, gecas owned 29 of these aircraft, 26 of which are contracted for lease to airlines that remain obligated to make contractual rental payments. in addition, gecas has made pre-delivery payments to boeing related to 77 of these aircraft on order and has made financing commitments to acquire a further 16 aircraft under purchase and leaseback contracts with airlines.
as of december 31, 2020, we have approximately $1.7 billion of net assets ($3.2 billion of assets and $1.5 billion of liabilities) related to the 737 max program that primarily comprised aviation accounts receivable offset by progress collections and gecas pre-delivery payments and owned aircraft subject to lease. no impairment charges were incurred related to the 737 max aircraft and related balances, as we continue to believe these assets are recoverable over their contractual or useful lives. we continue to monitor 737 max return to service and return to delivery developments with our airline customers, lessees and boeing.
segment operations. segment revenues include sales of products and services by the segment. industrial segment profit is determined based on performance measures used by our chief operating decision maker (codm), who is our chief executive officer (ceo), to assess the performance of each business in a given period. in connection with that assessment, the ceo may exclude matters, such as charges for impairments, significant, higher-cost restructuring programs, manufacturing footprint rationalization and other similar expenses, acquisition costs and other related charges, certain gains and losses from acquisitions or dispositions, and certain litigation settlements. see the corporate items and eliminations section for additional information about costs excluded from segment profit.
segment profit excludes results reported as discontinued operations and the portion of earnings or loss attributable to noncontrolling interests of consolidated subsidiaries, and as such only includes the portion of earnings or loss attributable to our share of the consolidated earnings or loss of consolidated subsidiaries.
interest and other financial charges, income taxes and non-operating benefit costs are excluded in determining segment profit for the industrial segments. interest and other financial charges, income taxes, non-operating benefit costs and ge capital preferred stock dividends are included in determining segment profit (which we sometimes refer to as net earnings) for the capital segment. other income is included in segment profit for the industrial segments.
certain corporate costs, such as those related to shared services, employee benefits, and information technology, are allocated to our segments based on usage. a portion of the remaining corporate costs is allocated based on each segment's relative net cost of operations.

competition & regulation. worldwide competition for power generation products and services is intense. demand for power generation is global, and as a result, is sensitive to the economic and political environments of each country in which we do business. our products and services sold to end customers are often subject to many regulatory requirements and performance standards under different federal, state, foreign and energy industry standards.
significant trends & developments. we continue to execute for our customers through covid-19, prioritizing safety first and foremost. from an operations perspective, we are working within our supply chain and with our suppliers to catch up on parts and project scope that were delayed as a result of covid-19. despite difficult travel and customer site restrictions, we continue to service our customers' installed base and have completed roughly 90% of all planned outages in the year. from a market perspective, both gas-based electricity generation and ge gas turbine utilization has remained stable. our ability to close transactions, particularly services parts & upgrades, has been impacted by constrained customer budgets and access to financing due to oil prices and economic slowdown, especially in gas power. although there may be market challenges in the near term, we believe gas will play a critical role in the energy transition and our view of the market has not materially changed, albeit timing on new orders is harder to forecast.
power continues to right size its business to better align with market demand and drive its businesses with an operational rigor and discipline that is focused on its customers' lifecycle experience. in gas power, we continue to size the business for a 25-30 gw market, although acknowledge that the size any given year can vary. we remain focused on our underwriting discipline and risk management to ensure we are securing deals that meet our financial hurdles and we have a high confidence to deliver for our customers.
looking ahead, we anticipate the power market to continue to be impacted by overcapacity in the industry, continued price pressure from competition on servicing the installed base, and the uncertain timing of deal closures due to financing and the complexities of working in emerging markets. market factors related to the energy transition such as greater renewable energy penetration and the adoption of climate change-related policies continue to impact long-term demand, to differing degrees across markets globally. as such, we announced in the third quarter of 2020 that we will be exiting the new build coal power market, while continuing to service our customers' installed base.
we continue to invest in new product development, such as our ha-turbines, and upgrades as these are critical to our customers and the long-term strategy of the business. in 2020, we supplied the first purpose-built hydrogen-burning power plant in the u.s. with gas power's 7ha.02 turbine. our fundamentals remain strong with approximately $80 billion in backlog and a gas turbine installed base greater than 7,000 units, including approximately 1,800 units under long-term service agreements.

for the year ended december 31, 2020, segment orders were down $0.9 billion (5%), segment revenues were down $1.0 billion (6%) and segment profit was down 6%.
backlog as of december 31, 2020 decreased $5.7 billion (7%) from december 31, 2019, primarily driven by sales outpacing new orders.
orders decreased $0.8 billion (4%) organically, primarily due to decreases in gas power heavy-duty gas turbine unit and services orders and steam equipment orders.
revenues decreased $0.9 billion (5%) organically*, primarily due to decreases in gas power services revenues, primarily related to decreases in transactional part sales and upgrades, partially offset by increases in gas power equipment revenues related to 13 more heavy-duty gas turbine unit shipments. steam equipment and service revenues also decreased.
profit decreased 7% organically* due to lower revenues, charges of approximately $0.3 billion related to an under-performing jv in china, charges related to contracts, a charge for a specific customer credit event at gas power, and a quality reserve at power portfolio on the legacy product line that we have since exited in power conversion, partially offset by continued efforts to right size the business across gas power and power portfolio.

hybrid solutions - provides reliable, affordable and dispatchable integration of renewable energies that drive vital stability to the grid and includes unique applications to integrate storage and renewable energy generation sources, such as wind, hydropower and solar.
competition & regulation. while many factors, including government incentives and specific market rules, affect how renewable energy can deliver outcomes for customers in a given region, renewable energy is increasingly able to compete with fossil fuels in terms of levelized cost of electricity. however, continued competitive pressure from other wind and hydro turbine manufacturers as well as from other energy sources, such as solar photovoltaic, reinforced by a general move to electricity auction mechanisms, has driven price pressure and the need for innovation.
we continue to invest in generating wind turbine product improvements, including larger rotors, taller towers and higher nameplate ratings that continue to drive down the cost of wind energy, and in exploring new ways to further improve the efficiency and flexibility of our hydropower technology with new innovative turbine designs and digital solutions. as industry models continue to evolve, our digital strategy and investments in technical innovation will position us to add value for customers looking for clean, renewable energy.
significant trends & developments. renewable energy is in a rapid transition period and competes in the marketplace against existing and new conventional energy sources. wind energy is currently the second-largest contributor to renewable capacity growth with hydropower projected to remain the largest renewable electricity source through 2023.
we continue to observe growth across the global onshore wind market together with a positive impact on deliveries and installations in the u.s. from the production tax credit (ptc) cycle and customer preference shifting to larger, more efficient units to drive down costs and compete with other power generation options. despite the competitive nature of the market, onshore wind order pricing has stabilized globally. several energy-related tax credit extensions were passed into law in december 2020 further extending the phase-down of u.s. ptcs. under the current legislation, onshore wind projects that begin construction in 2021 will also qualify for a 60% ptc. we expect high levels of production observed in 2020 to continue for 2021 deliveries at onshore wind and are closely monitoring our execution during this period.
additionally, offshore wind projects that begin construction before 2026 are eligible to elect either the ptc or the investment tax credit (itc), with the itc extended by five years at the full rate. we have received full certification for our haliade-x 12- and 13mw prototypes and during the fourth quarter of 2020 reported orders within offshore wind for the supply of 95 haliade-x 13mw units for the first phase of the dogger bank wind farm in the u.k.
new product introductions remain important to our onshore and offshore customers who are demonstrating the willingness to adopt the new technology of larger turbines that decrease the levelized cost of energy. during 2020, we delivered our first onshore 5mw cypress units and have reported more than 600 of these units in backlog. we have observed significant market demand for our offshore haliade-x units and based on existing customer commitments, expect to report additional orders and backlog for the next two phases of dogger bank and for offshore projects in the u.s. upon obtaining final notification to proceed. we are preparing for large scale production of haliade-x in response to this market demand.
the grid market remains challenging as we continue to experience pricing pressure in the high voltage direct current (hvdc) and high voltage (hv) product lines. the hydropower industry continues to maximize value and grid flexibility with refurbishments, repower and pumped storage projects to support both wind and solar expansion. the grid and hydro businesses are executing their turnaround plans and we are expecting improved operating results in 2021.
despite the covid-19 pandemic, we have continued to deliver for our customers, while taking all necessary precautions for our employees, and returned our manufacturing locations and long-term project sites to pre-covid-19 capacity levels and operations. while we do not believe the long-term outlook for renewable energy products and services has materially changed, we are monitoring the impact of the pandemic on the renewable energy industry, including electricity consumption forecasts and customer capital expenditure levels, supply chain, availability of financing and our ability to execute on equipment and long-term projects, including the impact of possible customer related delays. in response to volume declines in certain of our businesses, we implemented additional cost reduction measures, restructuring and cash preservation actions.

for the year ended december 31, 2020, segment orders were down $0.6 billion (3%), segment revenues were up $0.3 billion (2%) and segment profit was up $0.1 billion (10%).
backlog as of december 31, 2020 increased $2.5 billion (9%) from december 31, 2019, primarily from offshore wind due to our first haliade-x order from dogger bank wind farm, new cypress platform orders mainly in onshore wind europe and an increase in hydro. these increases were partially offset by sales exceeding new orders at grid, primarily as a result of increased commercial selectivity in certain product lines.
orders decreased $0.4 billion (3%) organically, primarily due to lower onshore wind turbine and repower unit orders in north america compared to the prior year due to the ptc phase down and lower orders at grid. these decreases were partially offset by increased orders at offshore wind of haliade-x, other regions of onshore wind, lm wind, hybrid solutions and hydro.
revenues increased $0.6 billion (4%) organically*, primarily from onshore wind with 300 more wind turbine shipments on a unit basis, and 13% more on a megawatt basis, and at offshore wind and hybrid solutions compared to the prior year. these increases were partially offset by lower grid revenues, primarily attributable to lower volumes in the power transformer product line, and lower hydro revenues.
profit increased $0.1 billion (6%) organically*, as the impact of higher sales volume at onshore wind, the favorable impact of cost reduction measures and improved project execution exceeded higher restructuring costs and the nonrecurrence of a $0.1 billion non-cash gain from the termination of two offshore wind contracts in 2019.

competition & regulation. the global businesses for aircraft jet engines, maintenance, component repair and overhaul services (including parts sales) are highly competitive. both domestic and international markets are important to the growth and success of the business. product development cycles are long and product quality and efficiency are critical to success. research and development expenditures are important in this business, as are focused intellectual property strategies and protection of key aircraft engine design, manufacture, repair and product upgrade technologies. aircraft engine and systems orders tend to follow civil air travel and demand and military procurement cycles.
our product, services and activities are subject to a number of global regulators such as the u.s. federal aviation administration (faa), european union aviation safety agency (easa), civil aviation administration of china (caac) and other regulatory bodies.
significant trends & developments. the global covid-19 pandemic continues to have a material adverse effect on the global airline industry. a key underlying driver of aviation's commercial engine and services businesses is global commercial air traffic, which in turn is driven by economic activity and consumer and business propensity to travel. since the beginning of the pandemic in the first quarter of 2020, we have seen varied levels of recovery in global markets. government travel restrictions, public health advisories, individuals' propensity to travel and continued cases of the virus have all impacted the level of air travel. due to the global airline industry contraction, aviation's airline and airframe customers are taking measures to address reduced demand, which, in turn, continue to materially impact aviation's business operations and financial performance. as a result, our long-term service agreement billings decreased approximately 19% from the prior year, partially mitigated by customer billings for contract terminations, modifications and annual contractual minimum engine flight hours. aviation is closely monitoring government actions and economic and industry forecasts, although such forecasts continue to evolve and reflect the uncertainty about the severity and duration of the decline in commercial air traffic. aviation regularly tracks global departures, which as of december 31, 2020, were approximately 40% below the pre-covid-19 baseline. more broadly, we are in frequent dialogue with our airline and airframe customers about the outlook for commercial air travel, new aircraft production, and after-market services. given the current trend, we expect domestic travel routes primarily served by narrowbody aircraft to recover before long-haul, international travel routes which are primarily served by widebody aircraft. we continue to expect the engine aftermarket recovery to lag departure trends across regions and fleets, which would result in long-term service agreement billings and cash to recover prior to associated revenues and profits. consistent with industry projections, aviation continues to estimate the duration of the market recovery to be prolonged over multiple years dependent on containing the spread of the virus, effective inoculation programs and government collaboration to encourage travel, particularly around quarantine requirements.
aviation has taken several business actions to respond to the current adverse environment, including a reduction of approximately 25% of its total global workforce. for the year ended december 31, 2020, aviation realized more than $1 billion in operational cost reduction and $2 billion in cash preservation actions, including a headcount reduction of over 11,000 employees. aviation expects to realize cost and cash savings in 2021 as a result of the actions taken in 2020 and further initiatives in 2021. the business is actively monitoring the pace of demand recovery to ensure the business is appropriately sized for the future. in addition, we continue to partner with our airline and leasing customers and are working closely with our airframe partners to align production rates for 2021 and beyond.
aviation's operational and financial performance is impacted by commercial air traffic, shop visit and spare part demand, fleet retirements, and demand for new aircraft. we monitor and forecast each of these factors as part of aviation's long-term planning process, which may result in additional business restructuring actions. given the uncertainty related to the severity and length of the global covid-19 pandemic and the impact on these factors across the aviation sector and specific customers, aviation could be required to record charges, impairments, or other adverse financial impacts in future periods if actual results differ significantly from aviation's current estimates.
as it relates to the military environment, aviation continues to forecast strong military demand creating future growth opportunities for our military business as the u.s. department of defense and foreign governments have continued flight operations, and have allocated budgets to upgrade and modernize their existing fleets. during 2020, aviation experienced supply chain execution challenges which resulted in fewer engine and spare part shipments than the prior year. the business is actively addressing these matters to enable future growth in military.
total engineering, comprised of company, customer and partner-funded and nonrecurring engineering costs, decreased compared to prior year in line with the changes in the commercial environment. for the year ended december 31, 2020, company-funded research and development spend decreased compared to 2019, and we expect the reduction to continue in line with the actions outlined above. however, customer and partner-funded engineering efforts, primarily in our military business, increased compared to the prior year. in september 2020, aviation announced it received certification from the faa for the ge9x engine, the world's largest and most powerful commercial aircraft engine.
aviation is taking actions to protect its ability to serve its customers now and as the global airline industry recovers. while its near-term focus remains on navigating the covid-19 pandemic, aviation's deep history of innovation and technology leadership, commercial engine installed base of approximately 37,700 units, military engine installed base of approximately 26,500 units, with approximately 12,500 units under long-term service agreements, and $260 billion backlog represents strong long-term fundamentals. aviation is taking actions to protect and strengthen its business and seeks to emerge from this crisis stronger and drive long-term cash and profitable growth over time.

(a)aviation segment revenues represent 30% and 27% of total industrial revenues and total segment revenues, respectively, for the year ended december 31, 2020.
(b)aviation segment profit represents 17% of total industrial profit for the year ended december 31, 2020.
(c)included restructuring charges of $26 million, $8 million and $12 million for the years ended december 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively, that were previously reported within the corporate segment and were reclassified into the aviation segment results in the fourth quarter of 2020 for all periods presented. for a summary of all restructuring charges by segment, see the other consolidated information section.
for the year ended december 31, 2020, segment orders were down $15.1 billion (41%), segment revenues were down $10.8 billion (33%) and segment profit was down $5.6 billion (82%).
backlog as of december 31, 2020 decreased $12.8 billion (5%) from december 31, 2019, primarily due to a reduction in our commercial services backlog and cancellations of commercial equipment orders, which included approximately 1,500 leap 1-b unit order cancellations and 22 ge9x unit order cancellations. the reduction to commercial services backlog reflects estimates of lower engine utilization, the partial cancellation of long-term service agreements related to the equipment unit order cancellations, and anticipated customer fleet restructuring and contract modifications. backlog adjustments could be necessary in future periods for additional cancellations of new commercial engine orders, fleet retirements, or changes to customer aircraft utilization and operating behavior.
orders decreased $14.8 billion (41%) organically, primarily driven by lower commercial equipment and service orders as airline customers have slowed or deferred new engine orders, as well as delayed maintenance and repair operations while existing fleets have lower utilization or been grounded. military orders increased 21% compared to the prior year primarily driven by equipment and new development orders.
revenues decreased $10.5 billion (32%) organically*. equipment revenues decreased, primarily due to 1,376 fewer commercial install and spare engine unit shipments, including 921 fewer leap units and 228 fewer cfm56 units versus the prior year, in part due to the 737 max grounding and production slowdown. commercial services revenues decreased, primarily due to lower commercial spare part shipments, decreased shop visits and the cumulative impact of changes in billing and cost assumptions in our long-term service agreements. military revenues increased primarily due to increased revenues on development contracts and engine shipment mix, partially offset by fewer engine and spare part shipments due to supply chain execution challenges.
profit decreased $5.6 billion (82%) organically*, primarily due to lower volume on commercial spare part and commercial spare engine shipments, and decreased shop visits in our service agreements. during the year ended december 31, 2020, aviation recorded expenses of $0.5 billion due to lower production volumes and initiated restructuring actions given decreases in demand primarily related to commercial engines. aviation also recorded pre-tax charges totaling $0.2 billion due to expected future losses related primarily to customer credit risk given the current environment. in addition, aviation recorded net unfavorable changes of $1.1 billion to the estimated profitability in its long-term service agreements. this decrease includes a $0.6 billion pre-tax charge to reflect the cumulative covid-19 pandemic-related impacts of changes to billing and cost assumptions for certain long-term service agreements, reflecting lower engine utilization, anticipated customer fleet restructuring and contract modifications as a result of current and forecasted market conditions. additional adjustments could occur in future periods and could be material for certain long-term service agreements if actual customer operating behavior differs significantly from aviation's current estimates.

competition & regulation. healthcare competes with a variety of u.s. and non-u.s. manufacturers and services providers. customers require products and services that allow them to provide better access to healthcare, improve the affordability of care and improve the quality of patient outcomes. key factors affecting competition include technological innovations, productivity solutions, competitive pricing and the ability to provide lifecycle services. new technologies and solutions could make our products and services obsolete unless we continue to develop new and improved offerings. our products are subject to regulation by numerous government agencies, as well as laws and regulations that apply to various reimbursement schemes or other government funded healthcare programs.
significant trends & developments. during the first half of 2020, there was an increase in demand for certain of our products that are highly correlated in response to the covid-19 pandemic, including ventilators, monitoring solutions, x-ray, anesthesia and point-of-care ultrasound product lines. however, we also saw reduction in demand and delays in procurement in other products and services that were not critical to the response efforts or where procedures could be postponed (magnetic resonance, contrast agents and nuclear tracers). we have experienced some moderation in covid-19 related demand in the second half of 2020 and have experienced some recovery in overall hospital spending, though this varies by market. the pandemic is still driving uncertainty in our markets globally, as well as additional supply chain and logistics costs, and we expect this to continue. we expect capital expenditures, particularly in private markets, to remain under pressure from revenue declines and cautious spending related to covid-19 impacts. in response to continuing near-term volatility and cost pressures, we have driven structural cost reduction and cash optimization actions that began in the first quarter of 2020.
the global healthcare market has continued to expand, driven by macro trends relating to growing and aging populations, increasing chronic and lifestyle-related diseases, accelerating demand for healthcare in emerging markets, and increasing use of diagnostic imaging. technological innovation that makes it possible to address an increasing number of diseases, conditions and patients in a more cost-effective manner has also driven growth across each of our global markets.
the healthcare systems (hcs) equipment market over the long term continues to expand at low single-digit rates or better, while demand continues for services on new equipment as well as on our existing installed base. however, there is short-term variation driven by market-specific political, environmental and economic cycles. there has been some moderation in tariffs in both u.s. and china, however, this is subject to changes in u.s.-china trade regulations. long-term growth in emerging markets is driven by trends of expanding demand and access to healthcare. developed markets are expected to remain steady in the near term driven by macro trends in the healthcare industry.
the pharmaceutical diagnostics (pdx) business is well positioned in the contrast agent and nuclear tracer markets. this market is expected to grow over the long-term, driven by continued diagnostic imaging procedure growth and increasing contrast and tracer-enhanced biomarkers of these same procedures, as these products help to increase the precision of the diagnostic information provided to clinicians. after we experienced reduced demand in the first half of 2020, we saw an increase in the second half of 2020 for pdx products as procedure volume increased.
we continue focusing on creating new products and digital solutions as well as expanding uses of existing offerings that are tailored to the different needs of our global customers. ge healthcare recently introduced the volusontm swift, an industry-first sono-automation tool, which leverages artificial intelligence to automatically identify fetal anatomy, enhancing workflow by more than 70%. in addition, we launched the next version of mural virtual care solution, which provides clinical decision support with a view of patients' status across a care area, hospital or system. we also completed the acquisition of prismatic sensors ab, which specializes in photon counting computed tomography (ct).

(a)healthcare segment revenues represent 25% and 22% of total industrial revenues and total segment revenues, respectively, for the year ended december 31, 2020.
(b)healthcare segment profit represents 42% of total industrial profit for the year ended december 31, 2020.
(c)included restructuring charges of $134 million, $159 million and $176 million for the years ended december 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively, that were previously reported within the corporate segment and were reclassified into the healthcare segment results in the fourth quarter of 2020 for all periods presented. for a summary of all restructuring charges by segment, see the other consolidated information section.
for the year ended december 31, 2020, segment orders were down $2.5 billion (12%), segment revenues were down $1.9 billion (10%) and segment profit was down $0.7 billion (18%).
backlog as of december 31, 2020 decreased $1.4 billion (7%) from december 31, 2019, primarily due to the biopharma disposition. excluding biopharma, backlog decreased $0.1 billion.
orders increased $0.3 billion (1%) organically, due to increases in demand for covid-19 related products, including a $0.3 billion order from the u.s. department of health and human services to deliver 50,000 ventilators in partnership with ford, partially offset by pdx. excluding biopharma, orders were up $0.1 billion organically.
revenues increased $0.7 billion (4%) organically*, driven by increased demand in hcs products used directly in response to covid-19, partially offset by reduced volume in pdx from a decrease in non-essential routine procedures. excluding biopharma, revenues increased $0.6 billion (4%) organically*.
profit increased $0.5 billion (17%) organically*, primarily due to cost reductions and increased demand for hcs products used directly in response to covid-19, partially offset by decreases in pdx volume. excluding biopharma, profits increased $0.4 billion (17%) organically*.
capital. capital is the financial services division of ge focused on customers and markets aligned with ge's industrial businesses across developed and emerging markets. we provide financial products and services around the globe that build on ge's industry specific expertise in aviation, power, renewables and other activities to capitalize on market-specific opportunities. while there are customer benefits and knowledge sharing advantages linking ge's industrial and capital businesses, the financial and operational relationships are maintained with arms-length terms as though the businesses were independent.
ge capital aviation services (gecas) - an aviation lessor and financier with over 50 years of experience. gecas provides a wide range of assets including narrow- or widebody aircraft, regional jets, turboprops, freighters, engines, helicopters, financing and materials. gecas offers a broad array of financing products and services on these assets including operating leases, sale-leasebacks, asset trading and servicing, and airframe parts management. gecas owns, services or has on order more than 1,600 aircraft and serves approximately 205 customers in 73 countries from a network of 15 offices around the world.
energy financial services (efs) - a global energy investor that provides financial solutions and underwriting capabilities for power and renewable energy to meet rising demand and sustainability imperatives.
working capital solutions (wcs) - provides working capital services primarily by purchasing ge industrial customer receivables.
insurance - refer to the other items - insurance section for a detailed business description.
competition & regulation. the businesses in which we engage are highly competitive and are subject to competition from various types of financial institutions including banks, investors, such as sovereign wealth funds, hedge funds and private equity investors, leasing companies, finance companies associated with manufacturers and insurance and reinsurance companies. for our gecas operations, competition is based on lease rate financing terms, aircraft delivery dates, condition and availability, as well as available capital demand for financing. for our efs operations, competition is primarily based on deal structure and terms. as we compete globally, efs' success is sensitive to project execution and merchant electricity prices, as well as the economic and political environment of each country in which we do business.
the businesses in which we engage are subject to a variety of u.s. federal and state laws and regulations. our insurance operations are regulated by the insurance departments in the states in which they are domiciled or licensed, with the kansas insurance department (kid) being our primary state regulator.
significant trends & developments. we continue to evaluate strategic options to accelerate the further reduction in the size of ge capital, some of which could result in material financial charges depending on the timing, negotiated terms and conditions of any ultimate arrangements.
at ge capital, the primary effect of the covid-19 pandemic pertains to its gecas business. the pandemic has led to worldwide reduction of flight schedules and it is difficult to predict its longer-term impact. additionally, the related market volatility resulted in higher credit spreads on the investment securities held by our run-off insurance business, which resulted in marks and impairments taken in the first quarter, which, starting in the second quarter more than recovered in 2020.
as of december 31, 2020, gecas owned 917 fixed-wing aircraft, of which 27 with a book value of $0.6 billion were available to lease to customers (aircraft on the ground). we test recoverability of each fixed-wing aircraft in our operating lease portfolio at least annually. additionally, we perform quarterly evaluations in circumstances such as when assets are re-leased or current lease terms have changed.
given the environment, we accelerated our review in the second quarter to focus on leases with higher risk of repossession based on our assessment of customer credit risk default and any unplaced leased assets rolling-off over the next 12 months, which represented approximately 20% of our fixed-wing aircraft operating lease portfolio. in addition, we performed our detailed annual portfolio review in the third quarter of 2020, which incorporated third-party appraisal data, updates to all cash flow assumptions as well as evolving market and customer dynamics that we are monitoring. these analyses resulted in pre-tax impairments of $0.5 billion in 2020, primarily on our fixed-wing aircraft operating lease portfolio. pre-tax impairments were $0.1 billion in 2019. the increase in pre-tax impairments was driven by declining cash flow projections of the future collectability of rents on aircraft and engines currently under contract related to market impacts resulting from the pandemic. continued deterioration in cash flow projections, including current rents, downtime, release rates and residual assumptions could result in future impairments in the operating lease portfolio.
based on the resulting pressure on its airline customers, gecas continues to work with customers on restructuring requests as they arise. as a result of these requests, we have executed agreements with customers to reschedule certain lease payments. as of december 31, 2020, we have a contractually deferred balance of $0.4 billion. in addition, we have invoiced $0.3 billion under these agreements and collected about 84%. we expect to continue to receive requests for rent deferrals and/or lease restructures from our global airline customers as a result of covid-19 and related market impacts. an extended disruption of regional or international travel could result in an increase in these types of requests in future periods, which could result in an increase to the trade receivable balance. as gecas evaluates future lease restructures, there is a risk of lease modifications that could have a material adverse effect on gecas operations, financial position and cash flows.
in october 2020, pacific investment management company (pimco), one of the world's premier fixed income investment managers, and gecas announced they had reached a preliminary agreement to develop an aviation leasing venture to support up to $3 billion in aircraft asset financings. pimco and gecas have executed certain of the definitive agreements and obtained relevant regulatory clearances for the venture.
we annually perform premium deficiency testing in the aggregate across our run-off insurance portfolio in the third quarter. as a result of the testing, we identified no premium deficiency. see the other items section and note 12 for further information.
ge capital received $2 billion of additional capital contributions from ge in the fourth quarter of 2020. see the capital resources and liquidity section for further information.
as previously mentioned, ge reached a settlement with the sec and paid a civil penalty of $0.2 billion in december 2020, of which $0.1 billion was recorded and paid at ge capital. see note 23 for further information.
ge capital debt to equity ratio        3.4:1       3.9:1
(a)    in the first quarter of 2020, the remaining industrial finance assets of $268 million were transferred to other continuing operations.
(b)    included cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash of $13,245 million as of december 31, 2020 and $17,618 million as of december 31, 2019.
total segment profit (loss)               $(1,710)          $(530)          $(489)
(a)    capital segment revenues represent 9% of total segment revenues for the year ended december 31, 2020.
(b)    other continuing operations primarily comprised excess interest costs from debt previously allocated to assets that have been sold as part of the ge capital exit plan, preferred stock dividend costs and interest costs not allocated to ge capital businesses, which are driven by ge capital's interest allocation process. interest costs are allocated to ge capital businesses based on the tenor of their assets using the market rate at the time of origination, which differs from the asset profile when the debt was originated. as a result, actual interest expense is higher than interest expense allocated to the remaining ge capital businesses. all preferred stock dividend costs have become a ge industrial obligation in january 2021. see note 16 for further information. in addition, we anticipate unallocated interest costs to gradually decline as debt matures and/or is refinanced.
capital revenues decreased $1.5 billion (17%), as a result of volume declines and lower gains. these volume declines were primarily at gecas related to lower interest income attributable to the sale of pk airfinance and lower rental revenue on our aircraft leasing portfolio, and at wcs related to lower purchases of ge industrial customer receivables and the run-off of the ge capital supply chain finance program (see ge industrial working capital transactions for further information). capital losses increased $1.2 billion, primarily due to an impairment of goodwill of $0.8 billion (pre-tax), volume declines, higher mark-to-market effects and other impairments, including $0.5 billion (pre-tax) on the gecas fixed-wing aircraft portfolio as a result of covid-19 and related market impacts, lower gains, debt tender costs, the sec settlement charge and the nonrecurrence of a 2019 tax reform enactment adjustment. these increased losses were partially offset by the nonrecurrence of a $1.0 billion pre-tax charge identified through the completion of our 2019 annual insurance premium deficiency review, higher tax benefits including the tax benefit related to the biopharma sale and lower excess interest cost. gains were $0.4 billion and $0.7 billion in 2020 and 2019, respectively, which primarily related to sales of certain gecas aircraft and engines resulting in gains of $0.2 billion and $0.4 billion in 2020 and 2019, respectively, and the sale of equity method investments resulting in gains of $0.1 billion and $0.2 billion in 2020 and 2019, respectively, at efs.
corporate items and eliminations. corporate items and eliminations is a caption used in the segment operations - summary of reportable segments table to reconcile the aggregated results of our segments to the consolidated results of the company. the corporate items and eliminations amounts related to revenues and earnings include the results of disposed businesses, certain amounts not included in industrial operating segment results because they are excluded from measurement of their operating performance for internal and external purposes and the elimination of intersegment activities. in addition, the corporate items and eliminations amounts related to earnings include certain costs of our principal retirement plans, significant, higher-cost restructuring programs and other costs reported in corporate.
corporate items and eliminations includes the results of our lighting segment, through its disposition in the second quarter of 2020, and ge digital business for all periods presented.

(a) included non-cash pre-tax impairment charges of $429 million, net of $65 million attributable to noncontrolling interests for the steam business within our power segment in 2020.
(b) ge reached a settlement with the sec and paid a civil penalty of $200 million in december 2020, of which $100 million was recorded and paid at corporate and $100 million was recorded and paid at ge capital.
(c) included non-cash pre-tax impairment charge of $877 million, net of $149 million attributable to noncontrolling interests for the additive reporting unit within our aviation segment in 2020.
adjusted total corporate operating costs* excludes gains (losses) on disposals and held for sale businesses, significant, higher-cost restructuring programs, unrealized gains (losses) and goodwill impairments. we believe that adjusting corporate costs to exclude the effects of items that are not closely associated with ongoing corporate operations provides management and investors with a meaningful measure that increases the period-to-period comparability of our ongoing corporate costs.
for the year ended december 31, 2020, revenues decreased by $0.6 billion, primarily as a result of a $0.5 billion decrease in revenues due to the sale of our current and lighting businesses in april 2019 and june 2020, respectively, and $0.1 billion of higher inter-segment eliminations. corporate costs decreased by $10.7 billion due to $12.5 billion of higher net gains, primarily driven by $12.4 billion of gains from the sale of our biopharma business in 2020. corporate costs also decreased by $0.8 billion due to $1.5 billion of goodwill impairment charges related to our renewable energy segment in 2019 as compared to $0.7 billion of net goodwill impairment charges related to our aviation segment in 2020. in addition, corporate costs decreased by $0.2 billion due to lower restructuring and other charges in 2020, primarily at corporate and power, partially offset by higher restructuring at aviation. these decreases were partially offset by $2.7 billion of higher net unrealized losses, primarily related to a $1.8 billion mark-to-market loss on our baker hughes shares and a $0.1 billion impairment on our ventures portfolio in 2020, as compared to a $0.8 billion mark-to-market gain on our baker hughes shares in 2019. corporate recognized $0.4 billion of non-cash impairment charges related to property, plant and equipment and intangible assets at our steam business within our power segment in 2020. in addition, corporate costs increased by $0.1 billion due to the settlement of the sec investigation in 2020.
adjusted total corporate operating costs* decreased by $0.4 billion in 2020 primarily as the result of $0.3 billion of cost reductions within our digital business and functions and $0.2 billion of lower costs primarily associated with existing ehs matters. overall, eliminations were relatively flat due to higher intercompany elimination activity from project financing investments associated with wind energy projects in our renewable energy segment and higher ge industrial inter-segment eliminations, offset by lower spare engine sales from our aviation segment to our gecas business.
costs and gains not included in segment results. as discussed in the segment operations section, certain amounts are not included in industrial segment results because they are excluded from measurement of their operating performance for internal and external purposes. these amounts relate primarily to significant, higher-cost restructuring programs, goodwill impairment charges and gains/(losses) on acquisition and disposition activities.

other consolidated information restructuring. restructuring actions are essential to our cost improvement efforts for both existing operations and those acquired. restructuring and other charges relate primarily to workforce reductions, facility exit costs associated with the consolidation of sales, service and manufacturing facilities, the integration of acquisitions, and certain other asset write-downs such as those associated with product line exits. we also recognize an obligation for severance benefits that vest or accumulate with service. we continue to closely monitor the economic environment and expect to undertake further restructuring actions to more closely align our cost structure with earnings goals. this table is inclusive of all restructuring charges in our segments.

total restructuring and other charges by business           $1,254          $1,343          $3,050
liabilities associated with restructuring activities were approximately $1.3 billion, $1.7 billion, and $2.6 billion, including actuarial determined post-employment severance benefits of $0.7 billion, $1.0 billion, and $1.6 billion as of december 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively.

the decrease in ge industrial interest and other financial charges for the year ended december 31, 2020 was driven primarily by lower interest on borrowings due to repayments of intercompany loans from ge capital and lower losses related to the completion of tender offers to purchase ge industrial senior notes (including fees and other costs associated with the tenders), and lower expenses on sales of ge industrial current receivables mainly driven by lower sales of receivables and lower benchmark interest rates. the primary components of ge industrial interest and other financial charges are interest on short- and long-term borrowings and financing costs on sales of receivables. total ge industrial interest and other financial charges of $0.9 billion and $1.3 billion were recorded at corporate and $0.5 billion and $0.8 billion were recorded by ge industrial segments for the years ended december 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.
the decrease in ge capital interest and other financial charges for the year ended december 31, 2020 was primarily due to lower average borrowings balances due to maturities and a decrease in average interest rates due to changes in market rates, partially offset by higher net interest on assumed debt resulting from a decrease in intercompany loans to ge industrial which bear the right of offset (see the borrowings section of capital resources and liquidity for an explanation of assumed debt and right-of-offset loans), and the $0.2 billion loss resulting from the completion of tender offers to purchase ge capital senior notes (including fees and other costs associated with the tenders). ge capital average borrowings were $55.8 billion, $61.8 billion and $78.7 billion in 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. the ge capital average composite effective interest rate (including interest allocated to discontinued operations) was 4.0%, 4.2% and 3.9% in 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.
postretirement benefit plans. refer to note 13 for our pension and retiree benefit plans.
provision (benefit) for income taxes            $(474)          $726           $93
for the year ended december 31, 2020, the consolidated income tax benefit was $0.5 billion. the change in tax from a tax provision in 2019 to a tax benefit for 2020 was primarily due to the decrease in pre-tax income excluding the gain from the sale of our biopharma business and non-deductible goodwill impairment charges and a decrease in valuation allowances on non-u.s. deferred tax assets partially offset by the increase in tax expense associated with the disposition of the biopharma business in 2020 compared to the amount recognized on preparatory steps for the planned disposition in 2019 and a decrease in benefit from the completion of the internal revenue service (irs) audits.
absent additional taxes enacted as part of u.s. tax reform and non-u.s. losses without a tax benefit, our consolidated income tax provision is generally reduced because of the benefits of lower-taxed global operations as certain non-u.s. income is subject to local country tax rates that are below the u.s. statutory tax rate.
the rate of tax on our profitable non-u.s. earnings is below the u.s. statutory tax rate because we have significant business operations subject to tax in countries where the tax on that income is lower than the u.s. statutory rate and because ge funds certain non-u.s. operations through foreign companies that are subject to low foreign taxes. most of these earnings have been reinvested in active non-u.s. business operations and as of december 31, 2020, we have not decided to repatriate these earnings to the u.s. given u.s. tax reform, substantially all of our net prior unrepatriated earnings were subject to u.s. tax and accordingly we generally expect to have the ability to repatriate available non-u.s. cash without additional u.s. federal tax cost and any foreign withholding taxes on a repatriation to the u.s. would potentially be partially offset by a u.s. foreign tax credit.
a substantial portion of the benefit for lower-taxed non-u.s. earnings related to business operations subject to tax in countries where the tax on that income is lower than the u.s. statutory rate is derived from our gecas aircraft leasing operations located in ireland where the earnings are taxed at 12.5%, our power operations located in switzerland where the earnings are taxed at between 9% and 18.6% and our aviation operations located in singapore where the earnings are primarily taxed at a rate of 8%.
the rate of tax on non-u.s. operations is increased, however, because we also incur losses in foreign jurisdictions where it is not likely that the losses can be utilized and no tax benefit is provided for those losses and valuation allowances against loss carryforwards are provided when it is no longer likely that the losses can be utilized. in addition, as part of u.s. tax reform, the u.s. has enacted a tax on "base eroding" payments from the u.s. we are continuing to undertake restructuring actions to mitigate the impact from this provision. the u.s. has also enacted a minimum tax on foreign earnings (global intangible low tax income). because we have tangible assets outside the u.s. and pay significant foreign taxes, we generally do not expect a significant increase in tax liability from this new u.s. minimum tax. overall, these newly enacted provisions increase the rate of tax on our non-u.s. operations.

the amounts reported above exclude the impact of u.s. tax reform which is reported as a separate line in the reconciliation of the u.s. federal statutory income tax rate to the actual tax rate in note 15.
for the year ended december 31, 2020, the change from an expense from global operations in 2019 to a benefit from global operations in 2020 reflects the lower rate of tax on the disposition of the biopharma business in 2020 compared to an amount of tax recognized on preparatory steps for the planned disposition in 2019 and a decrease in valuation allowances on non-u.s. deferred tax assets.
a more detailed analysis of differences between the u.s. federal statutory rate and the consolidated effective rate, as well as other information about our income tax provisions, is provided in the critical accounting estimates section and note 15. the nature of business activities and associated income taxes differ for ge industrial and for ge capital; therefore, a separate analysis of each is presented in the paragraphs that follow.
for the year ended december 31, 2020, the ge industrial provision for income taxes decreased primarily due to the decrease in pre-tax income excluding the gain from the sale of our biopharma business and non-deductible goodwill impairment charges and a decrease in valuation allowances on non-u.s. deferred tax assets partially offset by the increase in tax expense associated with the disposition of the biopharma business in 2020 compared to the amount recognized on preparatory steps for the planned disposition in 2019 and a decrease in benefit from the completion of the irs audits.

ge capital provision (benefit) for income taxes          $(862)          $(582)          $(374)
for the year ended december 31, 2020, the ge capital tax benefit increased primarily due to the decrease in pre-tax income excluding non-deductible goodwill impairment charges and due to larger benefits on global operations including a tax benefit associated with the disposition of the biopharma business in 2020.
research and development. we conduct research and development (r&d) activities to continually enhance our existing products and services, develop new products and services to meet our customers' changing needs and requirements, and address new market opportunities. in addition to funding r&d internally, we also receive funding externally from our customers and partners, which contributes to the overall r&d for the company.

(b) customer funded is principally u.s. government funded in our aviation segment.
discontinued operations. discontinued operations primarily include certain businesses in our ge capital segment (our mortgage portfolio in poland and trailing liabilities associated with the sale of our ge capital businesses) and our baker hughes and transportation segments. see notes 2 and 23 for further financial information regarding our businesses in discontinued operations.
the mortgage portfolio in poland (bank bph) comprises floating-rate residential mortgages, 87% of which are indexed to or denominated in foreign currencies (primarily swiss francs). at december 31, 2020, the total portfolio had a carrying value of $2.4 billion with a 1.61% 90-day delinquency rate and an average loan to value ratio of approximately 63.0%. the portfolio is recorded at the lower of cost or fair value, less cost to sell, and included a $0.3 billion impairment, which reflected market yields as well as estimates with respect to ongoing litigation in poland related to foreign currency-denominated mortgages and other factors. see note 23 for additional information about this litigation and the potential for further adverse developments to result in further losses related to these loans in future reporting periods.
capital resources and liquidity financial policy. we intend to maintain a disciplined financial policy, including maintaining a high cash balance. we are targeting a sustainable long-term credit rating in the single-a range, achieving a ge industrial net debt*-to-ebitda ratio of less than 2.5x and a dividend in line with our peers over time, as well as maintaining a less than 4-to-1 debt-to-equity ratio for ge capital. in addition to net debt*-to-ebitda, we also evaluate other leverage measures, including gross debt-to-ebitda, and we will ultimately size our deleveraging actions across a range of measures to ensure we are operating the company based on a strong balance sheet. we intend to continue to decrease our ge industrial leverage over time as we navigate this period of uncertainty, although we now expect to achieve our ge industrial leverage target over time.
liquidity policy. we maintain a strong focus on liquidity and define our liquidity risk tolerance based on sources and uses to maintain a sufficient liquidity position to meet our obligations under both normal and stressed conditions. we intend to maintain a high level of cash and maximize flexibility as we navigate the current environment. at both ge industrial and ge capital, we manage our liquidity to provide access to sufficient funding to meet our business needs and financial obligations, as well as capital allocation and growth objectives, throughout business cycles.
ge industrial has continued to enhance its cash management operations, targeting increased linear cash flow, lower factoring, and reducing restricted cash. as a result, we reduced our intra-quarter borrowings by $3.6 billion in 2020 and reduced our ge industrial cash needs to below approximately $13 billion on a go-forward basis. however, we will continue holding elevated cash levels through this period of uncertainty.
at ge capital, we continue to hold cash levels to cover at least 12 months of long-term debt maturities.
we believe that our consolidated liquidity and availability under our revolving credit facilities will be sufficient to meet our liquidity needs.
consolidated liquidity. following is a summary of cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash at december 31, 2020.
ge capital                  13,421           non-u.s.                    17,696
cash held in non-u.s. entities has generally been reinvested in active foreign business operations; however, substantially all of our unrepatriated earnings were subject to u.s. federal tax and, if there is a change in reinvestment, we would expect to be able to repatriate available cash (excluding amounts held in countries with currency controls) without additional federal tax cost. any foreign withholding tax on a repatriation to the u.s. would potentially be partially offset by a u.s. foreign tax credit.
ge industrial liquidity. ge industrial's primary sources of liquidity consist of cash and cash equivalents, free cash flows from our operating businesses, monetization of receivables, and short-term borrowing facilities, including revolving credit facilities. cash generation can be subject to variability based on many factors, including seasonality, receipt of down payments on large equipment orders, timing of billings on long-term contracts, market conditions and our ability to execute dispositions. additionally, as previously reported, we launched a program in the third quarter of 2020 to fully monetize our baker hughes position over approximately three years. consistent with the program's design, we received initial proceeds of approximately $0.4 billion in the fourth quarter of 2020 and $0.7 billion in january 2021. see note 26 for further information.
ge industrial cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash totaled $23.2 billion at december 31, 2020, including $2.2 billion of cash held in countries with currency control restrictions and $0.4 billion of restricted use cash. cash held in countries with currency controls represents amounts held in countries that may restrict the transfer of funds to the u.s. or limit our ability to transfer funds to the u.s. without incurring substantial costs. restricted use cash represents amounts that are not available to fund operations, and primarily comprised funds restricted in connection with certain ongoing litigation matters.
in the fourth quarter of 2020, ge industrial took actions to continue to solidify its financial position through a $2.5 billion pre-funding to the ge pension plan as well as the repayment of $1.5 billion of intercompany loans to ge capital. based on our current assumptions, we do not anticipate further contributions to the ge pension plan through 2023.
as previously communicated, ge industrial provided a capital contribution to ge capital in the fourth quarter of 2020 of $2.0 billion, in line with the first quarter 2020 insurance statutory funding. in 2021, ge industrial expects to provide an additional contribution to ge capital in line with the existing insurance statutory funding requirement of approximately $2.0 billion. further 2021 capital contributions will depend on ge capital's performance, including gecas operations and the insurance statutory asset adequacy testing results, in light of the uncertain environment. going forward, we anticipate ge capital's liquidity and capital needs will be met through a combination of ge capital liquidity, ge capital asset sales, ge capital future earnings and capital contributions from ge industrial.
ge capital liquidity. ge capital's primary sources of liquidity consist of cash and cash equivalents, cash generated from asset sales and cash flows from our businesses, as well as ge industrial repayments of intercompany loans and capital contributions from ge industrial. we expect to maintain a sufficient liquidity position to fund our insurance obligations and debt maturities. see the segment operations - capital section for further information regarding allocation of ge capital interest expense to the ge capital businesses.
ge capital cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash totaled $13.4 billion at december 31, 2020, excluding $0.5 billion of cash in insurance entities, which was classified as all other assets on the ge capital statement of financial position. see note 10 for further information about classification of cash in insurance entities.
ge capital provided capital contributions to its insurance subsidiaries of $2.0 billion, $1.9 billion and $3.5 billion in the first quarters of 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively, and expects to provide further capital contributions of approximately $7 billion through 2024, including approximately $2.0 billion in the first quarter of 2021, pending completion of our december 31, 2020 statutory reporting process, which includes asset adequacy testing. these contributions are subject to ongoing monitoring by kid, and the total amount to be contributed could increase or decrease, or the timing could be accelerated, based upon the results of reserve adequacy testing or a decision by kid to modify the schedule of contributions set forth in january 2018. we will continue to monitor the interest rate environment, including the impact of reinvestment rates and our investment portfolio performance, and other factors in determining the related effect on our expected future capital contributions. see the critical accounting estimates section for discussion of the sensitivity of interest rate changes to our insurance liabilities. ge is required to maintain specified capital levels at these insurance subsidiaries under capital maintenance agreements. going forward, we anticipate funding any capital needs for insurance through a combination of ge capital liquidity, ge capital asset sales, ge capital future earnings and capital contributions from ge industrial.
borrowings. consolidated total borrowings were $75.1 billion and $90.9 billion at december 31, 2020 and december 31, 2019, respectively, a decrease of $15.8 billion ($16.3 billion excluding intercompany eliminations). see the following table for a summary of ge industrial and ge capital borrowings.

(a) consolidated total borrowings of $75,067 million and $90,882 million at december 31, 2020 and december 31, 2019, respectively, are net of intercompany eliminations of $600 million and $1,036 million, respectively, of other ge industrial borrowings from ge capital, primarily related to timing of cash settlements associated with ge industrial receivables monetization programs.
(b) included $5,687 million and $4,234 million at december 31, 2020 and december 31, 2019, respectively, of fair value adjustments for debt in fair value hedge relationships. see note 21 for further information.
the reduction in ge industrial adjusted borrowings at december 31, 2020 compared to december 31, 2019, was driven primarily by $9.0 billion (including $1.5 billion in the fourth quarter of 2020) of repayments of intercompany loans from ge capital, debt repurchases of $4.2 billion, lower commercial paper of $3.0 billion, and net repayments and maturities of other debt of $1.1 billion, partially offset by issuances of new long-term debt of $7.5 billion and $0.6 billion related to changes in foreign exchange rates.
ge industrial net debt* was $32.3 billion and $47.9 billion at december 31, 2020 and december 31, 2019, respectively. the reduction was driven primarily by $9.0 billion of repayments of intercompany loans from ge capital, an increase in the net cash deduction of $4.2 billion due to a higher cash balance, the repurchase of $4.2 billion of debt, a reduction in after-tax pension and principal retiree benefit plan liabilities of $1.8 billion, a reduction in commercial paper of $3.0 billion, and net repayments and maturities of other debt of $1.1 billion, partially offset by new issuances of new long-term debt of $7.5 billion and $0.6 billion related to changes in foreign exchange rates.
the reduction in ge capital adjusted borrowings at december 31, 2020 compared to december 31, 2019, was driven primarily by debt repurchases of $11.9 billion (including $2.2 billion in the fourth quarter of 2020), long-term debt maturities and other repayments of $10.7 billion (including $2.8 billion in the fourth quarter of 2020), and lower non-recourse borrowings of $0.8 billion, partially offset by ge industrial repayments of intercompany loans of $9.0 billion (which has the effect of increasing ge capital borrowings), issuances of new long-term debt of $6.0 billion, $1.4 billion of fair value adjustments for debt in fair value hedge relationships, and $0.5 billion related to changes in foreign exchange rates.
liability management actions. in 2020, we took a series of actions to enhance and extend our liquidity at both ge industrial and ge capital, issuing a total of $13.5 billion of longer-dated debt and reducing near-term maturities by $10.5 billion in the second quarter, with the remaining $3 billion to be leverage neutral in ge capital by the end of 2021. following are details of these and other actions.
in the second quarter of 2020, ge industrial issued a total of $7.5 billion of senior notes, and used the proceeds to complete a tender offer to purchase $4.2 billion of ge senior notes, to reduce commercial paper and other debt by $1.8 billion, and to repay $1.5 billion of intercompany loans from ge capital. the total of these transactions was leverage neutral for ge industrial within the second quarter.
in the second quarter of 2020, ge capital issued a total of $6.0 billion of senior notes and used the proceeds to complete a tender offer to purchase a total of $9.8 billion of debt. in the fourth quarter of 2020, ge capital completed a tender offer to purchase a total of $2.2 billion of debt with maturities from 2021 through 2023 using the $1.5 billion of proceeds from the ge industrial repayment of intercompany loans as well as existing cash.
the following table provides a reconciliation of total short- and long-term borrowings as reported on the respective ge industrial and ge capital statements of financial position to borrowings adjusted for assumed debt and intercompany loans:
december 31, 2020                                                                        ge industrial        ge capital   consolidated total short- and long-term borrowings                                                   $42,736            $32,931         $75,067

intercompany loans with right of offset                                                   3,177            (3,177)         -
total intercompany payable (receivable) between ge industrial and ge capital           (19,213)             19,213         -
in 2015, senior unsecured notes and commercial paper were assumed by ge industrial upon its merger with ge capital. under the conditions of the 2015 assumed debt agreement, ge capital agreed to continue making required principal and interest payments on behalf of ge industrial, resulting in the establishment of an intercompany receivable and payable between ge industrial and ge capital. in addition, ge capital has periodically made intercompany loans to ge industrial with maturity terms that mirror the assumed debt. as these loans qualify for right-of-offset presentation, they reduce the assumed debt intercompany receivable and payable between ge industrial and ge capital, as noted in the table above.
the remaining intercompany loans from ge capital to ge industrial bear the right of offset against amounts owed by ge capital to ge industrial under the assumed debt agreement and can be prepaid by ge industrial at any time, in whole or in part, without premium or penalty. these loans are priced at market terms and have a collective weighted average interest rate of 3.7% and term of approximately 15.2 years at december 31, 2020.
ge industrial has in place committed revolving credit lines. the following table provides a summary of committed and available credit lines.
less offset provisions                                                              -                   6,700
under the terms of an agreement between ge capital and ge industrial, ge capital has the right to compel ge industrial to borrow under the $15.0 billion unused back-up revolving syndicated credit facility. under this agreement, ge industrial would transfer the proceeds to ge capital as intercompany loans, which would be subject to the same terms and conditions as those between ge industrial and the lending banks. ge capital has not exercised this right.
the following table provides a summary of the activity in the primary external sources of short-term borrowings for ge industrial in the fourth quarters of 2020 and 2019. ge industrial uses its bilateral revolving credit facilities from time to time to meet its short-term liquidity needs.
in the third quarter of 2020, we reduced our ending commercial paper balance to zero. total average and maximum borrowings in the table above are calculated based on the daily outstanding balance of the sum of commercial paper and revolving credit facilities.
credit ratings and conditions. we have relied, and may continue to rely, on the short- and long-term debt capital markets to fund, among other things, a significant portion of our operations. the cost and availability of debt financing is influenced by our credit ratings. moody's investors service (moody's), standard and poor's global ratings (s&p), and fitch ratings (fitch) currently issue separate ratings on ge industrial and ge capital short- and long-term debt. the credit ratings of ge industrial and ge capital as of the date of this filing are set forth in the table below.
long term         baa1           bbb+           bbb ge capital           outlook           negative       negative       stable short term        p-2            a-2            f3
long term         baa1           bbb+           bbb we are disclosing our credit ratings and any current quarter updates to these ratings to enhance understanding of our sources of liquidity and the effects of our ratings on our costs of funds and access to liquidity. our ratings may be subject to a revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating organization, and each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating. for a description of some of the potential consequences of a reduction in our credit ratings, see the financial risks section of risk factors in this report.
substantially all of the company's debt agreements in place at december 31, 2020 do not contain material credit rating covenants. ge's unused back-up revolving syndicated credit facility and certain of our bilateral revolving credit facilities contain a customary net debt-to-ebitda financial covenant, which ge satisfied at december 31, 2020.
the company may from time to time enter into agreements that contain minimum ratings requirements. the following table provides a summary of the maximum estimated potential liquidity impact in the event of further downgrades with regards to the most significant contractual credit ratings conditions of the company.
the amounts in the table above represent the incremental estimated liquidity impact that could occur if we were to fall below each given ratings level.
our most significant contractual ratings requirements are related to ordinary course commercial activities, our receivables sales programs, and our derivatives portfolio. the timing within the quarter of the potential liquidity impact of these areas may differ, as can the remedies to resolving any potential breaches of required ratings levels.
foreign exchange and interest rate risks. as a result of our global operations, we generate and incur a significant portion of our revenues and expenses in currencies other than the u.s. dollar. such principal currencies include the euro, the chinese renminbi, the british pound sterling and the indian rupee, among others. the effects of foreign currency fluctuations on earnings, excluding the earnings impact of the underlying hedged item, was less than $0.1 billion, $0.1 billion, and $0.3 billion for the years ended december 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. this analysis excludes any offsetting effect from the forecasted future transactions that are economically hedged.
exchange rate and interest rate risks are managed with a variety of techniques, including selective use of derivatives. we apply policies to manage each of these risks, including prohibitions on speculative activities. following is an analysis of the potential effects of changes in interest rates and currency exchange rates.
it is our policy to minimize exposure to interest rate changes with regards to our borrowings and their impact to interest and other financial charges. we fund our financial investments using a combination of debt and hedging instruments so that the interest rates of our borrowings match the expected interest rate profile on our assets. it is our policy to minimize currency exposures and to conduct operations either within functional currencies or using the protection of hedge strategies. to test the effectiveness of our hedging actions, for interest rate risk we assumed that, on january 1, 2021, interest rates increased by 100 basis points and the increase remained in place for the next 12 months and for currency risk of assets and liabilities denominated in other than their functional currencies, we evaluated the effect of a 10% shift in exchange rates against the u.s. dollar. the analyses indicated that our 2020 consolidated net earnings would decline by less than $0.1 billion for interest rate risk and approximately $0.1 billion for foreign exchange risk.
libor reform. in connection with the potential transition away from the use of the london interbank offered rate (libor) as an interest rate benchmark, on november 30, 2020, the ice benchmark administration limited (iba) announced a consultation on its intention to cease the publication of the one-week and two-month usd libor settings immediately following the libor publication on december 31, 2021, and the remaining usd libor settings immediately following the libor publication on june 30, 2023. this followed an announcement on november 18, 2020, that iba would consult on its intention to cease the publication of all gbp, eur, chf and jpy libor settings immediately following the libor publication on december 31, 2021.
the company's most significant exposures to libor relate to preferred stock issued by ge industrial and certain floating-rate debt securities issued by ge capital, for which contractual fallback language exists. additionally, with respect to our derivatives portfolio, we are managing the transition from libor based on industry-wide libor reform efforts, including the recently released libor protocols issued by the international swaps and derivatives association. none of these exposures are benchmarked to one-week or two-month usd libor.
we are in the process of managing the transition and any financial impact will be accounted for under accounting standards update (asu) 2020-04, reference rate reform (topic 848): facilitation of the effects of reference rate reform on financial reporting, which we adopted in the fourth quarter of 2020. see note 1 for further information.
statement of cash flows. we manage the cash flow performance of our industrial and financial services businesses separately, in order to enable us and our investors to evaluate the cash from operating activities of our industrial businesses separately from the cash flows of our financial services business.
transactions between ge industrial and ge capital are reported in the respective columns of our statement of cash flows, but are eliminated in deriving our consolidated statement of cash flows. intercompany loans from ge capital to ge industrial are reflected as cash from (used for) financing activities at ge industrial and cash from (used for) investing activities at ge capital. capital contributions from ge industrial to ge capital are reflected as cash used for investing activities at ge industrial and cash from financing activities at ge capital. see the ge industrial working capital transactions section and notes 4 and 24 for further information regarding certain transactions affecting our consolidated statement of cash flows.
the following provides information on our cash flows in 2020 compared with 2019. refer to our annual report on form 10-k for the year ended december 31, 2019 for information regarding cash flows in 2019 compared with 2018.
ge industrial cash flows from continuing operations. the most significant source of cash in ge industrial cfoa is customer-related activities, the largest of which is collecting cash resulting from product or services sales. the most significant operating use of cash is to pay our suppliers, employees, tax authorities, contribute to post retirement plans and pay others for a wide range of material, services and taxes.
ge industrial measures itself on a ge industrial free cash flows* basis. this metric includes ge industrial cfoa plus investments in property, plant and equipment and additions to internal-use software; this metric excludes any dividends received from ge capital and any cash received from dispositions of property, plant and equipment. we believe that investors may also find it useful to compare ge's industrial free cash flows* performance without the effects of cash used for taxes related to business sales and contributions to the ge pension plan. we believe that this measure better allows management and investors to evaluate the capacity of our industrial operations to generate free cash flows.

ge industrial cash used for operating activities was $1.3 billion in 2020, an increase of $5.9 billion compared with 2019, primarily due to: a general decrease in net income (after adjusting for the gain on the sale of biopharma and non-cash losses related to our interest in baker hughes), primarily due to covid-19 impacts in our aviation segment; ge pension plan contributions (which are excluded from ge industrial free cash flows*) of $2.5 billion; partially offset by a decrease in cash used for operating working capital of $2.0 billion; lower provisions for income taxes of $0.9 billion; and an increase in cash paid for income taxes of $0.5 billion. increases in aviation-related customer allowance accruals (which is a component of all other operating activities) of $0.5 billion were $0.2 billion higher compared with 2019.
we utilized the provision of the coronavirus aid, relief, and economic security act (cares act) which allows employers to defer the payment of social security taxes and, as a result, we deferred $0.3 billion as of december 31, 2020.
the decrease in cash used for working capital was due to: a decrease in cash used for current receivables of $3.3 billion, which was primarily driven by lower volume, partially offset by a higher decrease in sales of receivables; an increase in cash generated by inventories, including deferred inventory, of $2.5 billion, which was primarily driven by lower material purchases, partially offset by lower liquidations; and changes in current contract assets of $0.7 billion, primarily due to a net unfavorable change in estimated profitability of $1.1 billion at aviation (see note 9). these decreases in cash used for working capital were partially offset by: an increase in cash used for accounts payable and equipment project accruals of $2.9 billion, which was primarily as a result of lower volume in 2020 and higher disbursements related to purchases of materials in prior periods; and lower progress collections and current deferred income of $1.7 billion, which included a partial offset due to early payments received at our aviation military equipment business of $0.7 billion in 2020 as part of the u.s. department of defense's efforts to support vendors in its supply chain during the pandemic.
ge industrial cash from investing activities was $17.7 billion in 2020, an increase of $13.7 billion compared with 2019, primarily due to: net proceeds from the sale of our biopharma business of $20.3 billion; lower capital contributions from ge industrial to ge capital of $2.0 billion; partially offset by the nonrecurrence of proceeds from the spin-off of our transportation business of $6.2 billion (including the sale of our retained ownership interests in wabtec); and lower proceeds from sales of our stake in baker hughes of $2.6 billion (including the sale of a portion of our retained ownership interests in 2020). cash used for additions to property, plant and equipment and internal-use software, which is a component of ge industrial free cash flows*, was $1.7 billion in 2020, down $0.8 billion compared with 2019.
ge industrial cash used for financing activities was $10.9 billion in 2020, an increase of $3.3 billion compared with 2019, primarily due to: higher repayments of intercompany loans from ge capital of $7.5 billion; a reduction in commercial paper of $3.0 billion; reductions of other debt of $0.8 billion; partially offset by new principal issuances of long-term debt of $7.5 billion in the second quarter of 2020 and lower repurchases of long-term debt of $0.6 billion.
ge industrial cash flows from discontinued operations. ge industrial cash used for investing activities in 2019 was primarily due to the deconsolidation of baker hughes cash as a result of the reduction in our ownership interest in the segment in the third quarter of 2019. ge industrial cash used for financing activities in 2019 primarily reflects payments of baker hughes dividends to noncontrolling interests.
ge capital cash flows from continuing operations. ge capital cash from operating activities was $3.5 billion in 2020, an increase of $1.6 billion compared with 2019, primarily due to: cash collateral received, which is a standard market practice to minimize derivative counterparty exposures, and settlements received on derivative contracts (components of all other operating activities) of $1.9 billion in 2020, an increase of $0.6 billion compared with 2019 as well as a general increase in cash generated from earnings (loss) from continuing operations. these are partially offset by an increase in trade receivables due to short-term extensions of payment terms to customers of $0.3 billion driven primarily by covid-19 and other market related effects.
ge capital cash from investing activities was $8.2 billion in 2020, a decrease of $1.2 billion compared with 2019, primarily due to: lower proceeds from business dispositions of $3.9 billion; lower net collections of financing receivables of $3.2 billion; a decrease in cash related to our current receivables and supply chain finance programs with ge industrial of $1.9 billion; higher net purchases of equity investments of $1.5 billion and a decrease of gecas sales deposits of $1.1 billion primarily driven by covid-19 and other market related effects; partially offset by repayments of ge capital intercompany loans (a component of all other investing activities) by ge industrial of $9.0 billion in 2020, an increase of $7.5 billion compared with 2019; an increase in cash received related to net settlements between our continuing operations (primarily our corporate function) and businesses in discontinued operations of $2.2 billion and a decrease in net purchases of investment securities of $0.3 billion.
ge capital cash used for financing activities was $16.7 billion in 2020, an increase of $9.7 billion compared with 2019, primarily due to: higher net repayments of borrowings of $8.5 billion and a lower capital contribution from ge industrial to ge capital of $2.0 billion; partially offset by lower cash settlements on derivatives hedging foreign currency debt of $1.1 billion.
ge industrial working capital transactions. sales of receivables. in order to manage short-term liquidity and credit exposure, ge industrial may sell current customer receivables to ge capital and third parties. these transactions are made on arms- length terms and any discount related to time value of money is recognized within the respective ge industrial business in the period these receivables were sold to ge capital or third parties. see note 4 for further information.
supply chain finance programs. ge industrial facilitates voluntary supply chain finance programs with third parties, which provide participating ge industrial suppliers the opportunity to sell their ge industrial receivables to third parties at the sole discretion of both the suppliers and the third parties.
at december 31, 2020 and 2019, included in ge industrial's accounts payable is $2.9 billion and $2.4 billion, respectively, of supplier invoices that are subject to the third-party programs. total ge industrial supplier invoices paid through these third-party programs were $4.9 billion and $1.4 billion for the years ended december 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.
previously, ge capital operated a supply chain finance program for suppliers to ge industrial's businesses. the remaining ge industrial liability associated with the funded participation in the ge capital program is presented as accounts payable and amounted to $0.1 billion and $2.1 billion at december 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. cash flows associated with the decrease in this liability are reflected as cash used for operating activities at ge industrial and cash from investing activities at ge capital, and are eliminated in our consolidated statement of cash flows.
intercompany transactions between ge industrial and ge capital. transactions between related companies are made on arms-length terms and are reported in the ge industrial and ge capital columns of our financial statements, which we believe provide useful supplemental information to our consolidated financial statements. consistent with our historical practice, all commercial transactions between ge industrial and ge capital continue to be reported on arms-length terms and are eliminated upon consolidation. see note 24 for further information.
ge capital finance transactions. during the years ended december 31, 2020 and 2019, ge capital acquired from third parties 20 aircraft with a list price totaling $1.7 billion and 51 aircraft with a list price totaling $6.4 billion, respectively, that will be leased to others and are powered by engines manufactured by ge aviation and affiliates. ge capital also made payments to ge aviation and affiliates related to spare engines and engine parts of $0.2 billion and $0.7 billion, which included $0.1 billion and $0.6 billion to cfm international, during the years ended december 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. additionally, ge capital had $2.1 billion and $2.0 billion of net book value of engines, originally manufactured by ge aviation and affiliates and subsequently leased back to ge aviation and affiliates at december 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.
also, during the years ended december 31, 2020 and 2019, ge industrial recognized equipment revenues of $2.3 billion and $1.6 billion, respectively, from customers within our power and renewable energy segments in which ge capital has been an investee or is committed to be an investee in the underlying projects. at december 31, 2020 and 2019, ge capital had funded related investments of $1.3 billion and $0.6 billion, respectively.
for certain of these investments, in order to meet its underwriting criteria, ge capital may obtain a direct guarantee from ge industrial related to the performance of the third party. ge industrial guarantees include direct performance or payment guarantees, return on investment guarantees and asset value guarantees. as of december 31, 2020, ge industrial had outstanding guarantees to ge capital on $0.9 billion of funded exposure and $0.1 billion of unfunded commitments, which included guarantees issued by industrial businesses. the recorded contingent liability for these guarantees was insignificant as of december 31, 2020 and is based on individual transaction level defaults, losses and/or returns.
critical accounting estimates. accounting estimates and assumptions discussed in this section are those that we consider to be the most critical to an understanding of our financial statements because they involve significant judgments and uncertainties. actual results in these areas could differ from management's estimates. see note 1 for further information on our most significant accounting policies.
revenue recognition on long-term services agreements. we have long-term service agreements with our customers predominately within our power and aviation segments that require us to maintain the customers' assets over the contract terms, which generally range from 5 to 25 years. however, contract modifications that extend or revise contracts are not uncommon. we recognize revenue as we perform under the arrangements using the percentage of completion method which is based on our costs incurred to date relative to our estimate of total expected costs. this requires us to make estimates of customer payments expected to be received over the contract term as well as the costs to perform required maintenance services.
customers generally pay us based on the utilization of the asset (per hour of usage for example) or upon the occurrence of a major event within the contract such as an overhaul. as a result, a significant estimate in determining expected revenues of a contract is estimating how customers will utilize their assets over the term of the agreement. the estimate of utilization, which can change over the contract life, impacts both the amount of customer payments we expect to receive and our estimate of future contract costs. customers' asset utilization will influence the timing and extent of overhauls and other service events over the life of the contract. we generally use a combination of both historical utilization trends as well as forward-looking information such as market conditions and potential asset retirements in developing our revenue estimates.
to develop our cost estimates, we consider the timing and extent of future maintenance and overhaul events, including the amount and cost of labor, spare parts and other resources required to perform the services. in developing our cost estimates, we utilize a combination of our historical cost experience and expected cost improvements. cost improvements are only included in future cost estimates after savings have been observed in actual results or proven effective through an extensive regulatory or engineering approval process.
we routinely review estimates under long-term service agreements and regularly revise them to adjust for changes in outlook. these revisions are based on objectively verifiable information that is available at the time of the review. contract modifications that change the rights and obligations, as well as the nature, timing and extent of future cash flows, are evaluated for potential price concessions, contract asset impairments and significant financing to determine if adjustments of earnings are required before effectively accounting for a modified contract as a new contract.
we regularly assess expected billings adjustments and customer credit risk inherent in the carrying amounts of receivables and contract assets, including the risk that contractual penalties may not be sufficient to offset our accumulated investment in the event of customer termination. we gain insight into future utilization and cost trends, as well as credit risk, through our knowledge of the installed base of equipment and fleet management strategies through close interaction with our customers that comes with supplying critical services and parts over extended periods. revisions may affect a long-term services agreement's total estimated profitability resulting in an adjustment of earnings.
on december 31, 2020, our net long-term service agreements balance of $1.3 billion represents approximately 0.7% of our total estimated life of contract billings of $188.4 billion. our contracts (on average) are approximately 20.9% complete based on costs incurred to date and our estimate of future costs. revisions to our estimates of future billings or costs that increase or decrease total estimated contract profitability by one percentage point would increase or decrease the long-term service agreements balance by $0.4 billion. cash billings collected on these contracts were $8.9 billion and $11.5 billion during the years ended december 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.

impairment of goodwill and other identified intangible assets. we perform our annual goodwill impairment testing in the fourth quarter. in assessing the possibility that a reporting unit's fair value has been reduced below its carrying amount due to the occurrence of events or circumstances between annual impairment testing dates, we consider all available evidence, including (i) the results of our impairment testing from the most recent testing date (in particular, the magnitude of the excess of fair value over carrying value observed), (ii) downward revisions to internal forecasts or decreases in market multiples (and the magnitude thereof), if any, and (iii) declines in market capitalization below book value (and the magnitude and duration of those declines), if any.
we determine fair value for each of the reporting units using the market approach, when available and appropriate, or the income approach, or a combination of both. we assess the valuation methodology based upon the relevance and availability of the data at the time we perform the valuation. if multiple valuation methodologies are used, the results are weighted appropriately.
valuations using the market approach are derived from metrics of publicly traded companies or historically completed transactions of comparable businesses. the selection of comparable businesses is based on the markets in which the reporting units operate giving consideration to risk profiles, size, geography, and diversity of products and services. a market approach is limited to reporting units for which there are publicly traded companies that have the characteristics similar to our businesses.
under the income approach, fair value is determined based on the present value of estimated future cash flows, discounted at an appropriate risk-adjusted rate. we use our internal forecasts to estimate future cash flows and include an estimate of long-term future growth rates based on our most recent views of the long-term outlook for each business. we derive our discount rates using a capital asset pricing model and analyzing published rates for industries relevant to our reporting units to estimate the cost of equity financing. we use discount rates that are commensurate with the risks and uncertainty inherent in the respective businesses and in our internally developed forecasts. discount rates used in our annual reporting unit valuations ranged from 10.5% to 22.5%.
estimating the fair value of reporting units requires the use of significant judgments that are based on a number of factors including actual operating results, internal forecasts, market observable pricing multiples of similar businesses and comparable transactions, possible control premiums, determining the appropriate discount rate and long-term growth rate assumptions, and, if multiple approaches are being used, determining the appropriate weighting applied to each approach. it is reasonably possible that the judgments and estimates described above could change in future periods.
we review identified intangible assets with defined useful lives and subject to amortization for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the related carrying amounts may not be recoverable. determining whether an impairment loss has occurred requires the use of our internal forecast to estimate future cash flows and the useful life over which these cash flows will occur. to determine fair value, we use our internal cash flow estimates discounted at an appropriate discount rate.

pension assumptions. refer to note 13 for our accounting estimates and assumptions related to our postretirement benefit plans.
income taxes. our annual tax rate is based on our income, statutory tax rates and tax planning opportunities available to us in the various jurisdictions in which we operate. tax laws are complex and subject to different interpretations by the taxpayer and respective governmental taxing authorities. significant judgment is required in determining our tax expense and in evaluating our tax positions, including evaluating uncertainties. we review our tax positions quarterly and adjust the balances as new information becomes available. our income tax rate is significantly affected by the tax rate on our global operations. in addition to local country tax laws and regulations, this rate can depend on the extent earnings are indefinitely reinvested outside the u.s. historically u.s. taxes were due upon repatriation of foreign earnings. due to the enactment of u.s. tax reform, repatriations of available cash from foreign earnings are expected to be free of u.s. federal income tax but may incur withholding or state taxes. indefinite reinvestment is determined by management's judgment about and intentions concerning the future operations of the company. most of these earnings have been reinvested in active non-u.s. business operations. at december 31, 2020, we have not changed our indefinite reinvestment decision as a result of tax reform but will reassess this on an ongoing basis.
we evaluate the recoverability of deferred income tax assets by assessing the adequacy of future expected taxable income from all sources, including reversal of taxable temporary differences, forecasted operating earnings and available tax planning strategies, which heavily rely on estimates. we use our historical experience and our short- and long-range business forecasts to provide insight. further, our global and diversified business portfolio gives us the opportunity to employ various prudent and feasible tax planning strategies to facilitate the recoverability of future deductions. amounts recorded for deferred tax assets related to non-u.s. net operating losses, net of valuation allowances, were $2.1 billion and $2.2 billion at december 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. of this, $0.1 billion and $0.2 billion at december 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, were associated with losses reported in discontinued operations, primarily related to our legacy financial services businesses, and $0.2 billion was related to held for sale assets at december 31, 2019.
see other consolidated information - income taxes section and notes 1 and 15 for further information.
loss contingencies. loss contingencies are uncertain and unresolved matters that arise in the ordinary course of business and result from events or actions by others that have the potential to result in a future loss. such contingencies include, but are not limited to, environmental obligations, litigation, regulatory investigations and proceedings, product quality and losses resulting from other events and developments. when a loss is considered probable and reasonably estimable, we record a liability in the amount of our best estimate for the ultimate loss. when there appears to be a range of possible costs with equal likelihood, liabilities are based on the low-end of such range. however, the likelihood of a loss with respect to a particular contingency is often difficult to predict and determining a meaningful estimate of the loss or a range of loss may not be practicable based on the information available and the potential effect of future events and negotiations with or decisions by third parties that will determine the ultimate resolution of the contingency. moreover, it is not uncommon for such matters to be resolved over many years, during which time relevant developments and new information must be continuously evaluated to determine both the likelihood of potential loss and whether it is possible to reasonably estimate a range of possible loss. disclosure is provided for material loss contingencies when a loss is probable but a reasonable estimate cannot be made, and when it is reasonably possible that a loss will be incurred or the amount of a loss will exceed the recorded provision. we regularly review contingencies to determine whether the likelihood of loss has changed and to assess whether a reasonable estimate of the loss or range of loss can be made. see note 23 for further information.
other items insurance. the run-off insurance operations of north american life and health (nalh) primarily include employers reassurance corporation (erac) and union fidelity life insurance company (uflic). erac was formerly part of employers reinsurance corporation (erc) until the sale of erc to swiss re in 2006. uflic was formerly part of genworth financial inc. (genworth) but was retained by ge after genworth's initial public offering in 2004.
erac primarily assumes long-term care insurance and life insurance from numerous cedents under various types of reinsurance treaties and stopped accepting new policies after 2008. uflic primarily assumes long-term care insurance, structured settlement annuities with and without life contingencies and variable annuities from genworth and has been closed to new business since 2004.
the vast majority of nalh's reinsurance exposures are long-duration arrangements that still involve substantial levels of premium collections and benefit payments even though erac and uflic have not entered into new reinsurance treaties in about a decade. these long-duration arrangements involve a number of direct writers and contain a range of risk transfer provisions and other contractual elements. in many instances, these arrangements do not transfer to us 100 percent of the risk embodied in the encompassed underlying policies issued by the direct writers. furthermore, we cede insurance risk to third-party reinsurers for a portion of our insurance contracts, primarily on long-term care insurance policies.
our run-off insurance liabilities and annuity benefits primarily comprise a liability for future policy benefits for those insurance contract claims not yet incurred and claim reserves for claims that have been incurred or are estimated to have been incurred but not yet reported. the insurance liabilities and annuity benefits amounted to $42.2 billion and $39.8 billion and primarily relate to individual long-term care insurance reserves of $21.3 billion and $21.0 billion and structured settlement annuities and life insurance reserves of $10.7 billion and $11.1 billion, at december 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. the increase in insurance liabilities and annuity benefits of $2.4 billion from december 31, 2019 to december 31, 2020 is primarily due to an adjustment of $2.5 billion resulting from an increase in unrealized gains on investment securities that would result in a premium deficiency should those gains be realized.
in addition to nalh, electric insurance company (eic) is a property and casualty insurance company primarily providing insurance to ge and its employees with net claim reserves of $0.3 billion at both december 31, 2020 and 2019.
we regularly monitor emerging experience in our run-off insurance operations and industry developments to identify trends that may help us refine our reserve assumptions. we believe recent elevated mortality across our portfolio and lower long-term care insurance claims are short term in nature and attributable to covid-19. however, the effects of covid-19, including the timing and success of vaccinations, remain uncertain and may result in variability in levels of future mortality and long-term care insurance claims activity, including changes in policyholder behavior (e.g., policyholder willingness to enter long-term care facilities or seek care at home), among others.
these monitoring activities also allow us to evaluate opportunities to reduce our insurance risk profile and improve the results of our run-off insurance operations. such opportunities may include the pursuit of future premium rate increases and benefit reductions on long-term care insurance contracts in accordance with our reinsurance contracts with our ceding companies; recapture and reinsurance transactions to reduce risk where economically justified; investment strategies to improve asset and liability matching and enhance investment portfolio yields; and managing our expense levels.
key portfolio characteristics long-term care insurance contracts. the long-term care insurance contracts we reinsure provide coverage at varying levels of benefits to policyholders and may include attributes that could result in claimants being on claim for longer periods or at higher daily claim costs, or alternatively limiting the premium paying period, compared to contracts with a lower level of benefits. for example, policyholders with a lifetime benefit period could receive coverage up to the specified daily maximum as long as the policyholder is claim eligible and receives care for covered services; inflation protection options increase the daily maximums to protect the policyholder from the rising cost of care with some options providing automatic annual increases of 3% to 5% or policyholder elected inflation-indexed increases for increased premium; joint life policies provide coverage for two lives which permit either life under a single contract to receive benefits at the same time or separately; and premium payment options may limit the period over which the policyholder pays premiums while still receiving coverage after premium payments cease, which may limit the impact of our benefit from future premium rate increases.
the erac long-term care insurance portfolio comprises more than two-thirds of our total long-term care insurance reserves and is assumed from approximately 30 ceding companies through various types of reinsurance and retrocession contracts having complex terms and conditions. compared to the overall long-term care insurance block, it has a lower average attained age with a larger number of policies (and covered lives, as over one-third of the policies are joint life policies), with lifetime benefit periods and/or with inflation protection options which may result in a higher potential for future claims.
the uflic long-term care insurance block comprises the remainder of our total long-term care insurance reserves and is more mature with policies that are more uniform, as it is assumed from a single ceding company, genworth, and has fewer policies with lifetime benefit periods, no joint life policies and slightly more policies with inflation protection options.
as further described within the premium deficiency testing section below, we reconstructed our future claim cost projections in 2017 utilizing trends observed in our emerging experience for older claimant ages and later duration policies. also described within that section are key assumption changes in 2020.
presented in the table below are gaap and statutory reserve balances and key attributes of our long-term care insurance portfolio.

structured settlement annuities and life insurance contracts. we reinsure approximately 29,100 structured settlement annuities with an average attained age of 53. these structured settlement annuities were primarily underwritten on impaired lives (i.e., shorter-than-average life expectancies) at origination and have projected payments extending decades into the future. our primary risks associated with these contracts include mortality (i.e., life expectancy or longevity), mortality improvement (i.e., assumed rate that mortality is expected to reduce over time), which may extend the duration of payments on life contingent contracts beyond our estimates, and reinvestment risk (i.e., a low interest rate environment may reduce our ability to achieve our targeted investment margins). unlike long-term care insurance, structured settlement annuities offer no ability to require additional premiums or reduce benefits.
our life reinsurance business typically covers the mortality risk associated with various types of life insurance policies that we reinsure from approximately 150 ceding company relationships where we pay a benefit based on the death of a covered life. as of december 31, 2020, across our u.s. and canadian life insurance blocks, we reinsure approximately $80 billion of net amount at risk (i.e., difference between the death benefit and any accrued cash value) from approximately 2 million policies with an average attained age of 59. in 2020, our incurred claims were approximately $0.6 billion with an average individual claim of approximately $50,000. the largest product types covered are 20-year level term policies, which represent approximately 35% of the net amount at risk and a significant portion are anticipated to lapse (i.e., the length of time a policy will remain in force) over the next 3 years as the policies reach the end of their 20-year level premium period.
investment portfolio and other adjustments. our insurance liabilities and annuity benefits are primarily supported by investment securities of $42.0 billion and $38.0 billion and commercial mortgage loans of $1.8 billion and $1.9 billion at december 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. additionally, we expect to purchase approximately $7 billion of new assets through 2024 in conjunction with expected capital contributions from ge capital to our insurance subsidiaries, of which approximately $2.0 billion is expected to be contributed in the first quarter of 2021, pending completion of our december 31, 2020 statutory reporting process, which includes asset adequacy testing. our investment securities are classified as available-for-sale and comprise mainly investment-grade debt securities. the portfolio includes $8.2 billion of net unrealized gains that are recorded within other comprehensive income, net of applicable taxes and other adjustments as of december 31, 2020.
in calculating our future policy benefit reserves, we are required to consider the impact of net unrealized gains and losses on our available-for-sale investment securities supporting our insurance contracts as if those unrealized amounts were realized. to the extent that the realization of gains would result in a premium deficiency, an adjustment is recorded to increase future policy benefit reserves with an after-tax offset to other comprehensive income. at december 31, 2020, the entire $8.2 billion balance of net unrealized gains on our investment securities required a related increase to future policy benefit reserves. this adjustment increased from $5.7 billion in 2019 to $8.2 billion in 2020 primarily from higher unrealized gains within the investment security portfolio supporting our insurance contracts as a result of decreased market yields. see note 3 for further information about our investment securities.
we manage the investments in our run-off insurance operations under strict investment guidelines, including limitations on asset class concentration, single issuer exposures, asset-liability duration variances, and other factors to meet credit quality, yield, liquidity and diversification requirements associated with servicing our insurance liabilities under reasonable circumstances. this process includes consideration of various asset allocation strategies and incorporates information from several external investment advisors to improve our investment yield subject to maintaining our ability to satisfy insurance liabilities when due, as well as considering our risk-based capital requirements, regulatory constraints, and tolerance for surplus volatility. with the expected capital contributions from ge capital through 2024, we intend to add new asset classes to further diversify our portfolio, including private equity, senior secured loans and infrastructure debt, among others. asset allocation planning is a dynamic process that considers changes in market conditions, risk appetite, liquidity needs and other factors which are reviewed on a periodic basis by our investment team. investing in these assets exposes us to both credit risk (i.e., debtor's ability to make timely payments of principal and interest) and interest rate risk (i.e., market price, cash flow variability, and reinvestment risk due to changes in market interest rates). we regularly review investment securities for impairment using both quantitative and qualitative criteria.
our run-off insurance operations have approximately $0.8 billion of assets held by states or other regulatory bodies in statutorily required deposit accounts, and approximately $32.2 billion of assets held in trust accounts associated with reinsurance contracts and reinsurance security trust agreements in place between either erac or uflic as the reinsuring entity and a number of ceding insurers. assets in these trusts are held by an independent trustee for the benefit of the ceding insurer, and are subject to various investment guidelines as set forth in the respective reinsurance contacts and trust agreements. some of these trust agreements may allow a ceding company to withdraw trust assets from the trust and hold these assets on its balance sheet, in an account under its control for the benefit of erac or uflic which might allow the ceding company to exercise investment control over such assets.
future policy benefit reserves. future policy benefit reserves represent the present value of future policy benefits less the present value of future gross premiums based on actuarial assumptions including, but not limited to, morbidity (i.e., frequency and severity of claim, including claim termination rates and benefit utilization rates); morbidity improvement (i.e., assumed rate of improvement in morbidity in the future); mortality (i.e., life expectancy or longevity); mortality improvement (i.e., assumed rate that mortality is expected to reduce over time); policyholder persistency or lapses (i.e., the length of time a policy will remain in force); anticipated premium increases or benefit reductions associated with future in-force rate actions, including actions that are: (a) approved and not yet implemented, (b) filed but not yet approved, and (c) estimated on future filings through 2028, on long-term care insurance policies; and interest rates. assumptions are locked-in throughout the remaining life of a contract unless a premium deficiency develops.
claim reserves. claim reserves are established when a claim is incurred and represents our best estimate of the present value of the ultimate obligations for future claim payments and claim adjustment expenses. key inputs include actual known facts about the claim, such as the benefits available and cause of disability of the claimant, as well as assumptions derived from our actual historical experience and expected future changes in experience factors. claim reserves are evaluated periodically for potential changes in loss estimates with the support of qualified actuaries, and any changes are recorded in earnings in the period in which they are determined.
reinsurance recoverables. we cede insurance risk to third-party reinsurers for a portion of our insurance contracts, primarily on long-term care insurance policies, and record receivables for estimated recoveries as we are not relieved from our primary obligation to policyholders or cedents. these receivables are estimated in a manner consistent with the future policy benefit reserves and claim reserves. reserves ceded to reinsurers, net of allowance, were $2.6 billion and $2.4 billion at december 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, and are included in the caption other ge capital receivables in our consolidated statement of financial position.
premium deficiency testing. we annually perform premium deficiency testing in the third quarter in the aggregate across our run-off insurance portfolio. the premium deficiency testing assesses the adequacy of future policy benefit reserves, net of unamortized capitalized acquisition costs, using current assumptions without provision for adverse deviation. a comprehensive review of premium deficiency assumptions is a complex process and depends on a number of factors, many of which are interdependent and require evaluation individually and in the aggregate across all insurance products. the vast majority of our run-off insurance operations consists of reinsurance from multiple ceding insurance entities pursuant to treaties having complex terms and conditions. premium deficiency testing relies on claim and policy information provided by these ceding entities and considers the reinsurance treaties and underlying policies. in order to utilize that information for purposes of completing experience studies covering all key assumptions, we perform detailed procedures to conform and validate the data received from the ceding entities. our long-term care insurance business includes coverage where credible claim experience for higher attained ages is still emerging, and to the extent future experience deviates from current expectations, new projections of claim costs extending over the expected life of the policies may be required. significant uncertainties exist in making projections for these long-term care insurance contracts, which requires that we consider a wide range of possible outcomes.
the primary assumptions used in the premium deficiency tests include:
morbidity. morbidity assumptions used in estimating future policy benefit reserves are based on estimates of expected incidences of disability among policyholders and the costs associated with these policyholders asserting claims under their contracts, and these estimates account for any expected future morbidity improvement. for long-term care exposures, estimating expected future costs includes assessments of incidence (probability of a claim), utilization (amount of available benefits expected to be incurred) and continuance (how long the claim will last). prior to 2017, premium deficiency assumptions considered the risk of anti-selection by including issue age adjustments to morbidity based on an actuarial assumption that long-term care policies issued to younger individuals would exhibit lower expected incidences and claim costs than those issued to older policyholders. recent claim experience and the development of reconstructed claim cost curves indicated issue age differences had minimal impact on claim cost projections, and, accordingly, beginning in 2017, issue age adjustments were eliminated in developing morbidity assumptions. higher morbidity increases, while lower morbidity decreases, the present value of expected future benefit payments.
rate of change in morbidity. our annual premium deficiency testing incorporates our best estimates of projected future changes in the morbidity rates reflected in our base claim cost curves. these estimates draw upon a number of inputs, some of which are subjective, and all of which are interpreted and applied in the exercise of professional actuarial judgment in the context of the characteristics specific to our portfolios. this exercise of judgment considers factors such as the work performed by internal and external independent actuarial experts engaged to advise us in our annual testing, the observed actual experience in our portfolios measured against our base projections, industry developments, and other trends, including advances in the state of medical care and health-care technology development. with respect to industry developments, we take into account that there are differences between and among industry peers in portfolio characteristics (such as demographic features of the insured populations), the aggregate effect of morbidity improvement or deterioration as applied to base claim cost projections, the extent to which such base cost projections reflect the most current experience, and the accepted diversity of practice in actuarial professional judgment. we assess the potential for any change in morbidity with reference to our existing base claim cost projections, reconstructed in 2017. projected improvement or deterioration in morbidity can have a material impact on our future claim cost projections, both on a stand-alone basis and also by virtue of influencing other variables such as discount rate and premium rate increases.
mortality. mortality assumptions used in estimating future policy benefit reserves are based on published mortality tables as adjusted for the results of our experience studies and estimates of expected future mortality improvement. for life insurance products, higher mortality increases the present value of expected future benefit payments, while for annuity and long-term care insurance contracts, higher mortality decreases the present value of expected future benefit payments.
discount rate. interest rate assumptions used in estimating the present value of future policy benefit reserves are based on expected investment yields, net of related investment expenses and expected defaults. in estimating future investment yields, we consider the actual yields on our current investment securities held by our run-off insurance operations and the future rates at which we expect to reinvest any proceeds from investment security maturities, net of other operating cash flows, and the projected future capital contributions into our run-off insurance operations. lower future investment yields result in a lower discount rate and a higher present value of future policy benefit reserves.
future long-term care premium rate increases. long-term care insurance policies allow the issuing insurance entity to increase premiums, or alternatively allow the policyholder the option to decrease benefits, with approval by state regulators, should actual experience emerge worse than what was projected when such policies were initially underwritten. as a reinsurer, we rely upon the primary insurers that issued the underlying policies to file proposed premium rate increases on those policies with the relevant state insurance regulators. while we have no direct ability to seek or to institute such premium rate increases, we often collaborate with the primary insurers in accordance with reinsurance contractual terms to file proposed premium rate increases. the amount of times that rate increases have occurred varies by ceding company. we consider recent experience of rate increase filings made by our ceding companies along with state insurance regulatory processes and precedents in establishing our current expectations. higher future premium rate increases lower the present value of future policy benefit reserves and lower future premium rate increases increase the present value of future policy benefit reserves.
terminations. terminations refers to the rate at which the underlying policies are cancelled due to either mortality, lapse (non-payment of premiums by a policyholder), or, in the case of long-term care insurance, benefit exhaustion. termination rate assumptions used in estimating the present value of future policy benefit reserves are based on the results of our experience studies and reflect actuarial judgment. lower termination rates increase, while higher termination rates decrease, the present value of expected future benefit payments.
in 2017, based on elevated claim experience for a portion of our long-term care insurance contracts, we initiated a comprehensive review of all premium deficiency testing assumptions across all insurance products, resulting in a reconstruction of our future claim cost projections for long-term care insurance products. while our long-term care insurance claim experience has shown some emerging modest favorable experience, it remains largely in-line with those reconstructed projections. however, the extent of actual experience since 2017 to date is limited in the context of a long-tailed, multi-decade portfolio.
2020 premium deficiency testing. we completed our annual premium deficiency testing in the aggregate across our run-off insurance portfolio in the third quarter of 2020. these procedures included updating experience studies since our last test completed in the third quarter of 2019, independent actuarial analysis and review of industry benchmarks. as we experienced a premium deficiency in 2019, our 2020 premium deficiency testing started with a zero margin and, accordingly, any net adverse development would result in a future premium deficiency. using our most recent future policy benefit reserve assumptions, including changes to our assumptions related to morbidity, future premium rate increases and discount rate, the 2020 premium deficiency testing results indicated there was a positive margin of less than 2% of the recorded future policy benefit reserves, excluding other adjustments, at september 30, 2020. as a result, the assumptions updated in connection with the premium deficiency recognized in 2019 remain locked-in and will remain so unless another premium deficiency occurs in the future.
the increase in the premium deficiency testing margin from our 2019 testing was primarily attributable to modestly favorable emerging morbidity experience in our long-term care insurance portfolio, primarily at the older attained ages, in the period since the 2017 reconstruction of our future claim cost projections ($0.4 billion) and higher projected future premium rate increase approvals ($0.2 billion), partially offset by a decline in the overall discount rate to a weighted average rate of 5.70% compared to 5.74% in 2019 ($0.2 billion). this decline in the discount rate from 2019 to 2020 reflects a lower expected reinvestment rate, due to lower benchmark interest rates in the u.s, increasing to a lower expected long-term average investment yield over a longer period and slightly lower actual yields on our investment security portfolio, partially offset by increased allocations to higher yielding asset classes introduced with our 2018 strategic initiatives, which included a modest decline in expected yield compared to 2019 assumptions.
as noted above, while our observed long-term care insurance claim experience has shown some emerging modest favorable experience in the period since the 2017 reconstruction of our future claim cost projections, it remains largely in-line with those reconstructed projections. based on the application of professional actuarial judgment to the factors discussed above, we have made no substantial change to our assumptions concerning morbidity improvement, mortality, mortality improvement, or terminations in 2020.
as with all assumptions underlying our premium deficiency testing, we will continue to monitor these factors, which may result in future changes in our assumptions.
since our premium deficiency testing performed in 2019, we have implemented approximately $0.3 billion of previously approved long-term care insurance premium rate increase actions and expect higher projected future premium rate increase approvals of approximately $0.2 billion. our 2020 premium deficiency test includes approximately $1.9 billion of anticipated future premium increases or benefit reductions associated with future in-force rate actions. this represents a decrease of $0.1 billion from our 2019 premium deficiency test to account for actions that are: (a) approved and not yet implemented, (b) filed but not yet approved, and (c) estimated on future filings through 2028 and includes the effects of the lower discount rate mentioned above and longer anticipated timing to achieve certain premium rate approvals.
as a result of exposure period cut-off dates to permit experience to develop and lags in ceding company data reporting from our ceding companies, the impact of covid-19 is not reflected in the experience studies data used in our 2020 premium deficiency testing. however, we assessed certain scenarios to understand potential impacts associated with covid-19 and, due to the insignificance and short-term nature of such uncertain future impacts, including the natural offsets from mortality in the aggregate across our run-off insurance products, concluded adjustments to our primary assumptions used in the premium deficiency testing were not warranted.
when results of the premium deficiency testing indicate overall reserves are sufficient, we are also required to assess whether additional future policy benefit reserves are required to be accrued over time in the future. such an accrual would be required if profits are projected in earlier future periods followed by losses projected in later future years (i.e., profits followed by losses). when this pattern of profits followed by losses is projected, we would be required to accrue a liability in the expected profitable years by the amount necessary to offset projected losses in later future years. we noted our projections as of third quarter 2020 indicate the present value of projected earnings in each future year to be positive, and therefore, no further adjustments to our future policy benefit reserves were required at this time.
gaap reserve sensitivities. the results of our premium deficiency testing are sensitive to the assumptions described above. considering the results of the 2020 premium deficiency test which resulted in a small margin, any future net adverse changes in our assumptions may reduce the margin or result in a premium deficiency requiring an increase to future policy benefit reserves. for example, adverse changes in key assumptions related to our future policy benefits reserves, holding all other assumptions constant, would have the following effects on the projected present value of future cash flows as presented in the table below. any future net favorable changes to these assumptions could result in a lower projected present value of future cash flows and additional margin in our premium deficiency test and higher income over the remaining duration of the portfolio, including higher investment income. the assumptions within our future policy benefit reserves are subject to significant uncertainties, including those inherent in the complex nature of our reinsurance treaties. many of our assumptions are interdependent and require evaluation individually and in the aggregate across all insurance products. small changes in the amounts used in the sensitivities or the use of different factors could result in materially different outcomes from those reflected below.

statutory considerations. our run-off insurance subsidiaries are required to prepare statutory financial statements in accordance with statutory accounting practices. statutory accounting practices, not gaap, determine the required statutory capital levels of our insurance legal entities.
statutory accounting practices are set forth by the national association of insurance commissioners (naic) as well as state laws, regulation and general administrative rules and differ in certain respects from gaap. under statutory accounting practices, base formulaic reserve assumptions typically do not change unless approved by our primary regulator, kid. in addition to base reserves, statutory accounting practices require additional actuarial reserves (aar) be established based on results of asset adequacy testing reflecting moderately adverse conditions (i.e., assumptions include a provision for adverse deviation (pad) rather than current assumptions without a pad as required for premium deficiency testing under gaap). as a result, our statutory asset adequacy testing assumptions reflect less long-term care insurance morbidity improvement and for shorter durations, restrictions on future long-term care insurance premium rate increases, no life insurance mortality improvement and a lower discount rate, among other differences. as a result, several of the sensitivities described in the table above would be less impactful on our statutory reserves.
the adverse impact on our statutory aar arising from our revised assumptions in 2017, including the collectability of reinsurance recoverables, is expected to require ge capital to contribute approximately $14.5 billion additional capital, to its run-off insurance operations in 2018-2024. for statutory accounting purposes, kid approved our request for a permitted accounting practice to recognize the 2017 aar increase over a seven-year period. ge capital provided capital contributions to its insurance subsidiaries of $2.0 billion, $1.9 billion and $3.5 billion in the first quarter of 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. ge capital expects to provide further capital contributions of approximately $7 billion through 2024 (of which approximately $2.0 billion is expected to be contributed in the first quarter of 2021, pending completion of our december 31, 2020 statutory reporting process, which includes asset adequacy testing), subject to ongoing monitoring by kid. ge is a party to capital maintenance agreements with erac and uflic under which ge is required to maintain their minimum statutory capital levels at 300% of their year-end authorized control level risk-based capital requirements as defined from time to time by the naic.
if our future policy benefit reserves established under gaap are realized over the estimated remaining life of our run-off insurance obligations, we would expect the $14.5 billion of capital contributed to the run-off insurance operations over the 2018 to 2024 period to be considered statutory capital surplus at the end of the estimated remaining life with no additional charge to gaap earnings. however, should the more conservative statutory assumptions be realized, we would be required to record the difference between gaap assumptions and statutory assumptions as a charge to gaap earnings in the future periods.

new accounting standards. the financial accounting standards board (fasb) issued asu no. 2018-12, financial services - insurance (topic 944): targeted improvements to the accounting for long-duration contracts with an effective date for periods beginning after december 31, 2021, with an election to adopt early. on november 5, 2020, the fasb issued asu 2020-11, financial services - insurance (topic 944): effective date and early application which defers the effective date for all insurance entities by one year and allows the early application transition date to be either the beginning of the prior period or the earliest prior period presented. we are evaluating the effect of the standard on our consolidated financial statements and anticipate that its adoption will significantly change the accounting for measurements of our long-duration insurance liabilities. the asu requires cash flow assumptions used in the measurement of various insurance liabilities to be reviewed at least annually and updated if actual experience or other evidence indicates previous assumptions need to be revised with any required changes recorded in earnings. under the current accounting guidance, the discount rate is based on expected investment yields, while under the asu the discount rate will be equivalent to the upper-medium grade (i.e., single a) fixed-income instrument yield reflecting the duration characteristics of the liability and is required to be updated in each reporting period with changes recorded in other comprehensive income. in measuring the insurance liabilities under the new standard, contracts shall not be grouped together from different issue years. these changes result in the elimination of premium deficiency testing and shadow adjustments. while we continue to evaluate the effect of the standard on our ongoing financial reporting, we anticipate that the adoption of the asu will materially affect our financial statements. as the asu is only applicable to the measurements of our long-duration insurance liabilities under gaap, it will not affect the accounting for our insurance reserves or the levels of capital and surplus under statutory accounting practices.
non-gaap financial measures. we believe that presenting non-gaap financial measures provides management and investors useful measures to evaluate performance and trends of the total company and its businesses. this includes adjustments in recent periods to gaap financial measures to increase period-to-period comparability following actions to strengthen our overall financial position and how we manage our business.
in addition, management recognizes that certain non-gaap terms may be interpreted differently by other companies under different circumstances. in various sections of this report we have made reference to the following non-gaap financial measures in describing our (1) revenues, specifically ge industrial organic revenues by segment; biopharma organic revenues, ge industrial organic revenues, and ge industrial equipment and services organic revenues (2) profit, specifically ge industrial organic profit and profit margin by segment; biopharma organic profit and profit margin, adjusted ge industrial profit and profit margin (excluding certain items); adjusted ge industrial organic profit and profit margin; adjusted earnings (loss); and adjusted earnings (loss) per share (eps), and (3) debt balances, specifically ge industrial net debt. the reasons we use these non-gaap financial measures and the reconciliations to their most directly comparable gaap financial measures follow.

(a) earnings for per-share calculation includes allocation of participating securities pursuant to the two-class method. see note 18 for further information. earnings-per-share amounts are computed independently. as a result, the sum of per-share amounts may not equal the total.
(b) see the corporate items and eliminations section for further information.
the service cost for our pension and other benefit plans are included in adjusted earnings*, which represents the ongoing cost of providing pension benefits to our employees. the components of non-operating benefit costs are mainly driven by capital allocation decisions and market performance. we believe the retained costs in adjusted earnings* and adjusted eps* provides management and investors a useful measure to evaluate the performance of the total company and increases period-to-period comparability. we also use adjusted eps* as a performance metric at the company level for our annual executive incentive plan for 2020. we believe presenting adjusted industrial earnings* and adjusted industrial eps* separately for our financial services businesses also provides management and investors with useful information about the relative size of our industrial and financial services businesses in relation to the total company.

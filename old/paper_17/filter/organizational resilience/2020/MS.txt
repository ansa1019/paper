risk factors").
we have established procedures based on legal and regulatory requirements on a worldwide basis that are designed to facilitate compliance with applicable statutory and regulatory requirements and to require that our policies relating to business conduct, ethics and practices are followed globally. in addition, we have established procedures to mitigate the risk that a counterparty's performance obligations will be unenforceable, including consideration of counterparty legal authority and capacity, adequacy of legal documentation, the permissibility of a transaction under applicable law and whether applicable bankruptcy or insolvency laws limit or alter contractual remedies. the heightened legal and regulatory focus on the financial services and banking industries globally presents a continuing business challenge for us.
december 2020 form 10-k financial statements and supplementary data report of independent registered public accounting firm to the shareholders and the board of directors of morgan stanley:
opinion on the financial statements we have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of morgan stanley and subsidiaries (the "firm") as of december 31, 2020 and 2019, the related consolidated income statements, comprehensive income statements, cash flow statements and statements of changes in total equity for each of the three years ended december 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the "financial statements"). in our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the firm as of december 31, 2020 and 2019, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years ended december 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america.
we have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board (united states) (pcaob), the firm's internal control over financial reporting as of december 31, 2020, based on criteria established in internal control - integrated framework (2013) issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission and our report dated february 26, 2021, expressed an unqualified opinion on the firm's internal control over financial reporting.
basis for opinion these financial statements are the responsibility of the firm's management. our responsibility is to express an opinion on the firm's financial statements based on our audits. we are a public accounting firm registered with the pcaob and are required to be independent with respect to the firm in accordance with the u.s. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the securities and exchange commission and the pcaob.
we conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the pcaob. those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. we believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
critical audit matters the critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. the communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.
valuation of level 3 financial assets and liabilities carried at fair value-refer to note 5 to the financial statements critical audit matter description the firm's trading and financing activities result in the firm carrying material financial instruments having limited price transparency. these financial instruments can span a broad array of product types and generally include derivative, security, loan, and borrowing positions. as described in note 5, these level 3 financial instruments approximate $18.4 billion and $10.2 billion, respectively, of financial assets and liabilities accounted for at fair value on a recurring basis at december 31, 2020. unlike financial instruments whose inputs are readily observable and, therefore, more easily independently corroborated, the valuation of financial instruments classified as level 3 is inherently subjective and often involves the use of unobservable inputs, as well as proprietary valuation models whose underlying algorithms and valuation methodologies are complex.
we identified the valuation of level 3 financial assets and liabilities carried at fair value as a critical audit matter given the firm uses complex valuation models and/or model inputs that are not observable in the marketplace to determine the respective fair values. performing our audit procedures to evaluate the appropriateness of these models and inputs involved a high degree of auditor judgment, professionals with specialized skills and knowledge, and an increased extent of testing.
december 2020 form 10-k how the critical audit matter was addressed in the audit our audit procedures related to the valuation estimate for financial instruments that are classified as level 3 included the following, among others:
•we tested the design and operating effectiveness of the firm's valuation controls, including model review and price verification, which are designed to test the appropriateness of the firm's valuation methodologies as well as the relevant inputs, and assumptions used to determine the fair value estimates.
•we independently evaluated the appropriateness of management's significant valuation methodologies, including the input assumptions, considering the expected assumptions of other market participants, and external data, when available.
•we developed independent valuation estimates for certain financial instrument selections, using externally sourced inputs and independent valuation models, and used such estimates to further evaluate management's fair value estimate, including comparing the estimate with similar transactions and evaluating the firm's assumptions inclusive of the inputs, as applicable.
•we tested the revenues arising from the trade date valuation estimate for certain structured transactions classified as level 3 financial instruments. for a selection of such transactions we developed independent valuation estimates to test the valuation inputs and assumptions used by the firm and evaluated whether the methods were consistent with relevant firm valuation policies.
•we assessed the consistency by which management has applied significant and unobservable valuation assumptions.
•we performed a retrospective assessment of management's valuation estimates for a sample of financial instrument selections by comparing such estimates to relevant transactions.
intangible assets-valuation of customer relationship intangible assets for the e*trade financial corporation ("e*trade") acquisition-refer to note 3 to the financial statements critical audit matter description on october 2, 2020, the firm completed the acquisition of e*trade for approximately $11.9 billion. the firm accounted for the acquisition under the acquisition method of accounting for business combinations. accordingly, the purchase price was allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their respective fair values, including identified intangibles of approximately $3.3 billion. of the identified intangible assets acquired, the most significant were the customer relationship intangible assets of $2.8 billion. management, with the assistance of a valuation specialist, estimated the fair value of customer relationship intangible assets using the income approach, which determines the fair value as the present value of forecasted future cash flows. the determination of fair value of the assets involves significant estimates and assumptions related to forecasted future cash flows and the selection of the respective discount rate.
we identified the valuation of customer relationship intangible assets as a critical audit matter because the fair value determination requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions in determining the forecasted future cash flows including revenue growth rates and attrition rates as well as the selection of the discount rate. performing audit procedures to evaluate the reasonableness of these estimates and assumptions required a high degree of auditor judgment and an increased extent of effort, including the involvement of our valuation specialists.
how the critical audit matter was addressed in the audit our audit procedures related to the valuation of customer relationship intangible assets acquired as part of the e*trade acquisition included the following, among others:
•we tested the operating effectiveness of internal controls over the valuation methodology used, the determination of forecasted future cash flows, and the selection of the discount rate.
•we assessed the knowledge, skill, ability and objectivity of management's valuation specialist and evaluated the work performed.
•we evaluated the appropriateness of the valuation methodology used and the reasonableness of the forecasted future cash flows for each selected customer relationship intangible asset, specifically the assumptions relating to revenue growth and attrition rates, as well as whether the assumptions used were reasonable considering external market and industry data as well as the past performance of e*trade. we also performed sensitivity analyses to evaluate the impact of changes in assumptions to the valuation of the customer relationship intangible assets.
•we tested the source information underlying the determination of the discount rates and attrition rates and also tested the mathematical accuracy of the calculations.
•we developed a range of independent estimates of discount rates for the selected customer relationship intangible assets and compared those to the respective discount rate utilized by management.
we have served as the firm's auditor since 1997.

institutional securities provides investment banking, sales and trading, lending and other services to corporations, governments, financial institutions and high to ultra-high net worth clients. investment banking services consist of capital raising and financial advisory services, including services relating to the underwriting of debt, equity and other securities, as well as advice on mergers and acquisitions, restructurings, real estate and project finance. sales and trading services include sales, financing, prime brokerage and market-making activities in the equity and fixed income businesses. lending activities include originating corporate loans and commercial real estate loans, providing secured lending facilities, and extending financing to sales and trading customers. other activities include asia wealth management services, investments and research.
wealth management provides a comprehensive array of financial services and solutions to individual investors and small to medium-sized businesses and institutions covering: financial advisor-led brokerage and investment advisory services; self-directed brokerage services, including through the e*trade platform; financial and wealth planning services; workplace services including stock plan administration; annuity and insurance products; securities-based lending, residential real estate loans and other lending products; banking; and retirement plan services.
investment management provides a broad range of investment strategies and products that span geographies, asset classes, and public and private markets to a diverse group of clients across institutional and intermediary channels. strategies and products, which are offered through a variety of investment vehicles, include equity, fixed income, liquidity and alternative/other products. institutional clients include defined benefit/defined contribution plans, foundations, endowments, government entities, sovereign wealth funds, insurance companies, third-party fund sponsors and corporations. individual clients are generally served through intermediaries, including affiliated and non-affiliated distributors.
basis of financial information the financial statements are prepared in accordance with u.s. gaap, which requires the firm to make estimates and assumptions regarding the valuations of certain financial instruments, the valuations of goodwill and intangible assets, the outcome of legal and tax matters, deferred tax assets, acl, and other matters that affect its financial statements and related disclosures. the firm believes that the estimates utilized in the preparation of its financial statements are prudent and reasonable. actual results could differ materially from these estimates.
certain reclassifications have been made to prior periods to conform to the current presentation. the notes are an integral part of the firm's financial statements. the firm has evaluated subsequent events for adjustment to or disclosure in these financial statements through the date of this report and has not identified any recordable or disclosable events not otherwise reported in these financial statements or the notes thereto.
consolidation the financial statements include the accounts of the firm, its wholly owned subsidiaries and other entities in which the firm has a controlling financial interest, including certain vies (see note 16). intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated. for consolidated subsidiaries that are not wholly owned, the third-party holdings of equity interests are referred to as noncontrolling interests. the net income attributable to noncontrolling interests for such subsidiaries is presented as net income applicable to noncontrolling interests in the income statements. the portion of shareholders' equity that is attributable to noncontrolling interests for such subsidiaries is presented as noncontrolling interests, a component of total equity, in the balance sheets.
for entities where the total equity investment at risk is sufficient to enable the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support and the equity holders bear the residual economic risks and returns of the entity and have the power to direct the activities of the entity that most significantly affect its economic performance, the firm consolidates those entities it controls either through a majority voting interest or otherwise. for vies (i.e., entities that do not meet the aforementioned criteria), the firm consolidates those entities where it has the power to make the decisions that most significantly affect the economic performance of the vie and has the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits that could potentially be significant to the vie.
december 2020 form 10-k notes to consolidated financial statements for investments in entities in which the firm does not have a controlling financial interest but has significant influence over operating and financial decisions, it applies the equity method of accounting with net gains and losses recorded within other revenues (see note 12) unless the firm has elected to measure the investment at fair value, in which case net gains and losses are recorded within investments revenues (see note 5).
the firm's significant regulated u.s. and international subsidiaries include:
2. significant accounting policies revenue recognition revenues are recognized when the promised goods or services are delivered to our customers, in an amount that is based on the consideration the firm expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services when such amounts are not probable of significant reversal.
investment banking revenues from investment banking activities consist of revenues earned from underwriting, primarily equity and fixed income securities and loan syndications, and advisory fees, primarily for mergers, acquisitions and restructurings.
underwriting revenues are generally recognized on trade date if there is no uncertainty or contingency related to the amount to be paid. underwriting costs are deferred and recognized in the relevant non-interest expenses line items when the related underwriting revenues are recorded.
advisory fees are recognized as advice is provided to the client, based on the estimated progress of work and when revenues are not probable of a significant reversal. advisory costs are recognized as incurred in the relevant non-interest expenses line items, including those reimbursed.
commissions and fees commission and fee revenues generally result from transaction-based arrangements in which the client is charged a fee for the execution of transactions. such revenues primarily arise from transactions in equity securities; services related to sales and trading activities; and sales of mutual funds, alternative funds, futures, insurance products and options, as well as revenues from order flow payments for directing customer orders to broker-dealers, exchanges, and market centers for execution. commission and fee revenues are recognized on trade date when the performance obligation is satisfied.
asset management revenues asset management, distribution and administration fees are generally based on related asset levels being managed, such as the aum of a customer's account or the net asset value of a fund. these fees are generally recognized when services are performed and the fees become known. management fees are reduced by estimated fee waivers and expense caps, if any, provided to the customer.
performance-based fees not in the form of carried interest are recorded when the annual performance target is met and the revenues are not probable of a significant reversal.
sales commissions paid by the firm in connection with the sale of certain classes of shares of its open-end mutual fund products are accounted for as deferred commission assets and amortized to expense over the expected life of the contract. the firm periodically tests deferred commission assets for recoverability based on cash flows expected to be received in future periods. other asset management and distribution costs are recognized as incurred in the relevant non-interest expenses line items.
carried interest the firm is entitled to receive performance-based fees in the form of carried interest when the return in certain funds exceeds specified performance targets. when the firm earns carried interest from funds as specified performance thresholds are met, that carried interest and any related general or limited partner interest is accounted for under the equity method of accounting and measured based on the firm's claim on the nav of the fund at the reporting date, taking into account the distribution terms applicable to the interest held.
see note 23 for information regarding the net cumulative unrealized amount of performance-based fee revenues at risk of reversal. see note 15 for information regarding general partner guarantees, which include potential obligations to return performance fee distributions previously received.
other items revenues from certain commodities-related contracts are recognized as the promised goods or services are delivered to the customer.
receivables from contracts with customers are recognized in customer and other receivables in the balance sheets when december 2020 form 10-k notes to consolidated financial statements the underlying performance obligations have been satisfied and the firm has the right per the contract to bill the customer. contract assets are recognized in other assets when the firm has satisfied its performance obligations but customer payment is conditional. contract liabilities are recognized in other liabilities when the firm has collected payment from a customer based on the terms of the contract, but the underlying performance obligations are not yet satisfied.
for contracts with a term of less than one year, incremental costs to obtain the contract are expensed as incurred. revenues are not discounted when payment is expected within one year.
the firm generally presents, net within revenues, taxes assessed by a governmental authority that are both imposed on and concurrent with a specific revenue-producing transaction and collected by the firm from a customer.
fair value of financial instruments instruments within trading assets and trading liabilities are measured at fair value, either as required or allowed by accounting guidance. these financial instruments primarily represent the firm's trading and investment positions and include both cash and derivative products. in addition, securities classified as afs are measured at fair value.
interest income and interest expense are recorded within the income statements depending on the nature of the instrument and related market conventions. when interest is included as a component of the instruments' fair value, interest is recorded within trading revenues or investments revenues. otherwise, it is recorded within interest income or interest expense. dividend income is recorded in trading revenues or investments revenues depending on the business activity.
the fair value of otc financial instruments, including derivative contracts related to financial instruments and commodities, is presented in the accompanying balance sheets on a net-by-counterparty basis, when appropriate. additionally, the firm nets the fair value of cash collateral paid or received against the fair value amounts recognized for net derivative positions executed with the same counterparty under the same master netting agreement.
fair value option the firm has elected to measure certain eligible instruments at fair value, including securities purchased under agreements to resell, loans and lending commitments, equity method investments and certain other assets, deposits, securities sold under agreements to repurchase, other secured financings and borrowings.
fair value measurement-definition and hierarchy fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability (i.e., the "exit price") in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.
fair value is a market-based measure considered from the perspective of a market participant rather than an entity-specific measure. therefore, even when market assumptions are not readily available, assumptions are set to reflect those that the firm believes market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability at the measurement date. where the firm manages a group of financial assets, financial liabilities, and nonfinancial items accounted for as derivatives on the basis of its net exposure to either market risks or credit risk, the firm measures the fair value of that group of financial instruments consistently with how market participants would price the net risk exposure at the measurement date.
in determining fair value, the firm uses various valuation approaches and establishes a hierarchy for inputs used in measuring fair value that requires the most observable inputs be used when available.
observable inputs are inputs that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability that were developed based on market data obtained from sources independent of the firm. unobservable inputs are inputs that reflect assumptions the firm believes other market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability that are developed based on the best information available in the circumstances. the fair value hierarchy is broken down into three levels based on the observability of inputs as follows, with level 1 being the highest and level 3 being the lowest level:
level 1.    valuations based on quoted prices in active markets that the firm has the ability to access for identical assets or liabilities. valuation adjustments, block discounts and discounts for entity-specific restrictions that would not transfer to market participants are not applied to level 1 instruments. since valuations are based on quoted prices that are readily and regularly available in an active market, valuation of these products does not entail a significant degree of judgment.
level 2.    valuations based on one or more quoted prices in markets that are not active or for which all significant inputs are observable, either directly or indirectly.
the availability of observable inputs can vary from product to product and is affected by a wide variety of factors, including december 2020 form 10-k notes to consolidated financial statements the type of product, whether the product is new and not yet established in the marketplace, the liquidity of markets and other characteristics particular to the product. to the extent that valuation is based on models or inputs that are less observable or unobservable in the market, the determination of fair value requires more judgment. accordingly, the degree of judgment exercised by the firm in determining fair value is greatest for instruments categorized in level 3 of the fair value hierarchy.
the firm considers prices and inputs that are current as of the measurement date, including during periods of market dislocation. in periods of market dislocation, the observability of prices and inputs may be reduced for many instruments. this condition could cause an instrument to be reclassified from level 1 to level 2 or from level 2 to level 3 of the fair value hierarchy.
in certain cases, the inputs used to measure fair value may fall into different levels of the fair value hierarchy. in such cases, the total fair value amount is disclosed in the level appropriate for the lowest level input that is significant to the total fair value of the asset or liability.
valuation techniques many cash instruments and otc derivative contracts have bid and ask prices that can be observed in the marketplace. bid prices reflect the highest price that a party is willing to pay for an asset. ask prices represent the lowest price that a party is willing to accept for an asset. the firm carries positions at the point within the bid-ask range that meets its best estimate of fair value. for offsetting positions in the same financial instrument, the same price within the bid-ask spread is used to measure both the long and short positions.
fair value for many cash instruments and otc derivative contracts is derived using pricing models. pricing models take into account the contract terms, as well as multiple inputs, including, where applicable, commodity prices, equity prices, interest rate yield curves, credit curves, correlation, creditworthiness of the counterparty, creditworthiness of the firm, option volatility and currency rates.
where appropriate, valuation adjustments are made to account for various factors such as liquidity risk (bid-ask adjustments), credit quality, model uncertainty and concentration risk and funding. adjustments for liquidity risk adjust model-derived mid-market amounts of level 2 and level 3 financial instruments for the bid-mid or mid-ask spread required to properly reflect the exit price of a risk position. bid-mid and mid-ask spreads are marked to levels observed in trade activity, broker quotes or other external third-party data. where these spreads are unobservable for the particular position in question, spreads are derived from observable levels of similar positions.
the firm applies credit-related valuation adjustments to its borrowings for which the fair value option was elected and to otc derivatives. the firm considers the impact of changes in its own credit spreads based upon observations of the secondary bond market spreads when measuring the fair value for borrowings.
for otc derivatives, the impact of changes in both the firm's and the counterparty's credit rating is considered when measuring fair value. in determining the expected exposure, the firm simulates the distribution of the future exposure to a counterparty, then applies market-based default probabilities to the future exposure, leveraging external third-party cds spread data. where cds spread data are unavailable for a specific counterparty, bond market spreads, cds spread data based on the counterparty's credit rating or cds spread data that reference a comparable counterparty may be utilized. the firm also considers collateral held and legally enforceable master netting agreements that mitigate its exposure to each counterparty.
adjustments for model uncertainty are taken for positions whose underlying models are reliant on significant inputs that are neither directly nor indirectly observable, hence requiring reliance on established theoretical concepts in their derivation. these adjustments are derived by making assessments of the possible degree of variability using statistical approaches and market-based information where possible.
the firm may apply concentration adjustments to certain of its otc derivative portfolios to reflect the additional cost of closing out a particularly large risk exposure. where possible, these adjustments are based on observable market information, but in many instances, significant judgment is required to estimate the costs of closing out concentrated risk exposures due to the lack of liquidity in the marketplace.
the firm applies an fva in the fair value measurements of otc uncollateralized or partially collateralized derivatives and in collateralized derivatives where the terms of the agreement do not permit the reuse of the collateral received. in general, fva reflects a market funding risk premium inherent in the noted derivative instruments. the methodology for measuring fva leverages the firm's existing credit-related valuation adjustment calculation methodologies, which apply to both assets and liabilities.
see note 5 for a description of valuation techniques applied to the major categories of financial instruments measured at fair value.
assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis certain of the firm's assets and liabilities are measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis. the firm incurs losses or gains for any adjustments of these assets or liabilities to fair value.
for assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis, fair value is determined by using various december 2020 form 10-k notes to consolidated financial statements valuation approaches. the same hierarchy for inputs as described above, which requires that observable inputs be used when available, is used in measuring fair value for these items.
for further information on financial assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring and non-recurring basis, see note 5.
offsetting of derivative instruments in connection with its derivative activities, the firm generally enters into master netting agreements and collateral agreements with its counterparties. these agreements provide the firm with the right, in the event of a default by the counterparty, to net a counterparty's rights and obligations under the agreement and to liquidate and set off cash collateral against any net amount owed by the counterparty. derivatives with enforceable master netting agreements are reported net of cash collateral received and posted.
however, in certain circumstances, the firm may not have such an agreement in place; the relevant insolvency regime may not support the enforceability of the master netting agreement or collateral agreement; or the firm may not have sought legal advice to support the enforceability of the agreement. in cases where the firm has not determined an agreement to be enforceable, the related amounts are not offset (see note 7).
the firm's policy is generally to receive cash and/or securities posted as collateral (with rights of rehypothecation), irrespective of the enforceability determination regarding the master netting and collateral agreement. in certain cases, the firm may agree for such collateral to be posted to a third-party custodian under a control agreement that enables it to take control of such collateral in the event of a counterparty default. the enforceability of the master netting agreement is taken into account in the firm's risk management practices and application of counterparty credit limits.
for information related to offsetting of derivatives, see note 7.
hedge accounting the firm applies hedge accounting using various derivative financial instruments for the following types of hedges: hedges of changes in the fair value of assets and liabilities due to the risk being hedged (fair value hedges); and hedges of net investments in foreign operations whose functional currency is different from the reporting currency of the parent company (net investment hedges). these financial instruments are included within trading assets-derivative and other contracts or trading liabilities-derivative and other contracts in the balance sheets. for hedges where hedge accounting is being applied, the firm performs effectiveness testing and other procedures.
fair value hedges-interest rate risk the firm's designated fair value hedges consist of interest rate swaps designated as hedges of changes in the benchmark interest rate of certain fixed rate afs securities and senior borrowings. in the fourth quarter of 2019, the firm also began designating interest rate swaps as fair value hedges of changes in the benchmark interest rate of certain fixed rate deposits. the firm is permitted to hedge the full, or part of the, contractual term of the hedged instrument. the firm uses regression analysis to perform an ongoing prospective and retrospective assessment of the effectiveness of these hedging relationships. a hedging relationship is deemed effective if the change in fair value of the hedging instrument (derivative) and the change in fair value of the hedged item (afs security, deposit liability or borrowing), due to changes in the benchmark interest rate, offset within a range of 80% to 125%. the firm considers the impact of valuation adjustments related to counterparty credit spreads and its own credit spreads to determine whether they would cause the hedging relationship to be ineffective.
for qualifying fair value hedges of benchmark interest rates, the change in the fair value of the derivative, offset by the change in the fair value attributable to the change in the benchmark interest rate risk of the hedged asset (liability), is recognized in earnings each period as a component of interest income (expense). for afs securities, the change in fair value of the hedged item due to changes other than the risk being hedged will continue to be reported in oci. when a derivative is de-designated as a hedge, any basis adjustment remaining on the hedged asset (liability) is amortized to interest income (expense) over the remaining life of the asset (liability) using the effective interest method.
net investment hedges the firm uses forward foreign exchange contracts to manage a portion of the currency exposure relating to its net investments in foreign operations. to the extent that the notional amounts of the hedging instruments equal the portion of the investments being hedged and the underlying exchange rate of the derivative hedging instrument is the same as the exchange rate between the functional currency of the investee and the intermediate parent entity's functional currency, it is considered to be perfectly effective, with no income statement recognition. the gain or loss from revaluing hedges of net investments in foreign operations at the spot rate is reported within aoci. the forward points on the hedging instruments are excluded from hedge effectiveness testing and changes in the fair value of this excluded component are recorded currently in interest income.
for further information on derivative instruments and hedging activities, see note 7.
afs investment securities afs securities are reported at fair value in the balance sheets. interest income, including amortization of premiums and december 2020 form 10-k notes to consolidated financial statements accretion of discounts, is included in interest income in the income statements. unrealized gains are recorded in oci and unrealized losses are recorded either in oci or in other revenues as described below.
afs securities in an unrealized loss position are first evaluated to determine whether there is an intent to sell or it is more likely than not the firm will be required to sell before recovery of the amortized cost basis. if so, the amortized cost basis is written down to the fair value of the security such that the entire unrealized loss is recognized in other revenues and any previously established acl is written off.
for all other afs securities in an unrealized loss position, any portion of unrealized losses representing a credit loss is recognized in other revenues and as an increase to the acl for afs securities, with the remainder of unrealized losses recognized in oci. a credit loss exists if the firm does not expect to recover the amortized cost basis of the security. when considering whether a credit loss exists, the firm considers relevant information, including:
•adverse conditions specifically related to the security, its industry or geographic area;
•changes in the financial condition of the issuer of the security, or, in the case of an asset-backed debt security, changes in the financial condition of the underlying loan obligors;
•the payment structure of the debt security and the likelihood of the issuer being able to make payments that increase in the future;
•failure of the issuer of the security to make scheduled interest or principal payments;
•the current rating and any changes to the rating of the security by a rating agency.
if a credit loss exists, the firm measures the credit loss as the difference between the present value of cash flows expected to be collected (discounted at the implicit interest rate at acquisition of the security or discounted at the effective yield for securities that incorporate changes in prepayment assumptions) and the amortized cost basis of the security. changes in prepayment assumptions alone are not considered to result in a credit loss. when estimating the present value of expected cash flows, information utilized includes the remaining payment terms of the security, prepayment speeds, financial condition of the issuer, expected defaults and the value of any underlying collateral.

htm securities htm securities are reported at amortized cost, net of any acl, in the balance sheets. refer to "allowance for credit losses" herein for guidance on the acl determination. interest income, including amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts on htm securities, is included in interest income in the income statements.
loans the firm accounts for loans based on the following categories: loans held for investment; loans held for sale; and loans at fair value.
nonaccrual all loan categories described below follow the same nonaccrual and write-off guidance as discussed in "allowance for credit losses" herein.
loans held for investment loans held for investment are reported at outstanding principal adjusted for any charge-offs, the allowance for loan losses, any unamortized deferred fees or costs for originated loans, and any unamortized premiums or discounts for purchased loans.
interest income.    interest income on performing loans held for investment is accrued and recognized as interest income at the contractual rate of interest. purchase price discounts or premiums, as well as net deferred loan fees or costs, are amortized into interest income over the life of the loan to produce a level rate of return.
lending commitments.    the firm records the liability and related expense for the credit exposure related to commitments to fund loans. for more information regarding loan commitments, standby letters of credit and financial guarantees, see note 15.
for more information regarding allowance for credit losses, refer to "allowance for credit losses" herein.
loans held for sale loans held for sale are measured at the lower of cost or fair value, with valuation changes recorded in other revenues. the firm determines the valuation allowance on an individual loan basis, except for residential mortgage loans for which the valuation allowance is determined at the loan product level. any decreases in fair value below the initial carrying amount december 2020 form 10-k notes to consolidated financial statements and any recoveries in fair value up to the initial carrying amount are recorded in other revenues. increases in fair value above initial carrying value are not recognized.
interest income. interest income on loans held for sale is accrued and recognized based on the contractual rate of interest. loan origination fees or costs and purchase price discounts or premiums are deferred as an adjustment to the loan's cost basis until the related loan is sold and, as such, are included in the periodic determination of the lower of cost or fair value adjustments and the gain or loss recognized at the time of sale.
lending commitments. commitments to fund mortgage loans held for sale are derivatives and are reported in trading assets or trading liabilities in the balance sheets with an offset to trading revenues in the income statements.
for commitments to fund non-mortgage loans, the firm records the liability and related expense for the fair value exposure below cost of such commitments in other liabilities and accrued expenses in the balance sheets with an offset to other revenues in the income statements.
because loans and lending commitments held for sale are recognized at the lower of cost or fair value, the allowance for loan losses and charge-off policies do not apply to these loans.
loans at fair value loans for which the fair value option is elected are carried at fair value, with changes in fair value recognized in earnings. loans carried at fair value are not evaluated for purposes of recording an allowance for loan losses. for further information on loans carried at fair value and classified as trading assets and trading liabilities, see note 5.
lending commitments. the firm records the liability and related expense for the fair value exposure related to commitments to fund loans that will be measured at fair value. the liability is recorded in trading liabilities in the balance sheets, and the expense is recorded in trading revenues in the income statements.
because such loans and lending commitments are reported at fair value, the allowance for loan losses and charge-off policies do not apply to these loans.
for further information on loans, see note 10.
allowance for credit losses the acl for financial instruments measured at amortized cost and certain off-balance sheet exposures (e.g., hfi loans and lending commitments, htm securities, customer and other receivables and certain guarantees) represents an estimate of expected credit losses over the entire life of the financial instrument.
factors considered by management when determining the acl include payment status, fair value of collateral and expected payments of principal and interest, as well as internal or external information relating to past events, current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts. the firm uses three forecasts that include assumptions about certain macroeconomic variables including, but not limited to, u.s. gross domestic product ("gdp"), equity market indices and unemployment rates, as well as commercial real estate and home price indices. at the conclusion of the firm's reasonable and supportable forecast period of 13 quarters, there is a gradual reversion back to historical averages.
the acl is measured on a collective basis when similar risk characteristics exist for multiple instruments considering all available information relevant to assessing the collectability of cash flows. generally, the firm applies a probability of default/loss given default model for instruments that are collectively assessed, under which the acl is calculated as the product of probability of default, loss given default and exposure at default. these parameters are forecast for each collective group of assets using a scenario-based statistical model.
if the instrument does not share similar risk characteristics with other instruments, including when it is probable that the firm will be unable to collect the full payment of principal and interest on the instrument when due, the acl is measured on an individual basis. the firm generally applies a discounted cash flow method for instruments that are individually assessed.
the firm may also elect to use an approach that considers the fair value of the collateral when measuring the acl if the loan is collateral dependent (i.e., repayment of the loan is expected to be provided substantially by the sale or operation of the underlying collateral and the borrower is experiencing financial difficulty).
additionally, the firm can elect to use an approach to measure the acl using the fair value of collateral where the borrower is required to, and reasonably expected to, continually adjust and replenish the amount of collateral securing the instrument to reflect changes in the fair value of such collateral. the firm has elected to use this approach for certain securities-based loans, margin loans, securities purchased under agreements to resell and securities borrowed.
•corporate loans, secured lending facilities, commercial real estate loans and securities, and other loans: internal risk ratings developed by the credit risk management department that are refreshed at least annually, and more frequently as necessary. these ratings generally correspond to external ratings published by s&p. the firm also december 2020 form 10-k notes to consolidated financial statements considers transaction structure, including type of collateral, collateral terms and position of the obligation within the capital structure. in addition, for commercial real estate, the firm considers property type and location, net operating income and ltv ratios, among other factors, as well as commercial real estate price and credit spread indices and capitalization rates.
•employee loans: employment status, which includes those currently employed by the firm and for which the firm can deduct any unpaid amounts due to it through certain compensation arrangements; and those no longer employed by the firm where such arrangements are no longer applicable.
for securities-based loans, the firm generally measures the acl based on the fair value of collateral.
qualitative and environmental factors such as economic and business conditions, the nature and volume of the portfolio, and lending terms and the volume and severity of past due loans are also considered in the acl calculations.
presentation of acl and provision for credit losses acl                                          provision for credit losses instruments measured at amortized cost (e.g., hfi loans, htm securities and customer and other receivables)       contra asset                                 other revenue employee loans                                                                                                    contra asset                                 compensation and benefits expense off-balance sheet instruments (e.g., hfi lending commitments and certain guarantees)                              other liabilities and accrued expenses       other expense troubled debt restructurings "tdrs"
the firm may modify the terms of certain loans for economic or legal reasons related to a borrower's financial difficulties by granting one or more concessions that the firm would not otherwise consider. such modifications are accounted for and reported as a tdr, except for certain modifications related to the coronavirus disease ("covid-19") as noted in "modifications and nonaccrual status for borrowers impacted by covid-19" herein. a loan that has been modified in a tdr is generally considered to be impaired and is evaluated individually. tdrs are also generally classified as nonaccrual and may be returned to accrual status only after the firm expects repayment of the remaining contractual principal and interest and there is sustained repayment performance for a reasonable period.
nonaccrual the firm places financial instruments on nonaccrual status if principal or interest is not expected when contractually due or is past due for a period of 90 days or more unless the obligation is well-secured and in the process of collection. for borrowers impacted by covid-19, see "modifications and nonaccrual status for borrowers impacted by covid-19" herein for additional considerations.
for any instrument placed on nonaccrual status, the firm reverses any unpaid interest accrued with an offsetting reduction to interest income. principal and interest payments received on nonaccrual instruments are applied to principal if there is doubt regarding the ultimate collectability of principal. if collection of the principal is not in doubt, interest income is realized on a cash basis. if the instrument is brought current and neither principal or interest collection is in doubt, instruments can generally return to accrual status and interest income can be recognized.
modifications and nonaccrual status for borrowers impacted by covid-19
in the first quarter of 2020, the firm elected to apply the guidance issued by congress in the coronavirus aid, relief, and economic security act ("cares act") as well as by the u.s. banking agencies stating that certain concessions granted to borrowers that are current on existing loans, either individually or as part of a program for creditworthy borrowers who are experiencing short-term financial or operational problems as a result of covid-19, generally would not be considered tdrs. additionally, these loans generally would not be considered nonaccrual unless collectability concerns exist despite the modification provided. for loans remaining on accrual status, the firm elected to continue recognizing interest income during the modification periods.
acl charge-offs the principal balance of a financial instrument is charged off in the period it is deemed uncollectible resulting in a reduction in the acl and the balance of the financial instrument in the balance sheet. accrued interest receivable balances that are separately recorded from the related financial instruments are charged off against interest income when the related financial instrument is placed on nonaccrual. accordingly, the firm elected not to measure an acl for accrued interest receivables. however, in the case of loans that are modified as a result of covid-19 and remain on accrual status due to the relief noted in "modifications and nonaccrual status for borrowers impacted by covid-19" herein, accrued interest receivable balances are assessed for any required acl.
transfers of financial assets transfers of financial assets are accounted for as sales when the firm has relinquished control over the transferred assets. any related gain or loss on sale is recorded in net revenues. transfers that are not accounted for as sales are treated as collateralized financings. securities borrowed or purchased under agreements to resell and securities loaned or sold under december 2020 form 10-k notes to consolidated financial statements agreements to repurchase are treated as collateralized financings (see note 9).
securities purchased under agreements to resell ("reverse repurchase agreements") and securities sold under agreements to repurchase ("repurchase agreements") are carried in the balance sheets at the amount of cash paid or received, plus accrued interest, except for certain reverse repurchase and repurchase agreements for which the firm has elected the fair value option (see note 6). where appropriate, repurchase agreements and reverse repurchase agreements with the same counterparty are reported on a net basis. securities borrowed and securities loaned are recorded at the amount of cash collateral advanced or received.
in instances where the firm is the lender in securities-for-securities transactions and is permitted to sell or repledge these securities, the fair value of the collateral received is reported in trading assets, and the related obligation to return the collateral is reported in trading liabilities in the balance sheets. securities-for-securities transactions where the firm is the borrower are not included in the balance sheets.
in order to manage credit exposure arising from these transactions, in appropriate circumstances, the firm enters into master netting agreements and collateral agreements with its counterparties. these agreements provide the firm with the right, in the event of a default by the counterparty, to net a counterparty's rights and obligations under the agreement and to liquidate and set off collateral held by the firm against the net amount owed by the counterparty.
the firm's policy is generally to take possession of securities purchased or borrowed in connection with reverse repurchase agreements and securities borrowed transactions, respectively, and to receive cash and/or securities delivered under repurchase agreements or securities loaned transactions (with rights of rehypothecation).
for information related to offsetting of certain collateralized transactions, see note 9.
premises, equipment and capitalized software costs premises, equipment and capitalized software costs consist of buildings, leasehold improvements, furniture, fixtures, computer and communications equipment, power generation assets and capitalized software (externally purchased and developed for internal use). premises, equipment and capitalized software costs are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization and are included in other assets in the balance sheets. depreciation and amortization are provided by the straight-line method over the estimated useful life of the asset.

capitalized software costs                                       2 to 10
premises, equipment and capitalized software costs are tested for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances suggest that an asset's carrying value may not be fully recoverable.
goodwill and intangible assets the firm tests goodwill for impairment on an annual basis and on an interim basis when certain events or circumstances exist. the firm tests goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level, which is generally at the level of or one level below its business segments. for both the annual and interim tests, the firm has the option to either (i) perform a quantitative impairment test or (ii) first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, in which case the quantitative test would be performed.
when performing a quantitative impairment test, the firm compares the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount, including goodwill. if the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, the goodwill impairment loss is equal to the excess of the carrying value over the fair value, limited to the carrying amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit.
the estimated fair values of the reporting units are derived based on valuation techniques the firm believes market participants would use for each respective reporting unit. the estimated fair values are generally determined by utilizing a discounted cash flow methodology or methodologies that incorporate price-to-book and price-to-earnings multiples of certain comparable companies.
intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives and are reviewed for impairment on an interim basis when impairment indicators are present. impairment losses are recorded within other expenses in the income statements.
earnings per common share basic eps is computed by dividing earnings available to morgan stanley common shareholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the period. earnings available to morgan stanley common shareholders represents net income applicable to morgan stanley reduced by preferred stock dividends. common shares outstanding include common stock and vested rsus where recipients december 2020 form 10-k notes to consolidated financial statements have satisfied the relevant vesting terms. diluted eps reflects the assumed conversion of all dilutive securities.
share-based awards that pay dividend equivalents subject to vesting are included in diluted shares outstanding (if dilutive) under the treasury stock method.
the firm has granted psus that vest and convert to shares of common stock only if predetermined performance and market goals are satisfied. since the issuance of the shares is contingent upon the satisfaction of certain conditions, the psus are included in diluted eps based on the number of shares (if any) that would be issuable if the reporting date was the end of the performance period.
for further information on diluted earnings (loss) per common share, see note 18 to the financial statements.
deferred compensation stock-based compensation the firm measures compensation expense for stock-based awards at fair value. the firm determines the fair value of rsus (including psus with non-market performance conditions) based on the grant-date fair value of its common stock, measured as the volume-weighted average price on the date of grant ("vwap"). the fair value of rsus not entitled to dividends until conversion is measured at vwap reduced by the present value of dividends expected to be paid on the underlying shares prior to scheduled conversion date. psus that contain market-based conditions are valued using a monte carlo valuation model.
compensation expense is recognized over the vesting period relevant to each separately vesting portion of the award. compensation expense for awards with performance conditions is recognized based on the probable outcome of the performance condition at each reporting date. compensation expense for awards with market-based conditions is recognized irrespective of the probability of the market condition being achieved and is not reversed if the market condition is not met. the firm accounts for forfeitures as they occur.
stock-based awards generally contain clawback and cancellation provisions. certain awards provide the firm discretion to claw back or cancel all or a portion of the award under specified circumstances. compensation expense for those awards is adjusted for changes in the fair value of the firm's common stock or the relevant model valuation, as appropriate, until conversion, exercise or expiration.
employee stock trusts in connection with certain stock-based compensation plans, the firm has established employee stock trusts to provide, at its discretion, common stock voting rights to certain rsu holders. following an rsu award, when a stock trust is utilized, the firm contributes shares to be held in the stock trust until the rsus convert to common shares. the assets of the employee stock trusts are consolidated with those of the firm and are generally accounted for in a manner similar to treasury stock, where the shares of common stock outstanding reported in common stock issued to employee stock trusts are offset by an equal amount reported in employee stock trusts in the balance sheets.
the firm uses the grant-date fair value of stock-based compensation as the basis for recording the movement of the assets to or from the employee stock trusts. changes in the fair value are not recognized as the firm's stock-based compensation must be settled by delivery of a fixed number of shares of the firm's common stock.
deferred cash-based compensation compensation expense for deferred cash-based compensation awards is calculated based on the notional value of the award granted, adjusted for changes in the fair value of the referenced investments that employees select. compensation expense is recognized over the vesting period relevant to each separately vesting portion of the award. compensation expense for these awards is adjusted based on notional earnings of the referenced investments until distribution.
the firm invests directly, as a principal, in financial instruments and other investments to economically hedge certain of its obligations under its deferred cash-based compensation plans. changes in the value of such investments are recorded in trading revenues and investments revenues. although changes in compensation expense resulting from changes in the fair value of the referenced investments will generally be offset by changes in the fair value of investments made by the firm, there is typically a timing difference between the immediate recognition of gains and losses on the firm's investments and the deferred recognition of the related compensation expense over the vesting period.
retirement-eligible employee compensation for year-end stock-based awards and deferred cash-based compensation awards anticipated to be granted to retirement-eligible employees under award terms that do not contain a future service requirement, the firm accrues the estimated cost of the awards over the course of the calendar year preceding the grant date, which reflects the period over which the compensation is earned.
carried interest compensation the firm generally recognizes compensation expense for any portion of carried interest (both realized and unrealized) that is allocated to employees. for information on performance-based fees in the form of carried interest, which are directly related to carried interest compensation, see "revenue recognition-carried interest" herein.
december 2020 form 10-k notes to consolidated financial statements income taxes deferred tax assets and liabilities are recorded based upon the temporary differences between the financial statement and income tax bases of assets and liabilities using currently enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. the effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in income tax expense (benefit) in the period that includes the enactment date. such effects are recorded in income tax expense (benefit) from continuing operations regardless of where deferred taxes were originally recorded.
the firm recognizes net deferred tax assets to the extent that it believes these assets are more likely than not to be realized. in making such a determination, the firm considers all available positive and negative evidence, including future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences, projected future taxable income, tax planning strategies and results of recent operations. when performing the assessment, the firm considers all types of deferred tax assets in combination with each other, regardless of the origin of the underlying temporary difference. if a deferred tax asset is determined to be unrealizable, a valuation allowance is established. if the firm subsequently determines that it would be able to realize deferred tax assets in excess of their net recorded amount, it would make an adjustment to the deferred tax asset valuation allowance, which would reduce the provision for income taxes.
the firm recognizes tax expense associated with global intangible low-taxed income as it is incurred as part of the current income taxes to be paid or refunded for the current period.
uncertain tax positions are recorded on the basis of a two-step process, whereby (i) the firm determines whether it is more likely than not that the tax positions will be sustained on the basis of the technical merits of the position and (ii) for those tax positions that meet this threshold, the firm recognizes the largest amount of tax benefit that is more likely than not to be realized upon ultimate settlement with the related tax authority. interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits are recognized as a component of the provision for income taxes.
foreign currencies assets and liabilities of operations with non-u.s. dollar functional currencies are translated at year-end rates of exchange. gains or losses resulting from translating foreign currency financial statements, net of hedge gains or losses and related tax effects, are reflected in aoci in the balance sheets. gains or losses resulting from remeasurement of foreign currency transactions are included in net income, and amounts recognized in the income statement are translated at the rate of exchange on the respective date of recognition for each amount.
reference rate reform the firm has adopted the reference rate reform accounting update. there was no impact to the firm's financial statements upon initial adoption.
this accounting update provides optional accounting relief to entities with contracts, hedge accounting relationships or other transactions that reference libor or other interest rate benchmarks for which the referenced rate is expected to be discontinued or replaced. the firm is applying the accounting relief as relevant contract and hedge accounting relationship modifications are made during the course of the reference rate reform transition period. the optional relief generally allows for contract modifications solely related to the replacement of the reference rate to be accounted for as a continuation of the existing contract instead of as an extinguishment of the contract and would therefore not trigger certain accounting impacts that would otherwise be required. it also allows entities to change certain critical terms of existing hedge accounting relationships that are affected by reference rate reform, and these changes would not require de-designating the hedge accounting relationship. the optional relief ends december 31, 2022.
financial instruments-credit losses the firm has adopted the financial instruments-credit losses.
this accounting update impacted the impairment model for certain financial assets measured at amortized cost by requiring a cecl methodology to estimate expected credit losses over the entire life of the financial asset, recorded at inception or purchase. cecl replaced the incurred loss model previously applicable to loans held for investment, htm securities and other receivables carried at amortized cost, such as employee loans.
the update also eliminated the concept of other-than-temporary impairment for afs securities and instead requires impairments on afs securities to be recognized in earnings through an allowance when the fair value is less than amortized cost and a credit loss exists, and through a permanent reduction of the amortized cost basis when the securities are expected to be sold before recovery of amortized cost.
at transition on january 1, 2020, the adoption of this accounting standard resulted in an increase in the allowance for credit losses of $131 million with a corresponding reduction in retained earnings of $100 million, net of tax. the adoption impact was primarily attributable to a $124 million increase in the allowance for credit losses on employee loans.
december 2020 form 10-k notes to consolidated financial statements accounting updates adopted in 2019
leases upon the adoption of leases, the firm began recognizing in the balance sheet leases with terms exceeding one year as right-of-use ("rou") assets and corresponding liabilities. the adoption resulted in an increase to retained earnings of approximately $63 million, net of tax, related to deferred revenue from previously recorded sale-leaseback transactions. at transition on january 1, 2019, the adoption also resulted in a balance sheet gross-up of approximately $4 billion reflected in other assets and other liabilities and accrued expenses. see note 10 for lease disclosures, including amounts reflected in the december 31, 2019 balance sheet. prior period amounts were not restated.
as allowed by the guidance, the firm elected not to reassess the following at transition: whether existing contracts are or contain leases; and for existing leases, lease classification and initial direct costs. in addition, the firm continues to account for existing land easements as service contracts.
both at transition and for new leases thereafter, rou assets and lease liabilities are initially recognized based on the present value of the future minimum lease payments over the lease term, including non-lease components such as fixed common area maintenance costs and other fixed costs such as real estate taxes and insurance.
the discount rates used in determining the present value of leases are the firm's incremental borrowing rates, developed based upon each lease's term and currency of payment. the lease term includes options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that the firm will exercise that option. for operating leases, the rou assets also include any prepaid lease payments and initial direct costs incurred and are reduced by lease incentives. for these leases, lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term if the rou asset has not been impaired or abandoned.
the amendments in this update permit use of the ois rate based on the secured overnight financing rate as a u.s. benchmark interest rate for hedge accounting purposes. the firm adopted this update on a prospective basis for qualifying new or redesignated hedging relationships. this update did not impact the firm's pre-existing hedges.
3. acquisitions acquisition of e*trade on october 2, 2020, the firm completed the acquisition of 100% of e*trade financial corporation ("e*trade") in a stock-for-stock transaction, which increases the scale and breadth of the wealth management business segment. total consideration for the transaction was approximately $11.9
billion, which principally consists of the $11 billion fair value of 233 million common shares issued from common stock held in treasury, at an exchange ratio of 1.0432 per e*trade common share. in addition, the firm issued series m and series n preferred shares with a fair value of approximately $0.7 billion in exchange for e*trade's existing preferred stock.
upon acquisition, the assets and liabilities of e*trade were adjusted to their respective fair values as of the closing date of the transaction, including the identifiable intangible assets acquired. in addition, the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net assets acquired has been recorded as goodwill. the fair value estimates used in valuing certain acquired assets and liabilities are based, in part, on inputs that are unobservable. for intangible assets, these include, but are not limited to, forecasted future cash flows, revenue growth rates, customer attrition rates and discount rates.
e*trade purchase price allocation
customer and other receivables                  12,267
customer and other payables                     15,488
1.acquired intangible assets are primarily composed of $2.8 billion related to customer relationships with a weighted-average life of 17 years.
e*trade's results are included in the firm's consolidated results for the period from october 2, 2020 to december 31, 2020. for this period, net revenues were approximately $600 million and net income (loss) was not material.
97                december 2020 form 10-k notes to consolidated financial statements morgan stanley and e*trade proforma combined financial information (unaudited)
the proforma financial information presented in the previous table was computed by combining the historical financial information of the firm and e*trade along with the effects of the acquisition method of accounting for business combinations as though the companies were combined on january 1, 2019. the proforma information does not reflect the potential benefits of cost and funding synergies, opportunities to earn additional revenues, or other factors, and therefore does not represent what the actual net revenues and net income would have been had the companies actually been combined as of this date.
4. cash and cash equivalents cash and cash equivalents consist of cash and due from banks and interest bearing deposits with banks. cash equivalents are highly liquid investments with remaining maturities of three months or less from the acquisition date that are readily convertible to cash and are not held for trading purposes.
cash and cash equivalents also include restricted cash such as cash segregated in compliance with federal or other regulations, including minimum reserve requirements set by the federal reserve bank and other central banks, and the firm's initial margin deposited with clearing organizations.

1.a single amount is disclosed for range and average when there is no significant difference between the minimum, maximum and average. amounts represent weighted averages except where simple averages and the median of the inputs are more relevant.
2.includes derivative contracts with multiple risks (i.e., hybrid products).
the previous tables provide information on the valuation techniques, significant unobservable inputs, and the ranges and averages for each major category of assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring and nonrecurring basis with a significant level 3 balance. the level of aggregation and breadth of products cause the range of inputs to be wide and not evenly distributed across the inventory of financial instruments. further, the range of unobservable inputs may differ across firms in the financial services industry because of diversity in the types of products included in each firm's inventory. generally, there are no predictable relationships between multiple significant unobservable inputs attributable to a given valuation technique.
other than as follows, during 2020, there were no significant revisions made to the descriptions of the firm's significant unobservable inputs. for margin loans, the margin loan rate is the annualized rate that reflects the possibility of losses as a result of movements in the price of the underlying margin loan collateral. the rate is calibrated from the previously disclosed discount rate, credit spread and/or volatility measures.
•comparable bond or loan price: a pricing input used when prices for the identical instrument are not available. significant subjectivity may be involved when fair value is determined using pricing data available for comparable instruments. valuation using comparable instruments can be done by calculating an implied yield (or spread over a liquid benchmark) from the price of a comparable bond or loan, then adjusting that yield (or spread) to derive a value for the bond or loan. the adjustment to yield (or spread) should account for relevant differences in the bonds or loans such as maturity or credit quality. alternatively, a price-to-price basis can be assumed between the comparable instrument and the bond or loan being valued in order to establish the value of the bond or loan.
•comparable equity price: a price derived from equity raises, share buybacks and external bid levels, etc. a discount or premium may be included in the fair value estimate.
•contingency probability: probability associated with the realization of an underlying event upon which the value of an asset is contingent.
•ebitda multiple / exit multiple: the ratio of enterprise value to ebitda, where enterprise value is the aggregate value of equity and debt minus cash and cash equivalents. the ebitda multiple reflects the value of the company in terms of its full-year ebitda, whereas the exit multiple reflects the value of the company in terms of its full-year expected ebitda at exit. either multiple allows comparison between companies from an operational perspective as the effect of capital structure, taxation and depreciation/amortization is excluded.
•recovery rate: amount expressed as a percentage of par that is expected to be received when a credit event occurs.
notes to consolidated financial statements an increase (decrease) to the following significant unobservable inputs would generally result in a lower (higher) fair value.
•cash-synthetic basis: the measure of the price differential between cash financial instruments and their synthetic derivative-based equivalents. the range disclosed in the previous table signifies the number of points by which the synthetic bond equivalent price is higher than the quoted price of the underlying cash bonds.
•funding spread: the cost of borrowing defined as the incremental spread over the ois rate for a specific collateral rate (which refers to the rate applicable to a specific type of security pledged as collateral).
•margin loan rate: the annualized rate that reflects the possibility of losses as a result of movements in the price of the underlying margin loan collateral. the rate is calibrated from the discount rate, credit spreads and/or volatility measures.
•wacc: wacc represents the theoretical rate of return required to debt and equity investors. the wacc is used in a discounted cash flow model that calculates the value of the equity. the model assumes that the cash flow assumptions, including projections, are fully reflected in the current equity value, while the debt to equity ratio is held constant.
an increase (decrease) to the following significant unobservable inputs would generally result in an impact to the fair value, but the magnitude and direction of the impact would depend on whether the firm is long or short the exposure.
•correlation: a pricing input where the payoff is driven by more than one underlying risk. correlation is a measure of the relationship between the movement of two variables (i.e., how the change in one variable influences a change in the other variable).
•credit spread: the credit spread reflects the additional net yield an investor can earn from a security with more credit risk relative to one with less credit risk. the credit spread of a particular security is often quoted in relation to the yield on a credit risk-free benchmark security or reference rate, typically either u.s. treasury or libor.
•interest rate curve: the term structure of interest rates (relationship between interest rates and the time to maturity) and a market's measure of future interest rates at the time of observation. an interest rate curve is used to set interest rate and foreign exchange derivative cash flows and is a pricing input used in the discounting of any otc derivative cash flow.
•volatility: the measure of variability in possible returns for an instrument given how much that instrument changes in value over time. volatility is a pricing input for options and, generally, the lower the volatility, the less risky the option. the level of volatility used in the valuation of a particular option depends on a number of factors, including the nature of the risk underlying that option, the tenor and the strike price of the option.
•volatility skew: the measure of the difference in implied volatility for options with identical underliers and expiry dates but with different strikes.
amounts in the previous table represent the firm's carrying value of general and limited partnership interests in fund investments, as well as any related performance-based fees in the form of carried interest. the carrying amounts are measured based on the nav of the fund taking into account the distribution terms applicable to the interest held. this same measurement applies whether the fund investments are accounted for under the equity method or fair value.
private equity.    funds that pursue multiple strategies, including leveraged buyouts, venture capital, infrastructure growth capital, distressed investments and mezzanine capital. in addition, the funds may be structured with a focus on specific geographic regions.
real estate.    funds that invest in real estate assets such as commercial office buildings, retail properties, multi-family residential properties, developments or hotels. in addition, the funds may be structured with a focus on specific geographic regions.
investments in private equity and real estate funds generally are not redeemable due to the closed-end nature of these funds. instead, distributions from each fund will be received as the underlying investments of the funds are disposed and monetized.
hedge.    funds that pursue various investment strategies, including long-short equity, fixed income/credit, event-driven and multi-strategy.

incremental collateral and termination payments upon potential future ratings downgrade
1.amount represents arrangements between the firm and other parties where upon the downgrade of one party, the downgraded party must deliver collateral to the other party. these bilateral downgrade arrangements are used by the firm to manage the risk of counterparty downgrades.
the additional collateral or termination payments that may be called in the event of a future credit rating downgrade vary by contract and can be based on ratings by either or both of moody's investors service, inc. and s&p global ratings. the previous table shows the future potential collateral amounts and termination payments that could be called or required by counterparties or exchange and clearing organizations in the event of one-notch or two-notch downgrade scenarios based on the relevant contractual downgrade triggers.
notes to consolidated financial statements maximum potential payout/notional of credit protection sold1
fair value asset (liability) of credit protection sold1
1.investment grade/non-investment grade determination is based on the internal credit rating of the reference obligation. internal credit ratings serve as the credit risk management department's assessment of credit risk and the basis for a comprehensive credit limits framework used to control credit risk. the firm uses quantitative models and judgment to estimate the various risk parameters related to each obligor.
the firm enters into credit derivatives, principally cds, under which it receives or provides protection against the risk of default on a set of debt obligations issued by a specified reference entity or entities. a majority of the firm's counterparties for these derivatives are banks, broker-dealers, and insurance and other financial institutions.
the fair value amounts as shown in the previous tables are prior to cash collateral or counterparty netting.
the purchase of credit protection does not represent the sole manner in which the firm risk manages its exposure to credit derivatives. the firm manages its exposure to these derivative contracts through a variety of risk mitigation strategies, which include managing the credit and correlation risk across single-name, non-tranched indices and baskets, tranched indices and baskets, and cash positions. aggregate market risk limits have been established for credit derivatives, and market risk measures are routinely monitored against these limits. the firm may also recover amounts on the underlying reference obligation delivered to the firm under cds where credit protection was sold.
single-name cds.    a cds protects the buyer against the loss of principal on a bond or loan in case of a default by the issuer. the protection buyer pays a periodic premium (generally quarterly) over the life of the contract and is protected for the period. the firm, in turn, performs under a cds if a credit event as defined under the contract occurs. typical credit events include bankruptcy, dissolution or insolvency of the referenced entity, failure to pay and restructuring of the obligations of the referenced entity.
index and basket cds.    index and basket cds are products where credit protection is provided on a portfolio of single-name cds. generally, in the event of a default on one of the underlying names, the firm pays a pro rata portion of the total notional amount of the cds.
the firm also enters into tranched index and basket cds where credit protection is provided on a particular portion of the portfolio loss distribution. the most junior tranches cover

9. collateralized transactions the firm enters into securities purchased under agreements to resell, securities sold under agreements to repurchase, securities borrowed and securities loaned transactions to, among other things, acquire securities to cover short positions and settle other securities obligations, to accommodate customers' needs and to finance its inventory positions.
the firm monitors the fair value of the underlying securities as compared with the related receivable or payable, including accrued interest, and, as necessary, requests additional collateral, as provided under the applicable agreement to ensure such transactions are adequately collateralized, or the return of excess collateral.
the risk related to a decline in the market value of collateral pledged or received is managed by setting appropriate market-based margin requirements. increases in collateral margin calls on secured financing due to market value declines may be mitigated by increases in collateral margin calls on securities purchased under agreements to resell and securities borrowed transactions with similar quality collateral. additionally, the firm may request lower quality collateral pledged be replaced with higher quality collateral through collateral substitution rights in the underlying agreements.
the firm actively manages its secured financings in a manner that reduces the potential refinancing risk of secured financings of less liquid assets and also considers the quality of collateral when negotiating collateral eligibility with counterparties. the firm utilizes shorter term secured financing for highly liquid assets and has established longer tenor limits for less liquid assets, for which funding may be at risk in the event of a market disruption.

the firm is subject to concentration risk by holding large positions in certain types of securities, loans or commitments to purchase securities of a single issuer, including sovereign governments and other entities, issuers located in a particular country or geographic area, public and private issuers involving developing countries or issuers engaged in a particular industry.
positions taken and underwriting and financing commitments, including those made in connection with the firm's private equity, principal investment and lending activities, often involve substantial amounts and significant exposure to individual issuers and businesses, including investment grade and non-investment grade issuers.
customer margin and other lending
the firm provides margin lending arrangements that allow customers to borrow against the value of qualifying securities. receivables under margin lending arrangements are included within customer and other receivables in the balance sheets. under these agreements and transactions, the firm receives collateral, which includes u.s. government and agency securities, other sovereign government obligations, corporate and other debt, and corporate equities. margin loans are collateralized by customer-owned securities held by the firm. the firm monitors required margin levels and established credit terms daily and, pursuant to such guidelines, requires customers to deposit additional collateral, or reduce positions, when necessary.
margin loans are extended on a demand basis and generally are not committed facilities. factors considered in the review of margin loans are the amount of the loan, the intended purpose, the degree of leverage being employed in the account and the amount of collateral, as well as an overall evaluation of the portfolio to ensure proper diversification or, in the case of concentrated positions, appropriate liquidity of the underlying collateral or potential hedging strategies to reduce risk. underlying collateral for margin loans is reviewed with respect to the liquidity of the proposed collateral positions, valuation of securities, historic trading range, volatility analysis and an evaluation of industry concentrations. for these transactions, adherence to the firm's collateral policies significantly limits its credit exposure in the event of a customer default. the firm may request additional margin collateral from customers, if appropriate, and, if necessary, may sell securities that have not been paid for or purchase securities sold but not delivered from customers.
also included in the amounts in the previous table is non-purpose securities-based lending on non-bank entities in the wealth management business segment.
other secured financings other secured financings include the liabilities related to transfers of financial assets that are accounted for as financings rather than sales, consolidated vies where the firm is deemed to be the primary beneficiary, and certain elns and other secured borrowings. these liabilities are generally payable from the cash flows of the related assets, which are accounted for as trading assets (see notes 14 and 16).
10. loans, lending commitments and related allowance for credit losses the firm's held-for-investment and held-for-sale loan portfolios consist of the following types of loans:
•corporate.  corporate includes revolving lines of credit, term loans and bridge loans made to corporate entities for a variety of purposes.
•secured lending facilities.     secured lending facilities include loans provided to clients, which are collateralized by various assets, including residential and commercial real estate mortgage loans, corporate loans and other assets.
notes to consolidated financial statements securities or refinancing margin debt. the majority of these loans are structured as revolving lines of credit. other primarily includes certain loans originated in the tailored lending business within the wealth management business segment.

credit quality crm evaluates new obligors before credit transactions are initially approved and at least annually thereafter for corporate and commercial real estate loans. for corporate, secured lending facilities and other loans, credit evaluations typically involve the evaluation of financial statements, assessment of leverage, liquidity, capital strength, asset composition and quality, market capitalization and access to capital markets, cash flow projections and debt service requirements, and the adequacy of collateral, if applicable. crm also evaluates strategy, market position, industry dynamics, obligor's management and other factors that could affect an obligor's risk profile.
for commercial real estate loans, the credit evaluation is focused on property and transaction metrics, including property type, ltv ratio, occupancy levels, debt service ratio, prevailing capitalization rates and market dynamics.
for residential real estate and securities-based loans, the initial credit evaluation typically includes, but is not limited to, review of the obligor's income, net worth, liquidity, collateral, ltv ratio and credit bureau information. subsequent credit monitoring for residential real estate loans is performed at the portfolio level. securities-based loan collateral values are monitored on an ongoing basis.

cre-commercial real estate sbl-securities-based lending the aggregate allowance for loans and lending commitments increased in 2020, reflecting the provision for credit losses within the institutional securities business segment principally resulting from the continued economic impact of covid-19, partially offset by charge-offs. the provision was primarily the result of actual and forecasted changes in asset quality trends, as well as risks related to uncertainty in the outlook for the sectors in focus due to covid-19. charge-offs in 2020 were primarily related to certain commercial real estate and corporate loans in the institutional securities business segment. the base scenario used in our acl models as of december 31, 2020 was generated using a combination of industry consensus economic forecasts, forward rates, and internally developed and validated models. given the nature of our lending portfolio, the most sensitive model input is u.s. gdp. the base scenario, among other things, assumes a continued recovery through 2021, supported by fiscal stimulus and monetary policy measures.

equity method investments, other than investments in certain fund interests, are summarized above and are included in other assets in the balance sheets with related income or loss included in other revenues in the income statements. see "net asset value measurements-fund interests" in note 5 for the carrying value of certain of the firm's fund interests, which are comprised of general and limited partnership interests, as well as any related carried interest.
the firm and mitsubishi ufj financial group, inc. ("mufg") formed a joint venture in japan comprising their respective investment banking and securities businesses by forming two joint venture companies, mitsubishi ufj morgan stanley securities co., ltd. ("mumss") and morgan stanley mufg securities co., ltd. ("msms") (the "joint venture"). the firm owns a 40% economic interest in the joint venture, and mufg owns the other 60%.
the firm's 40% voting interest in mumss is accounted for under the equity method within the institutional securities business segment and is included in the equity method investment balances above. the firm consolidates msms into the institutional securities business segment, based on its 51% voting interest.
the firm engages in transactions in the ordinary course of business with mufg and its affiliates; for example, investment banking, financial advisory, sales and trading, derivatives, investment management, lending, securitization and other financial services transactions. such transactions are on substantially the same terms as those that would be available to unrelated third parties for comparable transactions.

3.only includes borrowings with original maturities greater than one year. weighted average coupon is calculated utilizing u.s. and non-u.s. dollar interest rates and excludes financial instruments for which the fair value option was elected. virtually all of the variable rate notes issued by subsidiaries are carried at fair value so a weighted average coupon is not meaningful.
certain senior debt securities are denominated in various non-u.s. dollar currencies and may be structured to provide a return that is linked to equity, credit, commodity or other indices (e.g., the consumer price index). senior debt also may be structured to be callable by the firm or extendible at the option of holders of the senior debt securities.
the firm's borrowings include notes carried and managed on a fair value basis. these include instruments whose payments and redemption values are linked to the performance of a specific index, a basket of stocks, a specific equity security, a commodity, a credit exposure or basket of credit exposures; and instruments with various interest-rate-related features, including step-ups, step-downs and zero coupons. to minimize the exposure from such instruments, the firm has entered into various swap contracts and purchased options that effectively convert the borrowing costs into floating rates. the swaps and purchased options used to economically hedge the embedded features are derivatives and also are carried at fair value. changes in fair value related to the notes and economic hedges are reported in trading revenues. see notes

in general, other than securities inventories and customer balances financed by secured funding sources, the majority of the firm's assets are financed with a combination of deposits, short-term funding, floating rate long-term debt or fixed rate long-term debt swapped to a floating rate. the firm uses interest rate swaps to more closely match these borrowings to the duration, holding period and interest rate characteristics of the assets being funded and to manage interest rate risk. these swaps effectively convert certain of the firm's fixed rate borrowings into floating rate obligations. in addition, for non-u.s. dollar currency borrowings that are not used to fund assets in the same currency, the firm has entered into currency swaps that effectively convert the borrowings into u.s. dollar obligations.
the firm's use of swaps for asset and liability management affects its effective average borrowing rate.

1.beginning in 2020, commitments to central counterparties are presented separately; these commitments were previously included in corporate lending commitments and forward-starting secured financing receivables depending on the type of agreement.
since commitments associated with these instruments may expire unused, the amounts shown do not necessarily reflect the actual future cash funding requirements.
types of commitments lending commitments.  lending commitments primarily represent the notional amount of legally binding obligations to provide funding to clients for different types of loan transactions. for syndications that are led by the firm, the lending commitments accepted by the borrower but not yet closed are net of the amounts agreed to by counterparties that will participate in the syndication. for syndications that the firm participates in and does not lead, lending commitments accepted by the borrower but not yet closed include only the amount that the firm expects it will be allocated from the lead syndicate bank. due to the nature of the firm's obligations under the commitments, these amounts include certain commitments participated to third parties.
forward-starting secured financing receivables.  this amount includes securities purchased under agreements to resell and securities borrowed that the firm has entered into prior to the balance sheet date that will settle after the balance sheet date. these transactions are primarily secured by collateral from u.s. government agency securities and other sovereign government obligations when they are funded.
central counterparty.  these commitments relate to the firm's membership in certain clearinghouses and are contingent upon the default of a clearinghouse member or other stress events.
underwriting commitments.  the firm provides underwriting commitments in connection with its capital raising sources to a diverse group of corporate and other institutional clients.
investment activities.  the firm sponsors several non-consolidated investment management funds for third-party investors where it typically acts as general partner of, and investment advisor to, these funds and typically commits to invest a minority of the capital of such funds, with subscribing third-party investors contributing the majority. the firm has contractual capital commitments, guarantees and counterparty arrangements with respect to these investment management funds.
letters of credit and other financial guarantees.  the firm has outstanding letters of credit and other financial guarantees issued by third-party banks to certain of the firm's counterparties. the firm is contingently liable for these letters of credit and other financial guarantees, which are primarily used to provide collateral for securities and commodities traded and to satisfy various margin requirements in lieu of depositing cash or securities with these counterparties.

1.these amounts include certain issued standby letters of credit participated to third parties, totaling $0.6 billion of notional and collateral/recourse, due to the nature of the firm's obligations under these arrangements. as of december 31, 2020, the carrying amount of standby letters of credit and other financial guarantees issued includes an allowance for credit losses of $81 million.
2.the carrying amounts of derivative contracts that meet the accounting definition of a guarantee are shown on a gross basis. for further information on derivatives contracts, see note 7.
types of guarantees derivative contracts. certain derivative contracts meet the accounting definition of a guarantee, including certain written options, contingent forward contracts and cds (see note 7 regarding credit derivatives in which the firm has sold credit protection to the counterparty). all derivative contracts that could meet this accounting definition of a guarantee are included in the previous table, with the notional amount used as the maximum potential payout for certain derivative contracts, such as written interest rate caps and written foreign currency options. the firm evaluates collateral requirements for all derivatives, including derivatives that do not meet the accounting definition of a guarantee. for the effects of cash collateral and counterparty netting, see note 7.
in certain situations, collateral may be held by the firm for those contracts that meet the definition of a guarantee. generally, the firm sets collateral requirements by counterparty so that the collateral covers various transactions and products and is not allocated specifically to individual contracts. also, the firm may recover amounts related to the underlying asset delivered to the firm under the derivative contract.
standby letters of credit and other financial guarantees issued. in connection with its corporate lending business and other corporate activities, the firm provides standby letters of credit and other financial guarantees to counterparties. such arrangements represent obligations to make payments to third parties if the counterparty fails to fulfill its obligation under a borrowing arrangement or other contractual obligation. a majority of the firm's standby letters of credit are provided on behalf of counterparties that are investment grade. if the counterparty fails to fulfill its contractual obligation, the firm has access to collateral or recourse that would approximate its obligation.
market value guarantees. market value guarantees are issued to guarantee timely payment of a specified return to investors in certain affordable housing tax credit funds. these guarantees are designed to return an investor's contribution to a fund and the investor's share of tax losses and tax credits expected to be generated by a fund.
liquidity facilities. the firm has entered into liquidity facilities with spes and other counterparties, whereby the firm is required to make certain payments if losses or defaults occur. primarily, the firm acts as liquidity provider to municipal bond securitization spes and for standalone municipal bonds in which the holders of beneficial interests issued by these spes or the holders of the individual bonds, respectively, have the right to tender their interests for purchase by the firm on specified dates at a specified price. the firm often may have recourse to the underlying assets held by the spes in the event payments are required under such liquidity facilities, as well as make-whole or recourse provisions with the trust sponsors. the recourse amount often exceeds the maximum potential payout amount of the guarantee. substantially all of the underlying assets in the spes are investment grade. liquidity facilities provided to municipal tender option bond trusts are classified as derivatives.
whole loan sales guarantees. the firm has provided, or otherwise agreed to be responsible for, representations and warranties regarding certain whole loan sales. under certain circumstances, the firm may be required to repurchase such assets or make other payments related to such assets if such representations and warranties are breached. the firm's maximum potential payout related to such representations and warranties is equal to the current upb of such loans. since the firm no longer services these loans, it has no information on the current upb of those loans, and accordingly, the amount included in the previous table represents the upb at the time of the whole loan sale or at the time when the firm last serviced any of those loans. the current upb balances could be substantially lower than the maximum potential payout december 2020 form 10-k notes to consolidated financial statements amount included in the previous table. the related liability primarily relates to sales of loans to the federal mortgage agencies.
securitization representations and warranties. as part of the firm's institutional securities business segment's securitizations and related activities, the firm has provided, or otherwise agreed to be responsible for, representations and warranties regarding certain assets transferred in securitization transactions sponsored by the firm. the extent and nature of the representations and warranties, if any, vary among different securitizations. under certain circumstances, the firm may be required to repurchase certain assets or make other payments related to such assets if such representations and warranties are breached. the maximum potential amount of future payments the firm could be required to make would be equal to the current outstanding balances of, or losses associated with, the assets subject to breaches of such representations and warranties. the amount included in the previous table for the maximum potential payout includes the current upb or historical losses where known, and the upb at the time of sale when the current upb is not known.
general partner guarantees. as a general partner in certain investment management funds, the firm receives certain distributions from the partnerships when the return exceeds specified performance targets according to the provisions of the partnership agreements. the firm may be required to return all or a portion of such distributions to the limited partners in the event the limited partners do not achieve a certain return as specified in the various partnership agreements, subject to certain limitations.
client clearing guarantees. in 2019, the firm became a sponsoring member of the government securities division of the ficc's sponsored clearing model. clients of the firm, as sponsored members, can transact in overnight securities repurchase and resale agreements, which are cleared through the ficc. as sponsoring member, the firm guarantees to the ficc the prompt and full payment and performance of its clients' obligations. in 2020, the ficc's sponsored clearing model was updated such that the firm could be responsible for liquidation of a sponsored member's account and guarantees any resulting loss to the ficc in the event the sponsored member fails to fully pay any net liquidation amount due from the sponsored member to the ficc. accordingly, the firm's maximum potential payout amount reflects the total of the estimated net liquidation amounts for sponsored member accounts. the firm minimizes credit exposure under this guarantee by obtaining a security interest in its sponsored member clients' collateral and their contractual rights under sponsored member transactions. therefore, the firm's exposure is estimated to be an amount substantially lower than the maximum potential payout amount. the collateral amount in which the firm has a security interest is approximately equal to the maximum potential payout amount of the guarantee.
other guarantees and indemnities in the normal course of business, the firm provides guarantees and indemnifications in a variety of transactions. these provisions generally are standard contractual terms. certain of these guarantees and indemnifications are described below:
•indemnities. the firm provides standard indemnities to counterparties for certain contingent exposures and taxes, including u.s. and foreign withholding taxes, on interest and other payments made on derivatives, securities and stock lending transactions, certain annuity products and other financial arrangements. these indemnity payments could be required based on a change in the tax laws, a change in interpretation of applicable tax rulings or a change in factual circumstances. certain contracts contain provisions that enable the firm to terminate the agreement upon the occurrence of such events. the maximum potential amount of future payments that the firm could be required to make under these indemnifications cannot be estimated.
•exchange/clearinghouse member guarantees. the firm is a member of various exchanges and clearinghouses that trade and clear securities and/or derivative contracts. associated with its membership, the firm may be required to pay a certain amount as determined by the exchange or the clearinghouse in case of a default of any of its members or pay a proportionate share of the financial obligations of another member that may default on its obligations to the exchange or the clearinghouse. while the rules governing different exchange or clearinghouse memberships and the forms of these guarantees may vary, in general the firm's obligations under these rules would arise only if the exchange or clearinghouse had previously exhausted its resources.
in addition, some clearinghouse rules require members to assume a proportionate share of losses resulting from the clearinghouse's investment of guarantee fund contributions and initial margin, and of other losses unrelated to the default of a clearing member, if such losses exceed the specified resources allocated for such purpose by the clearinghouse.
the maximum potential payout under these rules cannot be estimated. the firm has not recorded any contingent liability in its financial statements for these agreements and believes that any potential requirement to make payments under these agreements is remote.
•merger and acquisition guarantees. the firm may, from time to time, in its role as investment banking advisor be required to provide guarantees in connection with certain european merger and acquisition transactions. if required by the regulating authorities, the firm provides a guarantee that the acquirer in the transaction has or will have sufficient funds to complete the transaction and would then be required to make the acquisition payments in the event december 2020 form 10-k notes to consolidated financial statements the acquirer's funds are insufficient at the completion date of the transaction. these arrangements generally cover the time frame from the transaction offer date to its closing date and, therefore, are generally short term in nature. the firm believes the likelihood of any payment by the firm under these arrangements is remote given the level of its due diligence in its role as investment banking advisor.
in addition, in the ordinary course of business, the firm guarantees the debt and/or certain trading obligations (including obligations associated with derivatives, foreign exchange contracts and the settlement of physical commodities) of certain subsidiaries. these guarantees generally are entity or product specific and are required by investors or trading counterparties. the activities of the firm's subsidiaries covered by these guarantees (including any related debt or trading obligations) are included in the financial statements.
contingencies legal in addition to the matters described in the following paragraphs, in the normal course of business, the firm has been named, from time to time, as a defendant in various legal actions, including arbitrations, class actions and other litigation, arising in connection with its activities as a global diversified financial services institution. certain of the actual or threatened legal actions include claims for substantial compensatory and/or punitive damages or claims for indeterminate amounts of damages. in some cases, the entities that would otherwise be the primary defendants in such cases are bankrupt or are in financial distress. these actions have included, but are not limited to, residential mortgage and credit crisis-related matters.
while the firm has identified below any individual proceedings where the firm believes a material loss to be reasonably possible and reasonably estimable, there can be no assurance that material losses will not be incurred from claims that have not yet been asserted or those where potential losses have not yet been determined to be probable or possible, and reasonably estimable.
the firm contests liability and/or the amount of damages as appropriate in each pending matter. where available information indicates that it is probable a liability had been incurred at the date of the financial statements and the firm can reasonably estimate the amount of that loss, the firm accrues the estimated loss by a charge to income.
the firm's legal expenses can, and may in the future, fluctuate from period to period, given the current environment regarding government investigations and private litigation affecting global financial services firms, including the firm.
in many proceedings and investigations, however, it is inherently difficult to determine whether any loss is probable or even possible or to estimate the amount of any loss. in addition, even where a loss is possible or an exposure to loss exists in excess of the liability already accrued with respect to a previously recognized loss contingency, it is not always possible to reasonably estimate the size of the possible loss or range of loss, particularly for proceedings and investigations where the factual record is being developed or contested or where plaintiffs or government entities seek substantial or indeterminate damages, restitution, disgorgement or penalties. numerous issues may need to be resolved before a loss or additional loss, or range of loss or additional range of loss, can be reasonably estimated for a proceeding or investigation, including through potentially lengthy discovery and determination of important factual matters, determination of issues related to class certification and the calculation of damages or other relief, and by addressing novel or unsettled legal questions relevant to the proceedings or investigations in question.
for certain other legal proceedings and investigations, the firm can estimate reasonably possible losses, additional losses, ranges of loss or ranges of additional loss in excess of amounts accrued but does not believe, based on current knowledge and after consultation with counsel, that such losses could have a material adverse effect on the firm's financial statements as a whole, other than the matters referred to in the following paragraphs.

december 2020 form 10-k notes to consolidated financial statements
16. variable interest entities and securitization activities overview the firm is involved with various spes in the normal course of business. in most cases, these entities are deemed to be vies.
the firm's variable interests in vies include debt and equity interests, commitments, guarantees, derivative instruments and certain fees. the firm's involvement with vies arises primarily from:
•interests purchased in connection with market-making activities, securities held in its investment securities portfolio and retained interests held as a result of securitization activities, including re-securitization transactions.
•structuring of clns or other asset-repackaging notes designed to meet the investment objectives of clients.
•other structured transactions designed to provide tax-efficient yields to the firm or its clients.
the firm determines whether it is the primary beneficiary of a vie upon its initial involvement with the vie and reassesses whether it is the primary beneficiary on an ongoing basis as long as it has any continuing involvement with the vie. this determination is based upon an analysis of the design of the vie, including the vie's structure and activities, the power to make significant economic decisions held by the firm and by other parties, and the variable interests owned by the firm and other parties.
the power to make the most significant economic decisions may take a number of different forms in different types of vies. the firm considers servicing or collateral management decisions as representing the power to make the most significant economic decisions in transactions such as securitizations or cdos. as a result, the firm does not consolidate securitizations or cdos for which it does not act as the servicer or collateral manager unless it holds certain other rights to replace the servicer or collateral manager or to require the liquidation of the entity. if the firm serves as servicer or collateral manager, or has certain other rights described in the previous sentence, the firm analyzes the interests in the vie that it holds and consolidates only those vies for which it holds a potentially significant interest in the vie.
for many transactions, such as re-securitization transactions, clns and other asset-repackaging notes, there are no significant economic decisions made on an ongoing basis. in these cases, the firm focuses its analysis on decisions made prior to the initial closing of the transaction and at the termination of the transaction. the firm concluded in most of these transactions that decisions made prior to the initial closing were shared between the firm and the initial investors based upon the nature of the assets, including whether the assets were issued in a transaction sponsored by the firm and the extent of the information available to the firm and to investors, the number, nature and involvement of investors, other rights held by the firm and investors, the standardization of the legal documentation and the level of continuing involvement by the firm, including the amount and type of interests owned by the firm and by other investors. the firm focused its control decision on any right held by the firm or investors related to the termination of the vie. most re-securitization transactions, clns and other asset-repackaging notes have no such termination rights.

consolidated vie assets and liabilities are presented in the previous tables after intercompany eliminations. generally, most assets owned by consolidated vies cannot be removed unilaterally by the firm and are not available to the firm while the related liabilities issued by consolidated vies are non-recourse to the firm. however, in certain consolidated vies, the firm either has the unilateral right to remove assets or provides additional recourse through derivatives such as total return swaps, guarantees or other forms of involvement.
notes to consolidated financial statements in general, the firm's exposure to loss in consolidated vies is limited to losses that would be absorbed on the vie net assets recognized in its financial statements, net of amounts absorbed by third-party variable interest holders.

1.amounts include transactions backed by residential mortgage loans, commercial mortgage loans and other types of assets, including consumer or commercial assets. and may be in loan or security form.
3.where notional amounts are utilized in quantifying the maximum exposure related to derivatives, such amounts do not reflect changes in fair value recorded by the firm.
4.additional vie assets owned represents the carrying value of total exposure to non-consolidated vies for which the maximum exposure to loss is less than specific thresholds, primarily interests issued by securitization spes. the firm's maximum exposure to loss generally equals the fair value of the assets owned. these assets are primarily included in trading assets and investment securities and are measured at fair value (see note 5). the firm does not provide additional support in these transactions through contractual facilities, guarantees or similar derivatives.
the majority of the vies included in the previous tables are sponsored by unrelated parties; examples of the firm's involvement with these vies include its secondary market-making activities and the securities held in its investment securities portfolio (see note 8).
the firm's maximum exposure to loss is dependent on the nature of the firm's variable interest in the vie and is limited to the notional amounts of certain liquidity facilities and other credit support, total return swaps and written put options, as well as the fair value of certain other derivatives and investments the firm has made in the vie.
the firm's maximum exposure to loss in the previous tables does not include the offsetting benefit of hedges or any reductions associated with the amount of collateral held as part of a transaction with the vie or any party to the vie directly against a specific exposure to loss.
liabilities issued by vies generally are non-recourse to the firm.

securitization activities in a securitization transaction, the firm transfers assets (generally commercial or residential mortgage loans or securities) to an spe, sells to investors most of the beneficial interests, such as notes or certificates, issued by the spe, and, in many cases, retains other beneficial interests. the purchase of the transferred assets by the spe is financed through the sale of these interests.
in many securitization transactions involving commercial mortgage loans, the firm transfers a portion of the assets to the spe with unrelated parties transferring the remaining assets. in addition, mainly in securitization transactions involving residential mortgage loans, the firm may also enter into derivative transactions, primarily interest rate swaps or interest rate caps, with the spe.
although not obligated, the firm generally makes a market in the securities issued by spes in securitization transactions. as a market maker, the firm offers to buy these securities from, and sell these securities to, investors. securities purchased through these market-making activities are not considered to be retained interests; these beneficial interests generally are included in trading assets-corporate and other debt and are measured at fair value.
the firm enters into derivatives, generally interest rate swaps and interest rate caps, with a senior payment priority in many securitization transactions. the risks associated with these and similar derivatives with spes are essentially the same as similar derivatives with non-spe counterparties and are december 2020 form 10-k notes to consolidated financial statements managed as part of the firm's overall exposure. see note 7 for further information on derivative instruments and hedging activities.
investment securities the firm holds securities issued by vies within the investment securities portfolio. these securities are composed of those related to transactions sponsored by the federal mortgage agencies and predominantly the most senior securities issued by vies backed by student loans and commercial mortgage loans. transactions sponsored by the federal mortgage agencies include an explicit or implicit guarantee provided by the u.s. government. additionally, the firm holds certain commercial mortgage-backed securities issued by vies retained as a result of the firm's securitization activities. see note 8 for further information on the investment securities portfolio.
municipal tender option bond trusts in a municipal tender option bond trust transaction, the client transfers a municipal bond to a trust. the trust issues short-term securities that the firm, as the remarketing agent, sells to investors. the client generally retains a residual interest. the short-term securities are supported by a liquidity facility pursuant to which the investors may put their short-term interests. in most programs, a third-party provider will provide such liquidity facility; in some programs, the firm provides this liquidity facility.
the firm may, in lieu of purchasing short-term securities for remarketing, decide to extend a temporary loan to the trust. the client can generally terminate the transaction at any time. the liquidity provider can generally terminate the transaction upon the occurrence of certain events. when the transaction is terminated, the municipal bond is generally sold or returned to the client. any losses suffered by the liquidity provider upon the sale of the bond are the responsibility of the client. this obligation is generally collateralized. liquidity facilities provided to municipal tender option bond trusts are classified as derivatives. the firm consolidates any municipal tender option bond trusts in which it holds the residual interest.
credit protection purchased through credit-linked notes cln transactions are designed to provide investors with exposure to certain credit risk on referenced assets. in these transactions, the firm transfers assets (generally high-quality securities or money market investments) to an spe, enters into a derivative transaction in which the spe sells protection on an unrelated referenced asset or group of assets, through a credit derivative, and sells the securities issued by the spe to investors. in some transactions, the firm may also enter into interest rate or currency swaps with the spe. depending on the structure, the assets and liabilities of the spe may be consolidated and recognized in the firm's balance sheets or accounted for as a sale of assets.
upon the occurrence of a credit event related to the referenced asset, the spe will deliver securities collateral as payment to the firm, which exposes the firm to changes in the collateral's value.
derivative payments by the spe are collateralized. the risks associated with these and similar derivatives with spes are essentially the same as those with non-spe counterparties and are managed as part of the firm's overall exposure.
other structured financings the firm invests in interests issued by entities that develop and own low-income communities (including low-income housing projects) and entities that construct and own facilities that will generate energy from renewable resources. the interests entitle the firm to a share of tax credits and tax losses generated by these projects. in addition, the firm has issued guarantees to investors in certain low-income housing funds. the guarantees are designed to return an investor's contribution to a fund and the investor's share of tax losses and tax credits expected to be generated by the fund. the firm is also involved with entities designed to provide tax-efficient yields to the firm or its clients.
collateralized loan and debt obligations clos and cdos are spes that purchase a pool of assets consisting of corporate loans, corporate bonds, abs or synthetic exposures on similar assets through derivatives, and issue multiple tranches of debt and equity securities to investors. the firm underwrites the securities issued in certain clo transactions on behalf of unaffiliated sponsors and provides advisory services to these unaffiliated sponsors. the firm sells corporate loans to many of these spes, in some cases representing a significant portion of the total assets purchased. although not obligated, the firm generally makes a market in the securities issued by spes in these transactions and may retain unsold securities. these beneficial interests are included in trading assets and are measured at fair value.
equity-linked notes eln transactions are designed to provide investors with exposure to certain risks related to the specific equity security, equity index or other index. in an eln transaction, the firm typically transfers to an spe either a note issued by the firm, the payments on which are linked to the performance of a specific equity security, equity index or other index, or debt securities issued by other companies and a derivative contract, the terms of which will relate to the performance of a specific equity security, equity index or other index. these eln transactions with spes were not consolidated at december 31, 2020 or december 31, 2019.

the previous tables include transactions with spes in which the firm, acting as principal, transferred financial assets with continuing involvement and received sales treatment. the transferred assets are carried at fair value prior to securitization, and any changes in fair value are recognized in the income statements. the firm may act as underwriter of the beneficial interests issued by these securitization vehicles, for which investment banking revenues are recognized. the firm may retain interests in the securitized financial assets as one or more tranches of the securitization. these retained interests are generally carried at fair value in the balance sheets with changes in fair value recognized in the income statements. fair value for these interests is measured using techniques that are consistent with the valuation techniques applied to the firm's major categories of assets and liabilities as described in notes 2 and 5. further, as permitted by applicable guidance, certain transfers of assets where the firm's only continuing involvement is a derivative are only reported in the following assets sold with retained exposure table.

17. regulatory requirements regulatory capital framework the firm is an fhc under the bank holding company act of 1956, as amended, and is subject to the regulation and oversight of the board of governors of the federal reserve system ("federal reserve"). the federal reserve establishes
133               december 2020 form 10-k notes to consolidated financial statements capital requirements for the firm, including well-capitalized standards, and evaluates the firm's compliance with such capital requirements. the occ establishes similar capital requirements and standards for the firm's u.s. bank subsidiaries including, among others, msbna and mspbna. the regulatory capital requirements are largely based on the basel iii capital standards established by the basel committee on banking supervision and also implement certain provisions of the dodd-frank wall street reform and consumer protection act.
regulatory capital requirements the firm is required to maintain minimum risk-based and leverage-based capital ratios under regulatory capital requirements. a summary of the calculations of regulatory capital and rwa follows.
minimum risk-based capital ratio requirements apply to common equity tier 1 capital, tier 1 capital and total capital (which includes tier 2 capital). capital standards require certain adjustments to, and deductions from, capital for purposes of determining these ratios.
in 2020, the u.s. banking agencies adopted a final rule, consistent with an interim final rule that was effective march 31, 2020, altering, for purposes of the regulatory capital rules, the required adoption time period for cecl. as of december 31, 2020, the risk-based and leverage-based capital amounts and ratios, as well as rwa, adjusted average assets and supplementary leverage exposure are calculated excluding the effect of the adoption of cecl based on the firm's election to defer this effect over a five-year transition period in accordance with the interim final rule.

2.the capital buffer requirement represents the amount of common equity tier 1 capital the firm must maintain above the minimum risk-based capital requirements in order to avoid restrictions on the firm's ability to make capital distributions, including the payment of dividends and the repurchase of stock, and to pay discretionary bonuses to executive officers. beginning october 1, 2020, the firm's standardized approach capital buffer requirement is equal to the sum of the scb, g-sib capital surcharge and ccyb, and the advanced approach capital buffer requirement is equal to the 2.5% capital conservation buffer, g-sib capital surcharge and ccyb.
3.required ratios represent the regulatory minimum plus the capital buffer requirement.
risk-weighted assets rwa reflects both the firm's on- and off-balance sheet risk, as well as capital charges attributable to the risk of loss arising from the following:
•credit risk: the failure of a borrower, counterparty or issuer to meet its financial obligations to the firm;
•market risk: adverse changes in the level of one or more market prices, rates, indices, volatilities, correlations or other market factors, such as market liquidity; and
•operational risk: inadequate or failed processes or systems, from human factors or from external events (e.g., fraud, theft, legal and compliance risks, cyber attacks or damage to physical assets).
the firm's risk-based capital ratios are computed under both (i) the standardized approaches for calculating credit risk and market risk rwa ("standardized approach") and (ii) the applicable advanced approaches for calculating credit risk, market risk and operational risk rwa ("advanced approach"). the credit risk rwa calculations between the two approaches differ in that the standardized approach requires calculation of rwa using prescribed risk weights, whereas the advanced approach utilizes models to calculate exposure amounts and risk weights. at december 31, 2020 and december 31, 2019, the differences between the actual and required ratio were lower under the standardized approach.
minimum leverage-based capital requirements include a tier 1 leverage ratio and an slr. the firm is required to maintain a tier 1 slr of 5%, inclusive of an enhanced slr capital buffer of at least 2%.

1.required ratios are inclusive of any buffers applicable as of the date presented. failure to maintain the buffers would result in restrictions on the firm's ability to make capital distributions, including the payment of dividends and the repurchase of stock, and to pay discretionary bonuses to executive officers.
2.adjusted average assets represents the denominator of the tier 1 leverage ratio and is composed of the average daily balance of consolidated on-balance sheet assets for the quarters ending on the respective balance sheet dates, reduced by disallowed goodwill, intangible assets, investments in covered funds, defined benefit pension plan assets, after-tax gain on sale from assets sold into securitizations, investments in the firm's own capital instruments, certain defined tax assets and other capital deductions.
3.based on a federal reserve interim final rule in effect until march 31, 2021, the firm's slr and supplementary leverage exposure as of december 31, 2020 reflect the exclusion of u.s. treasury securities and deposits at federal reserve banks.
4.supplementary leverage exposure is the sum of adjusted average assets used in the tier 1 leverage ratio and other adjustments, primarily: (i) for derivatives, potential future exposure and the effective notional principal amount of sold credit protection offset by qualifying purchased credit protection; (ii) the counterparty credit risk for repo-style transactions; and (iii) the credit equivalent amount for off-balance sheet exposures.
certain u.s. bank subsidiaries' regulatory capital and capital ratios the occ establishes capital requirements for the firm's u.s. bank subsidiaries, which as of december 31, 2020 include, among others, msbna and mspbna, and evaluates their compliance with such capital requirements. regulatory capital requirements for msbna and mspbna are calculated in a similar manner to the firm's regulatory capital requirements, although g-sib capital surcharge and stress capital buffer requirements do not apply to the u.s. bank subsidiaries.
the occ's regulatory capital framework includes prompt corrective action ("pca") standards, including "well-capitalized" pca standards that are based on specified regulatory capital ratio minimums. for the firm to remain an fhc, its u.s. bank subsidiaries must remain well-capitalized in accordance with the occ's pca standards. in addition, failure by the u.s. bank subsidiaries to meet minimum capital requirements may result in certain mandatory and discretionary actions by regulators that, if undertaken, could have a direct material effect on the u.s. bank subsidiaries' and the firm's financial statements.
at december 31, 2020 and december 31, 2019, msbna and mspbna risk-based capital ratios are based on the standardized approach rules. at december 31, 2020, the risk-based and leverage-based capital amounts and ratios are calculated excluding the effect of the adoption of cecl based on msbna's and mspbna's elections to defer this effect over a five-year transition period.

on march 15, 2020, the financial services forum announced that each of its eight member banks, including the firm, had voluntarily suspended their share repurchase programs. on june 25, 2020, the federal reserve published summary results of ccar and announced that large bhcs, including the firm, generally would be restricted in making share repurchases during the third quarter, and on september 30, 2020, the restrictions were extended through the fourth quarter of 2020. on december 18, 2020 the federal reserve published summary results of the second round of supervisory stress tests for each large bhc, including the firm, and permitted the resumption of share repurchases in the first quarter of 2021.
a portion of common stock repurchases was conducted under a sales plan with mufg, whereby mufg sold shares of the firm's common stock to the firm, as part of the firm's share repurchase program. the sales plan, which was suspended on december 10, 2020, has no impact on the strategic alliance between mufg and the firm, including the joint ventures in japan, and is only intended to maintain mufg's ownership percentage below 24.9% in order to comply with mufg's passivity commitments to the board of governors of the federal reserve system.
pursuant to the share repurchase program, the firm considers, among other things, business segment capital needs, as well as stock-based compensation and benefit plan requirements. share repurchases under the program will be exercised from time to time at prices the firm deems appropriate subject to various factors, including the firm's capital position and market conditions. the share repurchases may be effected through open market purchases or privately negotiated transactions, including through rule 10b5-1 plans, and may be suspended at any time. share repurchases by the firm are subject to regulatory non-objection.

performance-based stock units psus will vest and convert to shares of common stock only if the firm satisfies predetermined performance and market-based conditions over a three-year performance period. the number of psus that will vest ranges from 0% to 150% of the target award, based on the extent to which the firm achieves the specified performance goals. one-half of the award will be earned based on the firm's average return on equity, excluding certain adjustments specified in the plan terms ("ms adjusted roe"). the other half of the award will be earned based on the firm's total shareholder return, relative to the total shareholder return of the s&p 500 financials sector index ("relative ms tsr"). psus have vesting, restriction and cancellation provisions that are generally similar to those of rsus. at december 31, 2020, approximately 3 million psus were outstanding.
notes to consolidated financial statements the relative ms tsr fair values on the award date were estimated using a monte carlo simulation and the following assumptions.

the risk-free interest rate was determined based on the yields available on u.s. treasury zero-coupon issues. the expected stock price volatility was determined using historical volatility. the correlation coefficient was developed based on historical price data of the firm and the s&p 500 financials sector index. the model uses an expected dividend yield equivalent to reinvesting dividends.
deferred cash-based compensation plans deferred cash-based compensation plans generally provide a return to the plan participants based upon the performance of each participant's referenced investments.

the u.s. qualified plan's assets represent 87% of the firm's total pension plan assets. the u.s. qualified plan uses a combination of active and risk-controlled fixed income investment strategies. the fixed income asset allocation consists primarily of fixed income securities and related derivative instruments designed to approximate the expected cash flows of the plan's liabilities in order to help reduce plan exposure to interest rate variation and to better align assets with the obligation. the longer-duration fixed income allocation is expected to help protect the plan's funded status and maintain the stability of plan contributions over the long run. the investment portfolio performance is assessed by comparing actual investment performance with changes in the estimated present value of the u.s. qualified plan's benefit obligation.
derivative instruments are permitted in the u.s. qualified plan's investment portfolio only to the extent that they comply with all of the plan's investment policy guidelines and are consistent with the plan's risk and return objectives.
as a fundamental operating principle, any restrictions on the underlying assets apply to the respective derivative product. this includes percentage allocations and credit quality. derivatives are used solely for the purpose of enhancing investment returns in the underlying assets and not to circumvent portfolio restrictions.
plan assets are measured at fair value using valuation techniques that are consistent with the valuation techniques applied to the firm's major categories of assets and liabilities as described in notes 2 and 5. otc derivative contracts consist of investments in interest rate swaps and total return swaps. other investments consist of pledged insurance annuity contracts held by non-u.s.-based plans. the pledged insurance annuity contracts are valued based on the premium reserve of the insurer for a guarantee that the insurer has given to the employee benefit plan that approximates fair value. the pledged insurance annuity contracts are categorized in level 3 of the fair value hierarchy.
commingled trust funds are privately offered funds regulated, supervised and subject to periodic examination by a u.s. federal or state agency and available to institutional clients. the trust must be maintained for the collective investment or reinvestment of assets contributed to it from u.s. tax-qualified employee benefit plans maintained by more than one employer or controlled group of corporations. the sponsor of the commingled trust funds values the funds based on the fair value of the underlying securities. commingled trust funds are redeemable at nav at the measurement date or in the near future.
some non-u.s.-based plans hold foreign funds that consist of investments in fixed income funds, target cash flow funds and liquidity funds. fixed income funds invest in individual securities quoted on a recognized stock exchange or traded in a regulated market. certain fixed income funds aim to produce returns consistent with certain financial times stock exchange indexes. target cash flow funds are designed to provide a series of fixed annual cash flows achieved by investing in government bonds and derivatives. liquidity funds place a high priority on capital preservation, stable value and a high liquidity of assets. foreign funds are readily redeemable at nav.
the firm generally considers the nav of commingled trust funds and foreign funds provided by the fund manager to be the best estimate of fair value.
expected contributions the firm's policy is to fund at least the amount sufficient to meet minimum funding requirements under applicable employee benefit and tax laws. at december 31, 2020, the firm expected to contribute approximately $50 million to its pension plans in 2021 based upon the plans' current funded status and expected asset return assumptions for 2021.

u.s. employees meeting certain eligibility requirements may participate in the firm's 401(k) plans.
morgan stanley 401(k) plan eligible employees receive discretionary 401(k) matching cash contributions as determined annually by the firm. for 2020, 2019 and 2018, the firm matched employee contributions up to 4% of eligible pay, up to the irs limit. matching contributions were invested among available funds according to each participant's investment direction on file. eligible employees with eligible pay less than or equal to $100,000 also received a fixed contribution under the 401(k) plan equal to 2% of eligible pay. transition contributions relating to acquired entities or frozen employee benefit plans are allocated to certain eligible employees. the firm match, fixed contribution and transition contribution are included in the firm's 401(k) expense.
the firm maintains separate defined contribution pension plans that cover eligible employees of certain non-u.s. subsidiaries. under such plans, benefits are generally determined based on a fixed rate of base salary with certain vesting requirements.

the increase in the firm's effective tax rate in 2020 compared with the prior year is primarily due to the higher level of earnings and lower net discrete tax benefits. in 2020, net discrete tax benefits were $122 million, primarily related to the conversion of employee share-based awards.
the firm's effective tax rates for 2019 and 2018 include net discrete tax benefits of $475 million and $368 million, respectively, primarily associated with remeasurement of reserves and related interest as a result of new information pertaining to the resolution of multi-jurisdiction tax examinations, as well as benefits related to conversion of employee share-based awards. the fourth quarters of 2019 and 2018 include net discrete tax benefits of $158 million and $111 million, respectively.

revenues and expenses directly associated with each respective business segment are included in determining its operating results. other revenues and expenses that are not directly attributable to a particular business segment are generally allocated based on each business segment's respective net revenues, non-interest expenses or other relevant measures.
as a result of revenues and expenses from transactions with other operating segments being treated as transactions with external parties for purposes of segment disclosures, the firm includes an intersegment eliminations category to reconcile the business segment results to the consolidated results.

cross-border outstandings are based upon the ffiec regulatory guidelines for reporting cross-border information and represent the amounts that we may not be able to obtain from a foreign country due to country-specific events, including unfavorable economic and political conditions, economic and social instability, and changes in government policies. claims include cash, customer and other receivables, securities purchased under agreements to resell, securities borrowed and cash trading instruments, but exclude commitments. securities purchased under agreements to resell and securities borrowed are presented based on the domicile of the counterparty, without reduction for related securities collateral held. for information on the firm's country risk exposure, see "quantitative and qualitative disclosures about risk-country and other risks."
there can be substantial differences between our cross-border risk exposure and our country risk exposure. for instance, unlike the country risk exposure, our cross-border risk exposure does not include the effect of certain risk mitigants. in addition, the basis for determining the domicile of the cross-border risk exposure is different from the basis for determining the country risk exposure. cross-border risk exposure is reported based on the country of jurisdiction for the obligor or guarantor. for country risk exposure, we consider factors in addition to that of country of jurisdiction, including physical location of operations or assets, location

controls and procedures conclusion regarding the effectiveness of disclosure controls and procedures under the supervision and with the participation of the firm's management, including the chief executive officer and chief financial officer, the firm conducted an evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures, as such term is defined under exchange act rule 13a-15(e). based on this evaluation, the chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that the firm's disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of the end of the period covered by this annual report.
management's report on internal control over financial reporting the firm's management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. the firm's internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america ("u.s. gaap").
the internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that:
•pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the firm;
•provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with u.s. gaap, and that receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of the firm's management and directors; and
•provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of firm assets that could have a material effect on the firm's financial statements.
because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
management assessed the effectiveness of the firm's internal control over financial reporting as of december 31, 2020. in making this assessment, management used the criteria set forth by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission ("coso") in internal control-integrated framework (2013). based on management's assessment and those criteria, management believes that the firm maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of december 31, 2020.
the firm's independent registered public accounting firm has audited and issued a report on the firm's internal control over financial reporting, which appears below.
december 2020 form 10-k report of independent registered public accounting firm to the shareholders and the board of directors of morgan stanley:
opinion on internal control over financial reporting we have audited the internal control over financial reporting of morgan stanley and subsidiaries (the "firm") as of december 31, 2020, based on criteria established in internal control - integrated framework (2013) issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission (coso). in our opinion, the firm maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of december 31, 2020, based on criteria established in internal control - integrated framework (2013) issued by coso.
we have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board (united states) (pcaob), the financial statements of the firm as of and for the year ended december 31, 2020 and our report dated february 26, 2021 expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements.
basis for opinion the firm's management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying management's report on internal control over financial reporting. our responsibility is to express an opinion on the firm's internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. we are a public accounting firm registered with the pcaob and are required to be independent with respect to the firm in accordance with the u.s. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the securities and exchange commission and the pcaob.
we conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the pcaob. those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. we believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
definition and limitations of internal control over financial reporting a company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. a company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
december 2020 form 10-k changes in internal control over financial reporting no change in the firm's internal control over financial reporting (as such term is defined in exchange act rule 13a-15(f)) occurred during the quarter ended december 31, 2020 that materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the firm's internal control over financial reporting.
other information none.
unresolved staff comments the firm, like other well-known seasoned issuers, from time to time receives written comments from the staff of the sec regarding its periodic or current reports under the exchange act. there are no comments that remain unresolved that the firm received not less than 180 days before the end of the year to which this report relates that the firm believes are material.
properties we have offices, operations and data centers located around the world. our global headquarters and principal executive offices are located at 1585 broadway, new york, new york. our other principal offices include locations in manhattan and the greater new york metropolitan area, london, hong kong and tokyo. our current facilities are adequate for our present and future operations for each of our business segments, although we may add regional offices, depending upon our future operations.
legal proceedings in addition to the matters described below, in the normal course of business, the firm has been named, from time to time, as a defendant in various legal actions, including arbitrations, class actions and other litigation, arising in connection with its activities as a global diversified financial services institution. certain of the actual or threatened legal actions include claims for substantial compensatory and/or punitive damages or claims for indeterminate amounts of damages. in some cases, the entities that would otherwise be the primary defendants in such cases are bankrupt or are in financial distress.
the firm is also involved, from time to time, in other reviews, investigations and proceedings (both formal and informal) by governmental and self-regulatory agencies regarding the firm's business, and involving, among other matters, sales and trading activities, financial products or offerings sponsored, underwritten or sold by the firm, and accounting and operational matters, certain of which may result in adverse judgments, settlements, fines, penalties, injunctions or other relief.
the firm contests liability and/or the amount of damages as appropriate in each pending matter. where available information indicates that it is probable a liability had been incurred at the date of the financial statements and the firm can reasonably estimate the amount of that loss, the firm accrues the estimated loss by a charge to income. the firm's future legal expenses may fluctuate from period to period, given the current environment regarding government investigations and private litigation affecting global financial services firms, including the firm.
in many proceedings and investigations, however, it is inherently difficult to determine whether any loss is probable or even possible, or to estimate the amount of any loss. the firm cannot predict with certainty if, how or when such proceedings or investigations will be resolved or what the eventual settlement, fine, penalty or other relief, if any, may be, particularly for proceedings and investigations where the factual record is being developed or contested or where plaintiffs or government entities seek substantial or indeterminate damages, restitution, disgorgement or penalties. numerous issues may need to be resolved before a loss or additional loss or range of loss or additional range of loss can be reasonably estimated for a proceeding or investigation, including through potentially lengthy discovery and determination of important factual matters, determination of issues related to class certification and the calculation of damages or other relief, and by addressing novel or unsettled legal questions relevant to the proceedings or investigations in question. subject to the foregoing, the firm believes, based on current knowledge and after consultation with counsel, that the outcome of such proceedings and investigations will not have a material adverse effect on the financial condition of the firm, although the outcome of such proceedings or investigations could be material to the firm's operating results and cash flows for a particular period depending on, among other things, the level of the firm's revenues or income for such period.
while the firm has identified below certain proceedings that the firm believes to be material, individually or collectively, there can be no assurance that additional material losses will not be incurred from claims that have not yet been asserted or are not yet determined to be material.

we have established procedures based on legal and regulatory requirements on a worldwide basis that are designed to facilitate compliance with applicable statutory and regulatory requirements and to require that our policies relating to business conduct, ethics and practices are followed globally. in addition, we have established procedures to mitigate the risk that a counterparty's performance obligations will be unenforceable, including consideration of counterparty legal authority and capacity, adequacy of legal documentation, the permissibility of a transaction under applicable law and whether applicable bankruptcy or insolvency laws limit or alter contractual remedies. the heightened legal and regulatory focus on the financial services and banking industries globally presents a continuing business challenge for us.
december 2020 form 10-k financial statements and supplementary data report of independent registered public accounting firm to the shareholders and the board of directors of morgan stanley:
opinion on the financial statements we have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of morgan stanley and subsidiaries (the "firm") as of december 31, 2020 and 2019, the related consolidated income statements, comprehensive income statements, cash flow statements and statements of changes in total equity for each of the three years ended december 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the "financial statements"). in our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the firm as of december 31, 2020 and 2019, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years ended december 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america.
we have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board (united states) (pcaob), the firm's internal control over financial reporting as of december 31, 2020, based on criteria established in internal control - integrated framework (2013) issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission and our report dated february 26, 2021, expressed an unqualified opinion on the firm's internal control over financial reporting.
basis for opinion these financial statements are the responsibility of the firm's management. our responsibility is to express an opinion on the firm's financial statements based on our audits. we are a public accounting firm registered with the pcaob and are required to be independent with respect to the firm in accordance with the u.s. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the securities and exchange commission and the pcaob.
we conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the pcaob. those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. we believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
critical audit matters the critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. the communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.
valuation of level 3 financial assets and liabilities carried at fair value-refer to note 5 to the financial statements critical audit matter description the firm's trading and financing activities result in the firm carrying material financial instruments having limited price transparency. these financial instruments can span a broad array of product types and generally include derivative, security, loan, and borrowing positions. as described in note 5, these level 3 financial instruments approximate $18.4 billion and $10.2 billion, respectively, of financial assets and liabilities accounted for at fair value on a recurring basis at december 31, 2020. unlike financial instruments whose inputs are readily observable and, therefore, more easily independently corroborated, the valuation of financial instruments classified as level 3 is inherently subjective and often involves the use of unobservable inputs, as well as proprietary valuation models whose underlying algorithms and valuation methodologies are complex.
we identified the valuation of level 3 financial assets and liabilities carried at fair value as a critical audit matter given the firm uses complex valuation models and/or model inputs that are not observable in the marketplace to determine the respective fair values. performing our audit procedures to evaluate the appropriateness of these models and inputs involved a high degree of auditor judgment, professionals with specialized skills and knowledge, and an increased extent of testing.
december 2020 form 10-k how the critical audit matter was addressed in the audit our audit procedures related to the valuation estimate for financial instruments that are classified as level 3 included the following, among others:
•we tested the design and operating effectiveness of the firm's valuation controls, including model review and price verification, which are designed to test the appropriateness of the firm's valuation methodologies as well as the relevant inputs, and assumptions used to determine the fair value estimates.
•we independently evaluated the appropriateness of management's significant valuation methodologies, including the input assumptions, considering the expected assumptions of other market participants, and external data, when available.
•we developed independent valuation estimates for certain financial instrument selections, using externally sourced inputs and independent valuation models, and used such estimates to further evaluate management's fair value estimate, including comparing the estimate with similar transactions and evaluating the firm's assumptions inclusive of the inputs, as applicable.
•we tested the revenues arising from the trade date valuation estimate for certain structured transactions classified as level 3 financial instruments. for a selection of such transactions we developed independent valuation estimates to test the valuation inputs and assumptions used by the firm and evaluated whether the methods were consistent with relevant firm valuation policies.
•we assessed the consistency by which management has applied significant and unobservable valuation assumptions.
•we performed a retrospective assessment of management's valuation estimates for a sample of financial instrument selections by comparing such estimates to relevant transactions.
intangible assets-valuation of customer relationship intangible assets for the e*trade financial corporation ("e*trade") acquisition-refer to note 3 to the financial statements critical audit matter description on october 2, 2020, the firm completed the acquisition of e*trade for approximately $11.9 billion. the firm accounted for the acquisition under the acquisition method of accounting for business combinations. accordingly, the purchase price was allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their respective fair values, including identified intangibles of approximately $3.3 billion. of the identified intangible assets acquired, the most significant were the customer relationship intangible assets of $2.8 billion. management, with the assistance of a valuation specialist, estimated the fair value of customer relationship intangible assets using the income approach, which determines the fair value as the present value of forecasted future cash flows. the determination of fair value of the assets involves significant estimates and assumptions related to forecasted future cash flows and the selection of the respective discount rate.
we identified the valuation of customer relationship intangible assets as a critical audit matter because the fair value determination requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions in determining the forecasted future cash flows including revenue growth rates and attrition rates as well as the selection of the discount rate. performing audit procedures to evaluate the reasonableness of these estimates and assumptions required a high degree of auditor judgment and an increased extent of effort, including the involvement of our valuation specialists.
how the critical audit matter was addressed in the audit our audit procedures related to the valuation of customer relationship intangible assets acquired as part of the e*trade acquisition included the following, among others:
•we tested the operating effectiveness of internal controls over the valuation methodology used, the determination of forecasted future cash flows, and the selection of the discount rate.
•we assessed the knowledge, skill, ability and objectivity of management's valuation specialist and evaluated the work performed.
•we evaluated the appropriateness of the valuation methodology used and the reasonableness of the forecasted future cash flows for each selected customer relationship intangible asset, specifically the assumptions relating to revenue growth and attrition rates, as well as whether the assumptions used were reasonable considering external market and industry data as well as the past performance of e*trade. we also performed sensitivity analyses to evaluate the impact of changes in assumptions to the valuation of the customer relationship intangible assets.
•we tested the source information underlying the determination of the discount rates and attrition rates and also tested the mathematical accuracy of the calculations.
•we developed a range of independent estimates of discount rates for the selected customer relationship intangible assets and compared those to the respective discount rate utilized by management.
we have served as the firm's auditor since 1997.

1. introduction and basis of presentation the firm morgan stanley is a global financial services firm that maintains significant market positions in each of its business segments-institutional securities, wealth management and investment management. morgan stanley, through its subsidiaries and affiliates, provides a wide variety of products and services to a large and diversified group of clients and customers, including corporations, governments, financial institutions and individuals. unless the context otherwise requires, the terms "morgan stanley" or the "firm" mean morgan stanley (the "parent company") together with its consolidated subsidiaries. see the "glossary of common terms and acronyms" for the definition of certain terms and acronyms used throughout this form 10-k.
a description of the clients and principal products and services of each of the firm's business segments is as follows:
institutional securities provides investment banking, sales and trading, lending and other services to corporations, governments, financial institutions and high to ultra-high net worth clients. investment banking services consist of capital raising and financial advisory services, including services relating to the underwriting of debt, equity and other securities, as well as advice on mergers and acquisitions, restructurings, real estate and project finance. sales and trading services include sales, financing, prime brokerage and market-making activities in the equity and fixed income businesses. lending activities include originating corporate loans and commercial real estate loans, providing secured lending facilities, and extending financing to sales and trading customers. other activities include asia wealth management services, investments and research.
wealth management provides a comprehensive array of financial services and solutions to individual investors and small to medium-sized businesses and institutions covering: financial advisor-led brokerage and investment advisory services; self-directed brokerage services, including through the e*trade platform; financial and wealth planning services; workplace services including stock plan administration; annuity and insurance products; securities-based lending, residential real estate loans and other lending products; banking; and retirement plan services.
investment management provides a broad range of investment strategies and products that span geographies, asset classes, and public and private markets to a diverse group of clients across institutional and intermediary channels. strategies and products, which are offered through a variety of investment vehicles, include equity, fixed income, liquidity and alternative/other products. institutional clients include defined benefit/defined contribution plans, foundations, endowments, government entities, sovereign wealth funds, insurance companies, third-party fund sponsors and corporations. individual clients are generally served through intermediaries, including affiliated and non-affiliated distributors.
basis of financial information the financial statements are prepared in accordance with u.s. gaap, which requires the firm to make estimates and assumptions regarding the valuations of certain financial instruments, the valuations of goodwill and intangible assets, the outcome of legal and tax matters, deferred tax assets, acl, and other matters that affect its financial statements and related disclosures. the firm believes that the estimates utilized in the preparation of its financial statements are prudent and reasonable. actual results could differ materially from these estimates.
certain reclassifications have been made to prior periods to conform to the current presentation. the notes are an integral part of the firm's financial statements. the firm has evaluated subsequent events for adjustment to or disclosure in these financial statements through the date of this report and has not identified any recordable or disclosable events not otherwise reported in these financial statements or the notes thereto.
consolidation the financial statements include the accounts of the firm, its wholly owned subsidiaries and other entities in which the firm has a controlling financial interest, including certain vies (see note 16). intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated. for consolidated subsidiaries that are not wholly owned, the third-party holdings of equity interests are referred to as noncontrolling interests. the net income attributable to noncontrolling interests for such subsidiaries is presented as net income applicable to noncontrolling interests in the income statements. the portion of shareholders' equity that is attributable to noncontrolling interests for such subsidiaries is presented as noncontrolling interests, a component of total equity, in the balance sheets.
for entities where the total equity investment at risk is sufficient to enable the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support and the equity holders bear the residual economic risks and returns of the entity and have the power to direct the activities of the entity that most significantly affect its economic performance, the firm consolidates those entities it controls either through a majority voting interest or otherwise. for vies (i.e., entities that do not meet the aforementioned criteria), the firm consolidates those entities where it has the power to make the decisions that most significantly affect the economic performance of the vie and has the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits that could potentially be significant to the vie.
december 2020 form 10-k notes to consolidated financial statements for investments in entities in which the firm does not have a controlling financial interest but has significant influence over operating and financial decisions, it applies the equity method of accounting with net gains and losses recorded within other revenues (see note 12) unless the firm has elected to measure the investment at fair value, in which case net gains and losses are recorded within investments revenues (see note 5).
the firm's significant regulated u.s. and international subsidiaries include:
2. significant accounting policies revenue recognition revenues are recognized when the promised goods or services are delivered to our customers, in an amount that is based on the consideration the firm expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services when such amounts are not probable of significant reversal.
investment banking revenues from investment banking activities consist of revenues earned from underwriting, primarily equity and fixed income securities and loan syndications, and advisory fees, primarily for mergers, acquisitions and restructurings.
underwriting revenues are generally recognized on trade date if there is no uncertainty or contingency related to the amount to be paid. underwriting costs are deferred and recognized in the relevant non-interest expenses line items when the related underwriting revenues are recorded.
advisory fees are recognized as advice is provided to the client, based on the estimated progress of work and when revenues are not probable of a significant reversal. advisory costs are recognized as incurred in the relevant non-interest expenses line items, including those reimbursed.
commissions and fees commission and fee revenues generally result from transaction-based arrangements in which the client is charged a fee for the execution of transactions. such revenues primarily arise from transactions in equity securities; services related to sales and trading activities; and sales of mutual funds, alternative funds, futures, insurance products and options, as well as revenues from order flow payments for directing customer orders to broker-dealers, exchanges, and market centers for execution. commission and fee revenues are recognized on trade date when the performance obligation is satisfied.
asset management revenues asset management, distribution and administration fees are generally based on related asset levels being managed, such as the aum of a customer's account or the net asset value of a fund. these fees are generally recognized when services are performed and the fees become known. management fees are reduced by estimated fee waivers and expense caps, if any, provided to the customer.
performance-based fees not in the form of carried interest are recorded when the annual performance target is met and the revenues are not probable of a significant reversal.
sales commissions paid by the firm in connection with the sale of certain classes of shares of its open-end mutual fund products are accounted for as deferred commission assets and amortized to expense over the expected life of the contract. the firm periodically tests deferred commission assets for recoverability based on cash flows expected to be received in future periods. other asset management and distribution costs are recognized as incurred in the relevant non-interest expenses line items.
carried interest the firm is entitled to receive performance-based fees in the form of carried interest when the return in certain funds exceeds specified performance targets. when the firm earns carried interest from funds as specified performance thresholds are met, that carried interest and any related general or limited partner interest is accounted for under the equity method of accounting and measured based on the firm's claim on the nav of the fund at the reporting date, taking into account the distribution terms applicable to the interest held.
see note 23 for information regarding the net cumulative unrealized amount of performance-based fee revenues at risk of reversal. see note 15 for information regarding general partner guarantees, which include potential obligations to return performance fee distributions previously received.
other items revenues from certain commodities-related contracts are recognized as the promised goods or services are delivered to the customer.
receivables from contracts with customers are recognized in customer and other receivables in the balance sheets when december 2020 form 10-k notes to consolidated financial statements the underlying performance obligations have been satisfied and the firm has the right per the contract to bill the customer. contract assets are recognized in other assets when the firm has satisfied its performance obligations but customer payment is conditional. contract liabilities are recognized in other liabilities when the firm has collected payment from a customer based on the terms of the contract, but the underlying performance obligations are not yet satisfied.
for contracts with a term of less than one year, incremental costs to obtain the contract are expensed as incurred. revenues are not discounted when payment is expected within one year.
the firm generally presents, net within revenues, taxes assessed by a governmental authority that are both imposed on and concurrent with a specific revenue-producing transaction and collected by the firm from a customer.
fair value of financial instruments instruments within trading assets and trading liabilities are measured at fair value, either as required or allowed by accounting guidance. these financial instruments primarily represent the firm's trading and investment positions and include both cash and derivative products. in addition, securities classified as afs are measured at fair value.
interest income and interest expense are recorded within the income statements depending on the nature of the instrument and related market conventions. when interest is included as a component of the instruments' fair value, interest is recorded within trading revenues or investments revenues. otherwise, it is recorded within interest income or interest expense. dividend income is recorded in trading revenues or investments revenues depending on the business activity.
the fair value of otc financial instruments, including derivative contracts related to financial instruments and commodities, is presented in the accompanying balance sheets on a net-by-counterparty basis, when appropriate. additionally, the firm nets the fair value of cash collateral paid or received against the fair value amounts recognized for net derivative positions executed with the same counterparty under the same master netting agreement.
fair value option the firm has elected to measure certain eligible instruments at fair value, including securities purchased under agreements to resell, loans and lending commitments, equity method investments and certain other assets, deposits, securities sold under agreements to repurchase, other secured financings and borrowings.
fair value measurement-definition and hierarchy fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability (i.e., the "exit price") in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.
fair value is a market-based measure considered from the perspective of a market participant rather than an entity-specific measure. therefore, even when market assumptions are not readily available, assumptions are set to reflect those that the firm believes market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability at the measurement date. where the firm manages a group of financial assets, financial liabilities, and nonfinancial items accounted for as derivatives on the basis of its net exposure to either market risks or credit risk, the firm measures the fair value of that group of financial instruments consistently with how market participants would price the net risk exposure at the measurement date.
in determining fair value, the firm uses various valuation approaches and establishes a hierarchy for inputs used in measuring fair value that requires the most observable inputs be used when available.
observable inputs are inputs that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability that were developed based on market data obtained from sources independent of the firm. unobservable inputs are inputs that reflect assumptions the firm believes other market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability that are developed based on the best information available in the circumstances. the fair value hierarchy is broken down into three levels based on the observability of inputs as follows, with level 1 being the highest and level 3 being the lowest level:
level 1.    valuations based on quoted prices in active markets that the firm has the ability to access for identical assets or liabilities. valuation adjustments, block discounts and discounts for entity-specific restrictions that would not transfer to market participants are not applied to level 1 instruments. since valuations are based on quoted prices that are readily and regularly available in an active market, valuation of these products does not entail a significant degree of judgment.
level 2.    valuations based on one or more quoted prices in markets that are not active or for which all significant inputs are observable, either directly or indirectly.
the availability of observable inputs can vary from product to product and is affected by a wide variety of factors, including december 2020 form 10-k notes to consolidated financial statements the type of product, whether the product is new and not yet established in the marketplace, the liquidity of markets and other characteristics particular to the product. to the extent that valuation is based on models or inputs that are less observable or unobservable in the market, the determination of fair value requires more judgment. accordingly, the degree of judgment exercised by the firm in determining fair value is greatest for instruments categorized in level 3 of the fair value hierarchy.
the firm considers prices and inputs that are current as of the measurement date, including during periods of market dislocation. in periods of market dislocation, the observability of prices and inputs may be reduced for many instruments. this condition could cause an instrument to be reclassified from level 1 to level 2 or from level 2 to level 3 of the fair value hierarchy.
in certain cases, the inputs used to measure fair value may fall into different levels of the fair value hierarchy. in such cases, the total fair value amount is disclosed in the level appropriate for the lowest level input that is significant to the total fair value of the asset or liability.
valuation techniques many cash instruments and otc derivative contracts have bid and ask prices that can be observed in the marketplace. bid prices reflect the highest price that a party is willing to pay for an asset. ask prices represent the lowest price that a party is willing to accept for an asset. the firm carries positions at the point within the bid-ask range that meets its best estimate of fair value. for offsetting positions in the same financial instrument, the same price within the bid-ask spread is used to measure both the long and short positions.
fair value for many cash instruments and otc derivative contracts is derived using pricing models. pricing models take into account the contract terms, as well as multiple inputs, including, where applicable, commodity prices, equity prices, interest rate yield curves, credit curves, correlation, creditworthiness of the counterparty, creditworthiness of the firm, option volatility and currency rates.
where appropriate, valuation adjustments are made to account for various factors such as liquidity risk (bid-ask adjustments), credit quality, model uncertainty and concentration risk and funding. adjustments for liquidity risk adjust model-derived mid-market amounts of level 2 and level 3 financial instruments for the bid-mid or mid-ask spread required to properly reflect the exit price of a risk position. bid-mid and mid-ask spreads are marked to levels observed in trade activity, broker quotes or other external third-party data. where these spreads are unobservable for the particular position in question, spreads are derived from observable levels of similar positions.
the firm applies credit-related valuation adjustments to its borrowings for which the fair value option was elected and to otc derivatives. the firm considers the impact of changes in its own credit spreads based upon observations of the secondary bond market spreads when measuring the fair value for borrowings.
for otc derivatives, the impact of changes in both the firm's and the counterparty's credit rating is considered when measuring fair value. in determining the expected exposure, the firm simulates the distribution of the future exposure to a counterparty, then applies market-based default probabilities to the future exposure, leveraging external third-party cds spread data. where cds spread data are unavailable for a specific counterparty, bond market spreads, cds spread data based on the counterparty's credit rating or cds spread data that reference a comparable counterparty may be utilized. the firm also considers collateral held and legally enforceable master netting agreements that mitigate its exposure to each counterparty.
adjustments for model uncertainty are taken for positions whose underlying models are reliant on significant inputs that are neither directly nor indirectly observable, hence requiring reliance on established theoretical concepts in their derivation. these adjustments are derived by making assessments of the possible degree of variability using statistical approaches and market-based information where possible.
the firm may apply concentration adjustments to certain of its otc derivative portfolios to reflect the additional cost of closing out a particularly large risk exposure. where possible, these adjustments are based on observable market information, but in many instances, significant judgment is required to estimate the costs of closing out concentrated risk exposures due to the lack of liquidity in the marketplace.
the firm applies an fva in the fair value measurements of otc uncollateralized or partially collateralized derivatives and in collateralized derivatives where the terms of the agreement do not permit the reuse of the collateral received. in general, fva reflects a market funding risk premium inherent in the noted derivative instruments. the methodology for measuring fva leverages the firm's existing credit-related valuation adjustment calculation methodologies, which apply to both assets and liabilities.
see note 5 for a description of valuation techniques applied to the major categories of financial instruments measured at fair value.
assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis certain of the firm's assets and liabilities are measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis. the firm incurs losses or gains for any adjustments of these assets or liabilities to fair value.
for assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis, fair value is determined by using various december 2020 form 10-k notes to consolidated financial statements valuation approaches. the same hierarchy for inputs as described above, which requires that observable inputs be used when available, is used in measuring fair value for these items.
for further information on financial assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring and non-recurring basis, see note 5.
offsetting of derivative instruments in connection with its derivative activities, the firm generally enters into master netting agreements and collateral agreements with its counterparties. these agreements provide the firm with the right, in the event of a default by the counterparty, to net a counterparty's rights and obligations under the agreement and to liquidate and set off cash collateral against any net amount owed by the counterparty. derivatives with enforceable master netting agreements are reported net of cash collateral received and posted.
however, in certain circumstances, the firm may not have such an agreement in place; the relevant insolvency regime may not support the enforceability of the master netting agreement or collateral agreement; or the firm may not have sought legal advice to support the enforceability of the agreement. in cases where the firm has not determined an agreement to be enforceable, the related amounts are not offset (see note 7).
the firm's policy is generally to receive cash and/or securities posted as collateral (with rights of rehypothecation), irrespective of the enforceability determination regarding the master netting and collateral agreement. in certain cases, the firm may agree for such collateral to be posted to a third-party custodian under a control agreement that enables it to take control of such collateral in the event of a counterparty default. the enforceability of the master netting agreement is taken into account in the firm's risk management practices and application of counterparty credit limits.
for information related to offsetting of derivatives, see note 7.
hedge accounting the firm applies hedge accounting using various derivative financial instruments for the following types of hedges: hedges of changes in the fair value of assets and liabilities due to the risk being hedged (fair value hedges); and hedges of net investments in foreign operations whose functional currency is different from the reporting currency of the parent company (net investment hedges). these financial instruments are included within trading assets-derivative and other contracts or trading liabilities-derivative and other contracts in the balance sheets. for hedges where hedge accounting is being applied, the firm performs effectiveness testing and other procedures.
fair value hedges-interest rate risk the firm's designated fair value hedges consist of interest rate swaps designated as hedges of changes in the benchmark interest rate of certain fixed rate afs securities and senior borrowings. in the fourth quarter of 2019, the firm also began designating interest rate swaps as fair value hedges of changes in the benchmark interest rate of certain fixed rate deposits. the firm is permitted to hedge the full, or part of the, contractual term of the hedged instrument. the firm uses regression analysis to perform an ongoing prospective and retrospective assessment of the effectiveness of these hedging relationships. a hedging relationship is deemed effective if the change in fair value of the hedging instrument (derivative) and the change in fair value of the hedged item (afs security, deposit liability or borrowing), due to changes in the benchmark interest rate, offset within a range of 80% to 125%. the firm considers the impact of valuation adjustments related to counterparty credit spreads and its own credit spreads to determine whether they would cause the hedging relationship to be ineffective.
for qualifying fair value hedges of benchmark interest rates, the change in the fair value of the derivative, offset by the change in the fair value attributable to the change in the benchmark interest rate risk of the hedged asset (liability), is recognized in earnings each period as a component of interest income (expense). for afs securities, the change in fair value of the hedged item due to changes other than the risk being hedged will continue to be reported in oci. when a derivative is de-designated as a hedge, any basis adjustment remaining on the hedged asset (liability) is amortized to interest income (expense) over the remaining life of the asset (liability) using the effective interest method.
net investment hedges the firm uses forward foreign exchange contracts to manage a portion of the currency exposure relating to its net investments in foreign operations. to the extent that the notional amounts of the hedging instruments equal the portion of the investments being hedged and the underlying exchange rate of the derivative hedging instrument is the same as the exchange rate between the functional currency of the investee and the intermediate parent entity's functional currency, it is considered to be perfectly effective, with no income statement recognition. the gain or loss from revaluing hedges of net investments in foreign operations at the spot rate is reported within aoci. the forward points on the hedging instruments are excluded from hedge effectiveness testing and changes in the fair value of this excluded component are recorded currently in interest income.
for further information on derivative instruments and hedging activities, see note 7.
afs investment securities afs securities are reported at fair value in the balance sheets. interest income, including amortization of premiums and december 2020 form 10-k notes to consolidated financial statements accretion of discounts, is included in interest income in the income statements. unrealized gains are recorded in oci and unrealized losses are recorded either in oci or in other revenues as described below.
afs securities in an unrealized loss position are first evaluated to determine whether there is an intent to sell or it is more likely than not the firm will be required to sell before recovery of the amortized cost basis. if so, the amortized cost basis is written down to the fair value of the security such that the entire unrealized loss is recognized in other revenues and any previously established acl is written off.
for all other afs securities in an unrealized loss position, any portion of unrealized losses representing a credit loss is recognized in other revenues and as an increase to the acl for afs securities, with the remainder of unrealized losses recognized in oci. a credit loss exists if the firm does not expect to recover the amortized cost basis of the security. when considering whether a credit loss exists, the firm considers relevant information, including:
•adverse conditions specifically related to the security, its industry or geographic area;
•changes in the financial condition of the issuer of the security, or, in the case of an asset-backed debt security, changes in the financial condition of the underlying loan obligors;
•the payment structure of the debt security and the likelihood of the issuer being able to make payments that increase in the future;
•failure of the issuer of the security to make scheduled interest or principal payments;
•the current rating and any changes to the rating of the security by a rating agency.
if a credit loss exists, the firm measures the credit loss as the difference between the present value of cash flows expected to be collected (discounted at the implicit interest rate at acquisition of the security or discounted at the effective yield for securities that incorporate changes in prepayment assumptions) and the amortized cost basis of the security. changes in prepayment assumptions alone are not considered to result in a credit loss. when estimating the present value of expected cash flows, information utilized includes the remaining payment terms of the security, prepayment speeds, financial condition of the issuer, expected defaults and the value of any underlying collateral.

htm securities htm securities are reported at amortized cost, net of any acl, in the balance sheets. refer to "allowance for credit losses" herein for guidance on the acl determination. interest income, including amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts on htm securities, is included in interest income in the income statements.
loans the firm accounts for loans based on the following categories: loans held for investment; loans held for sale; and loans at fair value.
nonaccrual all loan categories described below follow the same nonaccrual and write-off guidance as discussed in "allowance for credit losses" herein.
loans held for investment loans held for investment are reported at outstanding principal adjusted for any charge-offs, the allowance for loan losses, any unamortized deferred fees or costs for originated loans, and any unamortized premiums or discounts for purchased loans.
interest income.    interest income on performing loans held for investment is accrued and recognized as interest income at the contractual rate of interest. purchase price discounts or premiums, as well as net deferred loan fees or costs, are amortized into interest income over the life of the loan to produce a level rate of return.
lending commitments.    the firm records the liability and related expense for the credit exposure related to commitments to fund loans. for more information regarding loan commitments, standby letters of credit and financial guarantees, see note 15.
for more information regarding allowance for credit losses, refer to "allowance for credit losses" herein.
loans held for sale loans held for sale are measured at the lower of cost or fair value, with valuation changes recorded in other revenues. the firm determines the valuation allowance on an individual loan basis, except for residential mortgage loans for which the valuation allowance is determined at the loan product level. any decreases in fair value below the initial carrying amount december 2020 form 10-k notes to consolidated financial statements and any recoveries in fair value up to the initial carrying amount are recorded in other revenues. increases in fair value above initial carrying value are not recognized.
interest income. interest income on loans held for sale is accrued and recognized based on the contractual rate of interest. loan origination fees or costs and purchase price discounts or premiums are deferred as an adjustment to the loan's cost basis until the related loan is sold and, as such, are included in the periodic determination of the lower of cost or fair value adjustments and the gain or loss recognized at the time of sale.
lending commitments. commitments to fund mortgage loans held for sale are derivatives and are reported in trading assets or trading liabilities in the balance sheets with an offset to trading revenues in the income statements.
for commitments to fund non-mortgage loans, the firm records the liability and related expense for the fair value exposure below cost of such commitments in other liabilities and accrued expenses in the balance sheets with an offset to other revenues in the income statements.
because loans and lending commitments held for sale are recognized at the lower of cost or fair value, the allowance for loan losses and charge-off policies do not apply to these loans.
loans at fair value loans for which the fair value option is elected are carried at fair value, with changes in fair value recognized in earnings. loans carried at fair value are not evaluated for purposes of recording an allowance for loan losses. for further information on loans carried at fair value and classified as trading assets and trading liabilities, see note 5.
lending commitments. the firm records the liability and related expense for the fair value exposure related to commitments to fund loans that will be measured at fair value. the liability is recorded in trading liabilities in the balance sheets, and the expense is recorded in trading revenues in the income statements.
because such loans and lending commitments are reported at fair value, the allowance for loan losses and charge-off policies do not apply to these loans.
for further information on loans, see note 10.
allowance for credit losses the acl for financial instruments measured at amortized cost and certain off-balance sheet exposures (e.g., hfi loans and lending commitments, htm securities, customer and other receivables and certain guarantees) represents an estimate of expected credit losses over the entire life of the financial instrument.
factors considered by management when determining the acl include payment status, fair value of collateral and expected payments of principal and interest, as well as internal or external information relating to past events, current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts. the firm uses three forecasts that include assumptions about certain macroeconomic variables including, but not limited to, u.s. gross domestic product ("gdp"), equity market indices and unemployment rates, as well as commercial real estate and home price indices. at the conclusion of the firm's reasonable and supportable forecast period of 13 quarters, there is a gradual reversion back to historical averages.
the acl is measured on a collective basis when similar risk characteristics exist for multiple instruments considering all available information relevant to assessing the collectability of cash flows. generally, the firm applies a probability of default/loss given default model for instruments that are collectively assessed, under which the acl is calculated as the product of probability of default, loss given default and exposure at default. these parameters are forecast for each collective group of assets using a scenario-based statistical model.
if the instrument does not share similar risk characteristics with other instruments, including when it is probable that the firm will be unable to collect the full payment of principal and interest on the instrument when due, the acl is measured on an individual basis. the firm generally applies a discounted cash flow method for instruments that are individually assessed.
the firm may also elect to use an approach that considers the fair value of the collateral when measuring the acl if the loan is collateral dependent (i.e., repayment of the loan is expected to be provided substantially by the sale or operation of the underlying collateral and the borrower is experiencing financial difficulty).
additionally, the firm can elect to use an approach to measure the acl using the fair value of collateral where the borrower is required to, and reasonably expected to, continually adjust and replenish the amount of collateral securing the instrument to reflect changes in the fair value of such collateral. the firm has elected to use this approach for certain securities-based loans, margin loans, securities purchased under agreements to resell and securities borrowed.
•corporate loans, secured lending facilities, commercial real estate loans and securities, and other loans: internal risk ratings developed by the credit risk management department that are refreshed at least annually, and more frequently as necessary. these ratings generally correspond to external ratings published by s&p. the firm also december 2020 form 10-k notes to consolidated financial statements considers transaction structure, including type of collateral, collateral terms and position of the obligation within the capital structure. in addition, for commercial real estate, the firm considers property type and location, net operating income and ltv ratios, among other factors, as well as commercial real estate price and credit spread indices and capitalization rates.
•employee loans: employment status, which includes those currently employed by the firm and for which the firm can deduct any unpaid amounts due to it through certain compensation arrangements; and those no longer employed by the firm where such arrangements are no longer applicable.
for securities-based loans, the firm generally measures the acl based on the fair value of collateral.
qualitative and environmental factors such as economic and business conditions, the nature and volume of the portfolio, and lending terms and the volume and severity of past due loans are also considered in the acl calculations.
presentation of acl and provision for credit losses acl                                          provision for credit losses instruments measured at amortized cost (e.g., hfi loans, htm securities and customer and other receivables)       contra asset                                 other revenue employee loans                                                                                                    contra asset                                 compensation and benefits expense off-balance sheet instruments (e.g., hfi lending commitments and certain guarantees)                              other liabilities and accrued expenses       other expense troubled debt restructurings "tdrs"
the firm may modify the terms of certain loans for economic or legal reasons related to a borrower's financial difficulties by granting one or more concessions that the firm would not otherwise consider. such modifications are accounted for and reported as a tdr, except for certain modifications related to the coronavirus disease ("covid-19") as noted in "modifications and nonaccrual status for borrowers impacted by covid-19" herein. a loan that has been modified in a tdr is generally considered to be impaired and is evaluated individually. tdrs are also generally classified as nonaccrual and may be returned to accrual status only after the firm expects repayment of the remaining contractual principal and interest and there is sustained repayment performance for a reasonable period.
nonaccrual the firm places financial instruments on nonaccrual status if principal or interest is not expected when contractually due or is past due for a period of 90 days or more unless the obligation is well-secured and in the process of collection. for borrowers impacted by covid-19, see "modifications and nonaccrual status for borrowers impacted by covid-19" herein for additional considerations.
for any instrument placed on nonaccrual status, the firm reverses any unpaid interest accrued with an offsetting reduction to interest income. principal and interest payments received on nonaccrual instruments are applied to principal if there is doubt regarding the ultimate collectability of principal. if collection of the principal is not in doubt, interest income is realized on a cash basis. if the instrument is brought current and neither principal or interest collection is in doubt, instruments can generally return to accrual status and interest income can be recognized.
modifications and nonaccrual status for borrowers impacted by covid-19
in the first quarter of 2020, the firm elected to apply the guidance issued by congress in the coronavirus aid, relief, and economic security act ("cares act") as well as by the u.s. banking agencies stating that certain concessions granted to borrowers that are current on existing loans, either individually or as part of a program for creditworthy borrowers who are experiencing short-term financial or operational problems as a result of covid-19, generally would not be considered tdrs. additionally, these loans generally would not be considered nonaccrual unless collectability concerns exist despite the modification provided. for loans remaining on accrual status, the firm elected to continue recognizing interest income during the modification periods.
acl charge-offs the principal balance of a financial instrument is charged off in the period it is deemed uncollectible resulting in a reduction in the acl and the balance of the financial instrument in the balance sheet. accrued interest receivable balances that are separately recorded from the related financial instruments are charged off against interest income when the related financial instrument is placed on nonaccrual. accordingly, the firm elected not to measure an acl for accrued interest receivables. however, in the case of loans that are modified as a result of covid-19 and remain on accrual status due to the relief noted in "modifications and nonaccrual status for borrowers impacted by covid-19" herein, accrued interest receivable balances are assessed for any required acl.
transfers of financial assets transfers of financial assets are accounted for as sales when the firm has relinquished control over the transferred assets. any related gain or loss on sale is recorded in net revenues. transfers that are not accounted for as sales are treated as collateralized financings. securities borrowed or purchased under agreements to resell and securities loaned or sold under december 2020 form 10-k notes to consolidated financial statements agreements to repurchase are treated as collateralized financings (see note 9).
securities purchased under agreements to resell ("reverse repurchase agreements") and securities sold under agreements to repurchase ("repurchase agreements") are carried in the balance sheets at the amount of cash paid or received, plus accrued interest, except for certain reverse repurchase and repurchase agreements for which the firm has elected the fair value option (see note 6). where appropriate, repurchase agreements and reverse repurchase agreements with the same counterparty are reported on a net basis. securities borrowed and securities loaned are recorded at the amount of cash collateral advanced or received.
in instances where the firm is the lender in securities-for-securities transactions and is permitted to sell or repledge these securities, the fair value of the collateral received is reported in trading assets, and the related obligation to return the collateral is reported in trading liabilities in the balance sheets. securities-for-securities transactions where the firm is the borrower are not included in the balance sheets.
in order to manage credit exposure arising from these transactions, in appropriate circumstances, the firm enters into master netting agreements and collateral agreements with its counterparties. these agreements provide the firm with the right, in the event of a default by the counterparty, to net a counterparty's rights and obligations under the agreement and to liquidate and set off collateral held by the firm against the net amount owed by the counterparty.
the firm's policy is generally to take possession of securities purchased or borrowed in connection with reverse repurchase agreements and securities borrowed transactions, respectively, and to receive cash and/or securities delivered under repurchase agreements or securities loaned transactions (with rights of rehypothecation).
for information related to offsetting of certain collateralized transactions, see note 9.
premises, equipment and capitalized software costs premises, equipment and capitalized software costs consist of buildings, leasehold improvements, furniture, fixtures, computer and communications equipment, power generation assets and capitalized software (externally purchased and developed for internal use). premises, equipment and capitalized software costs are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization and are included in other assets in the balance sheets. depreciation and amortization are provided by the straight-line method over the estimated useful life of the asset.

power generation assets                                         15 to 29
capitalized software costs                                       2 to 10
premises, equipment and capitalized software costs are tested for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances suggest that an asset's carrying value may not be fully recoverable.
goodwill and intangible assets the firm tests goodwill for impairment on an annual basis and on an interim basis when certain events or circumstances exist. the firm tests goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level, which is generally at the level of or one level below its business segments. for both the annual and interim tests, the firm has the option to either (i) perform a quantitative impairment test or (ii) first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, in which case the quantitative test would be performed.
when performing a quantitative impairment test, the firm compares the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount, including goodwill. if the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, the goodwill impairment loss is equal to the excess of the carrying value over the fair value, limited to the carrying amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit.
the estimated fair values of the reporting units are derived based on valuation techniques the firm believes market participants would use for each respective reporting unit. the estimated fair values are generally determined by utilizing a discounted cash flow methodology or methodologies that incorporate price-to-book and price-to-earnings multiples of certain comparable companies.
intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives and are reviewed for impairment on an interim basis when impairment indicators are present. impairment losses are recorded within other expenses in the income statements.
earnings per common share basic eps is computed by dividing earnings available to morgan stanley common shareholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the period. earnings available to morgan stanley common shareholders represents net income applicable to morgan stanley reduced by preferred stock dividends. common shares outstanding include common stock and vested rsus where recipients december 2020 form 10-k notes to consolidated financial statements have satisfied the relevant vesting terms. diluted eps reflects the assumed conversion of all dilutive securities.
share-based awards that pay dividend equivalents subject to vesting are included in diluted shares outstanding (if dilutive) under the treasury stock method.
the firm has granted psus that vest and convert to shares of common stock only if predetermined performance and market goals are satisfied. since the issuance of the shares is contingent upon the satisfaction of certain conditions, the psus are included in diluted eps based on the number of shares (if any) that would be issuable if the reporting date was the end of the performance period.
for further information on diluted earnings (loss) per common share, see note 18 to the financial statements.
deferred compensation stock-based compensation the firm measures compensation expense for stock-based awards at fair value. the firm determines the fair value of rsus (including psus with non-market performance conditions) based on the grant-date fair value of its common stock, measured as the volume-weighted average price on the date of grant ("vwap"). the fair value of rsus not entitled to dividends until conversion is measured at vwap reduced by the present value of dividends expected to be paid on the underlying shares prior to scheduled conversion date. psus that contain market-based conditions are valued using a monte carlo valuation model.
compensation expense is recognized over the vesting period relevant to each separately vesting portion of the award. compensation expense for awards with performance conditions is recognized based on the probable outcome of the performance condition at each reporting date. compensation expense for awards with market-based conditions is recognized irrespective of the probability of the market condition being achieved and is not reversed if the market condition is not met. the firm accounts for forfeitures as they occur.
stock-based awards generally contain clawback and cancellation provisions. certain awards provide the firm discretion to claw back or cancel all or a portion of the award under specified circumstances. compensation expense for those awards is adjusted for changes in the fair value of the firm's common stock or the relevant model valuation, as appropriate, until conversion, exercise or expiration.
employee stock trusts in connection with certain stock-based compensation plans, the firm has established employee stock trusts to provide, at its discretion, common stock voting rights to certain rsu holders. following an rsu award, when a stock trust is utilized, the firm contributes shares to be held in the stock trust until the rsus convert to common shares. the assets of the employee stock trusts are consolidated with those of the firm and are generally accounted for in a manner similar to treasury stock, where the shares of common stock outstanding reported in common stock issued to employee stock trusts are offset by an equal amount reported in employee stock trusts in the balance sheets.
the firm uses the grant-date fair value of stock-based compensation as the basis for recording the movement of the assets to or from the employee stock trusts. changes in the fair value are not recognized as the firm's stock-based compensation must be settled by delivery of a fixed number of shares of the firm's common stock.
deferred cash-based compensation compensation expense for deferred cash-based compensation awards is calculated based on the notional value of the award granted, adjusted for changes in the fair value of the referenced investments that employees select. compensation expense is recognized over the vesting period relevant to each separately vesting portion of the award. compensation expense for these awards is adjusted based on notional earnings of the referenced investments until distribution.
the firm invests directly, as a principal, in financial instruments and other investments to economically hedge certain of its obligations under its deferred cash-based compensation plans. changes in the value of such investments are recorded in trading revenues and investments revenues. although changes in compensation expense resulting from changes in the fair value of the referenced investments will generally be offset by changes in the fair value of investments made by the firm, there is typically a timing difference between the immediate recognition of gains and losses on the firm's investments and the deferred recognition of the related compensation expense over the vesting period.
retirement-eligible employee compensation for year-end stock-based awards and deferred cash-based compensation awards anticipated to be granted to retirement-eligible employees under award terms that do not contain a future service requirement, the firm accrues the estimated cost of the awards over the course of the calendar year preceding the grant date, which reflects the period over which the compensation is earned.
carried interest compensation the firm generally recognizes compensation expense for any portion of carried interest (both realized and unrealized) that is allocated to employees. for information on performance-based fees in the form of carried interest, which are directly related to carried interest compensation, see "revenue recognition-carried interest" herein.
december 2020 form 10-k notes to consolidated financial statements income taxes deferred tax assets and liabilities are recorded based upon the temporary differences between the financial statement and income tax bases of assets and liabilities using currently enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. the effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in income tax expense (benefit) in the period that includes the enactment date. such effects are recorded in income tax expense (benefit) from continuing operations regardless of where deferred taxes were originally recorded.
the firm recognizes net deferred tax assets to the extent that it believes these assets are more likely than not to be realized. in making such a determination, the firm considers all available positive and negative evidence, including future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences, projected future taxable income, tax planning strategies and results of recent operations. when performing the assessment, the firm considers all types of deferred tax assets in combination with each other, regardless of the origin of the underlying temporary difference. if a deferred tax asset is determined to be unrealizable, a valuation allowance is established. if the firm subsequently determines that it would be able to realize deferred tax assets in excess of their net recorded amount, it would make an adjustment to the deferred tax asset valuation allowance, which would reduce the provision for income taxes.
the firm recognizes tax expense associated with global intangible low-taxed income as it is incurred as part of the current income taxes to be paid or refunded for the current period.
uncertain tax positions are recorded on the basis of a two-step process, whereby (i) the firm determines whether it is more likely than not that the tax positions will be sustained on the basis of the technical merits of the position and (ii) for those tax positions that meet this threshold, the firm recognizes the largest amount of tax benefit that is more likely than not to be realized upon ultimate settlement with the related tax authority. interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits are recognized as a component of the provision for income taxes.
foreign currencies assets and liabilities of operations with non-u.s. dollar functional currencies are translated at year-end rates of exchange. gains or losses resulting from translating foreign currency financial statements, net of hedge gains or losses and related tax effects, are reflected in aoci in the balance sheets. gains or losses resulting from remeasurement of foreign currency transactions are included in net income, and amounts recognized in the income statement are translated at the rate of exchange on the respective date of recognition for each amount.
reference rate reform the firm has adopted the reference rate reform accounting update. there was no impact to the firm's financial statements upon initial adoption.
this accounting update provides optional accounting relief to entities with contracts, hedge accounting relationships or other transactions that reference libor or other interest rate benchmarks for which the referenced rate is expected to be discontinued or replaced. the firm is applying the accounting relief as relevant contract and hedge accounting relationship modifications are made during the course of the reference rate reform transition period. the optional relief generally allows for contract modifications solely related to the replacement of the reference rate to be accounted for as a continuation of the existing contract instead of as an extinguishment of the contract and would therefore not trigger certain accounting impacts that would otherwise be required. it also allows entities to change certain critical terms of existing hedge accounting relationships that are affected by reference rate reform, and these changes would not require de-designating the hedge accounting relationship. the optional relief ends december 31, 2022.
financial instruments-credit losses the firm has adopted the financial instruments-credit losses.
this accounting update impacted the impairment model for certain financial assets measured at amortized cost by requiring a cecl methodology to estimate expected credit losses over the entire life of the financial asset, recorded at inception or purchase. cecl replaced the incurred loss model previously applicable to loans held for investment, htm securities and other receivables carried at amortized cost, such as employee loans.
the update also eliminated the concept of other-than-temporary impairment for afs securities and instead requires impairments on afs securities to be recognized in earnings through an allowance when the fair value is less than amortized cost and a credit loss exists, and through a permanent reduction of the amortized cost basis when the securities are expected to be sold before recovery of amortized cost.
at transition on january 1, 2020, the adoption of this accounting standard resulted in an increase in the allowance for credit losses of $131 million with a corresponding reduction in retained earnings of $100 million, net of tax. the adoption impact was primarily attributable to a $124 million increase in the allowance for credit losses on employee loans.
december 2020 form 10-k notes to consolidated financial statements accounting updates adopted in 2019
leases upon the adoption of leases, the firm began recognizing in the balance sheet leases with terms exceeding one year as right-of-use ("rou") assets and corresponding liabilities. the adoption resulted in an increase to retained earnings of approximately $63 million, net of tax, related to deferred revenue from previously recorded sale-leaseback transactions. at transition on january 1, 2019, the adoption also resulted in a balance sheet gross-up of approximately $4 billion reflected in other assets and other liabilities and accrued expenses. see note 10 for lease disclosures, including amounts reflected in the december 31, 2019 balance sheet. prior period amounts were not restated.
as allowed by the guidance, the firm elected not to reassess the following at transition: whether existing contracts are or contain leases; and for existing leases, lease classification and initial direct costs. in addition, the firm continues to account for existing land easements as service contracts.
both at transition and for new leases thereafter, rou assets and lease liabilities are initially recognized based on the present value of the future minimum lease payments over the lease term, including non-lease components such as fixed common area maintenance costs and other fixed costs such as real estate taxes and insurance.
the discount rates used in determining the present value of leases are the firm's incremental borrowing rates, developed based upon each lease's term and currency of payment. the lease term includes options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that the firm will exercise that option. for operating leases, the rou assets also include any prepaid lease payments and initial direct costs incurred and are reduced by lease incentives. for these leases, lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term if the rou asset has not been impaired or abandoned.
the amendments in this update permit use of the ois rate based on the secured overnight financing rate as a u.s. benchmark interest rate for hedge accounting purposes. the firm adopted this update on a prospective basis for qualifying new or redesignated hedging relationships. this update did not impact the firm's pre-existing hedges.
3. acquisitions acquisition of e*trade on october 2, 2020, the firm completed the acquisition of 100% of e*trade financial corporation ("e*trade") in a stock-for-stock transaction, which increases the scale and breadth of the wealth management business segment. total consideration for the transaction was approximately $11.9
billion, which principally consists of the $11 billion fair value of 233 million common shares issued from common stock held in treasury, at an exchange ratio of 1.0432 per e*trade common share. in addition, the firm issued series m and series n preferred shares with a fair value of approximately $0.7 billion in exchange for e*trade's existing preferred stock.
upon acquisition, the assets and liabilities of e*trade were adjusted to their respective fair values as of the closing date of the transaction, including the identifiable intangible assets acquired. in addition, the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net assets acquired has been recorded as goodwill. the fair value estimates used in valuing certain acquired assets and liabilities are based, in part, on inputs that are unobservable. for intangible assets, these include, but are not limited to, forecasted future cash flows, revenue growth rates, customer attrition rates and discount rates.
e*trade purchase price allocation
customer and other receivables                  12,267
customer and other payables                     15,488
1.acquired intangible assets are primarily composed of $2.8 billion related to customer relationships with a weighted-average life of 17 years.
e*trade's results are included in the firm's consolidated results for the period from october 2, 2020 to december 31, 2020. for this period, net revenues were approximately $600 million and net income (loss) was not material.
97                december 2020 form 10-k notes to consolidated financial statements morgan stanley and e*trade proforma combined financial information (unaudited)
the proforma financial information presented in the previous table was computed by combining the historical financial information of the firm and e*trade along with the effects of the acquisition method of accounting for business combinations as though the companies were combined on january 1, 2019. the proforma information does not reflect the potential benefits of cost and funding synergies, opportunities to earn additional revenues, or other factors, and therefore does not represent what the actual net revenues and net income would have been had the companies actually been combined as of this date.
4. cash and cash equivalents cash and cash equivalents consist of cash and due from banks and interest bearing deposits with banks. cash equivalents are highly liquid investments with remaining maturities of three months or less from the acquisition date that are readily convertible to cash and are not held for trading purposes.
cash and cash equivalents also include restricted cash such as cash segregated in compliance with federal or other regulations, including minimum reserve requirements set by the federal reserve bank and other central banks, and the firm's initial margin deposited with clearing organizations.

•depending on the product and the terms of the transaction, the fair value of otc derivative products can be modeled using a series of techniques, including closed-form analytic formulas, such as the black-scholes option-pricing model, simulation models or a combination thereof. many pricing models do not entail material subjectivity as the methodologies employed do not necessitate significant judgment since model inputs may be observed from actively quoted markets, as is the case for generic interest rate swaps, many equity, commodity and foreign currency option contracts, and certain cds. in the case of more established derivative products, the pricing models used by the firm are widely accepted by the financial services industry.
•more complex otc derivative products are typically less liquid and require more judgment in the implementation of the valuation technique since direct trading activity or quotes are unobservable. this includes certain types of interest rate derivatives with both volatility and correlation exposure, equity, commodity or foreign currency derivatives that are either longer-dated or include exposure to multiple underlyings, and credit derivatives, including cds on certain mortgage- or asset-backed securities and basket cds. where required inputs are unobservable, relationships to observable data points, based on historical and/or implied observations, may be employed as a technique to estimate the model input values. for further information on the valuation techniques for otc derivative products, see note 2.
•investments include direct investments in equity securities, as well as various investment management funds, which include investments made in connection with certain employee deferred compensation plans.
•exchange-traded direct equity investments are generally valued based on quoted prices from the exchange.
•for direct investments, initially, the transaction price is generally considered by the firm as the exit price and is its best estimate of fair value.
•after initial recognition, in determining the fair value of non-exchange-traded internally and externally managed funds, the firm generally considers the nav of the fund provided by the fund manager to be the best estimate of fair value. these investments are included in the fund interests table in the "net asset value measurements" section herein.
•for non-exchange-traded investments either held directly or held within internally managed funds, fair value after initial recognition is based on an assessment of each underlying investment, considering rounds of financing and third-party transactions, discounted cash flow analyses and market-based information, including comparable firm transactions, trading multiples and changes in market outlook, among other factors.

1.a single amount is disclosed for range and average when there is no significant difference between the minimum, maximum and average. amounts represent weighted averages except where simple averages and the median of the inputs are more relevant.
2.includes derivative contracts with multiple risks (i.e., hybrid products).
the previous tables provide information on the valuation techniques, significant unobservable inputs, and the ranges and averages for each major category of assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring and nonrecurring basis with a significant level 3 balance. the level of aggregation and breadth of products cause the range of inputs to be wide and not evenly distributed across the inventory of financial instruments. further, the range of unobservable inputs may differ across firms in the financial services industry because of diversity in the types of products included in each firm's inventory. generally, there are no predictable relationships between multiple significant unobservable inputs attributable to a given valuation technique.
other than as follows, during 2020, there were no significant revisions made to the descriptions of the firm's significant unobservable inputs. for margin loans, the margin loan rate is the annualized rate that reflects the possibility of losses as a result of movements in the price of the underlying margin loan collateral. the rate is calibrated from the previously disclosed discount rate, credit spread and/or volatility measures.
•comparable bond or loan price: a pricing input used when prices for the identical instrument are not available. significant subjectivity may be involved when fair value is determined using pricing data available for comparable instruments. valuation using comparable instruments can be done by calculating an implied yield (or spread over a liquid benchmark) from the price of a comparable bond or loan, then adjusting that yield (or spread) to derive a value for the bond or loan. the adjustment to yield (or spread) should account for relevant differences in the bonds or loans such as maturity or credit quality. alternatively, a price-to-price basis can be assumed between the comparable instrument and the bond or loan being valued in order to establish the value of the bond or loan.
•comparable equity price: a price derived from equity raises, share buybacks and external bid levels, etc. a discount or premium may be included in the fair value estimate.
•contingency probability: probability associated with the realization of an underlying event upon which the value of an asset is contingent.
•ebitda multiple / exit multiple: the ratio of enterprise value to ebitda, where enterprise value is the aggregate value of equity and debt minus cash and cash equivalents. the ebitda multiple reflects the value of the company in terms of its full-year ebitda, whereas the exit multiple reflects the value of the company in terms of its full-year expected ebitda at exit. either multiple allows comparison between companies from an operational perspective as the effect of capital structure, taxation and depreciation/amortization is excluded.
•recovery rate: amount expressed as a percentage of par that is expected to be received when a credit event occurs.
notes to consolidated financial statements an increase (decrease) to the following significant unobservable inputs would generally result in a lower (higher) fair value.
•cash-synthetic basis: the measure of the price differential between cash financial instruments and their synthetic derivative-based equivalents. the range disclosed in the previous table signifies the number of points by which the synthetic bond equivalent price is higher than the quoted price of the underlying cash bonds.
•funding spread: the cost of borrowing defined as the incremental spread over the ois rate for a specific collateral rate (which refers to the rate applicable to a specific type of security pledged as collateral).
•margin loan rate: the annualized rate that reflects the possibility of losses as a result of movements in the price of the underlying margin loan collateral. the rate is calibrated from the discount rate, credit spreads and/or volatility measures.
•wacc: wacc represents the theoretical rate of return required to debt and equity investors. the wacc is used in a discounted cash flow model that calculates the value of the equity. the model assumes that the cash flow assumptions, including projections, are fully reflected in the current equity value, while the debt to equity ratio is held constant.
an increase (decrease) to the following significant unobservable inputs would generally result in an impact to the fair value, but the magnitude and direction of the impact would depend on whether the firm is long or short the exposure.
•correlation: a pricing input where the payoff is driven by more than one underlying risk. correlation is a measure of the relationship between the movement of two variables (i.e., how the change in one variable influences a change in the other variable).
•credit spread: the credit spread reflects the additional net yield an investor can earn from a security with more credit risk relative to one with less credit risk. the credit spread of a particular security is often quoted in relation to the yield on a credit risk-free benchmark security or reference rate, typically either u.s. treasury or libor.
•interest rate curve: the term structure of interest rates (relationship between interest rates and the time to maturity) and a market's measure of future interest rates at the time of observation. an interest rate curve is used to set interest rate and foreign exchange derivative cash flows and is a pricing input used in the discounting of any otc derivative cash flow.
•volatility: the measure of variability in possible returns for an instrument given how much that instrument changes in value over time. volatility is a pricing input for options and, generally, the lower the volatility, the less risky the option. the level of volatility used in the valuation of a particular option depends on a number of factors, including the nature of the risk underlying that option, the tenor and the strike price of the option.
•volatility skew: the measure of the difference in implied volatility for options with identical underliers and expiry dates but with different strikes.
amounts in the previous table represent the firm's carrying value of general and limited partnership interests in fund investments, as well as any related performance-based fees in the form of carried interest. the carrying amounts are measured based on the nav of the fund taking into account the distribution terms applicable to the interest held. this same measurement applies whether the fund investments are accounted for under the equity method or fair value.
private equity.    funds that pursue multiple strategies, including leveraged buyouts, venture capital, infrastructure growth capital, distressed investments and mezzanine capital. in addition, the funds may be structured with a focus on specific geographic regions.
real estate.    funds that invest in real estate assets such as commercial office buildings, retail properties, multi-family residential properties, developments or hotels. in addition, the funds may be structured with a focus on specific geographic regions.
investments in private equity and real estate funds generally are not redeemable due to the closed-end nature of these funds. instead, distributions from each fund will be received as the underlying investments of the funds are disposed and monetized.
hedge.    funds that pursue various investment strategies, including long-short equity, fixed income/credit, event-driven and multi-strategy.

incremental collateral and termination payments upon potential future ratings downgrade
1.amount represents arrangements between the firm and other parties where upon the downgrade of one party, the downgraded party must deliver collateral to the other party. these bilateral downgrade arrangements are used by the firm to manage the risk of counterparty downgrades.
the additional collateral or termination payments that may be called in the event of a future credit rating downgrade vary by contract and can be based on ratings by either or both of moody's investors service, inc. and s&p global ratings. the previous table shows the future potential collateral amounts and termination payments that could be called or required by counterparties or exchange and clearing organizations in the event of one-notch or two-notch downgrade scenarios based on the relevant contractual downgrade triggers.
notes to consolidated financial statements maximum potential payout/notional of credit protection sold1
fair value asset (liability) of credit protection sold1
1.investment grade/non-investment grade determination is based on the internal credit rating of the reference obligation. internal credit ratings serve as the credit risk management department's assessment of credit risk and the basis for a comprehensive credit limits framework used to control credit risk. the firm uses quantitative models and judgment to estimate the various risk parameters related to each obligor.
the firm enters into credit derivatives, principally cds, under which it receives or provides protection against the risk of default on a set of debt obligations issued by a specified reference entity or entities. a majority of the firm's counterparties for these derivatives are banks, broker-dealers, and insurance and other financial institutions.
the fair value amounts as shown in the previous tables are prior to cash collateral or counterparty netting.
the purchase of credit protection does not represent the sole manner in which the firm risk manages its exposure to credit derivatives. the firm manages its exposure to these derivative contracts through a variety of risk mitigation strategies, which include managing the credit and correlation risk across single-name, non-tranched indices and baskets, tranched indices and baskets, and cash positions. aggregate market risk limits have been established for credit derivatives, and market risk measures are routinely monitored against these limits. the firm may also recover amounts on the underlying reference obligation delivered to the firm under cds where credit protection was sold.
single-name cds.    a cds protects the buyer against the loss of principal on a bond or loan in case of a default by the issuer. the protection buyer pays a periodic premium (generally quarterly) over the life of the contract and is protected for the period. the firm, in turn, performs under a cds if a credit event as defined under the contract occurs. typical credit events include bankruptcy, dissolution or insolvency of the referenced entity, failure to pay and restructuring of the obligations of the referenced entity.
index and basket cds.    index and basket cds are products where credit protection is provided on a portfolio of single-name cds. generally, in the event of a default on one of the underlying names, the firm pays a pro rata portion of the total notional amount of the cds.
the firm also enters into tranched index and basket cds where credit protection is provided on a particular portion of the portfolio loss distribution. the most junior tranches cover

9. collateralized transactions the firm enters into securities purchased under agreements to resell, securities sold under agreements to repurchase, securities borrowed and securities loaned transactions to, among other things, acquire securities to cover short positions and settle other securities obligations, to accommodate customers' needs and to finance its inventory positions.
the firm monitors the fair value of the underlying securities as compared with the related receivable or payable, including accrued interest, and, as necessary, requests additional collateral, as provided under the applicable agreement to ensure such transactions are adequately collateralized, or the return of excess collateral.
the risk related to a decline in the market value of collateral pledged or received is managed by setting appropriate market-based margin requirements. increases in collateral margin calls on secured financing due to market value declines may be mitigated by increases in collateral margin calls on securities purchased under agreements to resell and securities borrowed transactions with similar quality collateral. additionally, the firm may request lower quality collateral pledged be replaced with higher quality collateral through collateral substitution rights in the underlying agreements.
the firm actively manages its secured financings in a manner that reduces the potential refinancing risk of secured financings of less liquid assets and also considers the quality of collateral when negotiating collateral eligibility with counterparties. the firm utilizes shorter term secured financing for highly liquid assets and has established longer tenor limits for less liquid assets, for which funding may be at risk in the event of a market disruption.

the firm is subject to concentration risk by holding large positions in certain types of securities, loans or commitments to purchase securities of a single issuer, including sovereign governments and other entities, issuers located in a particular country or geographic area, public and private issuers involving developing countries or issuers engaged in a particular industry.
positions taken and underwriting and financing commitments, including those made in connection with the firm's private equity, principal investment and lending activities, often involve substantial amounts and significant exposure to individual issuers and businesses, including investment grade and non-investment grade issuers.
customer margin and other lending
the firm provides margin lending arrangements that allow customers to borrow against the value of qualifying securities. receivables under margin lending arrangements are included within customer and other receivables in the balance sheets. under these agreements and transactions, the firm receives collateral, which includes u.s. government and agency securities, other sovereign government obligations, corporate and other debt, and corporate equities. margin loans are collateralized by customer-owned securities held by the firm. the firm monitors required margin levels and established credit terms daily and, pursuant to such guidelines, requires customers to deposit additional collateral, or reduce positions, when necessary.
margin loans are extended on a demand basis and generally are not committed facilities. factors considered in the review of margin loans are the amount of the loan, the intended purpose, the degree of leverage being employed in the account and the amount of collateral, as well as an overall evaluation of the portfolio to ensure proper diversification or, in the case of concentrated positions, appropriate liquidity of the underlying collateral or potential hedging strategies to reduce risk. underlying collateral for margin loans is reviewed with respect to the liquidity of the proposed collateral positions, valuation of securities, historic trading range, volatility analysis and an evaluation of industry concentrations. for these transactions, adherence to the firm's collateral policies significantly limits its credit exposure in the event of a customer default. the firm may request additional margin collateral from customers, if appropriate, and, if necessary, may sell securities that have not been paid for or purchase securities sold but not delivered from customers.
also included in the amounts in the previous table is non-purpose securities-based lending on non-bank entities in the wealth management business segment.
other secured financings other secured financings include the liabilities related to transfers of financial assets that are accounted for as financings rather than sales, consolidated vies where the firm is deemed to be the primary beneficiary, and certain elns and other secured borrowings. these liabilities are generally payable from the cash flows of the related assets, which are accounted for as trading assets (see notes 14 and 16).
10. loans, lending commitments and related allowance for credit losses the firm's held-for-investment and held-for-sale loan portfolios consist of the following types of loans:
•corporate.  corporate includes revolving lines of credit, term loans and bridge loans made to corporate entities for a variety of purposes.
•secured lending facilities.     secured lending facilities include loans provided to clients, which are collateralized by various assets, including residential and commercial real estate mortgage loans, corporate loans and other assets.
notes to consolidated financial statements securities or refinancing margin debt. the majority of these loans are structured as revolving lines of credit. other primarily includes certain loans originated in the tailored lending business within the wealth management business segment.

credit quality crm evaluates new obligors before credit transactions are initially approved and at least annually thereafter for corporate and commercial real estate loans. for corporate, secured lending facilities and other loans, credit evaluations typically involve the evaluation of financial statements, assessment of leverage, liquidity, capital strength, asset composition and quality, market capitalization and access to capital markets, cash flow projections and debt service requirements, and the adequacy of collateral, if applicable. crm also evaluates strategy, market position, industry dynamics, obligor's management and other factors that could affect an obligor's risk profile.
for commercial real estate loans, the credit evaluation is focused on property and transaction metrics, including property type, ltv ratio, occupancy levels, debt service ratio, prevailing capitalization rates and market dynamics.
for residential real estate and securities-based loans, the initial credit evaluation typically includes, but is not limited to, review of the obligor's income, net worth, liquidity, collateral, ltv ratio and credit bureau information. subsequent credit monitoring for residential real estate loans is performed at the portfolio level. securities-based loan collateral values are monitored on an ongoing basis.

cre-commercial real estate sbl-securities-based lending the aggregate allowance for loans and lending commitments increased in 2020, reflecting the provision for credit losses within the institutional securities business segment principally resulting from the continued economic impact of covid-19, partially offset by charge-offs. the provision was primarily the result of actual and forecasted changes in asset quality trends, as well as risks related to uncertainty in the outlook for the sectors in focus due to covid-19. charge-offs in 2020 were primarily related to certain commercial real estate and corporate loans in the institutional securities business segment. the base scenario used in our acl models as of december 31, 2020 was generated using a combination of industry consensus economic forecasts, forward rates, and internally developed and validated models. given the nature of our lending portfolio, the most sensitive model input is u.s. gdp. the base scenario, among other things, assumes a continued recovery through 2021, supported by fiscal stimulus and monetary policy measures.

equity method investments, other than investments in certain fund interests, are summarized above and are included in other assets in the balance sheets with related income or loss included in other revenues in the income statements. see "net asset value measurements-fund interests" in note 5 for the carrying value of certain of the firm's fund interests, which are comprised of general and limited partnership interests, as well as any related carried interest.
the firm and mitsubishi ufj financial group, inc. ("mufg") formed a joint venture in japan comprising their respective investment banking and securities businesses by forming two joint venture companies, mitsubishi ufj morgan stanley securities co., ltd. ("mumss") and morgan stanley mufg securities co., ltd. ("msms") (the "joint venture"). the firm owns a 40% economic interest in the joint venture, and mufg owns the other 60%.
the firm's 40% voting interest in mumss is accounted for under the equity method within the institutional securities business segment and is included in the equity method investment balances above. the firm consolidates msms into the institutional securities business segment, based on its 51% voting interest.
the firm engages in transactions in the ordinary course of business with mufg and its affiliates; for example, investment banking, financial advisory, sales and trading, derivatives, investment management, lending, securitization and other financial services transactions. such transactions are on substantially the same terms as those that would be available to unrelated third parties for comparable transactions.

3.only includes borrowings with original maturities greater than one year. weighted average coupon is calculated utilizing u.s. and non-u.s. dollar interest rates and excludes financial instruments for which the fair value option was elected. virtually all of the variable rate notes issued by subsidiaries are carried at fair value so a weighted average coupon is not meaningful.
certain senior debt securities are denominated in various non-u.s. dollar currencies and may be structured to provide a return that is linked to equity, credit, commodity or other indices (e.g., the consumer price index). senior debt also may be structured to be callable by the firm or extendible at the option of holders of the senior debt securities.
the firm's borrowings include notes carried and managed on a fair value basis. these include instruments whose payments and redemption values are linked to the performance of a specific index, a basket of stocks, a specific equity security, a commodity, a credit exposure or basket of credit exposures; and instruments with various interest-rate-related features, including step-ups, step-downs and zero coupons. to minimize the exposure from such instruments, the firm has entered into various swap contracts and purchased options that effectively convert the borrowing costs into floating rates. the swaps and purchased options used to economically hedge the embedded features are derivatives and also are carried at fair value. changes in fair value related to the notes and economic hedges are reported in trading revenues. see notes

in general, other than securities inventories and customer balances financed by secured funding sources, the majority of the firm's assets are financed with a combination of deposits, short-term funding, floating rate long-term debt or fixed rate long-term debt swapped to a floating rate. the firm uses interest rate swaps to more closely match these borrowings to the duration, holding period and interest rate characteristics of the assets being funded and to manage interest rate risk. these swaps effectively convert certain of the firm's fixed rate borrowings into floating rate obligations. in addition, for non-u.s. dollar currency borrowings that are not used to fund assets in the same currency, the firm has entered into currency swaps that effectively convert the borrowings into u.s. dollar obligations.
the firm's use of swaps for asset and liability management affects its effective average borrowing rate.

1.beginning in 2020, commitments to central counterparties are presented separately; these commitments were previously included in corporate lending commitments and forward-starting secured financing receivables depending on the type of agreement.
since commitments associated with these instruments may expire unused, the amounts shown do not necessarily reflect the actual future cash funding requirements.
types of commitments lending commitments.  lending commitments primarily represent the notional amount of legally binding obligations to provide funding to clients for different types of loan transactions. for syndications that are led by the firm, the lending commitments accepted by the borrower but not yet closed are net of the amounts agreed to by counterparties that will participate in the syndication. for syndications that the firm participates in and does not lead, lending commitments accepted by the borrower but not yet closed include only the amount that the firm expects it will be allocated from the lead syndicate bank. due to the nature of the firm's obligations under the commitments, these amounts include certain commitments participated to third parties.
forward-starting secured financing receivables.  this amount includes securities purchased under agreements to resell and securities borrowed that the firm has entered into prior to the balance sheet date that will settle after the balance sheet date. these transactions are primarily secured by collateral from u.s. government agency securities and other sovereign government obligations when they are funded.
central counterparty.  these commitments relate to the firm's membership in certain clearinghouses and are contingent upon the default of a clearinghouse member or other stress events.
underwriting commitments.  the firm provides underwriting commitments in connection with its capital raising sources to a diverse group of corporate and other institutional clients.
investment activities.  the firm sponsors several non-consolidated investment management funds for third-party investors where it typically acts as general partner of, and investment advisor to, these funds and typically commits to invest a minority of the capital of such funds, with subscribing third-party investors contributing the majority. the firm has contractual capital commitments, guarantees and counterparty arrangements with respect to these investment management funds.
letters of credit and other financial guarantees.  the firm has outstanding letters of credit and other financial guarantees issued by third-party banks to certain of the firm's counterparties. the firm is contingently liable for these letters of credit and other financial guarantees, which are primarily used to provide collateral for securities and commodities traded and to satisfy various margin requirements in lieu of depositing cash or securities with these counterparties.

1.these amounts include certain issued standby letters of credit participated to third parties, totaling $0.6 billion of notional and collateral/recourse, due to the nature of the firm's obligations under these arrangements. as of december 31, 2020, the carrying amount of standby letters of credit and other financial guarantees issued includes an allowance for credit losses of $81 million.
2.the carrying amounts of derivative contracts that meet the accounting definition of a guarantee are shown on a gross basis. for further information on derivatives contracts, see note 7.
types of guarantees derivative contracts. certain derivative contracts meet the accounting definition of a guarantee, including certain written options, contingent forward contracts and cds (see note 7 regarding credit derivatives in which the firm has sold credit protection to the counterparty). all derivative contracts that could meet this accounting definition of a guarantee are included in the previous table, with the notional amount used as the maximum potential payout for certain derivative contracts, such as written interest rate caps and written foreign currency options. the firm evaluates collateral requirements for all derivatives, including derivatives that do not meet the accounting definition of a guarantee. for the effects of cash collateral and counterparty netting, see note 7.
in certain situations, collateral may be held by the firm for those contracts that meet the definition of a guarantee. generally, the firm sets collateral requirements by counterparty so that the collateral covers various transactions and products and is not allocated specifically to individual contracts. also, the firm may recover amounts related to the underlying asset delivered to the firm under the derivative contract.
standby letters of credit and other financial guarantees issued. in connection with its corporate lending business and other corporate activities, the firm provides standby letters of credit and other financial guarantees to counterparties. such arrangements represent obligations to make payments to third parties if the counterparty fails to fulfill its obligation under a borrowing arrangement or other contractual obligation. a majority of the firm's standby letters of credit are provided on behalf of counterparties that are investment grade. if the counterparty fails to fulfill its contractual obligation, the firm has access to collateral or recourse that would approximate its obligation.
market value guarantees. market value guarantees are issued to guarantee timely payment of a specified return to investors in certain affordable housing tax credit funds. these guarantees are designed to return an investor's contribution to a fund and the investor's share of tax losses and tax credits expected to be generated by a fund.
liquidity facilities. the firm has entered into liquidity facilities with spes and other counterparties, whereby the firm is required to make certain payments if losses or defaults occur. primarily, the firm acts as liquidity provider to municipal bond securitization spes and for standalone municipal bonds in which the holders of beneficial interests issued by these spes or the holders of the individual bonds, respectively, have the right to tender their interests for purchase by the firm on specified dates at a specified price. the firm often may have recourse to the underlying assets held by the spes in the event payments are required under such liquidity facilities, as well as make-whole or recourse provisions with the trust sponsors. the recourse amount often exceeds the maximum potential payout amount of the guarantee. substantially all of the underlying assets in the spes are investment grade. liquidity facilities provided to municipal tender option bond trusts are classified as derivatives.
whole loan sales guarantees. the firm has provided, or otherwise agreed to be responsible for, representations and warranties regarding certain whole loan sales. under certain circumstances, the firm may be required to repurchase such assets or make other payments related to such assets if such representations and warranties are breached. the firm's maximum potential payout related to such representations and warranties is equal to the current upb of such loans. since the firm no longer services these loans, it has no information on the current upb of those loans, and accordingly, the amount included in the previous table represents the upb at the time of the whole loan sale or at the time when the firm last serviced any of those loans. the current upb balances could be substantially lower than the maximum potential payout december 2020 form 10-k notes to consolidated financial statements amount included in the previous table. the related liability primarily relates to sales of loans to the federal mortgage agencies.
securitization representations and warranties. as part of the firm's institutional securities business segment's securitizations and related activities, the firm has provided, or otherwise agreed to be responsible for, representations and warranties regarding certain assets transferred in securitization transactions sponsored by the firm. the extent and nature of the representations and warranties, if any, vary among different securitizations. under certain circumstances, the firm may be required to repurchase certain assets or make other payments related to such assets if such representations and warranties are breached. the maximum potential amount of future payments the firm could be required to make would be equal to the current outstanding balances of, or losses associated with, the assets subject to breaches of such representations and warranties. the amount included in the previous table for the maximum potential payout includes the current upb or historical losses where known, and the upb at the time of sale when the current upb is not known.
general partner guarantees. as a general partner in certain investment management funds, the firm receives certain distributions from the partnerships when the return exceeds specified performance targets according to the provisions of the partnership agreements. the firm may be required to return all or a portion of such distributions to the limited partners in the event the limited partners do not achieve a certain return as specified in the various partnership agreements, subject to certain limitations.
client clearing guarantees. in 2019, the firm became a sponsoring member of the government securities division of the ficc's sponsored clearing model. clients of the firm, as sponsored members, can transact in overnight securities repurchase and resale agreements, which are cleared through the ficc. as sponsoring member, the firm guarantees to the ficc the prompt and full payment and performance of its clients' obligations. in 2020, the ficc's sponsored clearing model was updated such that the firm could be responsible for liquidation of a sponsored member's account and guarantees any resulting loss to the ficc in the event the sponsored member fails to fully pay any net liquidation amount due from the sponsored member to the ficc. accordingly, the firm's maximum potential payout amount reflects the total of the estimated net liquidation amounts for sponsored member accounts. the firm minimizes credit exposure under this guarantee by obtaining a security interest in its sponsored member clients' collateral and their contractual rights under sponsored member transactions. therefore, the firm's exposure is estimated to be an amount substantially lower than the maximum potential payout amount. the collateral amount in which the firm has a security interest is approximately equal to the maximum potential payout amount of the guarantee.
other guarantees and indemnities in the normal course of business, the firm provides guarantees and indemnifications in a variety of transactions. these provisions generally are standard contractual terms. certain of these guarantees and indemnifications are described below:
•indemnities. the firm provides standard indemnities to counterparties for certain contingent exposures and taxes, including u.s. and foreign withholding taxes, on interest and other payments made on derivatives, securities and stock lending transactions, certain annuity products and other financial arrangements. these indemnity payments could be required based on a change in the tax laws, a change in interpretation of applicable tax rulings or a change in factual circumstances. certain contracts contain provisions that enable the firm to terminate the agreement upon the occurrence of such events. the maximum potential amount of future payments that the firm could be required to make under these indemnifications cannot be estimated.
•exchange/clearinghouse member guarantees. the firm is a member of various exchanges and clearinghouses that trade and clear securities and/or derivative contracts. associated with its membership, the firm may be required to pay a certain amount as determined by the exchange or the clearinghouse in case of a default of any of its members or pay a proportionate share of the financial obligations of another member that may default on its obligations to the exchange or the clearinghouse. while the rules governing different exchange or clearinghouse memberships and the forms of these guarantees may vary, in general the firm's obligations under these rules would arise only if the exchange or clearinghouse had previously exhausted its resources.
in addition, some clearinghouse rules require members to assume a proportionate share of losses resulting from the clearinghouse's investment of guarantee fund contributions and initial margin, and of other losses unrelated to the default of a clearing member, if such losses exceed the specified resources allocated for such purpose by the clearinghouse.
the maximum potential payout under these rules cannot be estimated. the firm has not recorded any contingent liability in its financial statements for these agreements and believes that any potential requirement to make payments under these agreements is remote.
•merger and acquisition guarantees. the firm may, from time to time, in its role as investment banking advisor be required to provide guarantees in connection with certain european merger and acquisition transactions. if required by the regulating authorities, the firm provides a guarantee that the acquirer in the transaction has or will have sufficient funds to complete the transaction and would then be required to make the acquisition payments in the event december 2020 form 10-k notes to consolidated financial statements the acquirer's funds are insufficient at the completion date of the transaction. these arrangements generally cover the time frame from the transaction offer date to its closing date and, therefore, are generally short term in nature. the firm believes the likelihood of any payment by the firm under these arrangements is remote given the level of its due diligence in its role as investment banking advisor.
in addition, in the ordinary course of business, the firm guarantees the debt and/or certain trading obligations (including obligations associated with derivatives, foreign exchange contracts and the settlement of physical commodities) of certain subsidiaries. these guarantees generally are entity or product specific and are required by investors or trading counterparties. the activities of the firm's subsidiaries covered by these guarantees (including any related debt or trading obligations) are included in the financial statements.
contingencies legal in addition to the matters described in the following paragraphs, in the normal course of business, the firm has been named, from time to time, as a defendant in various legal actions, including arbitrations, class actions and other litigation, arising in connection with its activities as a global diversified financial services institution. certain of the actual or threatened legal actions include claims for substantial compensatory and/or punitive damages or claims for indeterminate amounts of damages. in some cases, the entities that would otherwise be the primary defendants in such cases are bankrupt or are in financial distress. these actions have included, but are not limited to, residential mortgage and credit crisis-related matters.
while the firm has identified below any individual proceedings where the firm believes a material loss to be reasonably possible and reasonably estimable, there can be no assurance that material losses will not be incurred from claims that have not yet been asserted or those where potential losses have not yet been determined to be probable or possible, and reasonably estimable.
the firm contests liability and/or the amount of damages as appropriate in each pending matter. where available information indicates that it is probable a liability had been incurred at the date of the financial statements and the firm can reasonably estimate the amount of that loss, the firm accrues the estimated loss by a charge to income.
the firm's legal expenses can, and may in the future, fluctuate from period to period, given the current environment regarding government investigations and private litigation affecting global financial services firms, including the firm.
in many proceedings and investigations, however, it is inherently difficult to determine whether any loss is probable or even possible or to estimate the amount of any loss. in addition, even where a loss is possible or an exposure to loss exists in excess of the liability already accrued with respect to a previously recognized loss contingency, it is not always possible to reasonably estimate the size of the possible loss or range of loss, particularly for proceedings and investigations where the factual record is being developed or contested or where plaintiffs or government entities seek substantial or indeterminate damages, restitution, disgorgement or penalties. numerous issues may need to be resolved before a loss or additional loss, or range of loss or additional range of loss, can be reasonably estimated for a proceeding or investigation, including through potentially lengthy discovery and determination of important factual matters, determination of issues related to class certification and the calculation of damages or other relief, and by addressing novel or unsettled legal questions relevant to the proceedings or investigations in question.
for certain other legal proceedings and investigations, the firm can estimate reasonably possible losses, additional losses, ranges of loss or ranges of additional loss in excess of amounts accrued but does not believe, based on current knowledge and after consultation with counsel, that such losses could have a material adverse effect on the firm's financial statements as a whole, other than the matters referred to in the following paragraphs.

december 2020 form 10-k notes to consolidated financial statements
16. variable interest entities and securitization activities overview the firm is involved with various spes in the normal course of business. in most cases, these entities are deemed to be vies.
the firm's variable interests in vies include debt and equity interests, commitments, guarantees, derivative instruments and certain fees. the firm's involvement with vies arises primarily from:
•interests purchased in connection with market-making activities, securities held in its investment securities portfolio and retained interests held as a result of securitization activities, including re-securitization transactions.
•structuring of clns or other asset-repackaging notes designed to meet the investment objectives of clients.
•other structured transactions designed to provide tax-efficient yields to the firm or its clients.
the firm determines whether it is the primary beneficiary of a vie upon its initial involvement with the vie and reassesses whether it is the primary beneficiary on an ongoing basis as long as it has any continuing involvement with the vie. this determination is based upon an analysis of the design of the vie, including the vie's structure and activities, the power to make significant economic decisions held by the firm and by other parties, and the variable interests owned by the firm and other parties.
the power to make the most significant economic decisions may take a number of different forms in different types of vies. the firm considers servicing or collateral management decisions as representing the power to make the most significant economic decisions in transactions such as securitizations or cdos. as a result, the firm does not consolidate securitizations or cdos for which it does not act as the servicer or collateral manager unless it holds certain other rights to replace the servicer or collateral manager or to require the liquidation of the entity. if the firm serves as servicer or collateral manager, or has certain other rights described in the previous sentence, the firm analyzes the interests in the vie that it holds and consolidates only those vies for which it holds a potentially significant interest in the vie.
for many transactions, such as re-securitization transactions, clns and other asset-repackaging notes, there are no significant economic decisions made on an ongoing basis. in these cases, the firm focuses its analysis on decisions made prior to the initial closing of the transaction and at the termination of the transaction. the firm concluded in most of these transactions that decisions made prior to the initial closing were shared between the firm and the initial investors based upon the nature of the assets, including whether the assets were issued in a transaction sponsored by the firm and the extent of the information available to the firm and to investors, the number, nature and involvement of investors, other rights held by the firm and investors, the standardization of the legal documentation and the level of continuing involvement by the firm, including the amount and type of interests owned by the firm and by other investors. the firm focused its control decision on any right held by the firm or investors related to the termination of the vie. most re-securitization transactions, clns and other asset-repackaging notes have no such termination rights.

consolidated vie assets and liabilities are presented in the previous tables after intercompany eliminations. generally, most assets owned by consolidated vies cannot be removed unilaterally by the firm and are not available to the firm while the related liabilities issued by consolidated vies are non-recourse to the firm. however, in certain consolidated vies, the firm either has the unilateral right to remove assets or provides additional recourse through derivatives such as total return swaps, guarantees or other forms of involvement.
notes to consolidated financial statements in general, the firm's exposure to loss in consolidated vies is limited to losses that would be absorbed on the vie net assets recognized in its financial statements, net of amounts absorbed by third-party variable interest holders.

1.amounts include transactions backed by residential mortgage loans, commercial mortgage loans and other types of assets, including consumer or commercial assets. and may be in loan or security form.
3.where notional amounts are utilized in quantifying the maximum exposure related to derivatives, such amounts do not reflect changes in fair value recorded by the firm.
4.additional vie assets owned represents the carrying value of total exposure to non-consolidated vies for which the maximum exposure to loss is less than specific thresholds, primarily interests issued by securitization spes. the firm's maximum exposure to loss generally equals the fair value of the assets owned. these assets are primarily included in trading assets and investment securities and are measured at fair value (see note 5). the firm does not provide additional support in these transactions through contractual facilities, guarantees or similar derivatives.
the majority of the vies included in the previous tables are sponsored by unrelated parties; examples of the firm's involvement with these vies include its secondary market-making activities and the securities held in its investment securities portfolio (see note 8).
the firm's maximum exposure to loss is dependent on the nature of the firm's variable interest in the vie and is limited to the notional amounts of certain liquidity facilities and other credit support, total return swaps and written put options, as well as the fair value of certain other derivatives and investments the firm has made in the vie.
the firm's maximum exposure to loss in the previous tables does not include the offsetting benefit of hedges or any reductions associated with the amount of collateral held as part of a transaction with the vie or any party to the vie directly against a specific exposure to loss.
liabilities issued by vies generally are non-recourse to the firm.

securitization activities in a securitization transaction, the firm transfers assets (generally commercial or residential mortgage loans or securities) to an spe, sells to investors most of the beneficial interests, such as notes or certificates, issued by the spe, and, in many cases, retains other beneficial interests. the purchase of the transferred assets by the spe is financed through the sale of these interests.
in many securitization transactions involving commercial mortgage loans, the firm transfers a portion of the assets to the spe with unrelated parties transferring the remaining assets. in addition, mainly in securitization transactions involving residential mortgage loans, the firm may also enter into derivative transactions, primarily interest rate swaps or interest rate caps, with the spe.
although not obligated, the firm generally makes a market in the securities issued by spes in securitization transactions. as a market maker, the firm offers to buy these securities from, and sell these securities to, investors. securities purchased through these market-making activities are not considered to be retained interests; these beneficial interests generally are included in trading assets-corporate and other debt and are measured at fair value.
the firm enters into derivatives, generally interest rate swaps and interest rate caps, with a senior payment priority in many securitization transactions. the risks associated with these and similar derivatives with spes are essentially the same as similar derivatives with non-spe counterparties and are december 2020 form 10-k notes to consolidated financial statements managed as part of the firm's overall exposure. see note 7 for further information on derivative instruments and hedging activities.
investment securities the firm holds securities issued by vies within the investment securities portfolio. these securities are composed of those related to transactions sponsored by the federal mortgage agencies and predominantly the most senior securities issued by vies backed by student loans and commercial mortgage loans. transactions sponsored by the federal mortgage agencies include an explicit or implicit guarantee provided by the u.s. government. additionally, the firm holds certain commercial mortgage-backed securities issued by vies retained as a result of the firm's securitization activities. see note 8 for further information on the investment securities portfolio.
municipal tender option bond trusts in a municipal tender option bond trust transaction, the client transfers a municipal bond to a trust. the trust issues short-term securities that the firm, as the remarketing agent, sells to investors. the client generally retains a residual interest. the short-term securities are supported by a liquidity facility pursuant to which the investors may put their short-term interests. in most programs, a third-party provider will provide such liquidity facility; in some programs, the firm provides this liquidity facility.
the firm may, in lieu of purchasing short-term securities for remarketing, decide to extend a temporary loan to the trust. the client can generally terminate the transaction at any time. the liquidity provider can generally terminate the transaction upon the occurrence of certain events. when the transaction is terminated, the municipal bond is generally sold or returned to the client. any losses suffered by the liquidity provider upon the sale of the bond are the responsibility of the client. this obligation is generally collateralized. liquidity facilities provided to municipal tender option bond trusts are classified as derivatives. the firm consolidates any municipal tender option bond trusts in which it holds the residual interest.
credit protection purchased through credit-linked notes cln transactions are designed to provide investors with exposure to certain credit risk on referenced assets. in these transactions, the firm transfers assets (generally high-quality securities or money market investments) to an spe, enters into a derivative transaction in which the spe sells protection on an unrelated referenced asset or group of assets, through a credit derivative, and sells the securities issued by the spe to investors. in some transactions, the firm may also enter into interest rate or currency swaps with the spe. depending on the structure, the assets and liabilities of the spe may be consolidated and recognized in the firm's balance sheets or accounted for as a sale of assets.
upon the occurrence of a credit event related to the referenced asset, the spe will deliver securities collateral as payment to the firm, which exposes the firm to changes in the collateral's value.
derivative payments by the spe are collateralized. the risks associated with these and similar derivatives with spes are essentially the same as those with non-spe counterparties and are managed as part of the firm's overall exposure.
other structured financings the firm invests in interests issued by entities that develop and own low-income communities (including low-income housing projects) and entities that construct and own facilities that will generate energy from renewable resources. the interests entitle the firm to a share of tax credits and tax losses generated by these projects. in addition, the firm has issued guarantees to investors in certain low-income housing funds. the guarantees are designed to return an investor's contribution to a fund and the investor's share of tax losses and tax credits expected to be generated by the fund. the firm is also involved with entities designed to provide tax-efficient yields to the firm or its clients.
collateralized loan and debt obligations clos and cdos are spes that purchase a pool of assets consisting of corporate loans, corporate bonds, abs or synthetic exposures on similar assets through derivatives, and issue multiple tranches of debt and equity securities to investors. the firm underwrites the securities issued in certain clo transactions on behalf of unaffiliated sponsors and provides advisory services to these unaffiliated sponsors. the firm sells corporate loans to many of these spes, in some cases representing a significant portion of the total assets purchased. although not obligated, the firm generally makes a market in the securities issued by spes in these transactions and may retain unsold securities. these beneficial interests are included in trading assets and are measured at fair value.
equity-linked notes eln transactions are designed to provide investors with exposure to certain risks related to the specific equity security, equity index or other index. in an eln transaction, the firm typically transfers to an spe either a note issued by the firm, the payments on which are linked to the performance of a specific equity security, equity index or other index, or debt securities issued by other companies and a derivative contract, the terms of which will relate to the performance of a specific equity security, equity index or other index. these eln transactions with spes were not consolidated at december 31, 2020 or december 31, 2019.

the previous tables include transactions with spes in which the firm, acting as principal, transferred financial assets with continuing involvement and received sales treatment. the transferred assets are carried at fair value prior to securitization, and any changes in fair value are recognized in the income statements. the firm may act as underwriter of the beneficial interests issued by these securitization vehicles, for which investment banking revenues are recognized. the firm may retain interests in the securitized financial assets as one or more tranches of the securitization. these retained interests are generally carried at fair value in the balance sheets with changes in fair value recognized in the income statements. fair value for these interests is measured using techniques that are consistent with the valuation techniques applied to the firm's major categories of assets and liabilities as described in notes 2 and 5. further, as permitted by applicable guidance, certain transfers of assets where the firm's only continuing involvement is a derivative are only reported in the following assets sold with retained exposure table.

17. regulatory requirements regulatory capital framework the firm is an fhc under the bank holding company act of 1956, as amended, and is subject to the regulation and oversight of the board of governors of the federal reserve system ("federal reserve"). the federal reserve establishes
133               december 2020 form 10-k notes to consolidated financial statements capital requirements for the firm, including well-capitalized standards, and evaluates the firm's compliance with such capital requirements. the occ establishes similar capital requirements and standards for the firm's u.s. bank subsidiaries including, among others, msbna and mspbna. the regulatory capital requirements are largely based on the basel iii capital standards established by the basel committee on banking supervision and also implement certain provisions of the dodd-frank wall street reform and consumer protection act.
regulatory capital requirements the firm is required to maintain minimum risk-based and leverage-based capital ratios under regulatory capital requirements. a summary of the calculations of regulatory capital and rwa follows.
minimum risk-based capital ratio requirements apply to common equity tier 1 capital, tier 1 capital and total capital (which includes tier 2 capital). capital standards require certain adjustments to, and deductions from, capital for purposes of determining these ratios.
in 2020, the u.s. banking agencies adopted a final rule, consistent with an interim final rule that was effective march 31, 2020, altering, for purposes of the regulatory capital rules, the required adoption time period for cecl. as of december 31, 2020, the risk-based and leverage-based capital amounts and ratios, as well as rwa, adjusted average assets and supplementary leverage exposure are calculated excluding the effect of the adoption of cecl based on the firm's election to defer this effect over a five-year transition period in accordance with the interim final rule.

2.the capital buffer requirement represents the amount of common equity tier 1 capital the firm must maintain above the minimum risk-based capital requirements in order to avoid restrictions on the firm's ability to make capital distributions, including the payment of dividends and the repurchase of stock, and to pay discretionary bonuses to executive officers. beginning october 1, 2020, the firm's standardized approach capital buffer requirement is equal to the sum of the scb, g-sib capital surcharge and ccyb, and the advanced approach capital buffer requirement is equal to the 2.5% capital conservation buffer, g-sib capital surcharge and ccyb.
3.required ratios represent the regulatory minimum plus the capital buffer requirement.
risk-weighted assets rwa reflects both the firm's on- and off-balance sheet risk, as well as capital charges attributable to the risk of loss arising from the following:
•credit risk: the failure of a borrower, counterparty or issuer to meet its financial obligations to the firm;
•market risk: adverse changes in the level of one or more market prices, rates, indices, volatilities, correlations or other market factors, such as market liquidity; and
•operational risk: inadequate or failed processes or systems, from human factors or from external events (e.g., fraud, theft, legal and compliance risks, cyber attacks or damage to physical assets).
the firm's risk-based capital ratios are computed under both (i) the standardized approaches for calculating credit risk and market risk rwa ("standardized approach") and (ii) the applicable advanced approaches for calculating credit risk, market risk and operational risk rwa ("advanced approach"). the credit risk rwa calculations between the two approaches differ in that the standardized approach requires calculation of rwa using prescribed risk weights, whereas the advanced approach utilizes models to calculate exposure amounts and risk weights. at december 31, 2020 and december 31, 2019, the differences between the actual and required ratio were lower under the standardized approach.
minimum leverage-based capital requirements include a tier 1 leverage ratio and an slr. the firm is required to maintain a tier 1 slr of 5%, inclusive of an enhanced slr capital buffer of at least 2%.

1.required ratios are inclusive of any buffers applicable as of the date presented. failure to maintain the buffers would result in restrictions on the firm's ability to make capital distributions, including the payment of dividends and the repurchase of stock, and to pay discretionary bonuses to executive officers.
2.adjusted average assets represents the denominator of the tier 1 leverage ratio and is composed of the average daily balance of consolidated on-balance sheet assets for the quarters ending on the respective balance sheet dates, reduced by disallowed goodwill, intangible assets, investments in covered funds, defined benefit pension plan assets, after-tax gain on sale from assets sold into securitizations, investments in the firm's own capital instruments, certain defined tax assets and other capital deductions.
3.based on a federal reserve interim final rule in effect until march 31, 2021, the firm's slr and supplementary leverage exposure as of december 31, 2020 reflect the exclusion of u.s. treasury securities and deposits at federal reserve banks.
4.supplementary leverage exposure is the sum of adjusted average assets used in the tier 1 leverage ratio and other adjustments, primarily: (i) for derivatives, potential future exposure and the effective notional principal amount of sold credit protection offset by qualifying purchased credit protection; (ii) the counterparty credit risk for repo-style transactions; and (iii) the credit equivalent amount for off-balance sheet exposures.
certain u.s. bank subsidiaries' regulatory capital and capital ratios the occ establishes capital requirements for the firm's u.s. bank subsidiaries, which as of december 31, 2020 include, among others, msbna and mspbna, and evaluates their compliance with such capital requirements. regulatory capital requirements for msbna and mspbna are calculated in a similar manner to the firm's regulatory capital requirements, although g-sib capital surcharge and stress capital buffer requirements do not apply to the u.s. bank subsidiaries.
the occ's regulatory capital framework includes prompt corrective action ("pca") standards, including "well-capitalized" pca standards that are based on specified regulatory capital ratio minimums. for the firm to remain an fhc, its u.s. bank subsidiaries must remain well-capitalized in accordance with the occ's pca standards. in addition, failure by the u.s. bank subsidiaries to meet minimum capital requirements may result in certain mandatory and discretionary actions by regulators that, if undertaken, could have a direct material effect on the u.s. bank subsidiaries' and the firm's financial statements.
at december 31, 2020 and december 31, 2019, msbna and mspbna risk-based capital ratios are based on the standardized approach rules. at december 31, 2020, the risk-based and leverage-based capital amounts and ratios are calculated excluding the effect of the adoption of cecl based on msbna's and mspbna's elections to defer this effect over a five-year transition period.

on march 15, 2020, the financial services forum announced that each of its eight member banks, including the firm, had voluntarily suspended their share repurchase programs. on june 25, 2020, the federal reserve published summary results of ccar and announced that large bhcs, including the firm, generally would be restricted in making share repurchases during the third quarter, and on september 30, 2020, the restrictions were extended through the fourth quarter of 2020. on december 18, 2020 the federal reserve published summary results of the second round of supervisory stress tests for each large bhc, including the firm, and permitted the resumption of share repurchases in the first quarter of 2021.
a portion of common stock repurchases was conducted under a sales plan with mufg, whereby mufg sold shares of the firm's common stock to the firm, as part of the firm's share repurchase program. the sales plan, which was suspended on december 10, 2020, has no impact on the strategic alliance between mufg and the firm, including the joint ventures in japan, and is only intended to maintain mufg's ownership percentage below 24.9% in order to comply with mufg's passivity commitments to the board of governors of the federal reserve system.
pursuant to the share repurchase program, the firm considers, among other things, business segment capital needs, as well as stock-based compensation and benefit plan requirements. share repurchases under the program will be exercised from time to time at prices the firm deems appropriate subject to various factors, including the firm's capital position and market conditions. the share repurchases may be effected through open market purchases or privately negotiated transactions, including through rule 10b5-1 plans, and may be suspended at any time. share repurchases by the firm are subject to regulatory non-objection.

performance-based stock units psus will vest and convert to shares of common stock only if the firm satisfies predetermined performance and market-based conditions over a three-year performance period. the number of psus that will vest ranges from 0% to 150% of the target award, based on the extent to which the firm achieves the specified performance goals. one-half of the award will be earned based on the firm's average return on equity, excluding certain adjustments specified in the plan terms ("ms adjusted roe"). the other half of the award will be earned based on the firm's total shareholder return, relative to the total shareholder return of the s&p 500 financials sector index ("relative ms tsr"). psus have vesting, restriction and cancellation provisions that are generally similar to those of rsus. at december 31, 2020, approximately 3 million psus were outstanding.
notes to consolidated financial statements the relative ms tsr fair values on the award date were estimated using a monte carlo simulation and the following assumptions.

the risk-free interest rate was determined based on the yields available on u.s. treasury zero-coupon issues. the expected stock price volatility was determined using historical volatility. the correlation coefficient was developed based on historical price data of the firm and the s&p 500 financials sector index. the model uses an expected dividend yield equivalent to reinvesting dividends.
deferred cash-based compensation plans deferred cash-based compensation plans generally provide a return to the plan participants based upon the performance of each participant's referenced investments.

the u.s. qualified plan's assets represent 87% of the firm's total pension plan assets. the u.s. qualified plan uses a combination of active and risk-controlled fixed income investment strategies. the fixed income asset allocation consists primarily of fixed income securities and related derivative instruments designed to approximate the expected cash flows of the plan's liabilities in order to help reduce plan exposure to interest rate variation and to better align assets with the obligation. the longer-duration fixed income allocation is expected to help protect the plan's funded status and maintain the stability of plan contributions over the long run. the investment portfolio performance is assessed by comparing actual investment performance with changes in the estimated present value of the u.s. qualified plan's benefit obligation.
derivative instruments are permitted in the u.s. qualified plan's investment portfolio only to the extent that they comply with all of the plan's investment policy guidelines and are consistent with the plan's risk and return objectives.
as a fundamental operating principle, any restrictions on the underlying assets apply to the respective derivative product. this includes percentage allocations and credit quality. derivatives are used solely for the purpose of enhancing investment returns in the underlying assets and not to circumvent portfolio restrictions.
plan assets are measured at fair value using valuation techniques that are consistent with the valuation techniques applied to the firm's major categories of assets and liabilities as described in notes 2 and 5. otc derivative contracts consist of investments in interest rate swaps and total return swaps. other investments consist of pledged insurance annuity contracts held by non-u.s.-based plans. the pledged insurance annuity contracts are valued based on the premium reserve of the insurer for a guarantee that the insurer has given to the employee benefit plan that approximates fair value. the pledged insurance annuity contracts are categorized in level 3 of the fair value hierarchy.
commingled trust funds are privately offered funds regulated, supervised and subject to periodic examination by a u.s. federal or state agency and available to institutional clients. the trust must be maintained for the collective investment or reinvestment of assets contributed to it from u.s. tax-qualified employee benefit plans maintained by more than one employer or controlled group of corporations. the sponsor of the commingled trust funds values the funds based on the fair value of the underlying securities. commingled trust funds are redeemable at nav at the measurement date or in the near future.
some non-u.s.-based plans hold foreign funds that consist of investments in fixed income funds, target cash flow funds and liquidity funds. fixed income funds invest in individual securities quoted on a recognized stock exchange or traded in a regulated market. certain fixed income funds aim to produce returns consistent with certain financial times stock exchange indexes. target cash flow funds are designed to provide a series of fixed annual cash flows achieved by investing in government bonds and derivatives. liquidity funds place a high priority on capital preservation, stable value and a high liquidity of assets. foreign funds are readily redeemable at nav.
the firm generally considers the nav of commingled trust funds and foreign funds provided by the fund manager to be the best estimate of fair value.
expected contributions the firm's policy is to fund at least the amount sufficient to meet minimum funding requirements under applicable employee benefit and tax laws. at december 31, 2020, the firm expected to contribute approximately $50 million to its pension plans in 2021 based upon the plans' current funded status and expected asset return assumptions for 2021.

u.s. employees meeting certain eligibility requirements may participate in the firm's 401(k) plans.
morgan stanley 401(k) plan eligible employees receive discretionary 401(k) matching cash contributions as determined annually by the firm. for 2020, 2019 and 2018, the firm matched employee contributions up to 4% of eligible pay, up to the irs limit. matching contributions were invested among available funds according to each participant's investment direction on file. eligible employees with eligible pay less than or equal to $100,000 also received a fixed contribution under the 401(k) plan equal to 2% of eligible pay. transition contributions relating to acquired entities or frozen employee benefit plans are allocated to certain eligible employees. the firm match, fixed contribution and transition contribution are included in the firm's 401(k) expense.
the firm maintains separate defined contribution pension plans that cover eligible employees of certain non-u.s. subsidiaries. under such plans, benefits are generally determined based on a fixed rate of base salary with certain vesting requirements.

the increase in the firm's effective tax rate in 2020 compared with the prior year is primarily due to the higher level of earnings and lower net discrete tax benefits. in 2020, net discrete tax benefits were $122 million, primarily related to the conversion of employee share-based awards.
the firm's effective tax rates for 2019 and 2018 include net discrete tax benefits of $475 million and $368 million, respectively, primarily associated with remeasurement of reserves and related interest as a result of new information pertaining to the resolution of multi-jurisdiction tax examinations, as well as benefits related to conversion of employee share-based awards. the fourth quarters of 2019 and 2018 include net discrete tax benefits of $158 million and $111 million, respectively.

revenues and expenses directly associated with each respective business segment are included in determining its operating results. other revenues and expenses that are not directly attributable to a particular business segment are generally allocated based on each business segment's respective net revenues, non-interest expenses or other relevant measures.
as a result of revenues and expenses from transactions with other operating segments being treated as transactions with external parties for purposes of segment disclosures, the firm includes an intersegment eliminations category to reconcile the business segment results to the consolidated results.

our success largely depends on the performance of our management team and other key employees. if we are unable to recruit, attract and retain talented, highly qualified senior management and other key people, our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition could be adversely affected. successfully executing organizational change, including management transitions at leadership levels of the company and succession plans for senior management, is critical to our business success. while we follow a disciplined, ongoing succession planning process and have succession plans in place for senior management and other key executives, these do not guarantee that the services of qualified senior executives will continue to be available to us at particular moments in time. further, changes in immigration laws and policies, including during the covid-19 pandemic, have made in certain circumstances and may continue to make it more difficult for us to recruit or relocate highly skilled technical, professional and management personnel to meet our business needs. in addition, we are working to advance culture change through the implementation of diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives throughout our organization. if we do not (or are perceived not to) successfully implement these initiatives, our ability to recruit, attract and retain talent may be adversely impacted.
in addition, as a result of our global shared service organizational model, certain of our functions, such as marketing, payroll, finance and accounting, customer service and logistics, and human resources, are concentrated in key office facilities. a significant disruption to any of our key office facilities for any reason, including those mentioned above, could adversely affect our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.

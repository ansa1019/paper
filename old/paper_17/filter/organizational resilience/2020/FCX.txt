as part of our commitment to implementing the tailings standard, we will be required to consider uncertainties due to climate change, incorporate that assessment into the relevant knowledge base for our tailings facilities, use this knowledge base to enhance the resilience of our approach to the impacts of climate change using an adaptive management approach, incorporate that knowledge into facility operations, and take measures to mitigate both environmental impact and potential failure risks at our tailings facilities, including those arising from climate change. to the extent these obligations require future changes at our tailings facilities, it could increase our operational expenses or require further capital investments.

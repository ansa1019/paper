following the worldpay acquisition, we are focused on completing post-merger integration to achieve potential incremental revenue opportunities and expense efficiencies created by the combination of the two companies. we have a history of successfully integrating the operations and technology platforms of acquired companies, including winding down legacy environments and consolidating platforms from other acquisitions into our environment. based on prior integration experience, we developed integration plans to achieve the potential benefits created by the worldpay acquisition. as of the end of 2020, our achievement of revenue synergies remains on track to meet or exceed our current targets driven by successful cross-sell of our heritage premium payback solution into heritage worldpay clients and by leveraging our heritage worldpay sales and distribution teams, expanding on our existing relationships with financial institutions to establish merchant referral agreements and optimizing our network routing capabilities. we have also exceeded our original target for expense synergies, as we have successfully integrated organizational structures, reduced corporate overhead and achieved cost savings within our operating environment, and expect to continue to achieve additional expense synergies during 2021.

item 1a.       risk factors each of the registrants operates in a complex market and regulatory environment that involves significant risks, many of which are beyond that registrant's direct control. such risks, which could negatively affect one or more of the registrants' consolidated financial statements, fall primarily under the categories below:
market and financial factors primarily include:
•the price of fuels, in particular the price of natural gas, which affects power prices,
•the generation resources in the markets in which the registrants operate,
•the demand for electricity, reliability of service, and affordability in the markets where the registrants conduct their business,
•the ability of the registrants to operate their respective generating and transmission and distribution assets, their ability to access capital markets, and the impacts on their results of operations due to the global outbreak (pandemic) of the 2019 novel coronavirus (covid-19),
•the impacts of on-going competition, and
•emerging technologies and business models, including those related to climate change mitigation and transition to a low carbon economy.
regulatory, legislative, and legal factors primarily include changes to, and compliance with, the laws and regulations that govern:
•the design of power markets,
•utility regulatory business models,
•environmental and climate policy, and
operational factors primarily include:
•changes in the global climate could produce extreme weather events, which could put the registrant's facilities at risk, and such changes could also affect the levels and patterns of demand for energy and related services,
•the safe, secure, and effective operation of generation's nuclear facilities and the ability to effectively manage the associated decommissioning obligations,
•the ability of the registrants to maintain the reliability, resiliency, and safety of their energy delivery systems, which could affect the operating costs of the registrants and the opinions of their customers and regulators, and
•physical and cyber security risks for the registrants as the owner-operators of generation, transmission, and distribution facilities and as participants in commodities trading.
risks related to the planned separation primarily include:
•the timing and conditions associated with required regulatory approvals, which may affect the costs to achieve the separation and its timing,
•challenges to achieving the benefits of separation, including maintaining investment grade credit ratings, and
•the risk that the separation could be treated as a taxable transaction to both exelon and its shareholders.
there may be further risks and uncertainties that are not presently known or that are not currently believed by the registrants to be material that could negatively affect its consolidated financial statements in the future.
market and financial factors generation is exposed to price volatility associated with both the wholesale and retail power markets and the procurement of nuclear and fossil fuel (exelon and generation).
generation is exposed to commodity price risk for the unhedged portion of its electricity generation supply portfolio. generation's earnings and cash flows are therefore exposed to variability of spot and forward market prices in the markets in which it operates.
price of fuels. the spot market price of electricity for each hour is generally determined by the marginal cost of supplying the next unit of electricity to the market during that hour. thus, the market price of power is affected by the market price of the marginal fuel used to generate the electricity unit.
demand and supply. the market price for electricity is also affected by changes in the demand for electricity and the available supply of electricity. unfavorable economic conditions, milder than normal weather, and the growth of energy efficiency and demand response programs could each depress demand. in addition, in some markets, the supply of electricity could often exceed demand during some hours of the day, resulting in loss of revenue for base-load generating plants such as generation's nuclear plants. conversely, new demand sources such as electrification of transportation could increase demand and change demand patterns.
retail competition. generation's retail operations compete for customers in a competitive environment, which affects the margins that generation can earn and the volumes that it is able to serve. in periods of sustained low natural gas and power prices and low market volatility, retail competitors can aggressively pursue market share because the barriers to entry can be low and wholesale generators (including generation) use their retail operations to hedge generation output.
the impact of sustained low market prices or depressed demand and over-supply could be emphasized given generation's concentration of base-load electric generating capacity within primarily two geographic market regions, namely the midwest and the mid-atlantic. these impacts could adversely affect generation's ability to fund regulated utility growth for the benefit of customers, reduce debt and provide attractive shareholder returns. in addition, such conditions may no longer support the continued operation of certain generating facilities, which could adversely affect generation's financial statements primarily through accelerated depreciation and amortization expenses and one-time charges. see note 7 - early plant retirements of the combined notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information.
cost of fuel. generation depends on nuclear fuel and fossil fuels to operate most of its generating facilities. the supply markets for nuclear fuel, natural gas, and oil are subject to price fluctuations, availability restrictions, and counterparty default.
market designs. the wholesale markets vary from region to region with distinct rules, practices, and procedures. changes in these market rules, problems with rule implementation, or failure of any of these markets could adversely affect generation's business. in addition, a significant decrease in market participation could affect market liquidity and have a detrimental effect on market stability.
some of these technologies include, but are not limited to, further development or applications of technologies related to shale gas production, renewable energy technologies, energy efficiency, distributed generation, and energy storage devices. such developments could affect the price of energy, levels of customer-owned generation, customer expectations, and current business models and make portions of our electric system power supply and transmission and/or distribution facilities obsolete prior to the end of their useful lives. such technologies could also result in further declines in commodity prices or demand for delivered energy. each of these factors could affect the registrants' consolidated financial statements through, among other things, reduced operating revenues, increased operating and maintenance expenses, increased capital expenditures, and potential asset impairment charges or accelerated depreciation and decommissioning expenses over shortened remaining asset useful lives.
market performance and other factors could decrease the value of ndt funds and employee benefit plan assets and could increase the related employee benefit plan obligations, which then could require significant additional funding (all registrants).
disruptions in the capital markets and their actual or perceived effects on particular businesses and the greater economy could adversely affect the value of the investments held within generation's ndts and exelon's employee benefit plan trusts. the registrants have significant obligations in these areas and exelon and generation hold substantial assets in these trusts to meet those obligations. the asset values are subject to market fluctuations and will yield uncertain returns, which could fall below the registrants' projected return rates. a decline in the market value of the ndt fund investments could increase generation's funding requirements to decommission its nuclear plants. a decline in the market value of the pension and opeb plan assets would increase the funding requirements associated with exelon's pension and opeb plan obligations. additionally, exelon's pension and opeb plan liabilities are sensitive to changes in interest rates. as interest rates decrease, the liabilities increase, potentially increasing benefit costs and funding requirements. changes in demographics, including increased numbers of retirements or changes in life expectancy assumptions or changes to social security or medicare eligibility requirements could also increase the costs and funding requirements of the obligations related to the pension and opeb plans. see note 10 - asset retirement obligations and note 15 - retirement benefits of the combined notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information.
the registrants could be negatively affected by unstable capital and credit markets and increased volatility in commodity markets (all registrants).
the registrants rely on the capital markets, particularly for publicly offered debt, as well as the banking and commercial paper markets, to meet their financial commitments and short-term liquidity needs. disruptions in the capital and credit markets in the united states or abroad could negatively affect the registrants' ability to access the capital markets or draw on their respective bank revolving credit facilities. the banks may not be able to meet their funding commitments to the registrants if they experience shortages of capital and liquidity or if they experience excessive volumes of borrowing requests within a short period of time. the inability to access capital markets or credit facilities, and longer-term disruptions in the capital and credit markets as a result of uncertainty, changing or increased regulation, reduced alternatives, or failures of significant financial institutions could result in the deferral of discretionary capital expenditures, generation's ability to hedge effectively its generation portfolio, changes to generation's hedging strategy in order to reduce collateral posting requirements, or a reduction in dividend payments or other discretionary uses of cash. in addition, the registrants have exposure to worldwide financial markets, including europe, canada, and asia. disruptions in these markets could reduce or restrict the registrants' ability to secure sufficient liquidity or secure liquidity at reasonable terms. as of december 31, 2020, approximately 23%, 19%, and 18% of the registrants' available credit facilities were with european, canadian, and asian banks, respectively. see note 17 - debt and credit agreements of the combined notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information on the credit facilities.
the strength and depth of competition in energy markets depend heavily on active participation by multiple trading parties, which could be negatively affected by disruptions in the capital and credit markets and legislative and regulatory initiatives that could affect participants in commodities transactions. reduced capital and liquidity and failures of significant institutions that participate in the energy markets could diminish the liquidity and competitiveness of energy markets that are important to the respective businesses of the registrants. perceived weaknesses in the competitive strength of the energy markets could lead to pressures for greater regulation of those markets or attempts to replace market structures with other mechanisms for the sale of power, including the requirement of long-term contracts.
if any of the registrants were to experience a downgrade in its credit ratings to below investment grade or otherwise fail to satisfy the credit standards in its agreements with its counterparties, it would be required to provide significant amounts of collateral under its agreements with counterparties and could experience higher borrowing costs (all registrants).
generation's business is subject to credit quality standards that could require market participants to post collateral for their obligations. if generation were to be downgraded or lose its investment grade credit rating (based on its senior unsecured debt rating) or otherwise fail to satisfy the credit standards of trading counterparties, it would be required under its hedging arrangements to provide collateral in the form of letters of credit or cash, which could have a material adverse effect upon its liquidity. the amount of collateral required to be provided by generation at any point in time depends on a variety of factors, including (1) the notional amount of the applicable hedge, (2) the nature of counterparty and related agreements, and (3) changes in power or other commodity prices. in addition, if generation were downgraded, it could experience higher borrowing costs as a result of the downgrade. changes in ratings methodologies by the credit rating agencies could also have a negative impact on the ratings of generation.
generation has project-specific financing arrangements and must meet the requirements of various agreements relating to those financings. failure to meet those arrangements could give rise to a project-specific financing default which, if not cured or waived, could result in the specific project being required to repay the associated debt or other borrowings earlier than otherwise anticipated, and if such repayment were not made, the lenders or security holders would generally have broad remedies, including rights to foreclose against the project assets and related collateral or to force the exelon subsidiaries in the project-specific financings to enter into bankruptcy proceedings. the impact of bankruptcy could result in the impairment of certain project assets.
the utility registrants' operating agreements with pjm and peco's, bge's, and dpl's natural gas procurement contracts contain collateral provisions that are affected by their credit rating and market prices. if certain wholesale market conditions were to exist and the utility registrants were to lose their investment grade credit ratings (based on their senior unsecured debt ratings), they would be required to provide collateral in the forms of letters of credit or cash, which could have a material adverse effect upon their remaining sources of liquidity. pjm collateral posting requirements will generally increase as market prices rise and decrease as market prices fall. collateral posting requirements for peco, bge, and dpl, with respect to their natural gas supply contracts, will generally increase as forward market prices fall and decrease as forward market prices rise. if the utility registrants were downgraded, they could experience higher borrowing costs as a result of the downgrade. in addition, changes in ratings methodologies by the agencies could also have an adverse negative impact on the ratings of the utility registrants.
the utility registrants conduct their respective businesses and operate under governance models and other arrangements and procedures intended to assure that the utility registrants are treated as separate, independent companies, distinct from exelon and other exelon subsidiaries in order to isolate the utility registrants from exelon and other exelon subsidiaries in the event of financial difficulty at exelon or another exelon subsidiary. these measures (commonly referred to as "ring-fencing") could help avoid or limit a downgrade in the credit ratings of the utility registrants in the event of a reduction in the credit rating of exelon. despite these ring-fencing measures, the credit ratings of the utility registrants could remain linked, to some degree, to the credit ratings of exelon. consequently, a reduction in the credit rating of exelon could result in a reduction of the credit rating of some or all of the utility registrants. a reduction in the credit rating of a utility registrant could have a material adverse effect on the utility registrant.
see item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations - liquidity and capital resources - credit matters - market conditions and security ratings for additional information regarding the potential impacts of credit downgrades on the registrants' cash flows.
generation's risk management policies cannot fully eliminate the risk associated with its commodity trading activities (exelon and generation).
generation's asset-based power position as well as its power marketing, fuel procurement, and other commodity trading activities expose generation to risks of commodity price movements. generation buys and sells energy and other products and enters into financial contracts to manage risk and hedge various positions in generation's power generation portfolio. generation is exposed to volatility in financial results for unhedged positions as well as the risk of ineffective hedges. generation attempts to manage this exposure through enforcement of established risk limits and risk management procedures. these risk limits and risk management procedures may not work as planned and cannot eliminate all risks associated with these activities. even when its policies and procedures are followed, and decisions are made based on projections and estimates of future performance, results of operations could be diminished if the judgments and assumptions underlying those decisions prove to be incorrect. factors, such as future prices and demand for power and other energy-related commodities, become more difficult to predict and the calculations become less reliable the further into the future estimates are made. as a result, generation cannot predict the impact that its commodity trading activities and risk management decisions could have on its consolidated financial statements.
financial performance and load requirements could be negatively affected if generation is unable to effectively manage its power portfolio (exelon and generation).
a significant portion of generation's power portfolio is used to provide power under procurement contracts with the utility registrants and other customers. to the extent portions of the power portfolio are not needed for that purpose, generation's output is sold in the wholesale power markets. to the extent its power portfolio is not sufficient to meet the requirements of its customers under the related agreements, generation must purchase power in the wholesale power markets. generation's financial results could be negatively affected if it is unable to cost-effectively meet the load requirements of its customers, manage its power portfolio or effectively address the changes in the wholesale power markets.
the impacts of significant economic downturns or increases in customer rates, could lead to decreased volumes delivered and increased expense for uncollectible customer balances (all registrants).
the impacts of significant economic downturns on the utility registrants' customers, such as less demand for products and services provided by commercial and industrial customers, and the related regulatory limitations on residential service terminations, could result in an increase in the number of uncollectible customer balances. further, increases in customer rates, including those related to increases in purchased power and natural gas prices, could result in declines in customer usage and lower revenues for the utility registrants that do not have decoupling mechanisms.
generation's customer-facing energy delivery activities face similar economic downturn risks, such as lower volumes sold and increased expense for uncollectible customer balances.
see item 7a. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk for additional information of the registrants' credit risk.
the registrants' results could be negatively affected by the impacts of covid-19 (all registrants).
covid-19 is an evolving situation that could lead to extended disruption of economic activity in the registrants' respective markets. covid-19 could negatively affect the registrants' ability to operate their respective generating and transmission and distribution assets, their ability to access capital markets, and their results of operations. the registrants cannot predict the extent of the impacts of covid-19, which will depend on future developments and which are highly uncertain. see item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations - executive overview for additional information.
the registrants could be negatively affected by the impacts of weather (all registrants).
weather conditions directly influence the demand for electricity and natural gas and affect the price of energy commodities. temperatures above normal levels in the summer tend to increase summer cooling electricity demand and revenues, and temperatures below normal levels in the winter tend to increase winter heating electricity and gas demand and revenues. moderate temperatures adversely affect the usage of energy and resulting revenues at peco, dpl delaware, and ace. due to revenue decoupling, bge, pepco, and dpl maryland recognize revenues at mdpsc and dcpsc-approved levels per customer, regardless of what actual distribution volumes are for a billing period and are not affected by actual weather with the exception of major storms. comed's customer rates are adjusted to eliminate the favorable and unfavorable impacts of weather and customer usage patterns on distribution revenue.
extreme weather conditions or damage resulting from storms could stress the utility registrants' transmission and distribution systems, communication systems, and technology, resulting in increased maintenance and capital costs and limiting each company's ability to meet peak customer demand. first and third quarter financial results, in particular, are substantially dependent on weather conditions, and could make period comparisons less relevant.
generation's operations are also affected by weather, which affects demand for electricity as well as operating conditions. to the extent that weather is warmer in the summer or colder in the winter than assumed, generation could require greater resources to meet its contractual commitments. extreme weather conditions or storms could affect the availability of generation and its transmission, limiting generation's ability to source or send power to where it is sold. in addition, drought-like conditions limiting water usage could impact generation's ability to run certain generating assets at full capacity. these conditions, which cannot be accurately predicted, could cause generation to seek additional capacity at a time when wholesale markets are tight or to seek to sell excess capacity at a time when markets are weak.
climate change projections suggest increases to summer temperature and humidity trends, as well as more erratic precipitation and storm patterns over the long-term in the areas where registrants have generation, transmission, and distribution assets. the frequency in which weather conditions emerge outside the current expected climate norms could contribute to weather-related impacts discussed above.
long-lived assets represent the single largest asset class on the registrants' statements of financial position. in addition, exelon, comed, and phi have material goodwill balances.
the registrants evaluate the recoverability of the carrying value of long-lived assets to be held and used whenever events or circumstances indicating a potential impairment exist. factors such as, but not limited to, the business climate, including current and future energy and market conditions, environmental regulation, and the condition of assets are considered.
comed and phi perform an assessment for possible impairment of their goodwill at least annually or more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of the reporting units below their carrying amount. regulatory actions or changes in significant assumptions, including discount and growth rates, utility sector market performance and transactions, projected operating and capital cash flows for comed's, pepco's, dpl's, and ace's business, and the fair value of debt, could potentially result in future impairments of exelon's, comed's, and phi's goodwill.
an impairment would require the registrants to reduce the carrying value of the long-lived asset or goodwill to fair value through a non-cash charge to expense by the amount of the impairment. see item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations - critical accounting policies and estimates, note 8 - property, plant, and equipment, note 12 - asset impairments and note 13 - intangible assets of the combined notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on long-lived asset impairments and goodwill impairments.
the registrants could incur substantial costs in the event of non-performance by third-parties under indemnification agreements, or when the registrants have guaranteed their performance. generation is exposed to other credit risks in the power markets that are beyond its control (all registrants).
the registrants have entered into various agreements with counterparties that require those counterparties to reimburse a registrant and hold it harmless against specified obligations and claims. to the extent that any of these counterparties are affected by deterioration in their creditworthiness or the agreements are otherwise determined to be unenforceable, the affected registrant could be held responsible for the obligations. each of the utility registrants has transferred its former generation business to a third party and in each case the transferee has agreed to assume certain obligations and to indemnify the applicable utility registrant for such obligations. in connection with the restructurings under which comed, peco, and bge transferred their generating assets to generation, generation assumed certain of comed's, peco's, and bge's rights and obligations with respect to their former generation businesses. further, comed, peco, and bge have entered into agreements with third parties under which the third-party agreed to indemnify comed, peco, or bge for certain obligations related to their respective former generation businesses that have been assumed by generation as part of the restructuring. if the third-party, generation, or the transferee of pepco's, dpl's, or ace's generation facilities experienced events that reduced its creditworthiness or the indemnity arrangement became unenforceable, the applicable utility registrant could be liable for any existing or future claims. in addition, the utility registrants have residual liability under certain laws in connection with their former generation facilities.
the registrants have issued indemnities to third parties regarding environmental or other matters in connection with purchases and sales of assets and they could incur substantial costs to fulfill their obligations under these indemnities.
the registrants have issued guarantees of the performance of third parties, which obligate the registrants to perform in the event that the third parties do not perform. in the event of non-performance by those third parties, the registrants could incur substantial cost to fulfill their obligations under these guarantees.
in the bilateral markets, generation is exposed to the risk that counterparties that owe generation money or are obligated to purchase energy or fuel from generation, will not perform under their obligations for operational or financial reasons. in the event the counterparties to these arrangements fail to perform, generation could be forced to purchase or sell energy or fuel in the wholesale markets at less favorable prices and incur additional losses, to the extent amounts, if any, were already paid to the counterparties. in the spot markets, generation is exposed to risk as a result of default sharing mechanisms that exist within certain markets, primarily rtos and isos. generation is also a party to agreements with entities in the energy sector that have experienced rating downgrades or other financial difficulties. in addition, generation's retail sales subject it to credit risk through competitive electricity and natural gas supply activities to serve commercial and industrial companies, governmental entities and residential customers. retail credit risk results when customers default on their contractual obligations. this risk represents the loss that could be incurred due to the nonpayment of a customer's account balance, as well as the loss from the resale of energy previously committed to serve the customer.
regulatory, legislative, and legal factors federal or state legislative or regulatory actions could negatively affect the scope and functioning of the wholesale markets (exelon and generation).
approximately 70% of generation's generating resources, which include directly owned assets and capacity obtained through long-term contracts, are located in the area encompassed by pjm. generation's future results of operations are impacted by (1) ferc's and pjm's support for policies that favor the preservation of competitive wholesale power markets and recognize the value of zero-carbon electricity and resiliency and for states' energy objectives and policies (2) the absence of material changes to market structures that would limit or otherwise negatively affect exelon or generation. generation could also be affected by state laws, regulations, or initiatives to subsidize existing or new generation.
ferc's requirements for market-based rate authority could pose a risk that generation may no longer satisfy ferc's tests for market-based rates.
substantially all aspects of the businesses of the registrants are subject to comprehensive federal or state regulation and legislation.
generation's consolidated financial statements are significantly affected by its sales and purchases of commodities at market-based rates, as opposed to cost-based or other similarly regulated rates and federal and state regulatory and legislative developments related to emissions, climate change, capacity market mitigation, energy price information, resilience, fuel diversity, and rps. legislative and regulatory efforts in illinois, new york, and new jersey to preserve the environmental attributes and reliability benefits of zero-emission nuclear-powered generating facilities through zec programs are or could be subject to legal and regulatory challenges and, if overturned, could result in the early retirement of certain of generation's nuclear plants. see note 3 - regulatory matters and note 7 - early plant retirements of the combined notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information.
the utility registrants' consolidated financial statements are heavily dependent on the ability of the utility registrants to recover their costs for the retail purchase and distribution of power and natural gas to their customers.
fundamental changes in regulations or other adverse legislative actions affecting the registrants' businesses would require changes in their business planning models and operations. the registrants cannot predict when or whether legislative and regulatory proposals could become law or what their effect will be on the registrants.
changes in the utility registrants' respective terms and conditions of service, including their respective rates, are subject to regulatory approval proceedings and/or negotiated settlements that are at times contentious, lengthy, and subject to appeal, which lead to uncertainty as to the ultimate result and which could introduce time delays in effectuating rate changes (exelon and the utility registrants).
the utility registrants are required to engage in regulatory approval proceedings as a part of the process of establishing the terms and rates for their respective services. these proceedings typically involve multiple parties, including governmental bodies and officials, consumer advocacy groups, and various consumers of energy, who have differing concerns but who have the common objective of limiting rate increases or even reducing rates. decisions are subject to appeal, potentially leading to additional uncertainty associated with the approval proceedings. the potential duration of such proceedings creates a risk that rates ultimately approved by the applicable regulatory body may not be sufficient for a utility registrant to recover its costs by the time the rates become effective. established rates are also subject to subsequent prudency reviews by state regulators, whereby various portions of rates could be adjusted, subject to refund or disallowed, including recovery mechanisms for costs associated with the procurement of electricity or gas, credit losses, mgp remediation, smart grid infrastructure, and energy efficiency and demand response programs. in certain instances, the utility registrants could agree to negotiated settlements related to various rate matters, customer initiatives, or franchise agreements. these settlements are subject to regulatory approval. the ultimate outcome and timing of regulatory rate proceedings have a significant effect on the ability of the utility registrants to recover their costs or earn an adequate return. see note 3 - regulatory matters of the combined notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.
nrc actions could negatively affect the operations and profitability of generation's nuclear generating fleet (exelon and generation).
regulatory risk. a change in the atomic energy act or the applicable regulations or licenses could require a substantial increase in capital expenditures or could result in increased operating or decommissioning costs. events at nuclear plants owned by others, as well as those owned by generation, could cause the nrc to initiate such actions.
spent nuclear fuel storage. the approval of a national repository for the storage of snf and the timing of such a facility opening, will significantly affect the costs associated with storage of snf and the ultimate amounts received from the doe to reimburse generation for these costs.
any regulatory action relating to the timing and availability of a repository for snf could adversely affect generation's ability to fully decommission its nuclear units. generation cannot predict what, if any, fee may be established in the future for snf disposal. see note 19 - commitments and contingencies of the combined notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information on the snf obligation.
the registrants could be subject to higher costs and/or penalties related to mandatory reliability standards, including the likely exposure of the utility registrants to the results of pjm's rtep and nerc compliance requirements (all registrants).
the registrants as users, owners, and operators of the bulk power transmission system, including generation and the utility registrants, are subject to mandatory reliability standards promulgated by nerc and enforced by ferc. peco, bge, and dpl, as operators of natural gas distribution systems, are also subject to mandatory reliability standards of the u.s. department of transportation. the standards are based on the functions that need to be performed to ensure the bulk power system operates reliably and are guided by reliability and market interface principles. compliance with or changes in the reliability standards could subject the registrants to higher operating costs and/or increased capital expenditures. in addition, the icc, papuc, mdpsc, dcpsc, dpsc, and njbpu impose certain distribution reliability standards on the utility registrants. if the registrants were found not to be in compliance with the federal and state mandatory reliability standards, they could be subject to remediation costs as well as sanctions, which could include substantial monetary penalties.
the registrants could incur substantial costs to fulfill their obligations related to environmental and other matters (all registrants).
the businesses that the registrants operate are subject to extensive environmental regulation and legislation by local, state, and federal authorities. these laws and regulations affect the manner in which the registrants conduct their operations and make capital expenditures including how they handle air and water emissions, hazardous and solid waste, and activities affecting surface waters, groundwater, and aquatic and other species. violations of these requirements could subject the registrants to enforcement actions, capital expenditures to bring existing facilities into compliance, additional operating costs for remediation and clean-up costs, civil penalties and exposure to third parties' claims for alleged health or property damages, or operating restrictions to achieve compliance. in addition, the registrants are subject to liability under these laws for the remediation costs for environmental contamination of property now or formerly owned by the registrants and of property contaminated by hazardous substances they generated or released. remediation activities associated with mgp operations conducted by predecessor companies are one component of such costs. also, the registrants are currently involved in a number of proceedings relating to sites where hazardous substances have been deposited and could be subject to additional proceedings in the future. see item 1. business - environmental regulation for additional information.
the registrants could be negatively affected by challenges to tax positions taken, tax law changes, and the inherent difficulty in quantifying potential tax effects of business decisions. (all registrants).
the registrants are required to make judgments in order to estimate their obligations to taxing authorities. these tax obligations include income, real estate, sales and use, and employment-related taxes and ongoing appeal issues related to these tax matters. these judgments include reserves established for potential adverse outcomes regarding tax positions that have been taken that could be subject to challenge by the tax authorities. see note 1 - significant accounting policies and note 14 - income taxes of the combined notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information.
the registrants could be negatively affected by federal and state rps and/or energy conservation legislation, along with energy conservation by customers (all registrants).
changes to current state legislation or the development of federal legislation that requires the use of clean, renewable, and alternate fuel sources could significantly impact generation and the utility registrants, especially if timely cost recovery is not allowed for utility registrants. the impact could include increased costs and increased rates for customers.
federal and state legislation mandating the implementation of energy conservation programs that require the implementation of new technologies, such as smart meters and smart grid, could increase capital expenditures and could significantly impact the utility registrants consolidated financial statements if timely cost recovery is not allowed. furthermore, regulated energy consumption reduction targets and declines in customer energy consumption resulting from the implementation of new energy conservation technologies could lead to a decline in the revenues of the registrants. see item 1. business - environmental regulation - renewable and clean energy standards for additional information.
generation's affiliation with the utility registrants, together with the presence of a substantial percentage of generation's physical asset base within the utility registrants' service territories, could increase generation's cost of doing business to the extent future complaints or challenges regarding the utility registrants' retail rates result in settlements or legislative or regulatory requirements funded in part by generation (exelon and generation).
generation has significant generating resources within the service areas of the utility registrants and makes significant sales to each of them. those facts tend to cause generation to be directly affected by developments in those markets. government officials, legislators, and advocacy groups are aware of generation's affiliation with the utility registrants and its sales to each of them. in periods of rising utility rates, particularly when driven by increased costs of energy production and supply, those officials and advocacy groups could question or challenge costs and transactions incurred by the utility registrants with generation, irrespective of any previous regulatory processes or approvals underlying those transactions. these challenges could increase the time, complexity, and cost of the associated regulatory proceedings, and the occurrence of such challenges could subject generation to a level of scrutiny not faced by other unaffiliated competitors in those markets. in addition, government officials and legislators could seek ways to force generation to contribute to efforts to mitigate potential or actual rate increases, through measures such as generation-based taxes.
the registrants could be subject to adverse publicity and reputational risks, which make them vulnerable to negative customer perception and could lead to increased regulatory oversight or other consequences (all registrants).
the registrants could be the subject of public criticism. adverse publicity of this nature could render public service commissions and other regulatory and legislative authorities less likely to view energy companies such as exelon and its subsidiaries in a favorable light, and could cause exelon and its subsidiaries to be susceptible to less favorable legislative and regulatory outcomes, as well as increased regulatory oversight and more stringent legislative or regulatory requirements (e.g. disallowances of costs, lower roes).
the registrants are involved in legal proceedings, claims, and litigation arising out of their business operations. the material ones are summarized in note 19 - commitments and contingencies of the combined notes to consolidated financial statements. adverse outcomes in these proceedings could require significant expenditures, result in lost revenue, or restrict existing business activities.
exelon and comed have received requests for information related to an sec investigation into their lobbying activities. the outcome of the investigations could have a material adverse effect on their reputation and consolidated financial statements (exelon and comed).
on october 22, 2019, the sec notified exelon and comed that it had opened an investigation into their lobbying activities in the state of illinois. exelon and comed have cooperated fully, including by providing all information requested by the sec, and intend to continue to cooperate fully and expeditiously with the sec. the outcome of the sec's investigation cannot be predicted and could subject exelon and comed to civil penalties, sanctions, or other remedial measures. any of the foregoing, as well as the appearance of non-compliance with anti-corruption and anti-bribery laws, could have an adverse impact on exelon's and comed's reputations or relationships with regulatory and legislative authorities, customers, and other stakeholders, as well as their consolidated financial statements. see note 19 - commitments and contingencies of the combined notes to consolidated financial statements.
if comed violates its deferred prosecution agreement announced on july 17, 2020, it could have an adverse effect on the reputation and consolidated financial statements of exelon and comed (exelon and comed).
on july 17, 2020, comed entered into a deferred prosecution agreement (dpa) with the u.s. attorney's office for the northern district of illinois (usao) to resolve the usao's investigation into exelon's and comed's lobbying activities in the state of illinois. exelon was not made a party to the dpa and the investigation by the usao into exelon's activities ended with no charges being brought against exelon. under the dpa, the usao filed a single charge alleging that comed improperly gave and offered to give jobs, vendor subcontracts, and payments associated with those jobs and subcontracts for the benefit of the speaker of the illinois house of representatives and the speaker's associates, with the intent to influence the speaker's action regarding legislation affecting comed's interests. the dpa provides that the usao will defer any prosecution of such charge and any other criminal or civil case against comed in connection with the matters identified therein for a three-year period subject to certain obligations of comed, including, but not limited to, the following: (i) payment to the united states treasury of $200 million; (ii) continued full cooperation with the government's investigation; and (iii) comed's adoption and maintenance of remedial measures involving compliance and reporting undertakings as specified in the dpa. if comed is found to have breached the terms of the dpa, the usao may elect to prosecute, or bring a civil action against, comed for conduct alleged in the dpa or known to the government, which could result in fines or penalties and could have an adverse impact on exelon's and comed's reputation or relationships with regulatory and legislative authorities, customers and other stakeholders, as well as their consolidated financial statements. see note 19 - commitments and contingencies of the combined notes to consolidated financial statements.
generation's financial performance could be negatively affected by risks arising from its ownership and operation of hydroelectric facilities (exelon and generation).
ferc has the exclusive authority to license most non-federal hydropower projects located on navigable waterways, federal lands or connected to the interstate electric grid. generation cannot predict whether it will receive all the regulatory approvals for the renewed licenses of its hydroelectric facilities. if ferc does not issue new operating licenses for generation's hydroelectric facilities or a station cannot be operated through the end of its operating license, generation's results of operations could be adversely affected by increased depreciation rates and accelerated future decommissioning costs, since depreciation rates and decommissioning cost estimates currently include assumptions that license renewal will be received. generation could also lose revenue and incur increased fuel and purchased power expense to meet supply commitments. in addition, conditions could be imposed as part of the license renewal process that could adversely affect operations, could require a substantial increase in capital expenditures, could result in increased operating costs or could render the project uneconomic. similar effects could result from a change in the federal power act or the applicable regulations due to events at hydroelectric facilities owned by others, as well as those owned by generation.
operational factors the registrants are subject to risks associated with climate change (all registrants).
the registrants periodically perform analyses to better understand how climate change could affect their facilities and operations. the registrants primarily operate in the midwest and east coast of the united states, areas that historically have been prone to various types of severe weather events, such that the registrants have well-developed response and recovery programs based on these historical events. however, the registrants' physical facilities could be placed at greater risk of damage should changes in the global climate impact temperature and weather patterns, resulting in more intense, frequent and extreme weather events, unprecedented levels of precipitation, sea level rise, increased surface water temperatures, and/or other effects. in addition, changes to the climate may impact levels and patterns of demand for energy and related services, which could affect registrants' operations. over time, the registrants may need to make additional investments to protect facilities from physical climate-related risks and/or adapt to changes in operational requirements as a result of climate change.
the registrants also periodically perform analyses of potential pathways to reduce power sector and economy-wide ghg emissions to mitigate climate change. to the extent additional ghg reduction regulation or legislation becomes effective at the federal and/or state levels, the registrants could incur costs to further limit the ghg emissions from their operations or otherwise comply with applicable requirements. to the extent such additional regulation or legislation does not become effective, the potential competitive advantage offered by registrant's low-carbon emission profile may be reduced. see item 1. business - climate change mitigation.
generation's financial performance could be negatively affected by matters arising from its ownership and operation of nuclear facilities (exelon and generation).
nuclear capacity factors. capacity factors for nuclear generating units, significantly affect generation's results of operations. lower capacity factors could decrease generation's revenues and increase operating costs by requiring generation to produce additional energy from primarily its fossil facilities or purchase additional energy in the spot or forward markets in order to satisfy generation's obligations to committed third-party sales, including the utility registrants. these sources generally have higher costs than generation incurs to produce energy from its nuclear stations.
nuclear refueling outages. in general, refueling outages are planned to occur once every 18 to 24 months. the total number of refueling outages, along with their duration, could have a significant impact on generation's results of operations. when refueling outages last longer than anticipated or generation experiences unplanned outages, capacity factors decrease, and generation faces lower margins due to higher energy replacement costs and/or lower energy sales and higher operating and maintenance costs.
nuclear fuel quality. the quality of nuclear fuel utilized by generation could affect the efficiency and costs of generation's operations. remediation actions could result in increased costs due to accelerated fuel amortization, increased outage costs, and/or increased costs due to decreased generation capabilities.
operational risk. operations at any of generation's nuclear generation plants could degrade to the point where generation must shut down the plant or operate at less than full capacity. if this were to happen, identifying and correcting the causes could require significant time and expense. generation could choose to close a plant rather than incur the expense of restarting it or returning the plant to full capacity. in either event, generation could lose revenue and incur increased fuel and purchased power expense to meet supply commitments.
for plants operated but not wholly owned by generation, generation could also incur liability to the co-owners. for nuclear plants not operated and not wholly owned by generation, from which generation receives a portion of the plants' output, generation's results of operations are dependent on the operational performance of the operators and could be adversely affected by a significant event at those plants. additionally, poor operating performance at nuclear plants not owned by generation could result in increased regulation and reduced public support for nuclear-fueled energy. in addition, closure of generating plants owned by others, or extended interruptions of generating plants, or failure of transmission lines, could affect transmission systems that could adversely affect the sale and delivery of electricity in markets served by generation.
nuclear major incident risk and insurance. the consequences of a major incident could be severe and include loss of life and property damage. any resulting liability from a nuclear plant major incident within the united states, owned or operated by generation or owned by others, could exceed generation's resources, including insurance coverage. generation is a member of an industry mutual insurance company, neil, which provides property and business interruption insurance for generation's nuclear operations. uninsured losses and other expenses, to the extent not recovered from insurers or the nuclear industry, could be borne by generation. additionally, an accident or other significant event at a nuclear plant within the united states or abroad, whether owned by generation or others, could result in increased regulation and reduced public support for nuclear-fueled energy.
as required by the price-anderson act, generation carries the maximum available amount of nuclear liability insurance, $450 million for each operating site. claims exceeding that amount are covered through mandatory participation in a financial protection pool. in addition, the u.s. congress could impose revenue-raising measures on the nuclear industry to pay claims exceeding the $13.8 billion limit for a single incident.
see note 19 - commitments and contingencies of the combined notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information of nuclear insurance.
decommissioning obligation and funding. nrc regulations require that licensees of nuclear generating facilities demonstrate reasonable assurance that funds will be available in certain minimum amounts at the end of the life of the facility to decommission the facility.
generation recognizes as a liability the present value of the estimated future costs to decommission its nuclear facilities. the estimated liability is based on assumptions in the approach and timing of decommissioning the nuclear facilities, estimation of decommissioning costs, and federal and state regulatory requirements. the costs of such decommissioning may substantially exceed such liability, as facts, circumstances or our estimates may change, including changes in the approach and timing of decommissioning activities, changes in decommissioning costs, changes in federal or state regulatory requirements on the decommissioning of such facilities, other changes in our estimates or generation's ability to effectively execute on its planned decommissioning activities.
generation makes contributions to certain trust funds of the former peco units based on amounts being collected by peco from its customers and remitted to generation. while generation, through peco, has recourse to collect additional amounts from peco customers (subject to certain limitations and thresholds), it has no recourse to collect additional amounts from utility customers for any of its other nuclear units if there is a shortfall of funds necessary for decommissioning. if circumstances changed such that generation would be unable to continue to make contributions to the trust funds of the former peco units based on amounts collected from peco customers, or if generation no longer had recourse to collect additional amounts from peco customers if there was a shortfall of funds for decommissioning, the adequacy of the trust funds related to the former peco units could be negatively affected.
should the expected value of the ndt fund for any former comed unit fall below the amount of the expected decommissioning obligation for that unit, the accounting to offset decommissioning-related activities in the consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive income for that unit would be discontinued, the decommissioning-related activities would be recognized in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income, and the adverse impact to exelon's and generation's financial statements could be material. any changes to the existing peco regulatory agreements could impact exelon's and generation's ability to offset decommissioning-related activities within the consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive income, and the impact to exelon's and generation's financial statements could be material.
forecasting trust fund investment earnings and costs to decommission nuclear generating stations requires significant judgment, and actual results could differ significantly from current estimates. if the investments held by generation's ndt funds are not sufficient to fund the decommissioning of generation's nuclear units, generation could be required to take steps, such as providing financial guarantees through letters of credit or parent company guarantees or making additional contributions to the trusts, which could be significant, to ensure that the trusts are adequately funded and that current and future nrc minimum funding requirements are met.
see note 10 - asset retirement obligations of the combined notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information.
the utility registrants' operating costs are affected by their ability to maintain the availability and reliability of their delivery and operational systems (exelon and the utility registrants).
failures of the equipment or facilities used in the utility registrants' delivery systems could interrupt the electric transmission and electric and natural gas delivery, which could result in a loss of revenues and an increase in maintenance and capital expenditures. equipment or facilities failures can be due to a number of factors, including natural causes such as weather or information systems failure. specifically, if the implementation of ami, smart grid, or other technologies in the utility registrants' service territory fail to perform as intended or are not successfully integrated with billing and other information systems, or if any of the financial, accounting, or other data processing systems fail or have other significant shortcomings, the utility registrants' financial results could be negatively impacted. in addition, dependence upon automated systems could further increase the risk that operational system flaws or internal and/or external tampering or manipulation of those systems will result in losses that are difficult to detect.
regulated utilities, which are required to provide service to all customers within their service territory, have generally been afforded liability protections against claims by customers relating to failure of service. under illinois law, however, comed could be required to pay damages to its customers in some circumstances involving extended outages affecting large numbers of its customers, which could be material.
the registrants are subject to physical security and cybersecurity risks (all registrants).
the registrants face physical security and cybersecurity risks. threat sources continue to seek to exploit potential vulnerabilities in the electric and natural gas utility industry associated with protection of sensitive and confidential information, grid infrastructure, and other energy infrastructures, and such attacks and disruptions, both physical and cyber, are becoming increasingly sophisticated and dynamic. continued implementation of advanced digital technologies increases the potentially unfavorable impacts of such attacks. a security breach of the physical assets or information systems of the registrants, their competitors, vendors, business partners and interconnected entities in rtos and isos, or regulators could impact the operation of the generation fleet and/or reliability of the transmission and distribution system or result in the theft or inappropriate release of certain types of information, including critical infrastructure information, sensitive customer, vendor, and employee data, trading or other confidential data. the risk of these system-related events and security breaches occurring continues to intensify, and while the registrants have been, and will likely continue to be, subjected to physical and cyber-attacks, to date none has directly experienced a material breach or disruption to its network or information systems or our service operations. however, as such attacks continue to increase in sophistication and frequency, the registrants may be unable to prevent all such attacks in the future. if a significant breach were to occur, the reputation of the registrants could be negatively affected, customer confidence in the registrants or others in the industry could be diminished, or the registrants could be subject to legal claims, loss of revenues, increased costs, or operations shutdown. moreover, the amount and scope of insurance maintained against losses resulting from any such events or security breaches may not be sufficient to cover losses or otherwise adequately compensate for any disruptions to business that could result.
the utility registrants' deployment of smart meters throughout their service territories could increase the risk of damage from an intentional disruption of the system by third parties.
in addition, new or updated security regulations or unforeseen threat sources could require changes in current measures taken by the registrants or their business operations and could adversely affect their consolidated financial statements.
the registrants' employees, contractors, customers, and the general public could be exposed to a risk of injury due to the nature of the energy industry (all registrants).
employees and contractors throughout the organization work in, and customers and the general public could be exposed to, potentially dangerous environments near the registrants' operations. as a result, employees, contractors, customers, and the general public are at some risk for serious injury, including loss of life. these risks include nuclear accidents, dam failure, gas explosions, pole strikes, and electric contact cases.
natural disasters, war, acts and threats of terrorism, pandemic, and other significant events could negatively impact the registrants' results of operations, their ability to raise capital and their future growth (all registrants).
generation's fleet of power plants and the utility registrants' distribution and transmission infrastructures could be affected by natural disasters and extreme weather events, which could result in increased costs, including supply chain costs. an extreme weather event within the registrants' service areas can also directly affect their capital assets, causing disruption in service to customers due to downed wires and poles or damage to other operating equipment. natural disasters and other significant events increase the risk to generation that the nrc or other regulatory or legislative bodies could change the laws or regulations governing, among other things, operations, maintenance, licensed lives, decommissioning, snf storage, insurance, emergency planning, security, and environmental and radiological matters. in addition, natural disasters could affect the availability of a secure and economical supply of water in some locations, which is essential for generation's continued operation, particularly the cooling of generating units.
the impact that potential terrorist attacks could have on the industry and on exelon is uncertain. the registrants face a risk that their operations would be direct targets or indirect casualties of an act of terror. any retaliatory military strikes or sustained military campaign could affect their operations in unpredictable ways, such as changes in insurance markets and disruptions of fuel supplies and markets, particularly oil. furthermore, these catastrophic events could compromise the physical or cybersecurity of exelon's facilities, which could adversely affect exelon's ability to manage its business effectively. instability in the financial markets as a result of terrorism, war, natural disasters, pandemic, credit crises, recession, or other factors also could result in a decline in energy consumption or interruption of fuel or the supply chain. in addition, the implementation of security guidelines and measures has resulted in and is expected to continue to result in increased costs.
the registrants could be significantly affected by the outbreak of a pandemic. exelon has plans in place to respond to a pandemic. however, depending on the severity of a pandemic and the resulting impacts to workforce and other resource availability, the ability to operate exelon's generating and transmission and distribution assets could be affected.
in addition, exelon maintains a level of insurance coverage consistent with industry practices against property, casualty and cybersecurity losses subject to unforeseen occurrences or catastrophic events that could damage or destroy assets or interrupt operations. however, there can be no assurance that the amount of insurance will be adequate to address such property and casualty losses.
the registrants' businesses are capital intensive, and their assets could require significant expenditures to maintain and are subject to operational failure, which could result in potential liability (all registrants).
the registrants' businesses are capital intensive and require significant investments by generation in electric generating facilities and by the utility registrants in transmission and distribution infrastructure projects. equipment, even if maintained in accordance with good utility practices, is subject to operational failure, including events that are beyond the registrants' control, and could require significant expenditures to operate efficiently. the registrants consolidated financial statements could be negatively affected if they were unable to effectively manage their capital projects or raise the necessary capital. see item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations - liquidity and capital resources for additional information regarding the registrants' potential future capital expenditures.
the utility registrants' respective ability to deliver electricity, their operating costs, and their capital expenditures could be negatively impacted by transmission congestion and failures of neighboring transmission systems (exelon and the utility registrants).
demand for electricity within the utility registrants' service areas could stress available transmission capacity requiring alternative routing or curtailment of electricity usage. also, insufficient availability of electric supply to meet customer demand could jeopardize the utility registrants' ability to comply with reliability standards and strain customer and regulatory agency relationships. as with all utilities, potential concerns over transmission capacity or generation facility retirements could result in pjm or ferc requiring the utility registrants to upgrade or expand their respective transmission systems through additional capital expenditures.
pjm's systems and operations are designed to ensure the reliable operation of the transmission grid and prevent the operations of one utility from having an adverse impact on the operations of the other utilities. however, service interruptions at other utilities may cause interruptions in the utility registrants' service areas.
the registrants consolidated financial statements could be negatively affected if they fail to attract and retain an appropriately qualified workforce (all registrants).
certain events, such as an employee strike, loss of contract resources due to a major event, and an aging workforce without appropriate replacements, could lead to operating challenges and increased costs for the registrants. the challenges include lack of resources, loss of knowledge and a lengthy time period associated with skill development. in this case, costs, including costs for contractors to replace employees, productivity costs, and safety costs, could arise. the registrants are particularly affected due to the specialized knowledge required of the technical and support employees for their generation, transmission, and distribution operations.
the registrants could make acquisitions or investments in new business initiatives and new markets, which may not be successful or achieve the intended financial results (all registrants).
generation could continue to pursue growth in its existing businesses and markets and further diversification across the competitive energy value chain. this could include investment opportunities in renewables, development of natural gas generation, nuclear advisory or operating services for third parties, distributed generation, potential expansion of the existing wholesale gas businesses, and entry into lng. such initiatives could involve significant risks and uncertainties, including distraction of management from current operations, inadequate return on capital, and unidentified issues not discovered during diligence performed prior to launching an initiative or entering a market. additionally, it is possible that ferc, state public utility commissions or others could impose certain other restrictions on such transactions. all of these factors could result in higher costs or lower revenues than expected, resulting in lower than planned returns on investment.
the utility registrants face risks associated with their regulatory-mandated initiatives, such as smart grids and utility of the future. these risks include, but are not limited to, cost recovery, regulatory concerns, cybersecurity, and obsolescence of technology. such initiatives may not be successful.
the registrants may not realize or achieve the anticipated cost savings through the cost management efforts (all registrants).
the registrants' future financial performance and level of profitability is dependent, in part, on various cost reduction initiatives. the registrants may encounter challenges in executing these cost reduction initiatives and not achieve the intended cost savings.
risks related to the planned separation (exelon and generation)
the planned separation is contingent upon regulatory approvals and satisfaction of other conditions and may not be completed in accordance with the expected plans or anticipated timeline, or at all, which could negatively affect exelon's and generation's consolidated financial statements.
exelon is targeting to complete the separation in the first quarter of 2022, subject to final approval by exelon's board of directors, a form 10 registration statement being declared effective by the sec, regulatory approvals, and satisfaction of other conditions. the planned separation is subject to approval by the ferc, nrc and nypsc. there can be no assurance that any separation transaction will ultimately occur or, if one does occur, of its terms or timing. if the planned separation is not completed or is delayed, exelon's and generation's consolidated financial statements may be materially adversely affected, and the market price of exelon's common stock may be affected.
the plan to separate into two publicly traded companies will involve significant time and expense, which could disrupt or adversely affect our business.
the planned separation is complex in nature, and unanticipated developments or changes, including challenges in executing the separation, could delay or prevent the completion of the proposed separation, or cause the separation to occur on terms or conditions that are different or less favorable than expected. additionally, exelon's board of directors, in its sole and absolute discretion, may decide not to proceed with the separation at any time prior to the distribution date. the process of completing the proposed separation has been and is expected to continue to be time-consuming and involves significant costs and expenses.
the planned separation may not achieve some or all of the anticipated benefits and each separate company following the separation may underperform relative to exelon's expectations.
by separating the utility registrants and generation, exelon is creating two publicly traded companies with the resources necessary to best serve customers and sustain long-term investment and operating excellence. the separate companies are expected to create value by having the strategic flexibility to focus on their unique customer, market and community priorities. however, the planned separation may not provide such results on the scope or scale that exelon anticipates, and exelon and generation may not realize the anticipated benefits of the planned separation. failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on the financial statements of each separate company and their respective common stock price.
following the planned separation, the companies anticipate to maintain investment grade credit ratings. ratings are based upon assessments of multiple factors, including a company's credit metrics as well as industry and macroeconomic changes and trends. if a rating agency were to downgrade the rating below investment grade, the separate companies' borrowing costs would increase and their funding sources could decrease, which could have a material adverse effect on the financial statements of the affected company.
the common stock of the separately publicly traded companies following the separation may collectively trade at a value less than the price at which exelon's common stock might have traded had the separation not occurred.
there could be significant liability if the planned spin-off is determined to be a taxable transaction.
under the separation plan, exelon shareholders will retain their current shares of exelon stock and receive a pro-rata distribution of shares of the new company's stock in a transaction that is expected to be tax-free to exelon and its shareholders under sections 355 and 368 of the irc. exelon will seek a private letter ruling from the irs regarding the tax-free nature of the transaction. exelon will also seek from its tax advisors an opinion with respect to certain u.s. federal income tax consequences of the spin-off. if the planned spin-off ultimately is determined to be taxable, the spin-off could be treated as a taxable dividend to exelon's shareholders for u.s. federal income tax purposes, and exelon's shareholders could incur significant u.s. federal income tax liabilities. in addition, exelon would recognize a taxable gain to the extent that the fair market value of the new company's stock exceeds its tax basis in such stock on the date of the planned separation. exelon will enter into a tax matters agreement with the new company to address how post-separation issues will be managed between the companies, as well as which company is responsible for taxes imposed as a result of the planned separation, if any.
see note 26 - subsequent events of the combined notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information on the planned separation.

item 7.        management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations exelon executive overview exelon is a utility services holding company engaged in the generation, delivery, and marketing of energy through generation and the energy distribution and transmission businesses through comed, peco, bge, pepco, dpl, and ace.
exelon has eleven reportable segments consisting of generation's five reportable segments (mid-atlantic, midwest, new york, ercot, and other power regions), comed, peco, bge, pepco, dpl, and ace. see note 1 - significant accounting policies and note 5 - segment information of the combined notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding exelon's principal subsidiaries and reportable segments.
exelon's consolidated financial information includes the results of its eight separate operating subsidiary registrants, generation, comed, peco, bge, phi, pepco, dpl, and ace, which, along with exelon, are collectively referred to as the registrants. the following combined management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations summarizes results for the year ended december 31, 2020 compared to the year ended december 31, 2019, and is separately filed by exelon, generation, comed, peco, bge, phi, pepco, dpl, and ace. however, none of the registrants makes any representation as to information related solely to any of the other registrants. for discussion of the year ended december 31, 2019 compared to the year ended december 31, 2018, refer to item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in the 2019 form 10-k, which was filed with the sec on february 11, 2020.
covid-19. the registrants have taken steps to mitigate the potential risks posed by the global outbreak (pandemic) of covid-19. the registrants provide a critical service to our customers which means that it is paramount that we keep our employees who operate our businesses safe and minimize unnecessary risk of exposure to the virus. the registrants have taken extra precautions for our employees who work in the field and for employees who continue to work in our facilities. the registrants have implemented work from home policies where appropriate, and imposed travel limitations on their employees. in addition, the registrants have updated existing business continuity plans in the context of this pandemic.
the registrants continue to implement strong physical and cyber-security measures to ensure that our systems remain functional in order to both serve our operational needs with a remote workforce and keep them running to ensure uninterrupted service to our customers.
there were no changes in internal control over financial reporting in 2020 as a result of covid-19 that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, any of the registrants' internal control over financial reporting. see item 9a. controls and procedures for additional information.
unfavorable economic conditions due to covid-19 have impacted the demand for electricity and natural gas at generation and the utility registrants, which has resulted in a decrease in operating revenues.
as a result of covid-19, generation temporarily suspended interruption of service for all retail residential customers for non-payment and temporarily ceased new late payment fees for all retail customers from march to may of 2020. starting in march of 2020, the utility registrants also temporarily suspended customer disconnections for non-payment and temporarily ceased new late payment fees for all customers and restored service to customers upon request who were disconnected in the last twelve months. see note 3 - regulatory matters of the combined notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information on such measures at the utility registrants. at generation, such measures resulted in an increase in credit loss expense. comed and ace recorded regulatory assets for the incremental credit loss expense based on existing mechanisms. bge, peco, pepco, and dpl also recorded regulatory assets for substantially all the incremental credit loss expense incurred in 2020. see note 3 - regulatory matters of the combined notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information.
generation and the utility registrants have also incurred direct costs related to covid-19 consisting primarily of costs to acquire personal protective equipment, costs for cleaning supplies and services, and costs to hire healthcare professionals to monitor the health of their employees. at generation and peco, such costs are recorded as operating and maintenance expense and are excluded from adjusted (non-gaap) operating earnings. at comed, bge, pepco, dpl, and ace, such costs are primarily recorded as regulatory assets. see note 3 - regulatory matters of the combined notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information.
the estimated impact to generation's and the utility registrants' net income is approximately $170 million and $75 million for the year ended december 31, 2020, respectively.
to offset the unfavorable impacts from covid-19, the registrants identified approximately $250 million in cost savings across generation and the utility registrants in 2020. the cost savings achieved in 2020 were higher than originally anticipated.
the registrants rely on the capital markets for publicly offered debt as well as the commercial paper markets to meet their financial commitments and short-term liquidity needs. as a result of the disruptions in the commercial paper markets in march of 2020, generation borrowed $1.5 billion on its revolving credit facility to refinance commercial paper, which generation repaid on april 3, 2020. generation also entered into two short-term loan agreements in march of 2020 for an aggregate of $500 million. on april 8, 2020, generation received approximately $500 million in cash after entering into an accounts receivable financing arrangement. on april 24, 2020, exelon corporate entered into a credit agreement establishing a $550 million 364-day revolving credit facility to be used as an additional source of short-term liquidity. in addition, the registrants issued long-term debt of $5.3 billion and were able to successfully complete their planned long-term debt issuances in 2020. see liquidity and capital resources, note 17 - debt and credit agreements, and note 6 - accounts receivable of the combined notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information.
the registrants assessed long-lived assets, goodwill, and investments for recoverability and there were no material impairment charges recorded in 2020 as a result of covid-19. see note 12 - asset impairments for additional information related to other impairment assessments in the third quarter of 2020. certain assumptions are highly sensitive to changes. changes in significant assumptions could potentially result in future impairments, which could be material.
this is an evolving situation that could lead to extended disruption of economic activity in our markets. the registrants will continue to monitor developments affecting their workforce, customers, and suppliers and will take additional precautions that they determine to be necessary in order to mitigate the impacts. the extent to which covid-19 may impact the registrants' ability to operate their generating and transmission and distribution assets, the ability to access capital markets, and results of operations, including demand for electricity and natural gas, will depend on the spread and proliferation of covid-19 around the world and future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted at this time.

(a)primarily includes eliminating and consolidating adjustments, exelon's corporate operations, shared service entities, and other financing and investing activities.
•one-time charges and accelerated depreciation and amortization associated with generation's decisions in the third quarter of 2020 to early retire byron and dresden nuclear facilities in 2021 and mystic units 8 and 9 in 2024, partially offset by the absence of accelerated depreciation and amortization due to the early retirement of tmi in september 2019;
•impairment of the new england asset group;
•payments that comed made under the deferred prosecution agreement. see note 19 - commitments and contingencies of the combined notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information;
•lower capacity revenue;
•reduction in load due to covid-19 at generation;
•impact of generation's annual update to the nuclear aro for non-regulatory agreement units;
•lower electric distribution earnings from lower allowed roe due to a decrease in treasury rates, partially offset by higher rate base at comed;
•higher storm costs related to the june 2020 and august 2020 storms at peco, net of tax repairs, and related to the august 2020 storm at dpl;
•unfavorable weather conditions at peco, dpl delaware, and ace; and
•a net increase in depreciation and amortization expense due to ongoing capital expenditures at peco, bge, pepco, dpl, and ace, partially offset at generation due to the impact of extending the operating license at peach bottom.
the decreases were partially offset by;
•higher mark-to-market gains;
•unrealized gains resulting from equity investments without readily determinable fair values that became publicly traded entities in the fourth quarter and were fair valued based on quoted market prices of the stocks as of december 31, 2020;
•lower operating and maintenance expense at generation primarily due to previous cost management programs, lower contracting costs, and lower travel costs, partially offset by lower neil insurance distributions;
•a tax benefit related to a settlement in the first quarter of 2020, partially offset by the absence of a tax benefit related to certain research and development activities recorded in the fourth quarter of 2019 at generation; and
adjusted (non-gaap) operating earnings. in addition to net income, exelon evaluates its operating performance using the measure of adjusted (non-gaap) operating earnings because management believes it represents earnings directly related to the ongoing operations of the business. adjusted (non-gaap) operating earnings exclude certain costs, expenses, gains and losses, and other specified items. this information is intended to enhance an investor's overall understanding of year-to-year operating results and provide an indication of exelon's baseline operating performance excluding items that are considered by management to be not directly related to the ongoing operations of the business. in addition, this information is among the primary indicators management uses as a basis for evaluating performance, allocating resources, setting incentive compensation targets, and planning and forecasting of future periods. adjusted (non-gaap) operating earnings is not a presentation defined under gaap and may not be comparable to other companies' presentations or deemed more useful than the gaap information provided elsewhere in this report.
the following table provides a reconciliation between net income attributable to common shareholders as determined in accordance with gaap and adjusted (non-gaap) operating earnings for the year ended december 31, 2020 as compared to 2019:

unless otherwise noted, the income tax impact of each reconciling item between gaap net income and adjusted (non-gaap) operating earnings is based on the marginal statutory federal and state income tax rates for each registrant, taking into account whether the income or expense item is taxable or deductible, respectively, in whole or in part. for all items except the unrealized gains and losses related to ndt funds, the marginal statutory income tax rates for 2020 and 2019 ranged from 26.0% to 29.0%. under irs regulations, ndt fund investment returns are taxed at different rates for investments if they are in qualified or non-qualified funds. the effective tax rates for the unrealized gains and losses related to ndt funds were 52.1% and 47.3% for the years ended december 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.
(a)reflects the impact of net unrealized gains and losses on generation's ndt fund investments for non-regulatory and regulatory agreement units. the impacts of the regulatory agreement units, including the associated income taxes, are contractually eliminated, resulting in no earnings impact.
(b)in 2020, reflects an impairment at comed in the second quarter of 2020 related to the acquisition of transmission assets and an impairment of the new england asset group in the third quarter of 2020. in 2019, primarily reflects the impairment of equity method investments in certain distributed energy companies. the impact of such impairment net of noncontrolling interest is $0.02.
(c)in 2020, primarily reflects one-time charges and accelerated depreciation and amortization associated with generation's decisions in the third quarter of 2020 to early retire byron and dresden nuclear facilities in 2021 and mystic units 8 and 9 in 2024. in 2019, primarily reflects accelerated depreciation and amortization expenses associated with the early retirement of the tmi nuclear facility and certain fossil sites and the loss on the sale of oyster creek to holtec, partially offset by net realized gains related to oyster creek's ndt fund investments, a net benefit associated with remeasurements of the tmi aro, and a gain on the sale of certain wind assets.
(d)primarily represents reorganization and severance costs related to cost management programs.
(e)reflects an adjustment to generation's nuclear aro for non-regulatory agreement units resulting from the annual update.
(f)represents direct costs related to covid-19 consisting primarily of costs to acquire personal protective equipment, costs for cleaning supplies and services, and costs to hire healthcare professionals to monitor the health of employees.
(g)reflects the payments made by comed under the deferred prosecution agreement, which comed entered into on july 17, 2020 with the u.s. attorney's office for the northern district of illinois.
(h)reflects costs related to the acquisition of edf's interest in ceng.
(i)reflects costs related to a multi-year erp system implementation.
(j)primarily reflects the adjustment to deferred income taxes due to changes in forecasted apportionment.
(k)represents elimination from generation's results of the noncontrolling interests related to certain exclusion items. in 2020, primarily related to unrealized gains and losses on ndt fund investments for ceng units. in 2019, primarily related to the impact of unrealized gains on ndt fund investments and the impact of the generation's annual nuclear aro update for ceng units, partially offset by the impairment of certain equity investments in distributed energy companies.
significant 2020 transactions and developments planned separation on february 21, 2021, exelon's board of directors approved a plan to separate the utility registrants and generation, creating two publicly traded companies with the resources necessary to best serve customers and sustain long-term investment and operating excellence. the separation gives each company the financial and strategic independence to focus on its specific customer needs, while executing its core business strategy. see note 26 - subsequent events of the combined notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information.
impacts of february 2021 weather events and texas-based generating assets outages beginning on february 15, 2021, generation's texas-based generating assets within the ercot market, specifically colorado bend ii, wolf hollow ii, and handley, experienced periodic outages as a result of historically severe cold weather conditions. in addition, those weather conditions drove increased demand for service, limited the availability of natural gas to fuel power plants, and dramatically increased wholesale power and gas prices.
exelon and generation estimate the impact to their net income for the first quarter of 2021 arising from these market and weather conditions to be approximately $560 million to $710 million. the estimated impact includes favorable results in certain regions within generation's wholesale gas business. the ultimate impact to exelon's and generation's consolidated financial statements may be affected by a number of factors, including final settlement data, the impacts of customer and counterparty credit losses, any state sponsored solutions to address the financial challenges caused by the event, and litigation and contract disputes which may result. exelon expects to offset between $410 million and $490 million of this impact primarily at generation through a combination of enhanced revenue opportunities, deferral of selected non-essential maintenance, and primarily one-time cost savings.
see note 26 - subsequent events of the combined notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information.
agreement for sale of generation's solar business on december 8, 2020, generation entered into an agreement with an affiliate of brookfield renewable, for the sale of a significant portion of generation's solar business, including 360 megawatts of generation in operation or under construction across more than 600 sites across the united states, for a purchase price of $810 million. completion of the transaction is expected to occur in the first half of 2021. generation will retain certain solar assets not included in this agreement, primarily antelope valley. see note 2 - mergers, acquisitions, and dispositions of the combined notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information.
early retirement of generation facilities in august 2020, generation announced that it intends to retire the byron generating station in september 2021, dresden generating station in november 2021, and mystic units 8 and 9 at the expiration of the cost of service commitment in may 2024. as a result, in the third quarter of 2020, exelon and generation recognized a $500 million impairment of its new england asset group and one-time non-cash charges for byron, dresden, and mystic related to materials and supplies inventory reserve adjustments, employee-related costs, and construction work-in-progress impairments, among other items. in addition, there will be ongoing annual financial impacts stemming from shortening the expected economic useful lives of these facilities, primarily related to accelerated depreciation of plant assets (including any arc) and accelerated amortization of nuclear fuel. such ongoing charges are excluded from adjusted (non-gaap) operating earnings.
the following table summarizes the incremental expense recorded for the year ended december 31, 2020 and the estimated amounts of incremental expense expected to be incurred through the retirement dates.
operating and maintenance one-time charges                                 277                        30                    10                     -                  20

(a)actual results may differ based on incremental future capital additions, actual units of production for nuclear fuel amortization, future revised aro assumptions, etc.
(b)reflects incremental accelerated depreciation of plant assets, including any arc.
(c)reflects primarily the net impacts associated with the remeasurement of the aro for dresden. see note 10 - asset retirement obligations of the combined notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information.
(d)reflects contractual offset for aro accretion, arc depreciation, and net impacts associated with the remeasurement of the aro for byron and dresden. based on the regulatory agreement with the icc, decommissioning-related activities are offset within exelon's and generation's consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income as long as the net cumulative decommissioning-related activities result in a regulatory liability at comed. recognition of a regulatory asset for nuclear decommissioning-related activities at comed is not permissible. the offset results in an equal adjustment to the noncurrent payables to comed at generation and an adjustment to the regulatory liabilities at comed. see note 10 - asset retirement obligations of the combined notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information.
deferred prosecution agreement on july 17, 2020, comed entered into a deferred prosecution agreement (dpa) with the u.s. attorney's office for the northern district of illinois (usao) to resolve the usao's investigation into comed's lobbying activities in the state of illinois. under the dpa, the usao filed a single charge alleging that comed improperly gave and offered to give jobs, vendor subcontracts, and payments associated with those jobs and subcontracts for the benefit of the speaker of the illinois house of representatives and the speaker's associates, with the intent to influence the speaker's action regarding legislation affecting comed's interests. the dpa provides that the usao will defer any prosecution of such charge and any other criminal or civil case against comed in connection with the matters identified therein for a three-year period subject to certain obligations of comed, including payment to the united states treasury of $200 million, with $100 million payable within thirty days of the filing of the dpa with the united states district court for the northern district of illinois and an additional $100 million within ninety days of such filing date. the payments will not be recovered in rates or charged to customers, and comed will not seek or accept reimbursement or indemnification from any source other than exelon. see note 19 - commitments and contingencies for additional information.
utility distribution base rate case proceedings the utility registrants file base rate cases with their regulatory commissions seeking increases or decreases to their electric transmission and distribution, and gas distribution rates to recover their costs and earn a fair return on their investments. the outcomes of these regulatory proceedings impact the utility registrants' current and future financial statements.

exelon's strategy and outlook on february 21, 2021, exelon's board of directors approved a plan to separate the utility registrants and generation, creating two publicly traded companies with the resources necessary to best serve customers and sustain long-term investment and operating excellence. the separation gives each company the financial and strategic independence to focus on its specific customer needs, while executing its core business strategy. see note 26 - subsequent events of the combined notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information.
in 2021, the businesses remain focused on maintaining industry leading operational excellence, meeting or exceeding their financial commitments, ensuring timely recovery on investments to enable customer benefits, supporting enactment of clean energy policies, and continued commitment to corporate responsibility.
exelon's utility strategy is to improve reliability and operations and enhance the customer experience, while ensuring ratemaking mechanisms provide the utilities fair financial returns. the utility registrants only invest in rate base where it provides a benefit to customers and the community by improving reliability and the service experience or otherwise meeting customer needs. the utility registrants make these investments at the lowest reasonable cost to customers. exelon seeks to leverage its scale and expertise across the utilities platform through enhanced standardization and sharing of resources and best practices to achieve improved operational and financial results. additionally, the utility registrants anticipate making significant future investments in smart grid technology, transmission projects, gas infrastructure, and electric system improvement projects, providing greater reliability and improved service for our customers and a stable return for the company.
generation's competitive businesses create value for customers by providing innovative energy solutions and reliable, clean, and affordable energy. generation's electricity generation strategy is to pursue opportunities that provide stable revenues and match supply to customers. generation leverages its energy generation portfolio to deliver energy to both wholesale and retail customers. generation's customer-facing activities foster development and delivery of other innovative energy-related products and services for its customers. generation operates in well-developed energy markets and employs an integrated hedging strategy to manage commodity price volatility. its generation fleet, including its nuclear plants which consistently operate at high capacity factors, also provide geographic and supply source diversity. these factors help generation mitigate the current challenging conditions in competitive energy markets.
various market, financial, regulatory, legislative and operational factors could affect the registrants' success in pursuing their strategies. exelon continues to assess infrastructure, operational, commercial, policy, and legal solutions to these issues. one key issue is ensuring the ability to properly value nuclear generation assets in the market, solutions to which exelon is actively pursuing in a variety of jurisdictions and venues. see item 1a. risk factors for additional information regarding market and financial factors.
growth opportunities management continually evaluates growth opportunities aligned with exelon's businesses, assets and markets, leveraging exelon's expertise in those areas and offering sustainable returns.
regulated energy businesses. the utility registrants anticipate investing approximately $27 billion over the next four years in electric and natural gas infrastructure improvements and modernization projects, including smart grid technology, storm hardening, advanced reliability technologies, and transmission projects, which is projected to result in an increase to current rate base of approximately $15 billion by the end of 2024. the utility registrants invest in rate base where beneficial to customers and the community by increasing reliability and the service experience or otherwise meeting customer needs. these investments are made at the lowest reasonable cost to customers.
competitive energy businesses. generation continually assesses the optimal structure and composition of its generation assets as well as explores wholesale and retail opportunities within the power and gas sectors. generation's strategy is to ensure appropriate valuation of its generation assets, in part through public policy efforts, identify and capitalize on opportunities that match supply to customers as a means to provide stable earnings, and identify emerging technologies where strategic investments provide the option for significant future growth or influence in market development.
other key business drivers and management strategies utility rates and rate proceedings the utility registrants file rate cases with their regulatory commissions seeking increases or decreases to their electric transmission and distribution, and gas distribution rates to recover their costs and earn a fair return on their investments. the outcomes of these regulatory proceedings impact the utility registrants' current and future results of operations, cash flows, and financial positions. see note 3 - regulatory matters of the combined notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information on these regulatory proceedings.
power markets price of fuels the use of new technologies to recover natural gas from shale deposits is increasing natural gas supply and reserves, which places downward pressure on natural gas prices and, therefore, on wholesale and retail power prices, which results in a reduction in exelon's revenues. forward natural gas prices have declined significantly over the last several years; in part reflecting an increase in supply due to strong natural gas production (due to shale gas development).
section 232 uranium petition on january 16, 2018, two canadian-owned uranium mining companies with operations in the u.s. jointly submitted a petition to the u.s. department of commerce ("doc") seeking relief under section 232 of the trade expansion act of 1962 from imports of uranium products, alleging that these imports threaten national security.
the united states nuclear fuel working group ("working group") report was made public on april 23, 2020. the working group report states that nuclear power is intrinsically tied to national security, and promises that the u.s. government will take bold actions to strengthen all parts of the nuclear fuel industry in the u.s. it recommends the agreement suspending the antidumping investigation on uranium from the russian federation (the "russian suspension agreement" or "rsa") be extended and to consider reducing the amount of russian imports of nuclear fuel. the russian suspension agreement is the historical resolution of a 1991 doc investigation that found that the russians had been selling or "dumping" cheap uranium products into the u.s. the rsa has been amended several times in the intervening years to allow russia to supply limited amounts of uranium products into the u.s. it was set to expire at the end of 2020, but was amended on october 5, 2020 to extend for another 20 years.
the working group report should be viewed as policy recommendations that may be implemented by executive agencies, congress, and or regulatory bodies. exelon and generation cannot currently predict the outcome of all of the policy changes recommended by the working group.
complaint at ferc seeking to alter capacity market default offer caps on february 21, 2019, pjm's independent market monitor (imm) filed a complaint alleging that the number of performance assessment intervals used to calculate the default offer cap for bids to supply capacity in pjm is too high, resulting in an overstated default offer cap that obviates the need for most sellers to seek unit-specific approval of their offers. the imm claims that this allows for the exercise of market power. the imm asks ferc to require pjm to reduce the number of performance assessment intervals used to calculate the opportunity costs of a capacity supplier assuming a capacity obligation. this would, in turn, lower the default offer cap and allow the imm to review more offers on a unit-specific basis. it is too early to predict the final outcome of this proceeding or its potential financial impact, if any, on exelon or generation.
energy demand load growth at the utility registrants is driven by recovery from covid-19 impacts. comed and peco are projecting modest growth in load of 2.5% and 1.8%, respectively, in 2021 as compared to reduced load in 2020. bge, pepco, dpl, and ace are projecting slower growth as prolonged covid-19 impacts decrease load by (2.0)%, (0.8)%, (0.9)%, and (2.4)%, respectively, in 2021 compared to 2020.
retail competition generation's retail operations compete for customers in a competitive environment, which affect the margins that generation can earn and the volumes that it is able to serve. forward natural gas and power prices are expected to remain low and thus we expect retail competitors to stay aggressive in their pursuit of market share, and that wholesale generators (including generation) will continue to use their retail operations to hedge generation output.
hedging strategy exelon's policy to hedge commodity risk on a ratable basis over three-year periods is intended to reduce the financial impact of market price volatility. generation is exposed to commodity price risk associated with the unhedged portion of its electricity portfolio. generation enters into non-derivative and derivative contracts, including financially-settled swaps, futures contracts and swap options, and physical options and physical forward contracts, all with credit-approved counterparties, to hedge this anticipated exposure. as of december 31, 2020, the percentage of expected generation hedged for the mid-atlantic, midwest, new york, and ercot reportable segments is 94%-97% for 2021. generation has been and will continue to be proactive in using hedging strategies to mitigate commodity price risk.
generation procures natural gas through long-term and short-term contracts and spot-market purchases. nuclear fuel assemblies are obtained predominantly through long-term uranium concentrate supply contracts, contracted conversion services, contracted enrichment services, or a combination thereof, and contracted fuel fabrication services. the supply markets for uranium concentrates and certain nuclear fuel services are subject to price fluctuations and availability restrictions. approximately 60% of generation's uranium concentrate requirements from 2021 through 2025 are supplied by three suppliers. in the event of non-performance by these or other suppliers, generation believes that replacement uranium concentrate can be obtained, although at prices that may be unfavorable when compared to the prices under the current supply agreements. non-performance by these counterparties could have a material adverse impact on exelon's and generation's consolidated financial statements.

the utility registrants mitigate commodity price risk through regulatory mechanisms that allow them to recover procurement costs from retail customers.
other legislative and regulatory developments illinois clean energy progress act on march 14, 2019, the clean energy progress act was introduced in the illinois general assembly to preserve illinois' clean energy choices arising from feja and empower the ipa to conduct capacity procurements outside of pjm's base residual auction process, while utilizing the frr provisions in pjm's tariffs which are still subject to penalties and other obligations under the pjm tariffs. the most significant provisions of the proposed legislation are as follows: (1) it allows the ipa to procure capacity directly from clean energy resources that have previously sold zecs or recs, including certain of generation's nuclear plants in illinois, or from new clean energy resources, (2) it establishes a goal of achieving 100% carbon-free power in the comed service territory by 2032, and (3) it implements reforms to enhance consumer protections in the state's competitive retail electricity and natural gas markets, including generation's retail customers. energy legislation has also been proposed by other stakeholders in 2019 and 2020, including renewable resource developers, environmental advocates, and coal-fueled generators. lawmakers focused their efforts on understanding all of the various legislative proposals with the goal of developing a single comprehensive energy package for ultimate consideration by the general assembly and governor pritzker. due to the covid-19 pandemic, the legislative calendar during 2020 was severely curtailed stalling progress on comprehensive energy legislation. the fall 2020 veto session was cancelled. the next opportunity for the general assembly to consider development of comprehensive energy legislation appears to come during the 2021 spring legislative session. exelon and generation will work with legislators and stakeholders and cannot predict the outcome or the potential financial impact, if any, on exelon or generation.
nuclear powers act of 2019
on april 12, 2019, the nuclear powers america act of 2019 was introduced to the united states congress, which expands the current investment tax credit to existing nuclear power plants. the proposed legislation would provide a credit equal to 30% of continued capital investment in certain nuclear energy-related expenditures, including capital expenses and nuclear fuel, starting from tax years 2019 through 2023. thereafter, the credit rate would be reduced to 26% in 2024, 22% in 2025, and 10% in 2026 and beyond. to qualify for the credit, the plant must be currently operational and must have applied for an operating license renewal before 2026.  exelon and generation are working with legislators and stakeholders and cannot predict the outcome or the potential financial impact, if any, on exelon or generation.
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires that management apply accounting policies and make estimates and assumptions that affect results of operations and the amounts of assets and liabilities reported in the financial statements. management believes that the accounting policies described below require significant judgment in their application, or incorporate estimates and assumptions that are inherently uncertain and that may change in subsequent periods. additional information of the application of these accounting policies can be found in the combined notes to consolidated financial statements.
nuclear decommissioning asset retirement obligations (exelon and generation)
generation's aro associated with decommissioning its nuclear units was $11.9 billion at december 31, 2020. the authoritative guidance requires that generation estimate its obligation for the future decommissioning of its nuclear generating plants. to estimate that liability, generation uses an internally-developed, probability-weighted, discounted cash flow model which, on a unit-by-unit basis, considers multiple decommissioning outcome scenarios.
as a result of recent nuclear plant retirements in the industry, nuclear operators and third-party service providers are obtaining more information about costs associated with decommissioning activities. at the same time, regulators are gaining more information about decommissioning activities which could result in changes to existing decommissioning requirements. in addition, as more nuclear plants are retired, it is possible that technological advances will be identified that could create efficiencies and lead to a reduction in decommissioning costs. the availability of ndt funds could impact the timing of the decommissioning activities. additionally, certain factors such as changes in regulatory requirements during plant operations or the profitability of a nuclear plant could impact the timing of plant retirements. these factors could result in material changes to generation's current estimates as more information becomes available and could change the timing of plant retirements and the probability assigned to the decommissioning outcome scenarios.
the nuclear decommissioning obligation is adjusted on a regular basis due to the passage of time and revisions to the key assumptions for the expected timing and/or estimated amounts of the future undiscounted cash flows required to decommission the nuclear plants, based upon the following methodologies and significant estimates and assumptions:
decommissioning cost studies. generation uses unit-by-unit decommissioning cost studies to provide a marketplace assessment of the expected costs (in current year dollars) and timing of decommissioning activities, which are validated by comparison to current decommissioning projects within the industry and other estimates. decommissioning cost studies are updated, on a rotational basis, for each of generation's nuclear units at least every five years, unless circumstances warrant more frequent updates. as part of the annual cost study update process, generation evaluates newly assumed costs or substantive changes in previously assumed costs to determine if the cost estimate impacts are sufficiently material to warrant application of the updated estimates to the aros across the nuclear fleet outside of the normal five-year rotating cost study update cycle.
cost escalation factors. generation uses cost escalation factors to escalate the decommissioning costs from the decommissioning cost studies discussed above through the assumed decommissioning period for each of the units. cost escalation studies, updated on an annual basis, are used to determine escalation factors, and are based on inflation indices for labor, equipment and materials, energy, llrw disposal, and other costs. all of the nuclear aros are adjusted each year for the updated cost escalation factors.
probabilistic cash flow models. generation's probabilistic cash flow models include the assignment of probabilities to various scenarios for decommissioning cost levels, decommissioning approaches, and timing of plant shutdown on a unit-by-unit basis. probabilities assigned to cost levels include an assessment of the likelihood of costs 20% higher (high-cost scenario) or 15% lower (low-cost scenario) than the base cost scenario. the assumed decommissioning scenarios include the following three alternatives: (1) decon which assumes decommissioning activities begin shortly after the cessation of operation, (2) shortened safstor generally has a 30-year delay prior to onset of decommissioning activities, and (3) safstor which assumes the nuclear facility is placed and maintained in such condition that the nuclear facility can be safely stored and subsequently decontaminated generally within 60 years after cessation of operations. in each decommissioning scenario, spent fuel is transferred to dry cask storage as soon as possible until doe acceptance for disposal.
the actual decommissioning approach selected once a nuclear facility is shutdown will be determined by generation at the time of shutdown and may be influenced by multiple factors including the funding status of the ndt fund at the time of shutdown.
the assumed plant shutdown timing scenarios include the following four alternatives: (1) the probability of operating through the original 40-year nuclear license term, (2) the probability of operating through an extended
60-year nuclear license term (regardless of whether such 20-year license extension has been received for each unit), (3) the probability of a second, 20-year license renewal for some nuclear units, and (4) the probability of early plant retirement for certain sites due to changing market conditions and regulatory environments. as power market and regulatory environment developments occur, generation evaluates and incorporates, as necessary, the impacts of such developments into its nuclear aro assumptions and estimates.
generation's probabilistic cash flow models also include an assessment of the timing of doe acceptance of snf for disposal. generation currently assumes doe will begin accepting snf in 2035. the snf acceptance date assumption is based on management's estimates of the amount of time required for doe to select a site location and develop the necessary infrastructure for long-term snf storage. for additional information regarding the estimated date when doe will begin accepting snf, see note 19 - commitments and contingencies of the combined notes to consolidated financial statements.
discount rates. the probability-weighted estimated future cash flows for the various assumed scenarios are discounted using credit-adjusted, risk-free rates (carfr) applicable to the various businesses in which each of the nuclear units originally operated. generation initially recognizes an aro at fair value and subsequently adjusts it for changes to estimated costs, timing of future cash flows and modifications to decommissioning assumptions. the aro is not required or permitted to be re-measured for changes in the carfr that occur in isolation. increases in the aro as a result of upward revisions in estimated undiscounted cash flows are considered new obligations and are measured using a current carfr as the increase creates a new cost layer within the aro. any decrease in the estimated undiscounted future cash flows relating to the aro are treated as a modification of an existing aro cost layer and, therefore, is measured using the average historical carfr rates used in creating the initial aro cost layers. if generation's future nominal cash flows associated with the aro were to be discounted at current prevailing carfr, the obligation would increase from approximately $11.9 billion to approximately $15.0 billion.
the following table illustrates the significant impact that changes in the carfr, when combined with changes in projected amounts and expected timing of cash flows, can have on the valuation of the aro (dollars in millions):
change in the carfr applied to the annual aro update       (decrease) increase to aro at december 31, 2020
aro sensitivities. changes in the assumptions underlying the aro could materially affect the decommissioning obligation. the impact to the aro of a change in any one of these assumptions is highly dependent on how the other assumptions may correspondingly change.
the following table illustrates the effects of changing certain aro assumptions while holding all other assumptions constant (dollars in millions):

as of december 31, 2020, exelon's $6.7 billion carrying amount of goodwill consists primarily of $2.6 billion at comed and $4 billion at phi. these entities are required to perform an assessment for possible impairment of their goodwill at least annually or more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of the reporting units below their carrying amount. a reporting unit is an operating segment or one level below an operating segment (known as a component) and is the level at which goodwill is assessed for impairment. comed has a single operating segment and reporting unit. phi's operating segments and reporting units are pepco, dpl, and ace. see note 5 - segment information of the combined notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information. exelon's and comed's goodwill has been assigned entirely to the comed reporting unit. exelon's and phi's goodwill has been assigned to the pepco, dpl, and ace reporting units in the amounts of $2.1 billion, $1.4 billion, and $0.5 billion, respectively. see note 13 - intangible assets of the combined notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information.
entities assessing goodwill for impairment have the option of first performing a qualitative assessment to determine whether a quantitative assessment is necessary. as part of the qualitative assessments, exelon, comed, and phi evaluate, among other things, management's best estimate of projected operating and capital cash flows for their businesses, outcomes of recent regulatory proceedings, changes in certain market conditions, including the discount rate and regulated utility peer ebitda multiples, and the passing margin from their last quantitative assessments performed.
application of the goodwill impairment assessment requires management judgment, including the identification of reporting units and determining the fair value of the reporting unit, which management estimates using a weighted combination of a discounted cash flow analysis and a market multiples analysis. significant assumptions used in these fair value analyses include discount and growth rates, utility sector market performance and transactions, and projected operating and capital cash flows for comed's, pepco's, dpl's, and ace's businesses and the fair value of debt.
while the 2020 annual assessments indicated no impairments, certain assumptions used in the assessment are highly sensitive to changes. adverse regulatory actions or changes in significant assumptions could potentially result in future impairments of exelon's, comed's, or phi's goodwill, which could be material.
see note 1 - significant accounting policies and note 13 - intangible assets of the combined notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information.
unamortized energy contract assets and liabilities (exelon, generation, and phi)
unamortized energy contract assets and liabilities represent the remaining unamortized balances of non-derivative energy contracts that generation has acquired and the electricity contracts exelon acquired as part of the phi merger. the initial amount recorded represents the fair value of the contracts at the time of acquisition. at exelon and phi, offsetting regulatory assets or liabilities were also recorded for those energy contract costs that are probable of recovery or refund through customer rates. the unamortized energy contract assets and liabilities and any corresponding regulatory assets or liabilities, respectively, are amortized over the life of the contract in relation to the expected realization of the underlying cash flows. amortization of the unamortized energy contract assets and liabilities is recorded through purchased power and fuel expense or operating revenues, depending on the nature of the underlying contract. see note 3 - regulatory matters and note 13 - intangible assets of the combined notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information.
impairment of long-lived assets (all registrants)
all registrants regularly monitor and evaluate the carrying value of long-lived assets and asset groups for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of those assets may not be recoverable. indicators of potential impairment may include a deteriorating business climate, including, but not limited to, declines in energy prices, condition of the asset, an asset remaining idle for more than a short period of time, specific regulatory disallowance, advances in technology, plans to dispose of a long-lived asset significantly before the end of its useful life, and financial distress of a third party for assets contracted with them on a long-term basis, among others.
the review of long-lived assets and asset groups for impairment utilizes significant assumptions about operating strategies and estimates of future cash flows, which require assessments of current and projected market conditions. for the generation business, forecasting future cash flows requires assumptions regarding forecasted commodity prices for the sale of power and purchases of fuel and the expected operations of assets. a variation in the assumptions used could lead to a different conclusion regarding the recoverability of an asset or asset group and, thus, could potentially result in material future impairments. an impairment evaluation is based on an undiscounted cash flow analysis at the lowest level at which cash flows of the long-lived assets or asset groups are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities. for the generation business, the lowest level of independent cash flows is determined by the evaluation of several factors, including the geographic dispatch of the generation units and the hedging strategies related to those units as well as the associated intangible assets or liabilities recorded on the balance sheet. the cash flows from the generating units are generally evaluated at a regional portfolio level with cash flows generated from the customer supply and risk management activities, including cash flows from related intangible assets and liabilities on the balance sheet. in certain cases, generating assets may be evaluated on an individual basis where those assets are contracted on a long-term basis with a third party and operations are independent of other generating assets (typically contracted renewables). for such assets the financial viability of the third party, including the impact of bankruptcy on the contract, may be a significant assumption in the assessment.
on a quarterly basis, generation assesses its long-lived assets or asset groups for indicators of impairment. if indicators are present for a long-lived asset or asset group, a comparison of the undiscounted expected future cash flows to the carrying value is performed. when the undiscounted cash flow analysis indicates the carrying value of a long-lived asset or asset group is not recoverable, the amount of the impairment loss is determined by measuring the excess of the carrying amount of the long-lived asset or asset group over its fair value. the fair value of the long-lived asset or asset group is dependent upon a market participant's view of the exit price of the assets. this includes significant assumptions of the estimated future cash flows generated by the assets and market discount rates. events and circumstances often do not occur as expected resulting in differences between prospective financial information and actual results, which may be material. the determination of fair value is driven by both internal assumptions that include significant unobservable inputs (level 3) such as revenue and generation forecasts, projected capital, and maintenance expenditures and discount rates, as well as information from various public, financial and industry sources.
see note 12 - asset impairments of the combined notes to consolidated financial statements for a discussion of asset impairment assessments.
depreciable lives of property, plant, and equipment (all registrants)
the registrants have significant investments in electric generation assets and electric and natural gas transmission and distribution assets. these assets are generally depreciated on a straight-line basis, using the group, composite, or unitary methods of depreciation. the group approach is typically for groups of similar assets that have approximately the same useful lives and the composite approach is used for heterogeneous assets that have different lives. under both methods, a reporting entity depreciates the assets over the average life of the assets in the group. the estimation of asset useful lives requires management judgment, supported by formal depreciation studies of historical asset retirement experience. depreciation studies are generally completed every five years, or more frequently if required by a rate regulator or if an event, regulatory action, or change in retirement patterns indicate an update is necessary.
for the utility registrants, depreciation studies generally serve as the basis for amounts allowed in customer rates for recovery of depreciation costs. generally, the utility registrants adjust their depreciation rates for financial reporting purposes concurrent with adjustments to depreciation rates reflected in customer rates, unless the depreciation rates reflected in customer rates do not align with management's judgment as to an appropriate estimated useful life or have not been updated on a timely basis. depreciation expense and customer rates for comed, bge, pepco, dpl, and ace include an estimate of the future costs of dismantling and removing plant from service upon retirement. see note 3 - regulatory matters of the combined notes to the consolidated financial statements for information regarding regulatory liabilities and assets recorded by comed, bge, pepco, dpl, and ace related to removal costs.
peco's removal costs are capitalized to accumulated depreciation when incurred, and recorded to depreciation expense over the life of the new asset constructed consistent with peco's regulatory recovery method. estimates for such removal costs are also evaluated in the periodic depreciation studies.
at generation, along with depreciation study results, management considers expected future energy market conditions and generation plant operating costs and capital investment requirements in determining the estimated service lives of its generating facilities and reassesses the reasonableness of estimated useful lives whenever events or changes in circumstances warrant. when a determination has been made that an asset will be retired before the end of its current estimated useful life, depreciation provisions will be accelerated to reflect the shortened estimated useful life, which could have a material unfavorable impact on exelon's and generation's future results of operations. see note 7 - early plant retirements of the combined notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.
changes in estimated useful lives of electric generation assets and of electric and natural gas transmission and distribution assets could have a significant impact on the registrants' future results of operations. see note 1 - significant accounting policies of the combined notes to consolidated financial statements for information regarding depreciation and estimated service lives of the property, plant, and equipment of the registrants.
defined benefit pension and other postretirement employee benefits (all registrants)
exelon sponsors defined benefit pension plans and opeb plans for substantially all current employees. the measurement of the plan obligations and costs of providing benefits involves various factors, including the development of valuation assumptions and inputs and accounting policy elections. when developing the required assumptions, exelon considers historical information as well as future expectations. the measurement of benefit obligations and costs is affected by several assumptions including the discount rate, the long-term expected rate of return on plan assets, the anticipated rate of increase of health care costs, exelon's contributions, the rate of compensation increases, and the long-term expected investment rate credited to employees of certain plans, among others. the assumptions are updated annually and upon any interim remeasurement of the plan obligations.
expected rate of return on plan assets. in determining the eroa, exelon considers historical economic indicators (including inflation and gdp growth) that impact asset returns, as well as expectation regarding future long-term capital market performance, weighted by exelon's target asset class allocations. exelon calculates the amount of expected return on pension and opeb plan assets by multiplying the eroa by the mrv of plan assets at the beginning of the year, taking into consideration anticipated contributions and benefit payments to be made during the year. in determining mrv, the authoritative guidance for pensions and postretirement benefits allows the use of either fair value or a calculated value that recognizes changes in fair value in a systematic and rational manner over not more than five years. for the majority of pension plan assets, exelon uses a calculated value that adjusts for 20% of the difference between fair value and expected mrv of plan assets. use of this calculated value approach enables less volatile expected asset returns to be recognized as a component of pension cost from year to year. for opeb plan assets and certain pension plan assets, exelon uses fair value to calculate the mrv.
discount rate. the discount rates are determined by developing a spot rate curve based on the yield to maturity of a universe of high-quality non-callable (or callable with make whole provisions) bonds with similar maturities to the related pension and opeb obligations. the spot rates are used to discount the estimated future benefit distribution amounts under the pension and opeb plans. the discount rate is the single level rate that produces the same result as the spot rate curve. exelon utilizes an analytical tool developed by its actuaries to determine the discount rates.
mortality. the mortality assumption is composed of a base table that represents the current expectation of life expectancy of the population adjusted by an improvement scale that attempts to anticipate future improvements in life expectancy. exelon's mortality assumption utilizes the soa 2019 base table (pri-2012) and mp-2020 improvement scale adjusted to use proxy ssa ultimate improvement rates.
sensitivity to changes in key assumptions. the following tables illustrate the effects of changing certain of the actuarial assumptions discussed above, while holding all other assumptions constant (dollars in millions):
actual assumption actuarial assumption                                          pension                    opeb         change in                   pension                   opeb                    total assumption change in 2020 cost:
change in benefit obligation at december 31, 2020:
(a)in general, the discount rate will have a larger impact on the pension and opeb cost and obligation as the rate moves closer to 0%. therefore, the discount rate sensitivities above cannot necessarily be extrapolated for larger increases or decreases in the discount rate. additionally, exelon utilizes a liability-driven investment strategy for its pension asset portfolio. the sensitivities shown above do not reflect the offsetting impact that changes in discount rates may have on pension asset returns.
see note 1 - significant accounting policies and note 15 - retirement benefits of the combined notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding the accounting for the defined benefit pension plans and opeb plans.
for their regulated electric and gas operations, exelon and the utility registrants reflect the effects of cost-based rate regulation in their financial statements, which is required for entities with regulated operations that meet the following criteria: (1) rates are established or approved by a third-party regulator; (2) rates are designed to recover the entities' cost of providing services or products; and (3) a reasonable expectation that rates designed to recover costs can be charged to and collected from customers. regulatory assets represent incurred costs that have been deferred because of their probable future recovery from customers through regulated rates. regulatory liabilities represent (1) revenue or gains that have been deferred because it is probable such amounts will be returned to customers through future regulated rates; or (2) billings in advance of expenditures for approved regulatory programs. if it is concluded in a future period that a separable portion of operations no longer meets the criteria discussed above, exelon and the utility registrants would be required to eliminate any associated regulatory assets and liabilities and the impact, which could be material, would be recognized in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income.
the following table illustrates the gains (losses) that could result from the elimination of regulatory assets and liabilities and charges against oci (dollars in millions before taxes) related to deferred costs associated with exelon's pension and opeb plans that are recorded as regulatory assets in exelon's consolidated balance sheets:
(a)exelon's charge against oci (before taxes) consists of up to $2.7 billion, $481 million, $193 million, $387 million, $188 million, and $91 million related to comed's, bge's, phi's, pepco's, dpl's, and ace's respective portions of the deferred costs associated with exelon's pension and opeb plans. exelon also has a net regulatory liability of $(36) million (before taxes) related to peco's portion of the deferred costs associated with exelon's opeb plans that would result in an increase in oci if reversed.
see note 3 - regulatory matters of the combined notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding regulatory matters, including the regulatory assets and liabilities tables of exelon and the utility registrants.
for each regulatory jurisdiction in which they conduct business, exelon and the utility registrants assess whether the regulatory assets and liabilities continue to meet the criteria for probable future recovery or refund at each balance sheet date and when regulatory events occur. this assessment includes consideration of recent rate orders, historical regulatory treatment for similar costs in each registrant's jurisdictions, and factors such as changes in applicable regulatory and political environments. if the assessments and estimates made by exelon and the utility registrants for regulatory assets and regulatory liabilities are ultimately different than actual regulatory outcomes, the impact in their consolidated financial statements could be material.

the registrants use derivative instruments to manage commodity price risk, foreign currency exchange risk, and interest rate risk related to ongoing business operations. the registrants' derivative activities are in accordance with exelon's risk management policy (rmp). see note 16 - derivative financial instruments of the combined notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information.
the registrants account for derivative financial instruments under the applicable authoritative guidance. determining whether a contract qualifies as a derivative requires that management exercise significant judgment, including assessing market liquidity as well as determining whether a contract has one or more underlyings and one or more notional quantities. changes in management's assessment of contracts and the liquidity of their markets, and changes in authoritative guidance, could result in previously excluded contracts becoming in scope of new authoritative guidance.
all derivatives are recognized on the balance sheet at their fair value, except for certain derivatives that qualify for, and are elected under, npns. derivatives entered into for economic hedging and for proprietary trading purposes are recorded at fair value through earnings. for economic hedges that are not designated for hedge accounting for the utility registrants, changes in the fair value each period are generally recorded with a corresponding offsetting regulatory asset or liability given likelihood of recovering the associated costs through customer rates.
npns. as part of generation's energy marketing business, generation enters into contracts to buy and sell energy to meet the requirements of its customers. these contracts include short-term and long-term commitments to purchase and sell energy and energy-related products in the retail and wholesale markets with the intent and ability to deliver or take delivery. while some of these contracts are considered derivative financial instruments under the authoritative guidance, certain of these qualifying transactions have been designated by generation as npns transactions, which are thus not required to be recorded at fair value, but rather on an accrual basis of accounting. determining whether a contract qualifies for the npns requires judgment on whether the contract will physically deliver and requires that management ensure compliance with all of the associated qualification and documentation requirements. revenues and expenses on contracts that qualify as npns are recognized when the underlying physical transaction is completed. contracts that qualify for the npns are those for which physical delivery is probable, quantities are expected to be used or sold in the normal course of business over a reasonable period of time, and the contract is not financially settled on a net basis. the contracts that comed has entered into with suppliers as part of comed's energy procurement process, peco's full requirement contracts under the papuc-approved dsp program, most of peco's natural gas supply agreements, all of bge's full requirement contracts and natural gas supply agreements that are derivatives, and certain pepco, dpl, and ace full requirement contracts qualify for and are accounted for under the npns.
commodity contracts. identification of a commodity contract as an economic hedge requires generation to determine that the contract is in accordance with the rmp. generation reassesses its economic hedges on a regular basis to determine if they continue to be within the guidelines of the rmp.
as a part of the authoritative guidance, the registrants make estimates and assumptions concerning future commodity prices, load requirements, interest rates, the timing of future transactions and their probable cash flows, the fair value of contracts and the expected changes in the fair value in deciding whether or not to enter into derivative transactions, and in determining the initial accounting treatment for derivative transactions. under the authoritative guidance for fair value measurements, the registrants categorize these derivatives under a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value.
derivative contracts are traded in both exchange-based and non-exchange-based markets. exchange-based derivatives that are valued using unadjusted quoted prices in active markets are generally categorized in level 1 in the fair value hierarchy.
certain derivatives' pricing is verified using indicative price quotations available through brokers or over-the-counter, on-line exchanges. the price quotations reflect the average of the bid-ask mid-point from markets that the registrants believe provide the most liquid market for the commodity. the price quotations are reviewed and corroborated to ensure the prices are observable and representative of an orderly transaction between market participants. the registrant's derivatives are traded predominately at liquid trading points. the remaining derivative contracts are valued using models that consider inputs such as contract terms, including maturity, and market parameters, and assumptions of the future prices of energy, interest rates, volatility, credit worthiness, and credit spread. for derivatives that trade in liquid markets, such as generic forwards, swaps, and options, the model inputs are generally observable. such instruments are categorized in level 2.
for derivatives that trade in less liquid markets with limited pricing information, the model inputs generally would include both observable and unobservable inputs and are categorized in level 3.
the registrants consider nonperformance risk, including credit risk in the valuation of derivative contracts, including both historical and current market data in its assessment of nonperformance risk, including credit risk. the impacts of nonperformance and credit risk to date have generally not been material to the financial statements.
see item 7a. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk and note 18 - fair value of financial assets and liabilities and note 16 - derivative financial instruments of the combined notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding the registrants' derivative instruments.
significant management judgment is required in determining the registrants' provisions for income taxes, primarily due to the uncertainty related to tax positions taken, as well as deferred tax assets and liabilities and valuation allowances. the registrants account for uncertain income tax positions using a benefit recognition model with a two-step approach including a more-likely-than-not recognition threshold and a measurement approach based on the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. management evaluates each position based solely on the technical merits and facts and circumstances of the position, assuming the position will be examined by a taxing authority having full knowledge of all relevant information. significant judgment is required to determine whether the recognition threshold has been met and, if so, the appropriate amount of tax benefits to be recorded in the registrants' consolidated financial statements.
the registrants evaluate quarterly the probability of realizing deferred tax assets by reviewing a forecast of future taxable income and their intent and ability to implement tax planning strategies, if necessary, to realize deferred tax assets. the registrants also assess negative evidence, such as the expiration of historical operating loss or tax credit carryforwards, that could indicate the registrant's inability to realize its deferred tax assets. based on the combined assessment, the registrants record valuation allowances for deferred tax assets when it is more-likely-than-not such benefit will not be realized in future periods.
actual income taxes could vary from estimated amounts due to the future impacts of various items, including future changes in income tax laws, the registrants' forecasted financial condition and results of operations, failure to successfully implement tax planning strategies, as well as results of audits and examinations of filed tax returns by taxing authorities. see note 14 - income taxes of the combined notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information.
in the preparation of their financial statements, the registrants make judgments regarding the future outcome of contingent events and record liabilities for loss contingencies that are probable and can be reasonably estimated based upon available information. the amount recorded may differ from the actual expense incurred when the uncertainty is resolved. such difference could have a significant impact in the registrants' consolidated financial statements.
environmental costs. environmental investigation and remediation liabilities are based upon estimates with respect to the number of sites for which the registrants will be responsible, the scope and cost of work to be performed at each site, the portion of costs that will be shared with other parties, the timing of the remediation work and changes in technology, regulations, and the requirements of local governmental authorities. annual studies and/or reviews are conducted at comed, peco, bge, and dpl to determine future remediation requirements for mgp sites and estimates are adjusted accordingly. in addition, periodic reviews are performed at each of the registrants to assess the adequacy of other environmental reserves. these matters, if resolved in a manner different from the estimate, could have a significant impact in the registrants' consolidated financial statements. see note 19 - commitments and contingencies of the combined notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information.
other, including personal injury claims. the registrants are self-insured for general liability, automotive liability, workers' compensation, and personal injury claims to the extent that losses are within policy deductibles or exceed the amount of insurance maintained. the registrants have reserves for both open claims asserted and an estimate of claims incurred but not reported (ibnr). the ibnr reserve is estimated based on actuarial assumptions and analysis and is updated annually. future events, such as the number of new claims to be filed each year, the average cost of disposing of claims, as well as the numerous uncertainties surrounding litigation and possible state and national legislative measures could cause the actual costs to be higher or lower than estimated. accordingly, these claims, if resolved in a manner different from the estimate, could have a material impact in the registrants' consolidated financial statements.
revenue recognition (all registrants)
sources of revenue and determination of accounting treatment. the registrants earn revenues from various business activities including: the sale of power and energy-related products, such as natural gas, capacity, and other commodities in non-regulated markets (wholesale and retail); the sale and delivery of power and natural gas in regulated markets; and the provision of other energy-related non-regulated products and services.
the accounting treatment for revenue recognition is based on the nature of the underlying transaction and applicable authoritative guidance. the registrants primarily apply the revenue from contracts with customers, derivative and arp guidance to recognize revenue as discussed in more detail below.
revenue from contracts with customers. the registrants recognize revenues in the period in which the performance obligations within contracts with customers are satisfied, which generally occurs when power, natural gas, and other energy-related commodities are physically delivered to the customer. transactions of the registrants within the scope of revenue from contracts with customers generally include non-derivative agreements, contracts that are designated as npns, sales to utility customers under regulated service tariffs, and spot-market energy commodity sales, including settlements with isos.
the determination of generation's and the utility registrants' retail power and natural gas sales to individual customers is based on systematic readings of customer meters, generally on a monthly basis. at the end of each month, amounts of energy delivered to customers since the date of the last meter reading are estimated, and corresponding unbilled revenue is recorded. the measurement of unbilled revenue is affected by the following factors: daily customer usage measured by generation or gas throughput volume, customer usage by class, losses of energy during delivery to customers and applicable customer rates. increases or decreases in volumes delivered to the utilities' customers and favorable or unfavorable rate mix due to changes in usage patterns in customer classes in the period could be significant to the calculation of unbilled revenue. in addition, revenues may fluctuate monthly as a result of customers electing to use an alternate supplier, since unbilled commodity revenues are not recorded for these customers. changes in the timing of meter reading schedules and the number and type of customers scheduled for each meter reading date also impact the measurement of unbilled revenue; however, total operating revenues would remain materially unchanged. see note 1 - significant accounting policies of the combined notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information.
derivative revenues. the registrants record revenues and expenses using the mark-to-market method of accounting for transactions that are accounted for as derivatives. these derivative transactions primarily relate to commodity price risk management activities. mark-to-market revenues and expenses include: inception gains or losses on new transactions where the fair value is observable, unrealized gains and losses from changes in the fair value of open contracts, and realized gains and losses.
alternative revenue program accounting. certain of the utility registrants' ratemaking mechanisms qualify as arps if they (i) are established by a regulatory order and allow for automatic adjustment to future rates, (ii) provide for additional revenues (above those amounts currently reflected in the price of utility service) that are objectively determinable and probable of recovery, and (iii) allow for the collection of those additional revenues within 24 months following the end of the period in which they were recognized. for mechanisms that meet these criteria, which include the utility registrants' formula rate mechanisms and revenue decoupling mechanisms, the utility registrants adjust revenue and record an offsetting regulatory asset or liability once the condition or event allowing additional billing or refund has occurred. the arp revenues presented in the utility registrants' consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income include both: (i) the recognition of "originating" arp revenues (when the regulator-specified condition or event allowing for additional billing or refund has occurred) and (ii) an equal and offsetting reversal of the "originating" arp revenues as those amounts are reflected in the price of utility service and recognized as revenue from contracts with customers.
comed records arp revenue for its best estimate of the electric distribution, energy efficiency, distributed generation rebates, and transmission revenue impacts resulting from future changes in rates that comed believes are probable of approval by the icc and ferc in accordance with its formula rate mechanisms. bge, pepco, and dpl record arp revenue for their best estimate of the electric and natural gas distribution revenue impacts resulting from future changes in rates that they believe are probable of approval by the mdpsc and/or dcpsc in accordance with their revenue decoupling mechanisms. peco, bge, pepco, dpl, and ace record arp revenue for their best estimate of the transmission revenue impacts resulting from future changes in rates that they believe are probable of approval by ferc in accordance with their formula rate mechanisms. estimates of the current year revenue requirement are based on actual and/or forecasted costs and investments in rate base for the period and the rates of return on common equity and associated regulatory capital structure allowed under the applicable tariff. the estimated reconciliation can be affected by, among other things, variances in costs incurred, investments made, allowed roe, and actions by regulators or courts.
see note 3 - regulatory matters of the combined notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information.
allowance for credit losses on customer accounts receivable (utility registrants)
utility registrants estimate the allowance for credit losses on customer receivables by applying loss rates developed specifically for each company based on historical loss experience, current conditions, and forward-looking risk factors to the outstanding receivable balance by customer risk segment. risk segments represent a group of customers with similar forward-looking credit quality indicators and risk factors that are comprised based on various attributes, including delinquency of their balances and payment history and represent expected, future customer behavior. loss rates applied to the accounts receivable balances are based on a historical average of charge-offs as a percentage of accounts receivable in each risk segment. the utility registrants' customer accounts are generally considered delinquent if the amount billed is not received by the time the next bill is issued, which normally occurs on a monthly basis. utility registrants' customer accounts are written off consistent with approved regulatory requirements. utility registrants' allowances for credit losses will continue to be affected by changes in volume, prices, and economic conditions as well as changes in icc, papuc, mdpsc, dcpsc, dpsc, and njbpu regulations.
generation results of operations by registrant results of operations-generation generation's results of operations includes discussion of rnf, which is a financial measure not defined under gaap and may not be comparable to other companies' presentations or deemed more useful than the gaap information provided elsewhere in this report. the codms for exelon and generation evaluate the performance of generation's electric business activities and allocate resources based on rnf. generation believes that rnf is a useful measure because it provides information that can be used to evaluate its operational performance.

revenues net of purchased power and fuel expense. the basis for generation's reportable segments is the integrated management of its electricity business that is located in different geographic regions, and largely representative of the footprints of iso/rto and/or nerc regions, which utilize multiple supply sources to provide electricity through various distribution channels (wholesale and retail). generation's hedging strategies and risk metrics are also aligned with these same geographic regions. generation's five reportable segments are mid-atlantic, midwest, new york, ercot, and other power regions. see note 5 - segment information of the combined notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information on these reportable segments.
the following business activities are not allocated to a region and are reported under other: natural gas, as well as other miscellaneous business activities that are not significant to overall operating revenues or results of operations. further, the following activities are not allocated to a region and are reported in other: accelerated nuclear fuel amortization associated with nuclear decommissioning; and other miscellaneous revenues.
generation evaluates the operating performance of electric business activities using the measure of rnf. operating revenues include all sales to third parties and affiliated sales to the utility registrants. purchased power costs include all costs associated with the procurement and supply of electricity including capacity, energy, generation and ancillary services. fuel expense includes the fuel costs for owned generation and fuel costs associated with tolling agreements.
for the years ended december 31, 2020 compared to 2019, rnf by region were as follows. see note 5 - segment information of the combined notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on purchase power and fuel expense for generation's reportable segments.

year ended december 31, 2020 compared to year ended december 31, 2019. net income decreased by $250 million primarily due to payments that comed made under the deferred prosecution agreement, an impairment charge resulting from acquisition of transmission assets, and lower allowed electric distribution roe due to a decrease in treasury rates, partially offset by higher electric distribution formula rate earnings (reflecting the impacts of higher rate base). see note 19 - commitments and contingencies of the combined notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information related to the deferred prosecution agreement.
the changes in operating revenues consisted of the following:
revenue decoupling. the demand for electricity is affected by weather and customer usage. operating revenues are not impacted by abnormal weather, usage per customer, or number of customers as a result of revenue decoupling mechanisms implemented pursuant to feja.
comed energy efficiency revenue. feja provides for a performance-based formula rate, which requires an annual reconciliation of the revenue requirement in effect to the actual costs that the icc determines are prudently and reasonably incurred in a given year. under feja, energy efficiency revenue varies from year to year based upon fluctuations in the underlying costs, investments being recovered, and allowed roe. energy efficiency revenue increased for the year ended december 31, 2020, as compared to the same period in 2019, primarily due to increased regulatory asset amortization which is fully recoverable. see depreciation and amortization expense discussions below and note 3 - regulatory matters of the combined notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information.
distribution revenue. eima and feja provide for a performance-based formula rate, which requires an annual reconciliation of the revenue requirement in effect to the actual costs that the icc determines are prudently and reasonably incurred in a given year. electric distribution revenue varies from year to year based upon fluctuations in the underlying costs (e.g., severe weather and storm restoration), investments being recovered, and allowed roe. during the year ended december 31, 2020, as compared to the same period in 2019, electric distribution revenue increased due to the impact of higher rate base and higher fully recoverable costs, offset by lower allowed roe due to a decrease in treasury rates. see note 3 - regulatory matters of the combined notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information.
transmission revenue. under a ferc-approved formula, transmission revenue varies from year to year based upon fluctuations in the underlying costs, capital investments being recovered, and the highest daily peak load, which is updated annually in january based on the prior calendar year. generally, increases/decreases in the highest daily peak load will result in higher/lower transmission revenue. during the year ended december 31, 2020, as compared to the same period in 2019, transmission revenues remained relatively consistent. see note 3 - regulatory matters of the combined notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information.
regulatory required programs represents revenues collected under approved riders to recover costs incurred for regulatory programs such as recoveries under the credit loss expense tariff, environmental costs associated with mgp sites, and costs related to electricity, zec, and rec procurement. the riders are designed to provide full and current cost recovery. the costs of these programs are included in purchased power expense, operating and maintenance expense, depreciation and amortization expense, and taxes other than income. customers have the choice to purchase electricity from competitive electric generation suppliers. customer choice programs do not impact the volume of deliveries as comed remains the distribution service provider for all customers and charges a regulated rate for distribution service, which is recorded in operating revenues. for customers that choose to purchase electric generation from competitive suppliers, comed acts as the billing agent and therefore does not record operating revenues or purchased power expense related to the electricity. for customers that choose to purchase electric generation from comed, comed is permitted to recover the electricity, zec, and rec procurement costs without mark-up and therefore records equal and offsetting amounts in operating revenues and purchased power expense related to the electricity, zecs, and recs.
see note 5 - segment information of the combined notes to consolidated financial statements for the presentation of comed's revenue disaggregation.
the increase of $57 million for the year ended december 31, 2020, as compared to the same period in 2019, in purchased power expense is offset in operating revenues as part of regulatory required programs.
comed the changes in operating and maintenance expense consisted of the following:
labor, other benefits, contracting, and materials                            7
pension and non-pension postretirement benefits expense                      5
(a)see note 19 - commitments and contingencies of the combined notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information.
(b)for the year ended december 31, 2020, the decrease primarily reflects lower storm costs as a result of the august 2020 storm costs being reclassified to a regulatory asset.
(c)for the year ended december 31, 2020, the decrease primarily reflects lower travel costs offset by an impairment charge related to acquisition of transmission assets.
(d)comed is allowed to recover from or refund to customers the difference between its annual credit loss expense and the amounts collected in rates annually through a rider mechanism.
the changes in depreciation and amortization expense consisted of the following:
(a)includes amortization of comed's energy efficiency formula rate regulatory asset and amortization related to the august 2020 storm regulatory asset.
(b)reflects ongoing capital expenditures.
interest expense, net increased $23 million for the year ended december 31, 2020, as compared to the same period in 2019, primarily due to the issuance of debt in february 2020.
effective income tax rates for the years ended december 31, 2020 and 2019, were 28.8% and 19.2%, respectively. see note 14 - income taxes of the combined notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding the components of the effective income tax rates.

year ended december 31, 2020 compared to year ended december 31, 2019. net income decreased by $81 million primarily due to unfavorable weather conditions, higher storm costs due to the june and august 2020 storms net of tax repairs, increased depreciation and amortization expense, and increased interest expense, partially offset by favorable volume and an increase in the tax repairs deduction.
the changes in operating revenues consisted of the following:
weather. the demand for electricity and natural gas is affected by weather conditions. with respect to the electric business, very warm weather in summer months and, with respect to the electric and natural gas businesses, very cold weather in winter months are referred to as "favorable weather conditions" because these weather conditions result in increased deliveries of electricity and natural gas. conversely, mild weather reduces demand. for the year ended december 31, 2020 compared to the same period in 2019, operating revenues related to weather decreased due to the impact of unfavorable weather conditions in peco's service territory.
heating and cooling degree days are quantitative indices that reflect the demand for energy needed to heat or cool a home or business. normal weather is determined based on historical average heating and cooling degree days for a 30-year period in peco's service territory. the changes in heating and cooling degree days in peco's service territory for the years ended december 31, 2020 compared to the same period in 2019 and normal weather consisted of the following:
peco for the years ended december 31,                                                             % change heating and cooling degree-days                   2020   2019                                      normal        2020 vs. 2019                  2019 vs. normal heating degree-days                        3,959                               4,307           4,437              (8.1)      %                   (10.8)       %
volume. electric volume, exclusive of the effects of weather, for the year ended december 31, 2020 compared to the same period in 2019, increased due to an increase in usage for residential customers during covid-19 further increased by customer growth. natural gas volume for the year ended december 31, 2020 compared to the same period in 2019, decreased on a net basis due to a decrease in usage for the commercial and industrial natural gas classes during covid-19.
electric retail deliveries to customers (in gwhs)                 2020                    2019                 % change 2020 vs. 2019                 weather - normal % change(b)

pricing for the year ended december 31, 2020 compared to the same period in 2019 increased primarily due to higher overall effective rates due to decreased usage across all major customer classes. additionally, the increase represents revenue from higher natural gas distribution rates.
transmission revenue. under a ferc approved formula, transmission revenue varies from year to year based upon fluctuations in the underlying costs and capital investments being recovered. peco's transmission formula rate filing was approved in the fourth quarter of 2019.
other revenue primarily includes revenue related to late payment charges. other revenues for the year ended december 31, 2020 compared to the same period in 2019, decreased as peco ceased new late fees for all customers and restored service to customers upon request who were disconnected in the last twelve months beginning march of 2020.
regulatory required programs represents revenues collected under approved riders to recover costs incurred for regulatory programs such as energy efficiency, pgc, and the gsa. the riders are designed to provide full and current cost recovery as well as a return. the costs of these programs are included in purchased power and fuel expense, operating and maintenance expense, depreciation and amortization expense, and income taxes. customers have the choice to purchase electricity and natural gas from competitive electric generation and natural gas suppliers. customer choice programs do not impact the volume of deliveries as peco remains the distribution service provider for all customers and charges a regulated rate for distribution service, which is recorded in operating revenues. for customers that choose to purchase electric generation or natural gas from competitive suppliers, peco acts as the billing agent and therefore does not record operating revenues or purchased power and fuel expense related to the electricity and/or natural gas. for customers that choose to purchase electric generation or natural gas from peco, peco is permitted to recover the electricity, natural gas, and rec procurement costs without mark-up and therefore records equal and offsetting amounts in operating revenues and purchased power and fuel expense related to the electricity, natural gas, and recs.
see note 5-segment information of the combined notes to consolidated financial statements for the presentation of peco's revenue disaggregation.
the decrease of $11 million for the year ended december 31, 2020 compared to the same period in 2019, respectively, in purchased power and fuel expense is fully offset in operating revenues as part of regulatory required programs.
peco the changes in operating and maintenance expense consisted of the following:
labor, other benefits, contracting, and materials                           23
pension and non-pension postretirement benefits expense                    (4)
(b)increased credit loss expense primarily as a result of suspending customer disconnections, partially offset by the regulatory asset recorded in 2020 related to incremental credit loss expense due to covid-19. see note 3 - regulatory matters of the combined notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information.
the changes in depreciation and amortization expense consisted of the following:
(a)depreciation and amortization expense increased primarily due to ongoing capital expenditures.
interest expense, net increased $11 million for the year ended december 31, 2020 compared to the same period in 2019, respectively, primarily due to the issuance of debt in june 2020.
effective income tax rates were (7.2)% and 11.0% for the years ended december 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. see note 14 - income taxes of the combined notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information of the change in effective income tax rates.

year ended december 31, 2020 compared to year ended december 31, 2019. net income remained relatively consistent primarily due to higher natural gas and electric distribution rates, partially offset by increased depreciation and amortization expense, increased interest expense, increased expense due to a commitment to a multi-year small business grants program, and a decrease in other revenues.
the changes in operating revenues consisted of the following:
bge revenue decoupling. the demand for electricity and natural gas is affected by weather and customer usage. however, operating revenues are not impacted by abnormal weather or usage per customer as a result of a bill stabilization adjustment (bsa) that provides for a fixed distribution charge per customer by customer class. while operating revenues are not impacted by abnormal weather or usage per customer, they are impacted by changes in the number of customers.

distribution revenue increased for the year ended december 31, 2020 compared to the same period in 2019, primarily due to the impact of higher natural gas and electric distribution rates that became effective in december 2019.
transmission revenue. under a ferc-approved formula, transmission revenue varies from year to year based upon fluctuations in the underlying costs, capital investments being recovered, and the highest daily peak load, which is updated annually in january based on the prior calendar year. generally, increases/decreases in the highest daily peak load will result in higher/lower transmission revenue. transmission revenue decreased for the year ended december 31, 2020 compared to the same period in 2019, primarily due to the settlement agreement of transmission-related income tax regulatory liabilities, partially offset by higher fully recoverable costs. see note 3 - regulatory matters of the combined notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information.
other revenue includes revenue related to late payment charges, mutual assistance, off-system sales, and service application fees. other revenue decreased for the year ended december 31, 2020 compared to the same period in 2019, as bge temporarily suspended customer disconnections for non-payment beginning march of 2020 and temporarily ceased new late fees for all customers and restored service to customers upon request who were disconnected in the last twelve months.
regulatory required programs represent revenues collected under approved riders to recover costs incurred for regulatory programs such as conservation, demand response, stride, and the polr mechanism. the riders are designed to provide full and current cost recovery, as well as a return in certain instances. the costs of these programs are included in purchased power and fuel expense, operating and maintenance expense, depreciation and amortization expense, and taxes other than income taxes. customers have the choice to purchase electricity and natural gas from competitive electric generation and natural gas suppliers. customer choice programs do not impact the volume of deliveries as bge remains the distribution service provider for all customers and charges a regulated rate for distribution service, which is recorded in operating revenues. for customers that choose to purchase electric generation or natural gas from competitive suppliers, bge acts as the billing agent and therefore does not record operating revenues or purchased power and fuel expense related to the electricity and/or natural gas. for customers that choose to purchase electric generation or natural gas from bge, bge is permitted to recover the electricity and natural gas procurement costs from customers and therefore records the amounts related to the electricity and/or natural gas in operating revenues and purchased power and fuel expense. bge recovers electricity and natural gas procurement costs from customers with a slight mark-up.

pepco distribution revenue increased for the year ended december 31, 2020 compared to the same period in 2019, primarily due to higher electric distribution rates in maryland that became effective in august 2019 and customer growth in the district of columbia.
transmission revenue. under a ferc-approved formula, transmission revenue varies from year to year based upon fluctuations in the underlying costs, capital investments being recovered, and the highest daily peak load, which is updated annually in january based on the prior calendar year. generally, increases/decreases in the highest daily peak load will result in higher/lower transmission revenue. transmission revenue decreased for the year ended december 31, 2020 compared to the same period in 2019 primary due to the settlement agreement of transmission-related income tax regulatory liabilities. see note 3 - regulatory matters of the combined notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information.
other revenue includes rental revenue, revenue related to late payment charges, mutual assistance revenues, and recoveries of other taxes. other revenue decreased for the year ended december 31, 2020 compared to the same period in 2019, as pepco temporarily suspended customer disconnections for non-payment beginning march of 2020 and temporarily ceased new late fees for all customers and restored services to customers upon request who were disconnected in the last twelve months.
regulatory required programs represent revenues collected under approved riders to recover costs incurred for regulatory programs such as energy efficiency programs, dc plug, and sos procurement and administrative costs. the riders are designed to provide full and current cost recovery as well as a return in certain instances. the costs of these programs are included in purchased power expense, operating and maintenance expense, depreciation and amortization expense, and taxes other than income taxes. customers have the choice to purchase electricity from competitive electric generation suppliers. customer choice programs do not impact the volume of deliveries, as pepco remains the distribution service provider for all customers and charges a regulated rate for distribution service, which is recorded in operating revenues. for customers that choose to purchase electric generation from competitive suppliers, pepco acts as the billing agent and therefore does not record operating revenues or purchased power expense related to the electricity. for customers that choose to purchase electric generation from pepco, pepco is permitted to recover the electricity and rec procurement costs from customers and therefore records the amounts related to the electricity and recs in operating revenues and purchased power expense. pepco recovers electricity and rec procurement costs from customers with a slight mark-up.
see note 5 - segment information of the combined notes to consolidated financial statements for the presentation of pepco's revenue disaggregation.
the decrease of $63 million for the year ended december 31, 2020 compared to the same period in 2019, in purchased power expense is fully offset in operating revenues as part of regulatory required programs.
pepco the changes in operating and maintenance expense consisted of the following:
(decrease) increase change in environmental liabilities                                      $(22)

labor, other benefits, contracting, and materials                           15
(a)increased credit loss expense primarily as a result of suspending customer disconnections, partially offset by the regulatory asset recorded in 2020 related to incremental credit loss expense due to covid-19. see note 3 - regulatory matters of the combined notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information.
the changes in depreciation and amortization expense consisted of the following:
(a)depreciation and amortization increased primarily due to ongoing capital expenditures.
taxes other than income decreased for the year ended december 31, 2020 compared to the same period in 2019, primarily due to lower taxes as part of regulatory required programs that are fully offset within operating revenues.
interest expense, net increased for the year ended december 31, 2020 compared to the same period in 2019, primarily due to issuance of debt in june 2019, february 2020, and june 2020.
gain on sales of assets for the year ended december 31, 2020 compared to the year ended december 31, 2019 increased due the sale of land in the fourth quarter of 2020.
effective income tax rates were (2.7)% and 6.2% for the years ended december 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. the change is primarily related to the settlement agreement of ongoing transmission-related income tax regulatory liabilities. see note 3 - regulatory matters and note 14 - income taxes of the combined notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding the components of the change in effective income tax rates.

year ended december 31, 2020 compared to year ended december 31, 2019. net income decreased by $22 million primarily due to an increase in storm costs related to the august 2020 storms in delaware, an increase in credit loss expense primarily as a result of suspending customer disconnections partially offset by the regulatory asset recorded in 2020 related to incremental credit loss expense due to covid-19, unfavorable weather conditions in dpl's delaware electric service territory, and an increase in depreciation and amortization expense, partially offset by higher electric distribution rates and an increase in transmission rates (net of the impact of the settlement agreement of transmission-related income tax regulatory liabilities).
the changes in operating revenues consisted of the following:
revenue decoupling. the demand for electricity is affected by weather and customer usage. however, operating revenues from electric distribution in maryland are not impacted by abnormal weather or usage per customer as a result of a bill stabilization adjustment (bsa) that provides for a fixed distribution charge per customer by customer class. while operating revenues from electric distribution in maryland are not impacted by abnormal weather or usage per customer, they are impacted by changes in the number of customers.
weather. the demand for electricity and natural gas in delaware is affected by weather conditions. with respect to the electric business, very warm weather in summer months and, with respect to the electric and natural gas businesses, very cold weather in winter months are referred to as "favorable weather conditions" because these weather conditions result in increased deliveries of electricity and natural gas. conversely, mild weather reduces demand. during the year ended december 31, 2020 compared to the same period in 2019, operating revenues related to weather decreased primarily due to unfavorable weather conditions in dpl's delaware service territory.
dpl heating and cooling degree days are quantitative indices that reflect the demand for energy needed to heat or cool a home or business. normal weather is determined based on historical average heating and cooling degree days for a 20-year period in dpl's delaware electric service territory and a 30-year period in dpl's delaware natural gas service territory. the changes in heating and cooling degree days in dpl's delaware service territory for the year ended december 31, 2020 compared to same period in 2019 and normal weather consisted of the following:

liquidity and capital resources all results included throughout the liquidity and capital resources section are presented on a gaap basis.
the registrants' operating and capital expenditures requirements are provided by internally generated cash flows from operations, the sale of certain receivables, as well as funds from external sources in the capital markets and through bank borrowings. the registrants' businesses are capital intensive and require considerable capital resources. each of the registrants annually evaluates its financing plan, dividend practices, and credit line sizing, focusing on maintaining its investment grade ratings while meeting its cash needs to fund capital requirements, retire debt, pay dividends, fund pension and opeb obligations, and invest in new and existing ventures. a broad spectrum of financing alternatives beyond the core financing options can be used to meet its needs and fund growth including monetizing assets in the portfolio via project financing, asset sales, and the use of other financing structures (e.g., joint ventures, minority partners, etc.). each registrant's access to external financing on reasonable terms depends on its credit ratings and current overall capital market business conditions, including that of the utility industry in general. if these conditions deteriorate to the extent that the registrants no longer have access to the capital markets at reasonable terms, the registrants have access to credit facilities with aggregate bank commitments of $10.6 billion. as a result of disruptions in the commercial paper markets due to covid-19 in march of 2020, generation borrowed $1.5 billion on its revolving credit facility to refinance commercial paper. generation repaid the $1.5 billion borrowed on the revolving credit facility on april 3, 2020 using funds from short-term loans issued in march 2020, cash proceeds from the sale of certain customer accounts receivable, and borrowings from the exelon intercompany money pool. see note 6 - accounts receivable of the combined notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information on the sale of customer accounts receivable. see executive overview for additional information on covid-19. the registrants continue to utilize their credit facilities to support their commercial paper programs, provide for other short-term borrowings, and to issue letters of credit. see the "credit matters" section below for additional information. the registrants expect cash flows to be sufficient to meet operating expenses, financing costs, and capital expenditure requirements.
the registrants primarily use their capital resources, including cash, to fund capital requirements, including construction expenditures, retire debt, pay dividends, fund pension and opeb obligations, and invest in new and existing ventures. the registrants spend a significant amount of cash on capital improvements and construction projects that have a long-term return on investment. additionally, the utility registrants operate in rate-regulated environments in which the amount of new investment recovery may be delayed or limited and where such recovery takes place over an extended period of time. see note 17 - debt and credit agreements of the combined notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information of the registrants' debt and credit agreements.
despite disruptions in the financial markets due to covid-19, the registrants issued long-term debt of $5.3 billion and were able to successfully complete their planned long-term debt issuances in 2020.
nrc minimum funding requirements (exelon and generation)
nrc regulations require that licensees of nuclear generating facilities demonstrate reasonable assurance that sufficient funds will be available in certain minimum amounts to decommission the facility. these nrc minimum funding levels are typically based upon the assumption that decommissioning activities will commence after the end of the current licensed life of each unit. if a unit fails the nrc minimum funding test, then the plant's owners or parent companies would be required to take steps, such as providing financial guarantees through letters of credit or parent company guarantees or making additional cash contributions to the ndt fund to ensure sufficient funds are available. see note 10 - asset retirement obligations of the combined notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information.
if a nuclear plant were to early retire there is a risk that it will no longer meet the nrc minimum funding requirements due to the earlier commencement of decommissioning activities and a shorter time period over which the ndt funds could appreciate in value. a shortfall could require that generation address the shortfall by, among other things, obtaining a parental guarantee for generation's share of the funding assurance. however, the amount of any guarantees or other assurance will ultimately depend on the decommissioning approach, the associated level of costs, and the ndt fund investment performance going forward. within two years after shutting down a plant, generation must submit a psdar to the nrc that includes the planned option for decommissioning the site. upon retirement, dresden will have adequate funding assurance, however, due to the earlier commencement of decommissioning activities and a shorter time period over which the ndt fund investments could appreciate in value, byron may no longer meet the nrc minimum funding requirements and, as a result, the nrc may require additional financial assurance including possibly a parental guarantee from exelon. considering the different approaches to decommissioning available to generation, the most likely estimates currently anticipated could require financial assurance for radiological decommissioning at byron of up to $90 million.
upon issuance of any required financial guarantees, each site would be able to utilize the respective ndt funds for radiological decommissioning costs, which represent the majority of the total expected decommissioning costs. however, under the regulations, the nrc must approve an exemption in order for generation to utilize the ndt funds to pay for non-radiological decommissioning costs (i.e. spent fuel management and site restoration costs, if applicable). if a unit does not receive this exemption, those costs would be borne by generation without reimbursement from or access to the ndt funds. accordingly, based on current projections of the most likely decommissioning approach, it is expected that dresden would not require supplemental cash from generation, but some portion of the byron spent fuel management costs would need to be funded through supplemental cash from generation. while the ultimate amounts may vary and could be offset by reimbursement of certain spent fuel management costs under the doe settlement agreement, decommissioning for byron may require supplemental cash from generation of up to $185 million, net of taxes, over a period of 10 years after permanent shutdown.
as of december 31, 2020, exelon would not be required to post a parental guarantee for tmi unit 1 under the safstor scenario which is the planned decommissioning option as described in the tmi unit 1 psdar filed by generation with the nrc on april 5, 2019. on october 16, 2019, the nrc granted generation's exemption request to use the tmi unit 1 ndt funds for spent fuel management costs. an additional exemption request would be required to allow the funds to be spent on site restoration costs, which are not expected to be incurred in the near term.

project financing is used to help mitigate risk of specific generating assets. project financing is based upon a nonrecourse financial structure, in which project debt is paid back from the cash generated by the specific asset or portfolio of assets. borrowings under these agreements are secured by the assets and equity of each respective project. the lenders do not have recourse against exelon or generation in the event of a default. if a specific project financing entity does not maintain compliance with its specific debt financing covenants, there could be a requirement to accelerate repayment of the associated debt or other project-related borrowings earlier than the stated maturity dates. in these instances, if such repayment was not satisfied, or restructured, the lenders or security holders would generally have rights to foreclose against the project-specific assets and related collateral. the potential requirement to satisfy its associated debt or other borrowings earlier than otherwise anticipated could lead to impairments due to a higher likelihood of disposing of the respective project-specific assets significantly before the end of their useful lives. additionally, project finance has credit facilities. see note 17 - debt and credit agreements of the combined notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information on nonrecourse debt and credit facilities.
cash flows from operating activities (all registrants)
generation's cash flows from operating activities primarily result from the sale of electric energy and energy-related products and services to customers. generation's future cash flows from operating activities may be affected by future demand for and market prices of energy and its ability to continue to produce and supply power at competitive costs as well as to obtain collections from customers.
the utility registrants' cash flows from operating activities primarily result from the transmission and distribution of electricity and, in the case of peco, bge, and dpl, gas distribution services. the utility registrants' distribution services are provided to an established and diverse base of retail customers. the utility registrants' future cash flows may be affected by the economy, weather conditions, future legislative initiatives, future regulatory proceedings with respect to their rates or operations, and their ability to achieve operating cost reductions.
see note 3 - regulatory matters and note 19 - commitments and contingencies of the combined notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information of regulatory and legal proceedings and proposed legislation.

changes in the registrants' cash flows from operations were generally consistent with changes in each registrant's respective results of operations, as adjusted by changes in working capital in the normal course of business, except as discussed below. in addition, significant operating cash flow impacts for the registrants for 2020 and 2019 were as follows:
•see note 24 -supplemental financial information of the combined notes to consolidated financial statements and the registrants' consolidated statement of cash flows for additional information on non-cash operating activity.
•see note 14 -income taxes of the combined notes to consolidated financial statements and the registrants' consolidated statement of cash flows for additional information on income taxes.
•depending upon whether generation is in a net mark-to-market liability or asset position, collateral may be required to be posted with or collected from its counterparties. in addition, the collateral posting and collection requirements differ depending on whether the transactions are on an exchange or in the otc markets.
•during 2020, exelon and generation derecognized approximately $1.2 billion of accounts receivable. see note 6 - accounts receivable for additional information on the sales of customer accounts receivable.
pension and other postretirement benefits management considers various factors when making pension funding decisions, including actuarially determined minimum contribution requirements under erisa, contributions required to avoid benefit restrictions and at-risk status as defined by the pension protection act of 2006 (the act), management of the pension obligation, and regulatory implications. the act requires the attainment of certain funding levels to avoid benefit restrictions (such as an inability to pay lump sums or to accrue benefits prospectively), and at-risk status (which triggers higher minimum contribution requirements and participant notification). the projected contributions below reflect a funding strategy to make levelized annual contributions with the objective of achieving 100% funded status on an abo basis over time. this level funding strategy helps minimize volatility of future period required pension contributions. based on this funding strategy and current market conditions, which are subject to change, exelon's estimated annual qualified pension contributions will be approximately $500 million in 2021. unlike the qualified pension plans, exelon's non-qualified pension plans are not funded, given that they are not subject to statutory minimum contribution requirements.
while opeb plans are also not subject to statutory minimum contribution requirements, exelon does fund certain of its plans. for exelon's funded opeb plans, contributions generally equal accounting costs, however, exelon's management has historically considered several factors in determining the level of contributions to its opeb plans, including liabilities management, levels of benefit claims paid, and regulatory implications (amounts deemed prudent to meet regulatory expectations and best assure continued rate recovery). the amounts below include benefit payments related to unfunded plans.
the following table provides all registrants' planned contributions to the qualified pension plans, planned benefit payments to non-qualified pension plans, and planned contributions to opeb plans in 2021:
generation                      196                                         27                           24
to the extent interest rates decline significantly or the pension and opeb plans earn less than the expected asset returns, annual pension contribution requirements in future years could increase. conversely, to the extent interest rates increase significantly or the pension and opeb plans earn greater than the expected asset returns, annual pension and opeb contribution requirements in future years could decrease. additionally, expected contributions could change if exelon changes its pension or opeb funding strategy.

significant investing cash flow impacts for the registrants for 2020 and 2019 were as follows:
•variances in capital expenditures are primarily due to the timing of cash expenditures for capital projects. refer below for additional information on projected capital expenditure spending.
•changes in intercompany money pool are driven by short-term borrowing needs. refer to more information regarding the intercompany money pool below.
capital expenditure spending the registrants most recent estimates of capital expenditures for plant additions and improvements for 2021 are approximately as follows:
generation                          n/a                           n/a                  n/a                1,150
projected capital expenditures and other investments are subject to periodic review and revision to reflect changes in economic conditions and other factors.
generation approximately 48% of projected 2021 capital expenditures at generation are for the acquisition of nuclear fuel, with the remaining amounts primarily reflecting additions and upgrades to existing generation facilities (including material condition improvements during nuclear refueling outages). generation anticipates that it will fund capital expenditures with internally generated funds and borrowings.
utility registrants projected 2021 capital expenditures at the utility registrants are for continuing projects to maintain and improve operations, including enhancing reliability and adding capacity to the transmission and distribution systems such as the utility registrants' construction commitments under pjm's rtep.
the utility registrants as transmission owners are subject to nerc compliance requirements. nerc provides guidance to transmission owners regarding assessments of transmission lines. the results of these assessments could require the utility registrants to incur incremental capital or operating and maintenance expenditures to ensure their transmission lines meet nerc standards. in 2010, nerc provided guidance to transmission owners that recommended the utility registrants perform assessments of their transmission lines. comed, peco, and bge submitted their final bi-annual reports to nerc in january 2014. peco will be incurring incremental capital expenditures associated with this guidance following the completion of the assessments. specific projects and expenditures are identified as the assessments are completed. peco's forecasted 2021 capital expenditures above reflect capital spending for remediation to be completed through 2021. comed, bge, pepco, dpl, and ace are complete with their assessments and do not expect capital expenditures related to this guidance in 2021.
the utility registrants anticipate that they will fund their capital expenditures with a combination of internally generated funds and borrowings and additional capital contributions from parent.

from time to time and as market conditions warrant, the registrants may engage in long-term debt retirements via tender offers, open market repurchases or other viable options to reduce debt on their respective balance sheets.
dividends quarterly dividends declared by the exelon board of directors during the year ended december 31, 2020 and for the first quarter of 2021 were as follows:
period                     declaration date        shareholder of record date       dividend payable date             cash per share(a)
(a)exelon's board of directors approved an updated dividend policy for 2021. the 2021 quarterly dividend will remain the same as the 2020 dividend of $0.3825 per share.
the registrants fund liquidity needs for capital investment, working capital, energy hedging, and other financial commitments through cash flows from continuing operations, public debt offerings, commercial paper markets, and large, diversified credit facilities. the credit facilities include $10.6 billion in aggregate total commitments of which $7.7 billion was available to support additional commercial paper as of december 31, 2020, and of which no financial institution has more than 7% of the aggregate commitments for the registrants. the registrants had access to the commercial paper markets and had availability under their revolving credit facilities during 2020 to fund their short-term liquidity needs, when necessary. the registrants routinely review the sufficiency of their liquidity position, including appropriate sizing of credit facility commitments, by performing various stress test scenarios, such as commodity price movements, increases in margin-related transactions, changes in hedging levels, and the impacts of hypothetical credit downgrades. the registrants have continued to closely monitor events in the financial markets and the financial institutions associated with the credit facilities, including monitoring credit ratings and outlooks, credit default swap levels, capital raising, and merger activity. see part i. item 1a. risk factors for additional information regarding the effects of uncertainty in the capital and credit markets.
the registrants believe their cash flow from operating activities, access to credit markets, and their credit facilities provide sufficient liquidity. if generation lost its investment grade credit rating as of december 31, 2020, it would have been required to provide incremental collateral of approximately $1.5 billion to meet collateral obligations for derivatives, non-derivatives, normal purchases and normal sales contracts, and applicable payables and receivables, net of the contractual right of offset under master netting agreements, which is well within the $4.7 billion of available credit capacity of its revolver.
the following table presents the incremental collateral that each utility registrant would have been required to provide in the event each utility registrant lost its investment grade credit rating at december 31, 2020 and available credit facility capacity prior to any incremental collateral at december 31, 2020:

(a)represents incremental collateral related to natural gas procurement contracts.
exelon credit facilities exelon corporate, comed, and bge meet their short-term liquidity requirements primarily through the issuance of commercial paper. generation and peco meet their short-term liquidity requirements primarily through the issuance of commercial paper and borrowings from the exelon intercompany money pool. pepco, dpl, and ace meet their short-term liquidity requirements primarily through the issuance of commercial paper and borrowings from the phi intercompany money pool. phi corporate meets its short-term liquidity requirements primarily through the issuance of short-term notes and the exelon intercompany money pool. the registrants may use their respective credit facilities for general corporate purposes, including meeting short-term funding requirements and the issuance of letters of credit.
see note 17 - debt and credit agreements of the combined notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information of the registrants' credit facilities and short term borrowing activity.
capital structure at december 31, 2020, the capital structures of the registrants consisted of the following:
exelon                 generation                comed                 peco                  bge                  phi                pepco                  dpl                  ace long-term debt                                 50    %                   27     %               43   %               44   %               47   %               40   %               49   %               48   %               47   %
(a)includes approximately $390 million, $205 million, and $184 million owed to unconsolidated affiliates of exelon, comed, and peco respectively. these special purpose entities were created for the sole purposes of issuing mandatorily redeemable trust preferred securities of comed and peco. see note 23 - variable interest entities of the combined notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding the authoritative guidance for vies.
security ratings the registrants' access to the capital markets, including the commercial paper market, and their respective financing costs in those markets, may depend on the securities ratings of the entity that is accessing the capital markets.
the registrants' borrowings are not subject to default or prepayment as a result of a downgrading of securities, although such a downgrading of a registrant's securities could increase fees and interest charges under that registrant's credit agreements.
as part of the normal course of business, the registrants enter into contracts that contain express provisions or otherwise permit the registrants and their counterparties to demand adequate assurance of future performance when there are reasonable grounds for doing so. in accordance with the contracts and applicable contracts law, if the registrants are downgraded by a credit rating agency, it is possible that a counterparty would attempt to rely on such a downgrade as a basis for making a demand for adequate assurance of future performance, which could include the posting of collateral. see note 16 - derivative financial instruments of the combined notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information on collateral provisions.
the credit ratings for exelon corporate, peco, bge, phi, pepco, dpl, and ace did not change for the twelve months ended december 31, 2020. on november 4, 2020, s&p revised its assessment of the strategic relationship between exelon and generation and subsequently lowered generation's senior unsecured debt rating to 'bbb' from 'bbb+'. on july 21, 2020, s&p lowered comed's long-term issuer credit rating from 'a-' to a 'bbb+'. s&p also affirmed the current 'a' rating on comed's senior secured debt and 'a-2' short-term rating, which influences long and short-term borrowing cost.
intercompany money pool to provide an additional short-term borrowing option that will generally be more favorable to the borrowing participants than the cost of external financing, both exelon and phi operate an intercompany money pool. maximum amounts contributed to and borrowed from the money pool by participant and the net contribution or borrowing as of december 31, 2020, are presented in the following tables:
for the year ended december 31, 2020                as of december 31, 2020
generation                                     254                               (980)                                     (285)
for the year ended december 31, 2020                           as of december 31, 2020
shelf registration statements exelon, generation, and the utility registrants have a currently effective combined shelf registration statement unlimited in amount, filed with the sec, that will expire in august 2022. the ability of each registrant to sell securities off the shelf registration statement or to access the private placement markets will depend on a number of factors at the time of the proposed sale, including other required regulatory approvals, as applicable, the current financial condition of the registrant, its securities ratings and market conditions.
as of december 31, 2020
(a)generation currently has blanket financing authority it received from ferc in connection with its market-based rate authority.
(b)as of december 31, 2020, comed had $893 million in new money long-term debt financing authority from the icc with an expiration date of february 1, 2023. on january 20, 2021, comed received $350 million of long-term debt refinancing authority from the icc approved with an effective date of february 1, 2021 and an expiration date of february 1, 2024.

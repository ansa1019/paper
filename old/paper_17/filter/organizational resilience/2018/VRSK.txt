item 1a.   risk factors you should carefully consider the following risks and all of the other information set forth in this annual report on form 10-k before deciding to invest in any of our securities. if any of the following risks actually occurs, our business, financial condition or results of operations would likely suffer. in such case, the trading price of our securities, including our common stock, could decline due to any of these risks, and you may lose all or part of your investment.
we could lose our access to data from external sources, which could prevent us from providing our solutions.
we depend upon data from external sources, including data received from customers and various government, and public record services, for information used in our databases. in general, we do not own the information in these databases, and the participating organizations could discontinue contributing information to the databases. our data sources could withdraw or increase the price for their data for a variety of reasons, and we could also become subject to legislative, judicial, or contractual restrictions on the use of such data, in particular if such data is not collected by the third parties in a way that allows us to legally use and/or process the data. in addition, some of our customers are significant stockholders of our company. specifically, a portion of common stock is owned by insurers who are also our customers. if our customers' percentage of ownership of our common stock decreases in the future, there can be no assurance that our customers will continue to provide data to the same extent or on the same terms. if a substantial number of data sources, or certain key sources, were to withdraw or be unable to provide their data, or if we were to lose access to data due to government regulation or if the collection of data became uneconomical, our ability to provide solutions to our customers could be impacted, which could materially adversely affect our business, reputation, financial condition, operating results, and cash flows.
agreements with our data suppliers are short-term agreements. some suppliers are also competitors, which may make us vulnerable to unpredictable price increases and may cause some suppliers not to renew certain agreements. our competitors could also enter into exclusive contracts with our data sources. if our competitors enter into such exclusive contracts, we may be precluded from receiving certain data from these suppliers or restricted in our use of such data, which would give our competitors an advantage. such a termination or exclusive contracts could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, and operating results if we were unable to arrange for substitute data sources.
fraudulent or unpermitted data access and other cyber-security or privacy breaches may negatively impact our business and harm our reputation.
security breaches in our facilities, computer networks, and databases may cause harm to our business and reputation and result in a loss of customers. many of our solutions involve the storage and transmission of proprietary information and sensitive or confidential data. as with other global companies, our systems are regularly subject to cyber-attacks, cyber-threats, physical break-ins, computer viruses, attacks by hackers and similar disruptive problems. as cyber-threats continue to evolve, we are required to expend significant additional resources to continue to modify and enhance our protective measures and to investigate and remediate any information security vulnerabilities and incidents. despite efforts to ensure the integrity of our systems and implement controls, processes, policies and other protective measures, we may not be able to anticipate or detect all security breaches, nor may we be able to implement guaranteed preventive measures against such security breaches. cyber-threats are rapidly evolving and we may not be able to anticipate, prevent or detect all such attacks and could be held liable for any security breach or loss. although we may incur significant costs in protecting against or remediating cyberattacks or other cyber-incidents, no cyber-attack or other cyber-incident has, to our knowledge, had a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations to date.
third-party contractors, including cloud-based service providers, also may experience security breaches involving the storage and transmission of proprietary information. if users gain improper access to our databases, they may be able to steal, publish, delete or modify confidential third-party information that is stored or transmitted on our networks. our business relies on the secure processing, transmission, storage and retrieval of confidential, proprietary and other information in our computer and data management systems and networks, and in the computer and data management systems and networks of third parties. in addition, to access our network, products and services, our customers and other third parties may use personal mobile devices or computing devices that are outside of our network environment and are subject to their own cybersecurity risks.
in addition, customers', employees' or other's misuse of and/or gaining unpermitted access to or failure to properly secure our information or services could cause harm to our business and reputation and result in loss of customers. any such misappropriation and/or misuse of or failure to properly secure our information could result in us, among other things, being in breach of certain data protection and related legislation.
•   deterring customers from using our solutions;
•   increasing operating expenses to correct problems caused by the breach;
•   affecting our ability to meet customers' expectations; and/or
incidents in which consumer data has been fraudulently or improperly acquired or viewed, or any other security or privacy breaches, may occur and could go undetected. the number of potentially affected consumers identified by any future incidents is obviously unknown. any such incident could materially adversely affect our business, reputation, financial condition, operating results and cash flows. in addition, media or other reports of perceived security vulnerabilities to our systems or those of our third-party suppliers, even if no breach has been attempted or occurred, could also adversely impact our reputation and materially impact our business.
we derive a substantial portion of our revenues from u.s. p&c primary insurers. if there is a downturn in the u.s. insurance industry or that industry does not continue to accept our solutions, our revenues will decline.
revenues derived from solutions we provide to u.s. p&c primary insurers account for a substantial portion of our total revenues. during the year ended december 31, 2018, approximately 47% of our revenue was derived from solutions provided to u.s. p&c primary insurers. also, invoices for certain of our solutions are linked in part to premiums in the u.s. p&c insurance market, which may rise or fall in any given year due to loss experience and capital capacity and other factors in the insurance industry that are beyond our control. in addition, our revenues will decline if the insurance industry does not continue to accept our solutions.
factors that might affect the acceptance of these solutions by p&c primary insurers include the following:
•   changes in the business analytics industry,
•   changes in technology,
•   saturation of market demand,
•   loss of key customers,
•   failure to execute our customer-focused selling approach.
a downturn in the insurance industry, pricing pressure or lower acceptance of our solutions by the insurance industry could result in a decline in revenues from that industry and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
acquisitions could result in operating difficulties, dilution and other harmful consequences, and we may not be successful in achieving growth through acquisitions.
our long-term business strategy includes growth through acquisitions. future acquisitions may not be completed on acceptable terms and acquired assets, data or businesses may not be successfully integrated into our operations, and we may ultimately divest unsuccessful investments. any acquisitions or investments will be accompanied by the risks commonly encountered in the acquisitions of businesses. such risks include, among other things:
•   paying more than fair market value for an acquired company or assets,
•   failing to integrate the operations and personnel of the acquired businesses in an efficient, timely manner,
•   assuming potential liabilities of an acquired company,
•   managing the potential disruption to our ongoing business,
•   distracting management focus from our core businesses,
•   failing to retain management at the acquired company,
•   difficulty in acquiring suitable businesses, including challenges in predicting the value an acquisition will ultimately contribute to our business,
•   possibility of overpaying for acquisitions, particularly those with significant intangible assets that derive value using novel tools and/or are involved in niche markets,
•   impairing relationships with employees, customers, and strategic partners,
•   incurring expenses associated with the amortization of intangible assets particularly for intellectual property and other intangible assets,
•   incurring expenses associated with an impairment of all or a portion of goodwill and other intangible assets due to changes in market conditions, weak economies in certain competitive markets, or the failure of certain acquisitions to realize expected benefits, and
•   diluting the share value and voting power of existing stockholders.
the anticipated benefits of many of our acquisitions may not materialize. future acquisitions or dispositions could result in the incurrence of debt, contingent liabilities or amortization expenses, or write-offs of goodwill and other intangible assets, any of which could harm our financial condition.
we typically fund our acquisitions through our debt facilities. although we have capacity under committed facilities, those may not be sufficient. therefore, future acquisitions may require us to obtain additional financing through debt or equity, which may not be available on favorable terms or at all and could result in dilution.
in addition, to the extent we cannot identify or consummate, on terms acceptable to us, acquisitions that are complementary or otherwise attractive to our business, we may experience difficulty in achieving future growth.
there may be consolidation in our end customer market, which could reduce the use of our services.
mergers or consolidations among our customers could reduce the number of our customers and potential customers. this could adversely affect our revenues even if these events do not reduce the aggregate number of customers or the activities of the consolidated entities. if our customers merge with or are acquired by other entities that are not our customers, or that use fewer of our services, they may discontinue or reduce their use of our services. the adverse effects of consolidation will be greater in sectors that we are particularly dependent upon, for example, in the p&c insurance sector. any of these developments could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results, and cash flows.
if we are unable to develop successful new solutions or if we experience defects, failures and delays associated with the introduction of new solutions, our business could suffer serious harm.
our growth and success depends upon our ability to develop and sell new solutions. if we are unable to develop new solutions, or if we are not successful in introducing and/or obtaining regulatory approval or acceptance for new solutions, or products we develop face sufficient pricing pressure to make them unattractive to pursue, we may not be able to grow our business, or growth may occur more slowly than we anticipate. in addition, significant undetected errors or delays in new solutions may affect market acceptance of our solutions and could harm our business, financial condition or results of operations. in the past, we have experienced delays while developing and introducing new solutions, primarily due to difficulties in developing models, acquiring data and adapting to particular operating environments. errors or defects in our solutions that are significant, or are perceived to be significant, could result in rejection of our solutions, damage to our reputation, loss of revenues, diversion of development resources, an increase in product liability claims, and increases in service and support costs and warranty claims.
we will continue to rely upon proprietary technology rights, and if we are unable to protect them, our business could be harmed.
our success depends, in part, upon our intellectual property rights. to date, we have relied primarily on a combination of copyright, patent, trade secret, and trademark laws and nondisclosure and other contractual restrictions on copying and distribution to protect our proprietary technology. this protection of our proprietary technology is limited, and our proprietary technology could be used by others without our consent. in addition, patents may not be issued with respect to our pending or future patent applications, and our patents may not be upheld as valid or may not prevent the development of competitive products. businesses we acquire also often involve intellectual property portfolios, which increase the challenges we face in protecting our strategic advantage. any disclosure, loss, invalidity of, or failure to protect our intellectual property could negatively impact our competitive position, and ultimately, our business. our protection of our intellectual property rights in the u.s. or abroad may not be adequate and others, including our competitors, may use our proprietary technology without our consent. furthermore, litigation may be necessary to enforce our intellectual property rights, to protect our trade secrets, or to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others. such litigation could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and could harm our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.
we could face claims for intellectual property infringement, which if successful could restrict us from using and providing our technologies and solutions to our customers.
there has been substantial litigation and other proceedings, particularly in the u.s., regarding patent and other intellectual property rights in the information technology industry. there is a risk that we are infringing, or may in the future infringe, the intellectual property rights of third parties. we have, from time-to-time, been subject to litigation alleging intellectual property infringement. we monitor third-party patents and patent applications that may be relevant to our technologies and solutions and we carry out freedom to operate analysis where we deem appropriate. however, such monitoring and analysis has not been, and is unlikely in the future to be, comprehensive, and it may not be possible to detect all potentially relevant patents and patent applications. since the patent application process can take several years to complete, there may be currently pending applications, unknown to us, that may later result in issued patents that cover our products and technologies. as a result, we may infringe existing and future third-party patents of which we are not aware. as we expand our operations there is a higher risk that such activity could infringe the intellectual property rights of third parties.
third-party intellectual property infringement claims and any resultant litigation against us or our technology partners or providers, could subject us to liability for damages, restrict us from using and providing our technologies and solutions or operating our business generally, or require changes to be made to our technologies and solutions. even if we prevail, litigation is time consuming and expensive to defend and would result in the diversion of management's time and attention.
if a successful claim of infringement is brought against us and we fail to develop non-infringing technologies and solutions or to obtain licenses on a timely and cost effective basis, this could materially adversely affect our business, reputation, financial condition, operating results, and cash flows.
regulatory developments could negatively impact our business.
because personal, public and non-public information is stored in some of our databases, we are vulnerable to government regulation and adverse publicity concerning the use of our data. we provide many types of data and services that already are subject to regulation under the fair credit reporting act, gramm-leach-bliley act, driver's privacy protection act, the european union's general data protection regulation, the dodd frank wall street reform and consumer protection act and to a lesser extent, various other federal, state, and local laws and regulations. these laws and regulations are designed to protect the privacy of the public and to prevent the misuse of personal information in the marketplace. however, many consumer advocates, privacy advocates, and government regulators believe that the existing laws and regulations do not adequately protect privacy. they have become increasingly concerned with the use of personal information, particularly social security numbers, department of motor vehicle data and dates of birth. as a result, they are lobbying for further restrictions on the dissemination or commercial use of personal information to the public and private sectors. similar initiatives are under way in other countries in which we do business or from which we source data. the company has implemented various measures to comply with the data privacy and protection principles of the european union's general data protection regulation, however, there can be no assurances that such methods will be deemed fully compliant. if the company is unable to comply with the data privacy and protection principles adopted pursuant to the general data protection regulation, it will impede our ability to conduct business between the u.s. and the e.u. which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
the following legal and regulatory developments also could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations or cash flows:
•   amendment, enactment, or interpretation of laws and regulations which restrict the access and use of personal information and reduce the supply of data available to customers;
•   changes in cultural and consumer attitudes to favor further restrictions on information collection and sharing, which may lead to regulations that prevent full utilization of our solutions;
•   failure of our solutions to comply with current laws and regulations; and
•   failure of our solutions to adapt to changes in the regulatory environment in an efficient, cost-effective manner.
we typically face a long selling cycle to secure new contracts that require significant resource commitments, which result in a long lead time before we receive revenues from new relationships.
we typically face a long selling cycle to secure a new contract and there is generally a long preparation period in order to commence providing the services. we typically incur significant business development expenses during the selling cycle and we may not succeed in winning a new customer's business, in which case we receive no revenues and may receive no reimbursement for such expenses. even if we succeed in developing a relationship with a potential new customer, we may not be successful in obtaining contractual commitments after the selling cycle or in maintaining contractual commitments after the implementation cycle, which may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.
we may lose key business assets, through the loss of data center capacity or the interruption of telecommunications links, the internet, or power sources, which could significantly impede our ability to do business.
our operations depend on our ability, as well as that of third-party service providers to whom we have outsourced several critical functions, to protect data centers, whether in cloud or dedicated environments, and related technology against damage from hardware failure, fire, flood, power loss, telecommunications failure, impacts of terrorism, breaches in security (such as the actions of computer hackers), natural disasters, or other disasters. certain of our facilities are located in areas that could be impacted by coastal flooding, earthquakes or other disasters. the online services we provide are dependent on links to telecommunications providers. in addition, we generate a significant amount of our revenues through telesales centers and websites that we utilize in the acquisition of new customers, fulfillment of solutions and services and responding to customer inquiries. we may not have sufficient redundant operations to cover a loss or failure in all of these areas in a timely manner. certain of our customer contracts provide that our online servers may not be unavailable for specified periods of time. any damage to our or our third-party service provider's data centers, failure of our telecommunications links or inability to access these telesales centers or websites could cause interruptions in operations that materially adversely affect our ability to meet customers' requirements, resulting in decreased revenue, operating income and earnings per share.
we are subject to competition in many of the markets in which we operate and we may not be able to compete effectively.
some markets in which we operate or which we believe may provide growth opportunities for us are highly competitive, and are expected to remain highly competitive. we compete on the basis of quality, customer service, product and service selection, and pricing. our competitive position in various market segments depends upon the relative strength of competitors in the segment and the resources devoted to competing in that segment. due to their size, certain competitors may be able to allocate greater resources to a particular market segment than we can. as a result, these competitors may be in a better position to anticipate and respond to changing customer preferences, emerging technologies and market trends. in addition, new competitors and alliances may emerge to take market share away, and as we enter into new lines of business, due to acquisition or otherwise, we face competition from new players with different competitive dynamics. we may be unable to maintain our competitive position in our market segments, especially against larger competitors. we may also invest further to upgrade our systems in order to compete. if we fail to successfully compete, our business, financial position and results of operations may be adversely affected.
to the extent the availability of free or relatively inexpensive information increases, the demand for some of our solutions may decrease.
public sources of free or relatively inexpensive information have become increasingly available recently, particularly through the internet, and this trend is expected to continue. governmental agencies in particular have increased the amount of information to which they provide free public access. public sources of free or relatively inexpensive information may reduce the demand for our solutions. to the extent that customers choose not to obtain solutions from us and instead rely on information obtained at little or no cost from these public sources, our business and results of operations may be adversely affected.
our financial position may be impacted by audit examinations or changes in tax laws or tax rulings.
our existing corporate structure and tax positions have been implemented in a manner in which we believe is compliant with current prevailing tax laws. however, changes in existing tax laws or rulings, including federal, state and international, could have a significant impact on our effective tax rate, cash tax positions and deferred tax assets and liabilities. audit examinations with an adverse outcome could have a negative effect in the jurisdictions in which we operate. furthermore, the organization for economic co-operation and development (oecd) released its base erosion and profit shifting (beps) action plans which may also lead to future tax reform that could affect our results. in addition, our tax positions are impacted by fluctuations in our earnings and financial results in the various countries in which we do business.
our senior leadership team is critical to our continued success and the loss of such personnel could harm our business.
our future success substantially depends on the continued service and performance of the members of our senior leadership team. these personnel possess business and technical capabilities that are difficult to replace.
however, as a general practice we do not enter into employee contracts with the members of our senior management operating team, except for certain limited situations. if we lose key members of our senior management operating team, we may not be able to effectively manage our current operations or meet ongoing and future business challenges, and this may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.
we may fail to attract and retain enough qualified employees to support our operations, which could have an adverse effect on our ability to expand our business and service our customers.
our business relies on large numbers of skilled employees and our success depends on our ability to attract, train and retain a sufficient number of qualified employees. if our attrition rate increases, our operating efficiency and productivity may decrease. we compete for employees not only with other companies in our industry, but also with companies in other industries, such as software services, engineering services and financial services companies, and there is a limited pool of employees who have the skills and training needed to do our work.
if our business continues to grow, the number of people we will need to hire will increase. we will also need to increase our hiring if we are not able to maintain our attrition rate through our current recruiting and retention policies. increased competition for employees could have an adverse effect on our ability to expand our business and service our customers, as well as cause us to incur greater personnel expenses and training costs.
we are subject to antitrust, consumer protection and other litigation, and may in the future become further subject to such litigation; an adverse outcome in such litigation could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, revenues and profitability.
we participate in businesses (particularly insurance-related businesses and services) that are subject to substantial litigation, including antitrust and consumer protection litigation. in addition, our insurance specialists are in the business of providing advice on standard contract terms, which if challenged could expose us to substantial reputational harm and possible liability. we are subject to the provisions of a 1995 settlement agreement in an antitrust lawsuit brought by various state attorneys general and private plaintiffs, which imposes certain constraints with respect to insurer involvement in our governance and business. we currently are defending against putative class action lawsuits in which it is alleged that certain of our subsidiaries unlawfully have conspired with insurers with respect to their payment of insurance claims. see "item 3. legal proceedings." our failure to successfully defend or settle any litigation could result in liability that, to the extent not covered by our insurance, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, revenues and profitability. given the nature of our business, we may be subject to litigation in the future. even if the direct financial impact of such litigation is not material, settlements or judgments arising out of such litigation could include further restrictions on our ability to conduct business, including potentially the elimination of entire lines of business, which could increase our cost of doing business and limit our prospects for future growth.
general economic, political and market forces and dislocations beyond our control could reduce demand for our solutions and harm our business.
the demand for our solutions may be impacted by domestic and international factors that are beyond our control, including macroeconomic, political and market conditions, the availability of short-term and long-term funding and capital, the level and volatility of interest rates, currency exchange rates, and inflation. any one or more of these factors may contribute to reduced activity and prices in the securities markets generally and could result in a reduction in demand for our solutions, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. a significant additional decline in the
value of assets for which risk is transferred in market transactions could have an adverse impact on the demand for our solutions.
we may incur substantial additional indebtedness in connection with future acquisitions.
in order to finance acquisitions, which are an important part of our long term growth strategy, we may incur substantial additional indebtedness and such increased leverage could adversely affect our business. in particular, the increased leverage could increase our vulnerability to sustained, adverse macroeconomic weakness, limit our ability to obtain further financing and limit our ability to pursue other operational and strategic opportunities. the increased leverage, potential lack of access to financing and increased expenses could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
general economic uncertainties, including downward trends in the energy industry, could reduce demand by wood mackenzie's customers for its products and services.
demand for wood mackenzie's products and services may be negatively influenced by general economic uncertainties, particularly any downward trends in the energy industry. many factors could negatively affect the revenues, profits and discretionary spending of wood mackenzie's customers. such factors include commodity prices (in particular, oil and coal), the state of the local economy, interest rates, currency exchange rates, political uncertainty or restrictions and regulations, the availability of industry resources, and other matters. a downturn or perceived downturn in the economy, particularly the energy industry, could add pricing pressure, delay subscription renewals or lead to more challenging or protracted fee negotiations or generally lower acceptance of our solutions by wood mackenzie's customers, which could cause a decline in our revenues and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
our operations are subject to additional risks inherent in international operations.
wood mackenzie is based in the united kingdom, or u.k., and conducts its principal operations outside the u.s. as a result, the percentage of our revenues generated outside of the u.s. has increased materially. conducting extensive international operations subjects us to risks that are inherent in international operations, including challenges posed by different pricing environments and different forms of competition; lack of familiarity and burdens of complying with foreign laws, legal standards, regulatory requirements, tariffs and other barriers; unexpected changes in regulatory requirements, taxes, trade laws, tariffs, export quotas, custom duties, or other trade restrictions; differing technology standards; difficulties in collecting accounts receivable; difficulties in managing and staffing international operations; varying expectations as to employee standards; potentially adverse tax consequences, including possible restrictions on the repatriation of earnings; and reduced or varied protection for intellectual property rights in some countries. moreover, international operations could be interrupted and negatively affected by economic changes, geopolitical regional conflicts, terrorist activity, political unrest, civil strife, acts of war, and other economic or political uncertainties. all of these risks could result in increased costs or decreased revenues, either of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
we are subject to the increased risk of exchange rate fluctuations.
the revenues and costs of wood mackenzie are primarily denominated in pound sterling. as a result of our acquisition of wood mackenzie and other recent acquisitions outside of the u.s., we face greater exposure to movements in currency exchange rates, which may cause our revenue and operating results to differ materially from expectations. our operating results could be negatively affected depending on the amount of revenue and expense denominated in foreign currencies. as exchange rates vary, revenue, cost of revenue, operating expenses, and other operating results, when remeasured in u.s. dollars, may differ materially from expectations. although we may apply certain strategies to mitigate foreign currency risk, these strategies may not eliminate our exposure to foreign exchange rate fluctuations and would involve costs and risks of their own, such as ongoing management time and expertise, external costs to implement the strategies and potential accounting implications.
economic and political instability and potential unfavorable changes in laws and regulations resulting from the u.k.'s exit from the e.u. could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
the results of the referendum on june 23, 2016 in the u.k., to exit the e.u., which is commonly referred to as "brexit," and to potentially significantly change the u.k.'s relationship with the e.u. and the laws and regulations impacting business conducted between the u.k. and e.u. countries could disrupt the overall stability of the e.u. given the diverse economic and political circumstances of individual e.u. countries and negatively impact our european operations. an immediate consequence of the brexit vote was an adverse impact to global markets, including currency markets which experienced a sharp drop in the value of the british pound.  longer term, the ongoing negotiations regarding the future terms of the u.k.'s relationship with the e.u. could result in the u.k. losing access to certain aspects of the single e.u. market and the global trade deals negotiated by the e.u. on behalf of its members. while the u.k. is currently expected to leave the e.u. on
march 29, 2019, uncertainty remains as to the exact timing and process. the brexit vote and the perceptions as to the impact of the withdrawal of the u.k. may adversely affect business activity, political stability and economic conditions in the u.k., the e.u. and elsewhere, the impact of which could have an adverse effect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
if there are substantial sales of our common stock, our stock price could decline.
the market price of our common stock could decline as a result of sales of a large number of shares of our common stock in the market, or the perception that these sales could occur. these sales, or the possibility that these sales may occur, also might make it more difficult for us to sell equity securities in the future at a time and at a price that we deem attractive. as of december 31, 2018, our ten largest shareholders owned 41.2% of our common stock, including 3.9% of our common stock owned by our employee stock ownership plan or esop. such stockholders are able to sell their common stock in the public market from time to time without registration, and subject to limitations on the timing, amount and method of those sales imposed by securities laws. if any of these stockholders were to sell a large number of their common stock, the market price of our common stock could decline significantly. in addition, the perception in the public markets that sales by them might occur could also adversely affect the market price of our common stock.
pursuant to our equity incentive plans, options to purchase approximately 6,730,288 shares of common stock were outstanding as of february 15, 2019. we filed a registration statement under the securities act, which covers the shares available for issuance under our equity incentive plans (including for such outstanding options) as well as shares held for resale by our existing stockholders that were previously issued under our equity incentive plans. such further issuance and resale of our common stock could cause the price of our common stock to decline.
also, in the future, we may issue our securities in connection with investments and acquisitions. the amount of our common stock issued in connection with an investment or acquisition could constitute a material portion of our then outstanding common stock.
our capital structure, level of indebtedness and the terms of anti-takeover provisions under delaware law and in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws could diminish the value of our common stock and could make a merger, tender offer or proxy contest difficult or could impede an attempt to replace or remove our directors.
we are a delaware corporation and the anti-takeover provisions of the delaware general corporation law may discourage, delay or prevent a change in control by prohibiting us from engaging in a business combination with an interested stockholder for a period of three years after the person becomes an interested stockholder, even if a change of control would be beneficial to our existing stockholders. in addition, our certificate of incorporation and bylaws may discourage, delay or prevent a change in our management or control over us that stockholders may consider favorable or make it more difficult for stockholders to replace directors even if stockholders consider it beneficial to do so. our certificate of incorporation and bylaws:
•   authorize the issuance of "blank check" preferred stock that could be issued by our board of directors to increase the number of outstanding shares to thwart a takeover attempt,
•   prohibit cumulative voting in the election of directors, which would otherwise allow holders of less than a majority of the stock to elect some directors,
•   require that vacancies on the board of directors, including newly-created directorships, be filled only by a majority vote of directors then in office,
•   limit who may call special meetings of stockholders,
•   prohibit stockholder action by written consent, requiring all stockholder actions to be taken at a meeting of the stockholders, and
•   establish advance notice requirements for nominating candidates for election to the board of directors or for proposing matters that can be acted upon by stockholders at stockholder meetings.
in addition, section 203 of the delaware general corporation law may inhibit potential acquisition bids for us. as a public company, we are subject to section 203, which regulates corporate acquisitions and limits the ability of a holder of 15.0% or more of our stock from acquiring the rest of our stock. under delaware law, a corporation may opt out of the anti-takeover provisions, but we do not intend to do so.
these provisions may prevent a stockholder from receiving the benefit from any premium over the market price of our common stock offered by a bidder in a potential takeover. even in the absence of an attempt to effect a change in management or a takeover attempt, these provisions may adversely affect the prevailing market price of our common stock if they are viewed as discouraging takeover attempts in the future.
item 7.   management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with our historical financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10-k, as well as the discussion under "selected consolidated financial data." this discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. our actual results may differ materially from those discussed in or implied by any of the forward-looking statements as a result of various factors, including but not limited to those listed under "risk factors" and "special note regarding forward-looking statements."
verisk is a leading data analytics provider serving customers in insurance, energy and specialized markets, and financial services. using advanced technologies to collect and analyze billions of records, we draw on unique data assets and deep domain expertise to provide innovations that may be integrated into customer workflows. we offer predictive analytics and decision support solutions to customers in rating, underwriting, claims, catastrophe and weather risk, natural resources intelligence, economic forecasting, and many other fields. in the united states, or u.s., and around the world, we help customers protect people, property, and financial assets. refer to item 1. business for further discussion.
our customers use our solutions to make better decisions about risk and opportunities with greater efficiency and discipline. we refer to these products and services as "solutions" due to the integration among our products and the flexibility that enables our customers to purchase components or the comprehensive package of products. these solutions take various forms, including data, statistical models or tailored analytics, all designed to allow our customers to make more logical decisions. we believe our solutions for analyzing risk positively impact our customers' revenues and help them better manage their costs.
we previously reported results based on two operating segments, decision analytics and risk assessment. during the first quarter of 2018, the chief operating decision maker, or codm, changed how he makes operating decisions, assesses the performance of the business, and allocates resources in a manner that caused the company's operating segments to change. consequently, effective as of the first quarter of 2018, our operating segments are based on three vertical markets we serve: insurance, energy and specialized markets, and financial services. these three operating segments are also our reportable segments, which have been retroactively recast to reflect the new segments in all periods presented.
our insurance segment provides underwriting and ratings, and claims insurance data for the u.s. p&c insurance industry. this segment's revenues represented approximately 71% and 72% of our revenues for the years ended december 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. our energy and specialized markets segment provides research and consulting data analytics for the global energy, chemicals, and metals and mining industries. our energy and specialized markets segment's revenues represented approximately 22% and 21% of our revenues for the years ended december 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. our financial services segment provides competitive benchmarking, decisioning algorithms, business intelligence, and customized analytic services to financial institutions, payment networks and processors, alternative lenders, regulators and merchants. our financial services segment's revenues represented approximately 7% of our revenues for the years ended december 31, 2018 and 2017.
executive summary key performance metrics we believe our business's ability to grow recurring revenue and generate positive cash flow is the key indicator of the successful execution of our business strategy. we use year-over-year revenue and ebitda growth as metrics to measure our performance. ebitda and ebitda margin are non-gaap financial measures (see note 2 within item 6. selected financial data section of management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations). the respective gaap financial measures are net income and net income margin.
revenue growth. we use year-over-year revenue growth as a key performance metric. we assess revenue growth based on our ability to generate increased revenue through increased sales to existing customers, sales to new customers, sales of new or expanded solutions to existing and new customers, and strategic acquisitions of new businesses.
ebitda growth. we use ebitda growth as a proxy for the cash generated by the business. ebitda growth serves as a measure of our ability to balance the size of revenue growth with cost management and investing for future growth.
ebitda margin. we use ebitda margin as a metric to assess segment performance and scalability of our business. we assess ebitda margin based on our ability to increase revenues while controlling expense growth.
revenues we earn revenues through agreements for hosted subscriptions, advisory/consulting services, and for transactional solutions, recurring and non-recurring. subscriptions for our solutions are generally paid in advance of rendering services either quarterly or in full upon commencement of the subscription period, which is usually for one year and automatically renewed each year. as a result, the timing of our cash flows generally precedes our recognition of revenues and income and our cash flow from operations tends to be higher in the first quarter as we receive subscription payments. examples of these arrangements include subscriptions that allow our customers to access our standardized coverage language, our claims fraud database or our actuarial services throughout the subscription period. in general, we experience minimal revenue seasonality within the business.
approximately 82% and 81% of the revenues in our insurance segment for the years ended december 31, 2018 and 2017 were derived from hosted subscriptions through agreements (generally one to five years) for our solutions. our customers in this segment include most of the p&c insurance providers in the u.s. approximately 78% and 82% of the revenues in our energy and specialized markets segment for the years ended december 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, were derived from hosted subscriptions with long-term agreements for our solutions. our customers in this segment include most of the top 10 global energy providers around the world. approximately 73% and 72% of the revenues in our financial services segment for the years ended december 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, were derived from subscriptions with long-term agreements for our solutions, respectively. our customers in this segment include financial institutions, payment networks and processors, alternative lenders, regulators, merchants, and all of the top 30 credit card issuers in north america, the united kingdom, and australia.
we also provide advisory/consulting services, which help our customers get more value out of our analytics and their subscriptions. in addition, certain of our solutions are paid for by our customers on a transactional basis, recurring and non-recurring. for example, we have solutions that allow our customers to access property-specific rating and underwriting information to price a policy on a commercial building, or compare a p&c insurance or a workers' compensation claim with information in our databases, or use our repair cost estimation solutions on a case-by-case basis. for the years ended december 31, 2018 and 2017, approximately 20% and 19%, respectively, of our revenues were derived from providing transactional and advisory/consulting solutions.
principal operating costs and expenses personnel expenses are a major component of both our cost of revenues and selling, general and administrative expenses. personnel expenses, which represented approximately 58% and 59% of our total operating expenses for the years ended december 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, include salaries, benefits, incentive compensation, equity compensation costs, sales commissions, employment taxes, recruiting costs, and outsourced temporary agency costs.
we assign personnel expenses between two categories, cost of revenues and selling, general and administrative costs, based on the actual costs associated with each employee. we categorize employees who maintain our solutions as cost of revenues, and all other personnel, including executive managers, sales people, marketing, business development, finance, legal, human resources, and administrative services, as selling, general and administrative expenses. a significant portion of our other
operating costs, such as facilities and communications, are either captured within cost of revenues or selling, general and administrative expense based on the nature of the work being performed.
while we expect to grow our headcount over time to take advantage of our market opportunities, we believe that the economies of scale in our operating model will allow us to grow our personnel expenses at a lower rate than revenues. historically, our ebitda margin has improved because we have been able to increase revenues without a proportionate corresponding increase in expenses. however, part of our corporate strategy is to invest in new solutions and new businesses, which may offset margin expansion.
cost of revenues. our cost of revenues consists primarily of personnel expenses. cost of revenues also includes the expenses associated with the acquisition and verification of data, the maintenance of our existing solutions and the development and enhancement of our next-generation solutions. our cost of revenues excludes depreciation and amortization.
selling, general and administrative expense. our selling, general and administrative expense also consists primarily of personnel costs. a portion of the other operating costs such as facilities, insurance and communications are allocated to selling, general and administrative costs based on the nature of the work being performed by the employee. our selling, general and administrative expenses excludes depreciation and amortization.
trends affecting our business we serve customers in three primary vertical markets: p&c insurance, energy and specialized markets, and financial services. the industry trends in each of those markets can affect our business.
a significant change in p&c insurers' profitability could affect the demand for our solutions. for insurers, the keys to profitability include increasing investment income, premium growth and disciplined underwriting of risks. investment income remains under pressure as a result of low interest rates. growth in p&c insurers' direct written premiums is cyclical, with total industry premium growth receding from a peak of 14.8% in 2002 to a trough of negative 3.1% in 2009 and subsequently recovering to 4.4% in 2012, 4.3% in 2013, 4.4% in 2014, 3.7% in 2015, 3.7% in 2016 and 4.7% in 2017. in recent years, we have signed multi-year contracts with certain customers, and pricing is fixed at the beginning of each multi-year period; pricing for other customers is still linked to prior years' premiums.
based on the most recent results available, direct premium growth and net premium growth accelerated in 2018. however, insurers were also challenged by heightened catastrophic losses in 2018 associated with major hurricanes, such as florence and michael, and several devastating wildfires in the state of california, coupled with additional losses reported from the three major hurricanes in 2017 - harvey, irma, and maria. these events illustrate the need for broader coverages, such as flood to meet the changing needs of communities.  we continue to provide the necessary resources to meet insurer needs.
trends in catastrophe and non-catastrophe weather losses can have an effect on our customers' profitability, and therefore on their appetite for buying analytics to help them manage their risks. any increase or decrease in frequency or severity of weather events over time could lead to an increased or decreased demand for our catastrophe modeling, catastrophe loss information, and repair cost solutions. likewise, any structural changes in the reinsurance and related brokerage industry from the recent influx of alternative capital or newer technologies could affect demand for our products. we also have a portion of our revenue related to the number of claims processed due to losses, which can be impacted by seasonal storm activity. the need by our customers to fight insurance fraud - both in claims and at policy inception - could lead to increased demand for our underwriting and claims solutions.
trends in the energy, chemicals, and metals and mining sectors and activity in financial markets can influence our revenues. during 2018, the brent oil price reached a peak of over approximately 80 dollar per barrel before falling under approximately 60 dollar per barrel by year end reflecting an oversupply in the market. the organization of the petroleum exporting countries, or opec, announced a significant cut in production beginning january 1, 2019 to help balance the market. in the upstream sector there are five global trends. first, capital investments have recovered from the cyclical low, the start of spend on a new global phase of significant liquefied natural gas projects adding momentum in 2019. second, the industry's ongoing progress in reducing costs have been boosted by digitalization initiatives as well as over-capacity in the service sector in many regions, leading to improved economics and more projects reaching a final investment decision. third, tight oil production in the u.s. lower 48 is still on a strong growth trajectory and remains a focus of global merger and acquisition activity as the industry consolidates. fourth, resource capture continues to be focused on lower risk opportunities with competitive bidding in 2019 to develop discovered fields in qatar (gas) and brazil (oil). fifth, many countries are reviewing their existing fiscal policies to ensure that they are competitive and attract investment. in the wider energy sector the energy transition is gaining momentum, most evidently in the rapid penetration of renewables into power and the emergence of electric vehicles - the latter set to present a competitive challenge to the internal combustion engine in the coming decades and
with implications for oil demand in the long term. petrochemicals is a key growth segment for oil demand, but the disposal of plastics is increasingly in the public eye as a social and environmental concern. new legislation limiting sulphur content in marine fuels comes into effect in 2020 with profound implications for refiners and major fuel consumers, such as airlines. as environmental concerns and the move to decarbonization gather pace, we will continue to evolve our offerings to meet the needs of our customers in a dynamic market and remain increasingly well positioned to serve our customers' information and analytical needs.
market trends continue to influence our financial services segment in important ways.  as we look forward towards 2019, increasing fraud and delinquency loss rates worldwide are strengthening demand for robust risk solutions which we are addressing via a range of new fraud solutions, which we have initially launched in mexico. additionally, higher levels of regulatory scrutiny as well as greater regulatory alignment worldwide is increasing demand for compliance and reporting tools, which we are tackling via our range of compliance products developed both within our financial services segment. in order to better serve our customers, add to our data asset, and expand our expertise, we made a number of acquisitions in the past year, including marketview, which provides analytical solutions for banks, acquirers, merchants and government in new zealand.  these new businesses offer new solutions for existing and new clients of our core business, and enable us to develop product and cost synergies going forward, and join our existing businesses that we acquired earlier and have integrated during 2018.

our claims revenue increased $57.7 million or 11.5%; excluding revenues from recent acquisitions of $15.0 million, our claims revenue increased $42.7 million or 8.5%, primarily due to growth in our repair cost estimating solutions, claims analytics and aerial imagery solutions revenue. the repair costs estimating and aerial imagery-based solutions contributed approximately $16.0 million in revenues related to severe storms for the year ended december 31, 2017, which did not reoccur in 2018.

liquidity and capital resources as of december 31, 2018 and 2017, we had cash and cash equivalents and available-for-sale securities of $142.8 million and $146.1 million, respectively. subscriptions for our solutions are billed and generally paid in advance of rendering services either quarterly or in full upon commencement of the subscription period, which is usually for one year. subscriptions are automatically renewed at the beginning of each calendar year. we have historically generated significant cash flows from operations. as a result of this factor, as well as the availability of funds under our syndicated revolving credit facility, we believe we will have sufficient cash to meet our working capital and capital expenditure needs, and to fuel our future growth plans.
we have historically managed the business with a working capital deficit due to the fact that, as described above, we offer our solutions and services primarily through annual subscriptions or long-term contracts, which are generally prepaid quarterly or annually in advance of the services being rendered. when cash is received for prepayment of invoices, we record an asset (cash and cash equivalents) on our balance sheet with the offset recorded as a current liability (deferred revenues). this current liability is deferred revenue that does not require a direct cash outflow since our customers have prepaid and are obligated to purchase the services. in most businesses, growth in revenue typically leads to an increase in the accounts receivable balance causing a use of cash as a company grows. unlike these businesses, our cash position is favorably affected by revenue growth, which results in a source of cash due to our customers prepaying for most of our services.
our consolidated capital expenditures as a percentage of consolidated revenues for the years ended december 31, 2018 and 2017, were 9.6% and 8.6%, respectively. expenditures related to developing and enhancing our solutions are predominately related to internal-use software and are capitalized in accordance with asc 350-40, "accounting for costs of computer software developed or obtained for internal use." we also capitalize amounts in accordance with asc 985-20, "software to be sold, leased or otherwise marketed."

financing and financing capacity we had total debt, excluding capital lease obligations, unamortized discounts and debt issuance costs of $2,715.0 million and $3,015.0 million at december 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. the debt at december 31, 2018 primarily consists of senior notes issued in 2015, 2012 and 2011 and borrowings outstanding under our committed senior unsecured syndicated revolving credit facility, or the credit facility, described below. interest on the senior notes is payable semi-annually each year. the unamortized discount and debt issuance costs were recorded as "long-term debt" in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets, and will be amortized to "interest expense" in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations within this form 10-k over the life of the respective senior note. the indenture governing the senior notes restricts our ability to, among other things, create certain liens, enter into sale/leaseback transactions and consolidate with, sell, lease, convey, or otherwise transfer all or substantially all of our assets, or merge with or into, any other person or entity. as of december 31, 2018, we had senior notes with an aggregate principal amount of $2,300.0 million outstanding, and we were in compliance with our financial debt covenants. in january 2019, we repaid a total of $250.0 million of the $2,300.0 million outstanding borrowings at december 31, 2018 under the senior notes.

(2)   other long-term liabilities consist of our employee-related deferred compensation plan. we also have a deferred compensation plan for our board of directors; however, based on past performance and the uncertainty of the dollar amounts to be paid, if any, we have excluded such amounts from the above table.
(3)   unrecognized tax benefits of approximately $17.4 million have been recorded as liabilities in accordance with asc 740, which have been omitted from the table above, and we are uncertain as to if or when such amounts may be settled, with the exception of those amounts subject to a statute of limitation. related to the unrecognized tax benefits, we also have recorded a liability for potential penalties and interest of $5.7 million.
off-balance sheet arrangements we have no off-balance sheet arrangements.
critical accounting policies and estimates our management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states. the preparation of these financial statements require management to make estimates and judgments that affect reported amounts of assets and liabilities and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and revenue and expenses during the reporting periods. these estimates are based on historical experience and on other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. on an ongoing basis, management evaluates its estimates, including those related to revenue recognition, goodwill and intangible assets, pension and other post retirement benefits, stock based compensation, and income taxes. actual results may differ from these assumptions or conditions.
revenue recognition we recognize revenue based on the transfer of promised goods or services to customers for the amount that reflects the consideration to which we expect to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. revenue is recognized in a five-step model: 1) identify the contract with a customer; 2) identify the performance obligations in the contract; 3) determine the transaction price; 4) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and 5) recognize revenue when or as the company satisfies a performance obligation. revenues for hosted subscription services are recognized ratably over the subscription term. revenues from certain discrete project based advisory/consulting services are recognized over time by measuring the progress toward complete satisfaction of the performance obligation, based on the input method of consulting hours worked; this aligns with the results achieved and value transferred to the customer. revenues from transactional solutions are recognized as the solutions are delivered or services performed at point in time.
we invoice our customers in annual, quarterly, or monthly installments. amounts billed and collected in advance are recorded as deferred revenues on the balance sheet and are recognized as the services are performed and revenue recognition criteria are met.
stock-based compensation stock-based compensation cost, including stock options, restricted stock, and performance share units, or psus, is measured at the grant date, based on the fair value of the awards granted, and is recognized as expense over the requisite service period. the fair value of stock options is measured using a black-scholes option-pricing model, which requires the use of several estimates, including expected term, expected risk-free interest rate, expected volatility, and expected dividend yield. the fair value of the restricted stock is determined using the closing price of the company's common stock on the grant date. the fair value of psus is determined on the grant date using the monte carlo simulation model.
option grants and restricted stock awards are generally expensed ratably over the four-year vesting period. psus are generally expensed ratably over the three-year vesting period. we follow the substantive vesting period approach for awards granted after january 1, 2005, which requires that stock-based compensation expense be recognized over the period from the date of grant to the date when the award is no longer contingent on the employee providing additional service.
we estimate expected forfeitures of equity awards at the date of grant and recognize compensation expense only for those awards expected to vest. the forfeiture assumption is ultimately adjusted to the actual forfeiture rate.
goodwill and intangibles goodwill represents the excess of acquisition costs over the fair value of tangible net assets and identifiable intangible assets of the businesses acquired. goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives are not amortized. intangible assets determined to have definite lives are amortized over their useful lives. goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are subject to impairment testing annually as of june 30, or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be fully recoverable, using the guidance and criteria described in the accounting standard for goodwill and other intangible assets. this testing compares carrying values to fair values and, when appropriate, the carrying value of these assets is reduced to fair value.
as of december 31, 2018, we had goodwill of $3,361.5 million, which represents 57.0% of our total assets. during 2018, we performed an impairment test as of june 30, 2018 and confirmed that no impairment charge was necessary. there are many assumptions and estimates used that directly impact the results of impairment testing, including an estimate of future expected revenues, earnings and cash flows, useful lives and discount rates applied to such expected cash flows in order to
estimate fair value. we have the ability to influence the outcome and ultimate results based on the assumptions and estimates we choose for determining the fair value of our reporting units. to mitigate undue influence, we set criteria and benchmarks that are reviewed and approved by various levels of management and reviewed by other independent parties. the determination of whether or not goodwill or indefinite-lived acquired intangible assets have become impaired involves a significant level of judgment in the assumptions and estimates underlying the approach used to determine the value of our reporting units. changes in our strategy or market conditions could significantly impact these judgments and require an impairment to be recorded to intangible assets and goodwill. there have been no goodwill impairment indicators subsequent to the impairment test performed as of june 30, 2018. for the year ended december 31, 2018, there were no impairment indicators related to our intangible assets.
we allocate the fair value of the purchase consideration to the tangible assets acquired, liabilities assumed and intangible assets acquired based on their estimated fair values. the excess of the fair value of the purchase consideration over the fair values of these identifiable assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill.  such valuations require management to make significant estimates and assumptions, especially with respect to intangible assets. the estimates used in valuing the intangible assets are determined with the assistance of third party specialists, a discounted cash flow analysis and estimates made by management. management's estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable, but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable and, as a result, actual results may differ from estimates. during the measurement period, which is not to exceed one year from the acquisition date, we may record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, with the corresponding offset to goodwill. upon the conclusion of the measurement period, any subsequent adjustments are recorded to earnings.
income taxes in projecting future taxable income, we develop assumptions including the amount of future state, federal and foreign pretax operating income, the reversal of temporary differences, and the implementation of feasible and prudent tax planning strategies. these assumptions require significant judgment about the forecasts of future taxable income and are consistent with the plans and estimates we use to manage the underlying businesses. the calculation of our tax liabilities also involves dealing with uncertainties in the application and evolution of complex tax laws and regulations in other jurisdictions.
we account for uncertain tax positions in accordance with accounting for uncertainty in income taxes - an interpretation of asc 740, which addresses the determination of whether tax benefits claimed or expected to be claimed on a tax return should be recorded in the financial statements. under this interpretation, we may recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained upon examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position.
we recognize and adjust our liabilities when our judgment changes as a result of the evaluation of new information not previously available. due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties, the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from our current estimate of the tax liabilities. these differences will be reflected as increases or decreases to income tax expense in the period in which they are determined.
on december 22, 2017 the tax cuts and job act ("tax act") was enacted.  the tax act included a number of changes to u.s. tax laws, most notably a reduction in the u.s. corporate tax rate from 35.0% to 21.0%. as a result of the corporate tax rate reduction, the company recognized a tax benefit in 2017 of $89.1 million due to the re-measurement of its deferred tax assets and liabilities.  in accordance with staff accounting bulletin (sab) no. 118, the company completed the analysis of the impacts of the 2017 tax act in the fourth quarter of 2018, resulting in an incremental charge of $1.0 million as income tax expense to reflect the final remeasurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities of $88.1 million.
we estimate unrecognized tax positions of $0.9 million that may be recognized by december 31, 2019, due to expiration of statutes of limitations and resolution of audits with taxing authorities, net of additional uncertain tax positions.
as of december 31, 2018, we have gross federal, state, and foreign income tax net operating loss carryforwards of $186.5 million, which will expire at various dates from 2019 through 2038. such net operating loss carryforwards expire as follows:
the net deferred income tax liability of $339.5 million consists primarily of timing differences involving depreciation and amortization.

on march 1, 2017, mckesson contributed the majority of our core mts business and change contributed substantially all of its businesses, excluding its pharmacy switch and prescription routing businesses, to form a joint venture, change healthcare. the purpose of the transaction was to create a new healthcare information technology company, bringing together the complementary strengths of the contributed assets to provide software and analytics, network solutions and technology-enabled services that will help customers obtain actionable insights, exchange mission-critical information, control costs, optimize revenue opportunities, increase cash flow and effectively navigate the shift to value-based healthcare. change healthcare is jointly governed by mckesson and change. operating a business under joint governance of unaffiliated, controlling members could lead to conflicts of interest or deadlocks on important and time-sensitive operational, financial or strategic decisions, and will require additional organizational formalities as well as time-consuming procedures for sharing information and making decisions. if we are unable to manage our joint venture relationship and to realize the strategic and financial benefits that we expect, including an initial public offering of change healthcare inc., such inability to manage the relationship or realize benefits may have a material adverse impact on our results of operations.

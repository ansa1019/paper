non-gaap measures we use certain financial measures internally to evaluate our performance and make financial and operational decisions that are presented in a manner that adjusts from their equivalent gaap measures or that supplement the information provided by our gaap measures. we use these adjusted results because we believe they more clearly highlight trends in our business that may not otherwise be apparent when relying solely on gaap financial measures, since these measures eliminate from our results specific financial items that have less bearing on our core operating performance.
we use these measures in communicating certain aspects of our results and performance, including in this annual report, and believe that these measures, when viewed in conjunction with our gaap results and the accompanying reconciliation, can provide investors with greater transparency and a greater understanding of factors affecting our financial condition and results of operations than gaap measures alone. in addition, we believe the presentation of these measures is useful to investors for making period-to-period comparisons of results because the adjustments to gaap are not reflective of our core business performance.
these financial measures are not presented in accordance with, or as an alternative to, gaap financial measures and may be different from non-gaap measures used by other companies. we encourage investors to review the gaap financial measures included in this annual report, including our consolidated financial statements, to aid in their analysis and understanding of our performance and in making comparisons.
the table below outlines our adjusted operating expenses, adjusted operating income, adjusted operating margin, adjusted net income attributable to ice common stockholders and adjusted earnings per share, which are non-gaap measures that are calculated by making adjustments for items we view as not reflective of our cash operations and core business
performance. these measures, including the adjustments and their related income tax effect and other tax adjustments (in millions, except for percentages and per share amounts), are as follows:

acquisition-related transaction costs are included as part of our core business expenses, except for those that are directly related to the announcement, closing, financing or termination of a transaction. however, we adjust for the acquisition-related transaction and integration costs relating to interactive data and nyse given the sizes of these acquisitions. the integration of nyse was completed by june 2016 and the integration of interactive data was completed by june 2018. amortization of acquisition-related intangibles are included in non-gaap adjustments as excluding these non-cash expenses provides greater clarity regarding our financial strength and stability of cash operating results.
in addition, we also include the following items as non-gaap adjustments, as each of these are not considered a part of our core business operations:
â€¢   2018: the gain recognized on our initial majority investment in mers in connection with our acquisition of 100% of the remaining mers interests;
â€¢   2018: the impairment loss on exchange registration intangible assets and employee severance costs related to the closure of ice futures canada and ice clear canada;
â€¢   2017: the net gain on the divestiture of trayport, and in 2018, a subsequent adjustment to reduce of the gain on the divestiture;
â€¢   2017: the realized investment gain and the foreign exchange loss and transaction expenses on the sale of our investment in cetip;
â€¢   2017: the nyse governance services net impairment loss on its divestiture; and
â€¢   2016: the creditex u.k. voice brokerage severance costs related to its discontinuance and the creditex customer relationship intangible asset impairment loss.
the tax items in non-gaap adjustments are either the tax impacts of the pre-tax non-gaap adjustments or tax items as described below that are not in the normal course of business and are not indicative of our core business performance. the following tax-related items are included as non-gaap adjustments:
â€¢   the income tax effects relating to all non-gaap adjustments;
â€¢   deferred tax adjustments on acquisition-related intangibles; including the impact of u.s. state tax law changes and apportionment updates, as well as foreign tax law changes which resulted in deferred tax (benefit) expense of ($5 million), $10 million and ($22 million) in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. in addition, deferred tax adjustments on acquisition-related intangibles include $34 million of deferred tax benefits due to u.k. corporate income tax rate reductions in 2016;
â€¢   deferred tax benefits of $11 million and $764 million in 2018 and 2017, respectively, resulting from changes in estimates as a result of the enactment of the tcja which reduced the corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%;
â€¢   2018: other tax adjustments including a $17 million tax benefit on the sale of trayport offset by an audit settlement for a pre-acquisition period in connection with our acquisition of nyse in 2013; and
â€¢   2016: other tax adjustments including a $15 million valuation allowance on singapore pre-acquisition net operating losses and other deferred tax assets and an $8 million deferred tax adjustment with respect to our occ equity method investment.

off-balance sheet arrangements we do not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities.
contractual obligations and commercial commitments the following presents our contractual obligations (which we intend to fund from existing cash as well as cash flow from operations) and commercial commitments as of december 31, 2018 (in millions):
operating lease obligations                        417                  64                   121                    99         133
purchase obligations include our estimate of the minimum outstanding obligations under agreements to purchase goods or services that we believe are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed, minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. purchase obligations exclude agreements that are cancellable at any time without penalty.
we have excluded from the contractual obligations and commercial commitments listed above $64.0 billion in cash margin deposits, guaranty funds and delivery contracts payable. clearing members of our clearing houses are required to deposit original margin and variation margin and to make deposits to a guaranty fund. the cash deposits made to these margin accounts and to the guaranty fund are recorded in the consolidated balance sheet as current assets with corresponding current liabilities to the clearing members that deposited them. ice ngx administers the physical delivery of energy trading contracts. it has an equal and offsetting claim to and from its respective participants on opposite sides of the physically-settled contract, each of which is reflected as a delivery contract receivable with an offsetting delivery contract payable. see note 14 to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report for additional information on our clearing houses and the margin deposits, guaranty funds and delivery contracts payable.
we have also excluded unrecognized tax benefits, or utbs. as of december 31, 2018, our cumulative utbs were $98 million. interest and penalties related to utbs were $28 million as of december 31, 2018. we are under examination by various tax authorities. we are unable to make a reasonable estimate of the periods of cash settlement because it is not possible to reasonably predict the amount of tax, interest and penalties, if any, that might be assessed by a tax authority or the timing of an assessment or payment. it is also not possible to reasonably predict whether or not the applicable statutes of limitations might expire without us being examined by any particular tax authority. see note 13 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information on our utbs.
as of december 31, 2018, in connection with our acquisition of nyse, we have obligations related to our pension and other benefit programs. the date of payment under these obligations cannot be determined and have been excluded from the table above. see note 16 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information on our pension and other benefit programs.
we have a 40% ownership in occ. under the occ's capital plan, the occ stockholders have committed to contribute up to $200 million in equity capital if certain capital thresholds are breached, including up to $80 million to be contributed by nyse, which has also been excluded from the table above.
in 2016, the sec approved a plan to establish a market-wide consolidated audit trail, or cat, to improve regulators' ability to monitor trading activity. in 2018, the first phase of implementation went live and required participants to begin reporting to the cat, with a phased implementation of the provisions of the cat through 2019. funding of the implementation and operation of the cat is ultimately expected to be provided by both the execution venues and industry members. to date, however, funding has been provided solely by the execution venues in exchange for promissory notes expected to be repaid if industry member fees are approved by the sec and are collected to fund the cat.
new and recently adopted accounting pronouncements refer to note 2 to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report for information on the new and recently adopted accounting pronouncements that are applicable to us.
critical accounting policies we have identified the policies below as critical to our business operations and the understanding of our results of operations. the impact of, and any associated risks related to, these policies on our business operations is discussed throughout "-
management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations." for a detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies, see note 2 to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report.
our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with u.s. gaap. the preparation of financial statements in conformity with these accounting principles requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities, and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities, at the date of our financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
we base our estimates and judgments on our historical experience and other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances when we make these estimates and judgments and re-evaluate them on a periodic basis. based on these factors, we make estimates and judgments about, among other things, the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from market prices or other independent sources and about the recognition and characterization of our revenues and expenses. the values and results based on these estimates and judgments could differ significantly under different assumptions or conditions and could change materially in the future.
we believe that the following critical accounting policies, among others, affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements and could materially increase or decrease our reported results, assets and liabilities.
goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets assets acquired and liabilities assumed in connection with our acquisitions are recorded at their estimated fair values. goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price of an acquired company over the fair value of its identifiable net assets, including identified intangible assets. we recognize specifically identifiable intangibles, such as customer relationships, trademarks, technology, trading products, data, exchange registrations, trade names and licenses when a specific right or contract is acquired. our determination of the fair value of the intangible assets and whether or not these assets may be impaired following their acquisition requires us to apply significant judgments and make significant estimates and assumptions regarding future cash flows. if we change our strategy or if market conditions shift, our judgments and estimates may change, which may result in adjustments to recorded asset balances. intangible assets with finite useful lives are amortized over their estimated useful lives whereas goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are not.
in performing the allocation of the acquisitions' purchase price to assets and liabilities, we consider, among other factors, the intended use of the acquired assets, analysis of past financial performance and estimates of future performance of the acquired business. at the acquisition date, a preliminary allocation of the purchase price is recorded based upon a preliminary valuation performed with the assistance of a third-party valuation specialist. we continue to review and assess our estimates, assumptions and valuation methodologies during the measurement period provided by gaap, which ends as soon as we receive the information about facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date or we learn that more information is not obtainable, which usually does not exceed one year from the date of acquisition. accordingly, these estimates and assumptions are subject to change, which could have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.
we allocate goodwill to reporting units based on the reporting unit expected to benefit from the business combination. we have identified four reporting units: our futures reporting unit, our data and listings reporting unit, our cash equities reporting unit, and our fixed income and cds reporting unit.
our goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets are evaluated for impairment annually in our fiscal fourth quarter or more frequently if conditions exist that indicate that the value may be impaired. we test our goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level. these impairment evaluations are performed by comparing the carrying value of the goodwill or other indefinite-lived intangibles to its estimated fair value.
goodwill impairment testing consists of a two-step methodology. the initial step requires us to determine the fair value of each reporting unit and compare it to the carrying value, including goodwill and other intangible assets, of such reporting unit. if the fair value exceeds the carrying value, no impairment loss is recognized and the second step, which is a calculation of the impairment, is not performed. however, if the carrying value exceeds its fair value, an impairment charge is recorded equal to the extent that the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value. for annual goodwill impairment testing, we have the option to first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, including goodwill and other intangible assets. if we conclude that this is the case, we must perform the two-step methodology described above. otherwise, we can skip the two-step methodology and do not need to perform any further testing. for annual indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment testing, we also have
the option to first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible assets is less than its carrying amount.
application of the impairment test requires judgment, including the identification of reporting units, assignment of assets and liabilities to reporting units, assignment of goodwill to reporting units, and determination of the fair value of each reporting unit. we have historically determined the fair value of our reporting units based on various valuation techniques, including discounted cash flow analysis and a multiple of earnings approach. in assessing whether goodwill and other intangible assets are impaired, we must make estimates and assumptions regarding future cash flows, long-term growth rates of our business, operating margins, discount rates, weighted average cost of capital and other factors to determine the fair value of our assets. these estimates and assumptions require management's judgment, and changes to these estimates and assumptions, as a result of changing economic and competitive conditions, could materially affect the determination of fair value and/or impairment.
the cash flows employed in the discounted cash flow analysis are based on our most recent budgets and business plans and, when applicable, various growth rates have been assumed for years beyond the current business plan period. future events could cause us to conclude that indicators of impairment exist for goodwill or other intangible assets. impairment may result from, among other things, deterioration in the performance of our business, adverse market conditions, adverse changes in applicable laws and regulations, competition, or the sale or disposition of a reporting unit. any resulting impairment loss could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations.
we are also required to evaluate other finite-lived intangible assets and property and equipment for impairment by first determining whether events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of these assets to be held and used may not be recoverable. if impairment indicators are present, then an estimate of undiscounted future cash flows produced by these long-lived assets is compared to the carrying value of those assets to determine if the asset is recoverable. if an asset is not recoverable, the loss is measured as the difference between fair value and carrying value of the impaired asset. fair value of these assets is based on various valuation techniques, including discounted cash flow analysis.
income taxes we are subject to income taxes in the u.s., u.k. and other foreign jurisdictions where we operate. the determination of our provision for income taxes and related accruals, deferred tax assets and liabilities requires the use of significant judgment, estimates, and the interpretation and application of complex tax laws. we recognize a current tax liability or tax asset for the estimated taxes payable or refundable on tax returns for the current year. we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax bases of our assets and liabilities. we establish valuation allowances if we believe that it is more likely than not that some or all of our deferred tax assets will not be realized. deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using current enacted tax rates in effect for the years in which those temporary differences and carryforwards are expected to reverse.
sec staff accounting bulletin no. 118, or sab 118, provided guidance for companies that had not completed their accounting for the income tax effects of the tcja in the period of enactment, allowing for a measurement period of up to one year after the enactment date to finalize the recording of the related tax impacts. as of december 31, 2018, we have completed our accounting for the tax effects of the enactment of the tcja. we reaffirmed our position that we were not subject to transition tax under the tcja as of december 31, 2017. in addition, we concluded that the $764 million of deferred tax benefit recorded in the 2017 financial statements was a reasonable estimate of the tcja's impact on our deferred tax and no further adjustments are necessary.
the fasb staff also provided additional guidance to address the accounting for the effects of the provisions related to the taxation of global intangible low-taxed income noting that companies should make an accounting policy election to recognize deferred taxes for temporary basis differences expected to reverse in future years or to include the tax expense in the year it is incurred. we have completed our analysis of the effects of these provisions and have made a policy election to recognize such taxes as current period expenses when incurred.
we do not recognize a tax benefit unless we conclude that it is more likely than not that the benefit will be sustained on audit by the taxing authority based solely on the technical merits of the associated tax position. if the recognition threshold is met, we recognize a tax benefit measured at the largest amount of the tax benefit that, in our judgment, is greater than 50 percent likely to be realized. we recognize accrued interest and penalties related to uncertain income tax positions as income tax expense in the consolidated statements of income.
we operate within multiple domestic and foreign taxing jurisdictions and are subject to audit in these jurisdictions by domestic and foreign tax authorities. these audits include questions regarding our tax filing positions, including the timing and amount of deductions taken and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions. we record accruals for the estimated
outcomes of these audits, and the accruals may change in the future due to new developments in each matter. at any point in time, many tax years are subject to or in the process of being audited by various taxing authorities. to the extent our estimates of settlements change or the final tax outcome of these matters is different from the amounts recorded, such differences will impact the income tax provision in the period in which such determinations are made. our income tax expense includes changes in our estimated liability for exposures associated with our various tax filing positions. determining the income tax expense for these potential assessments requires management to make assumptions that are subject to factors such as proposed assessments by tax authorities, changes in facts and circumstances, issuance of new regulations, and resolution of tax audits.
item 7 (a).     quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk as a result of our operating and financing activities, we are exposed to market risks such as interest rate risk, foreign currency exchange rate risk and credit risk. we have implemented policies and procedures designed to measure, manage, monitor and report risk exposures, which are regularly reviewed by the appropriate management and supervisory bodies.
interest rate risk we have exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relating to our cash and cash equivalents, short-term and long-term restricted cash, short-term and long-term investments and indebtedness. as of december 31, 2018 and 2017, our cash and cash equivalents, short-term and long-term restricted cash and cash equivalents, and short-term and long-term investments were $2.0 billion and $1.6 billion, respectively, of which $275 million and $293 million, respectively, were denominated in pounds sterling, euros or canadian dollars. the remaining cash and cash equivalents, and short-term and long-term restricted cash and cash equivalents are denominated in u.s. dollars. we do not use our investment portfolio for trading or other speculative purposes. a hypothetical decrease in long-term interest rates to zero basis points would decrease annual pre-tax earnings by $25 million as of december 31, 2018, assuming no change in the amount or composition of our cash and cash equivalents and short-term and long-term restricted cash and cash equivalents.
as of december 31, 2018, we had $7.4 billion in outstanding debt, of which $6.5 billion relates to our senior notes, which bear interest at fixed interest rates. the remaining amount outstanding of $951 million relates to the commercial paper program, which bears interest at fluctuating rates and, therefore, subjects us to interest rate risk. a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in long-term interest rates relating to the amounts outstanding under the commercial paper program as of december 31, 2018 would decrease annual pre-tax earnings by $10 million, assuming no change in the volume or composition of our outstanding indebtedness and no hedging activity. see item 7 "- management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations - debt" included in this annual report.
the interest rates on our commercial paper program are currently evaluated based upon current maturities and market conditions. the weighted average interest rate on our commercial paper program increased from 1.49% as of december 31, 2017 to 2.48% as of december 31, 2018. the increase in the commercial paper program weighted average interest rate was primarily due to the decisions by the u.s. federal reserve in march 2018, june 2018, september 2018, and in december 2018 to increase the federal funds short-term interest rate by an aggregate 100 basis points to 2.50%. the effective interest rate of commercial paper issuance will continue to fluctuate based on the movement in short-term interest rates along with shifts in supply and demand within the commercial paper market.
foreign currency exchange rate risk as an international business, we are subject to foreign currency exchange rate risk. we may experience gains or losses from foreign currency transactions in the future given that a significant part of our assets and liabilities are recorded in pounds sterling, canadian dollars or euros, and a significant portion of our revenues and expenses are recorded in pounds sterling or euros. certain assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses of foreign subsidiaries are denominated in the local functional currency of such subsidiaries. our exposure to foreign denominated earnings in 2018 and 2017 is presented by primary foreign currency in the following table (dollars in millions, except exchange rates):
pound sterling                        euro          pound sterling                        euro average exchange rate to the u.s. dollar in the current year period                 $1.3356                     $1.1813                 $1.2890                     $1.1297

(1)   represents the impact of currency fluctuation for the year compared to the same period in the prior year.
we have a significant part of our assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses recorded in pounds sterling or euros. in 2018, 2017 and 2016, 14%, 15% and 15%, respectively, of our consolidated revenues, less transaction-based expenses, were denominated in pounds sterling or euros, and 13%, 14%, and 18%, respectively, of our consolidated operating expenses were denominated in pounds sterling or euros. as the pound sterling or euro exchange rate changes, the u.s. equivalent of revenues and expenses denominated in foreign currencies changes accordingly.
foreign currency transaction risk related to the settlement of foreign currency denominated assets, liabilities and payables occur through our operations, which are received in or paid in pounds sterling, canadian dollars, or euros, due to the increase or decrease in the foreign currency exchange rates between periods. we incurred foreign currency transaction losses of $2 million, $4 million and $1 million in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. the foreign currency transactions losses were primarily attributable to the fluctuations of the pound sterling and euro relative to the u.s. dollar. a 10% adverse change in the underlying foreign currency exchange rates as of december 31, 2018, assuming no change in the composition of the foreign currency denominated assets, liabilities and payables and assuming no hedging activity, would result in no additional foreign currency gain or loss.
we entered into foreign currency hedging transactions during 2018, 2017 and 2016 as economic hedges to help mitigate a portion of our foreign exchange risk exposure and may enter into additional hedging transactions in the future to help mitigate our foreign exchange risk exposure. although we may enter into additional hedging transactions in the future to help mitigate our foreign exchange risk exposure, these hedging arrangements may not be effective, particularly in the event of imprecise forecasts of the levels of our non-u.s. denominated assets and liabilities.
we have foreign currency translation risk equal to our net investment in our foreign subsidiaries. the financial statements of these subsidiaries are translated into u.s. dollars using a current rate of exchange, with gains or losses included in the cumulative translation adjustment account, a component of equity. our exposure to the net investment in foreign currencies is presented by primary foreign currencies in the table below (in millions):
as of december 31, 2018
of which goodwill represents                                                                  638                                 413                                                      92
negative impact on consolidated equity of a 10% decrease in foreign currency exchange rates   $95                                      $30                                      $11
as of december 31, 2018 and 2017, the portion of our equity attributable to accumulated other comprehensive loss from foreign currency translation was $227 million and $136 million, respectively. in 2018, 2017 and 2016, currency exchange rate differences had a positive/(negative) impact of ($91 million), $209 million and ($300 million), respectively, on our
consolidated equity. the decrease in 2018 is primarily due to the decrease in the pound sterling/u.s. dollar exchange rate to 1.2756 as of december 31, 2018 (from 1.3510 as of december 31, 2017) due to the weakening of the pound sterling as compared to the u.s. dollar. the increase in 2017 is primarily due to the increase in the pound sterling/u.s. dollar exchange rate to 1.3510 as of december 31, 2017 (from 1.2336 as of december 31, 2016) due to the strengthening pound sterling as compared to the u.s. dollar. the future impact on our business relating to the u.k. leaving the eu and the corresponding regulatory changes are uncertain at this time, including future impacts on currency exchange rates.
credit risk we are exposed to credit risk in our operations in the event of a counterparty default. we limit our exposure to credit risk by rigorously selecting the counterparties with which we make our investments, monitoring them on an ongoing basis and executing agreements to protect our interests.
clearing house cash deposit risks the ice clearing houses hold material amounts of clearing member cash and cash equivalent deposits which are held or invested primarily to provide security of capital while minimizing credit, market and liquidity risks. refer to note 14 to our consolidated financial statements for more information on the ice clearing houses' cash and cash equivalent deposits, which were $64.0 billion as of december 31, 2018. while we seek to achieve a reasonable rate of return which may generate interest income for our clearing members, we are primarily concerned with preservation of capital and managing the risks associated with these deposits. as the ice clearing houses may pass on interest revenues (minus costs) to the clearing members, this could include negative or reduced yield due to market conditions. the following is a summary of the risks associated with these deposits and how these risks are mitigated.
â€¢   credit risk: when a clearing house has the ability to hold cash collateral at a central bank, the clearing house utilizes its access to the central bank system to minimize credit risk exposures. credit risk is monitored by using exposure limits depending on ratings assigned by rating agencies as well as the nature and maturity of transactions. our investment objective is to invest in securities that preserve principal while maximizing yields, without significantly increasing risk. we seek to substantially mitigate credit risk associated with investments by placing them with governments, well-capitalized financial institutions and other creditworthy counterparties.
an ongoing review is performed to evaluate changes in the financial status of counterparties. in addition to the intrinsic creditworthiness of counterparties, our policies require diversification of counterparties (banks, financial institutions, bond issuers and funds) so as to avoid a concentration of risk.
â€¢   liquidity risk: liquidity risk is the risk a clearing house may not be able to meet its payment obligations in the right currency, in the right place and the right time. to mitigate this risk, the clearing houses monitor liquidity requirements closely and maintain funds and assets in a manner which minimizes the risk of loss or delay in the access by the clearing house to such funds and assets. for example, holding funds with a central bank where possible or making only short term investments such as overnight reverse repurchase agreements serves to reduce liquidity risks.
â€¢   interest rate risk: interest rate risk is the risk that interest rates rise and cause the value of securities we hold or invest in to decline. if we were required to sell securities prior to maturity, and interest rates had risen, the sale might be made at a loss relative to the carrying value. our clearing houses seek to manage this risk by making short term investments. for example, where possible and in accordance with regulatory requirements, the clearing houses invest cash pursuant to overnight reverse repurchase agreements or term reverse repurchase agreements with short dated maturities. in addition, the clearing house investment guidelines allow for direct purchases of high quality sovereign debt (for example, u.s. treasury securities) and supranational debt instruments (euro cash deposits only) with short dated maturities.
â€¢   security issuer risk: security issuer risk is the risk that an issuer of a security defaults on the payment when the security matures or debt is serviced. this risk is mitigated by limiting allowable investments under the reverse repurchase agreements to high quality sovereign or government agency debt and limiting any direct investments to high quality sovereign debt instruments.
â€¢   investment counterparty risk: investment counterparty risk is the risk that a reverse repurchase agreement counterparty might become insolvent and, thus, fail to meet its obligations to our clearing houses. we mitigate this risk by only engaging in transactions with high credit quality counterparties and by limiting the acceptable collateral to securities of high quality issuers. when engaging in reverse repurchase agreements, our clearing houses take delivery of the securities underlying the reverse repurchase arrangement in custody accounts under clearing house
control. additionally, the securities purchased subject to reverse repurchase have a market value greater than the reverse repurchase amount. the typical haircut for high quality sovereign debt is 2% of the reverse repurchase amount which provides additional excess collateral. thus, in the event that a reverse repurchase counterparty defaults on its obligation to repurchase the underlying reverse repurchase securities, our clearing house will have possession of a security with a value potentially greater than the counterparty's obligation.
the ice clearing houses may use third-party investment advisors who make investments subject to the guidelines provided by each clearing house. such advisors do not hold clearing member cash or cash equivalent deposits or the underlying investments. clearing house property is held in custody accounts under clearing house control with credit worthy custodians including jpmorgan chase bank n.a., citibank n.a., bny mellon, bmo harris n.a. and euroclear bank brussels (for non-u.s. dollar deposits). the ice clearing houses employ (or may employ) multiple investment advisors and custodians to ensure that in the event a single advisor or custodian is unable to fulfill its role, additional advisors or custodians are available as alternatives.
â€¢   cross-currency margin deposit risk: each of the ice clearing houses may permit posting of cross-currency collateral to satisfy margin requirements (for example, accepting margin deposits denominated in u.s. dollars to secure a euro margin obligation). the ice clearing houses mitigate the risk of a currency value exposure by applying a "haircut" to the currency posted as margin at a level viewed as sufficient to provide financial protection during periods of currency volatility. cross-currency balances are marked-to-market on a daily basis. should the currency posted to satisfy margin requirements decline in value, the clearing member is required to increase its margin deposit on a same-day basis.
impact of inflation we have not been adversely affected by inflation as technological advances and competition have generally caused prices for the hardware and software that we use for our electronic platforms to remain constant. in the event of inflation, we believe that we will be able to pass on any price increases to our participants, as the prices that we charge are not governed by long-term contracts.

report of management on internal control over financial reporting our management is responsible for the preparation and integrity of the consolidated financial statements appearing in our annual report on form 10-k. the financial statements were prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles appropriate in the circumstances and, accordingly, include certain amounts based on our best judgments and estimates.
our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as such term is defined in rule 13a-15(f) and 15d-a5(f) under the securities exchange act of 1934 ("exchange act"). our internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of the consolidated financial statements. our internal control over financial reporting is supported by a program of internal audits and appropriate reviews by management, written policies and guidelines, careful selection and training of qualified personnel and a written global code of business conduct adopted by our board of directors, applicable to all of our directors and all officers and all of our employees.
because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements and even when determined to be effective, can only provide reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation. also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

report of independent registered public accounting firm on internal control over financial reporting to the stockholders and the board of directors of intercontinental exchange, inc.
opinion on internal control over financial reporting we have audited intercontinental exchange, inc. and subsidiaries' internal control over financial reporting as of december 31, 2018, based on criteria established in internal control-integrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission (2013 framework) (the coso criteria). in our opinion, intercontinental exchange, inc. and subsidiaries (the company) maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of december 31, 2018, based on the coso criteria.
we also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board (united states) (pcaob), the consolidated balance sheets of the company as of december 31, 2018 and 2017, and the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, changes in equity, accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) and redeemable non-controlling interest, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended december 31, 2018, and the related notes, and our report dated february 7, 2019 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.
basis for opinion the company's management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying "report of management on internal control over financial reporting". our responsibility is to express an opinion on the company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. we are a public accounting firm registered with the pcaob and are required to be independent with respect to the company in accordance with the u.s. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the securities and exchange commission and the pcaob.
we conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the pcaob. those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.
our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. we believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
definition and limitations of internal control over financial reporting a company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. a company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

intercontinental exchange, inc. and subsidiaries notes to consolidated financial statements
1.   description of business nature of business and organization we are a leading global operator of regulated exchanges, clearing houses and listings venues, and a provider of data services for commodity, financial, fixed income and equity markets. we operate regulated marketplaces for listing, trading and clearing a broad array of derivatives contracts and securities across major asset classes, including energy and agricultural commodities, metals, interest rates, equities, exchange-traded funds, or etfs, credit derivatives, bonds and currencies. we also offer comprehensive data services to support the trading, investment, risk management and connectivity needs of customers around the world and across asset classes.
our exchanges include derivative exchanges in the united states, or u.s., united kingdom, or u.k., european union or eu, canada and singapore, and cash equities, equity options and bond exchanges in the u.s. we also operate over-the-counter, or otc, markets for physical energy, fixed income, and credit default swaps, or cds, trade execution. to serve global derivatives markets, we operate central counterparty clearing houses, or ccps, in the u.s., u.k., eu, canada and singapore (note 14). we offer a range of data services for global financial and commodity markets, including pricing and reference data, exchange data, analytics, feeds, index services, desktops and connectivity solutions. through our markets, clearing houses, listings and data services, we provide comprehensive solutions for our customers through liquid markets, benchmark products, access to capital markets, and related services to support their ability to manage risk and raise capital. our business is currently conducted as two reportable segments, our trading and clearing segment and our data and listings segment, and the majority of our identifiable assets are located in the u.s. and u.k. (note 18).
2.   summary of significant accounting policies basis of presentation the accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared by us in accordance with u.s. generally accepted accounting principles, or u.s. gaap. these statements include the accounts of our wholly-owned and controlled subsidiaries. for consolidated subsidiaries in which our ownership is less than 100% and for which we have control over the assets and liabilities and the management of the entity, the outside stockholders' interests are shown as non-controlling interests (note 3).
all intercompany balances and transactions between us and our wholly-owned and controlled subsidiaries have been eliminated in consolidation. as discussed in note 3, the financial results of companies we acquire are included from the acquisition dates and the results of companies we sold are included up to the disposition dates. the accounting policies used to prepare these financial statements are the same as those used to prepare the consolidated financial statements in prior years except as described in these footnotes or for the adoption of new standards as outlined below.
use of estimates preparing financial statements in conformity with u.s. gaap requires us to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying disclosures. actual amounts could differ from those estimates.
comprehensive income other comprehensive income includes changes in fair value of net investment hedges, foreign currency translation adjustments, comprehensive income from equity method investments, and amortization of the difference in the projected benefit obligation and the accumulated benefit obligation associated with benefit plan liabilities, net of tax. prior to the january 1, 2018 adoption of accounting standards update, or asu, no. 2016-01, see "-recently adopted accounting pronouncements" below, other comprehensive income included changes in unrealized gains and losses on financial instruments classified as available-for-sale.
segment and geographic information we operate and present our results based on our two business segments: the trading and clearing segment that comprises our transaction-based execution and clearing businesses and the data and listings segment that comprises our subscription-based data services and securities listings businesses. this presentation is reflective of how our chief
operating decision maker reviews and operates our business. the majority of our identifiable assets are located in the u.s and u.k.
cash and cash equivalents we consider all short-term, highly liquid investments with original maturities at the purchase date of three months or less to be cash equivalents.
short-term and long-term restricted cash and cash equivalents we classify all cash and cash equivalents that are not available for immediate or general business use by us as restricted in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets (note 6). this includes amounts set aside due to regulatory requirements, earmarked for specific purposes, or restricted by specific agreements. we also invest a portion of funds in excess of short-term operating needs in term deposits and investment-grade marketable debt securities, including government or government sponsored agencies and corporate debt securities. these are classified as cash equivalents, are short-term in nature and carrying amount approximates fair value.
investments we have made various investments in the equity securities of other companies. we also invest in mutual funds and fixed income securities. these investments are carried at fair value, with changes in fair value, whether realized or unrealized, recognized in net income.
investments in equity securities, or equity investments, are carried at fair value, with changes in fair value, whether realized or unrealized, recognized in net income. fair value is determined using quoted prices in active markets for identical securities, when available. for those investments that do not have readily determinable fair market values, such as those which are not publicly-listed companies, we have made a fair value policy election under asu no. 2016-01, financial instruments - overall (subtopic 825-10): recognition and measurement of financial assets and financial liabilities, or asu 2016-01, discussed further below. the election requires us to only adjust the fair value of such investments if and when there is an observable price change in an orderly transaction of a similar or identical investment, with any change in fair value recognized in net income. investments that we intend to hold for more than one year are classified as other non-current assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. see "recently adopted accounting pronouncements" below for the new financial instruments accounting standard and its impact on the accounting for our investments.
when we do not have a controlling financial interest in an entity but exercise significant influence over the entity's operating and financial policies, such investments are accounted for using the equity method and included in other non-current assets. we recognize dividends when declared as a reduction in the carrying value of our equity method investments.
margin deposits, guaranty funds and delivery contracts receivable and payable original margin, variation margin and guaranty funds held by our clearing houses may be in the form of cash, government obligations, certain agency debt, letters of credit or gold (note 14). government, agency and corporate securities held for margin purposes are recorded at an amount that approximates fair value. cash and cash equivalent original margin, variation margin and guaranty fund deposits are reflected as current assets and current liabilities. the amount of margin deposits on hand will fluctuate over time as a result of, among other things, the extent of open positions held at any point in time by market participants in contracts and the margin rates then in effect for such contracts. changes in our margin accounts are not reflected in our consolidated statements of cash flows. non-cash and cash equivalent original margin and guaranty fund deposits are not reflected in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets as the risks and rewards of these assets remain with the clearing members unless the clearing houses have sold or re-pledged the assets or in the event of a clearing member default, where the clearing member is no longer entitled to redeem the assets. any income, gain or loss accrues to the clearing members.
ice ngx, which we acquired in december 2017, owns a clearing house which administers the physical delivery of energy trading contracts. it serves as an intermediary counterparty to both the buyer and seller. when physical delivery has occurred and/or settlement amounts have been determined, an asset is recorded as a delivery contract receivable and an offsetting payable is recorded for the amounts owed to or due from the contract participants. amounts recorded at period-end represent receivables and payables for deliveries that have occurred but for which payment has not been received or made. there is no impact on our consolidated statements of income as an equal amount is recognized as
both an asset and a liability. ice ngx also records unsettled variation margin equal to the fair value of open energy trading contracts as of the balance sheet date.
property and equipment property and equipment is recorded at cost, reduced by accumulated depreciation (note 7). depreciation and amortization is computed using the straight-line method based on estimated useful lives of the assets, or in the case of leasehold improvements, the shorter of the initial lease term or the estimated useful life of the improvement. we review the remaining estimated useful lives at each balance sheet date and make adjustments whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the remaining useful lives have changed. gains on disposals are included in other income and losses on disposals are included in depreciation expense. maintenance and repair costs are expensed as incurred.
allowance for doubtful accounts the allowance for doubtful accounts is maintained at a level that we believe to be sufficient to absorb probable losses in our accounts receivable portfolio. the allowance is based on several factors, including a continuous assessment of the collectability of each account. in circumstances where a specific customer's inability to meet its financial obligations is known, we record a specific provision for bad debts against amounts due to reduce the receivable to the amount we reasonably believe will be collected. accounts receivable are written-off against the allowance for doubtful accounts when collection efforts cease. a reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of allowance for doubtful accounts is as follows for 2018, 2017 and 2016 (in millions):
beginning balance of allowance for doubtful accounts        $6                  $7                  $2
charge-offs                                                 (7    )             (5    )              -
ending balance of allowance for doubtful accounts           $7                  $6                  $7
bad debt expense in the table above is based on our historical collection experiences and our assessment of the collectability of specific accounts. charge-offs in the table above represent the write-off of uncollectible receivables, net of recoveries. these amounts also include the impact of foreign currency translation adjustments.
software development costs we capitalize costs related to software we develop or obtain for internal use. the costs capitalized include both internal and external direct and incremental costs. general and administrative costs related to developing or obtaining such software are expensed as incurred. development costs incurred during the preliminary or maintenance project stages are expensed as incurred. costs incurred during the application development stage are capitalized and amortized using the straight-line method over the useful life of the software, generally not exceeding three years (except for certain ice data services and nyse platforms, which have seven-year useful lives). amortization begins only when the software becomes ready for its intended use.
accrued employee benefits we have a defined benefit pension plan and other postretirement benefit plans, or collectively the "benefit plans," covering certain of our u.s. operations. the benefit accrual for the pension plan is frozen. we recognize the funded status of the benefit plans in our consolidated balance sheets, measure the fair value of plan assets and benefit obligations as of the date of our fiscal year-end, and provide additional disclosures in the footnotes (note 16).
benefit plan costs and liabilities are dependent on assumptions used in calculating such amounts. these are provided by a third-party and include discount rates, health care cost trend rates, benefits earned, interest cost, expected return on assets, mortality rates and other factors. actual results that differ from the assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods and, therefore, generally affect recognized expense and the recorded obligation in future periods. however, certain of these unrecognized amounts are recognized when triggering events occur, such as when a settlement of pension obligations in excess of total interest and service costs occurs. while we believe that the assumptions used are appropriate, differences in actual experience or changes in assumptions may affect our pension and other post-retirement obligations and future expense recognized.
goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price of our acquisitions over the fair value of identifiable net assets acquired, including other identified intangible assets (note 8). we recognize specifically identifiable intangibles when a specific right or contract is acquired. with the assistance of third-party valuation specialists, goodwill has been allocated to our reporting units for purposes of impairment testing based on the portion of synergy, cost savings and other expected future cash flows expected to benefit the reporting units at the time of the acquisition. the reporting units identified for our goodwill testing are the futures, data and listings, cash equities and credit default swap reporting units. goodwill impairment testing is performed annually at the reporting unit level in the fiscal fourth quarter or more frequently if conditions exist that indicate that it may be impaired.
we also evaluate indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment annually in our fiscal fourth quarter or more frequently if conditions exist that indicate that an asset may be impaired.
for both goodwill and indefinite-lived impairment testing, we have the option to first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit or indefinite lived intangible asset is less than its carrying amount. if we conclude that this is the case, we must perform additional testing of the asset or reporting unit. otherwise, no further testing is necessary. if the fair value of the goodwill or indefinite-lived intangible asset is less than its carrying value, an impairment loss is recognized in earnings in an amount equal to the difference.
other than the net loss of $6 million on the divestiture of nyse governance services as discussed in note 3, we did not record an impairment charge related to goodwill or indefinite-lived intangible assets during 2018, 2017 or 2016.
impairment of long-lived assets and finite-lived intangible assets we review our property and equipment and finite-lived intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be fully recoverable. when these indicators exist, we project undiscounted net future cash flows over the remaining life of such assets. if the sum of the projected cash flows is less than the carrying amount, an impairment would exist, measured based upon the difference between the carrying amount and the fair value of the assets. finite-lived intangible assets are generally amortized using the straight-line method or an accelerated method over the lesser of their contractual or estimated useful lives.
during the third quarter of 2016, we discontinued creditex's u.k. voice brokerage operations and an impairment of the asset was recorded for $33 million as amortization expense.
derivatives and hedging activity periodically, we may use derivative financial instruments to manage exposure to changes in currency exchange rates. all derivatives are recorded at fair value. we generally do not designate these derivatives as hedges for accounting purposes. accordingly, changes in fair value are recognized in income.
from time to time, we may also hedge the impact of currency translation arising from certain of our non-u.s. investments by designating as hedges all or a portion of certain financial liabilities denominated in the same currency as the investments. we entered into foreign currency hedging transactions during 2018, 2017 and 2016 as economic hedges to help mitigate a portion of our foreign exchange risk exposure. the gains and losses on these transactions were not material during these years.
intellectual property all costs related to internally developed patents and trademarks are expensed as incurred. all costs related to purchased patents, trademarks and internet domain names are recorded as other intangible assets and are amortized using a straight-line method over their estimated useful lives. all costs related to licensed patents are capitalized and amortized using a straight-line method over the term of the license.
income taxes we recognize income taxes under the liability method. we recognize a current tax liability or tax asset for the estimated taxes payable or refundable on tax returns for the current year. we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax bases of assets and liabilities. we establish valuation allowances if we believe that it is more likely than not that some or all of our deferred tax assets will not be realized. deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using current enacted
tax rates in effect. we do not recognize a tax benefit unless we conclude that it is more likely than not that the benefit will be sustained on audit by the taxing authority based solely on the technical merits of the associated tax position. if the recognition threshold is met, we recognize a tax benefit measured at the largest amount of the tax benefit that, in our judgment, is greater than 50 percent likely to be realized. we recognize accrued interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions as a component of income tax expense.
we are subject to tax in numerous domestic and foreign jurisdictions primarily based on our operations in these jurisdictions. significant judgment is required in assessing the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns. fluctuations in the actual outcome of these future tax consequences could have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations.
during 2018, we completed our accounting for the tax effects of the enactment of the tax cuts and jobs act, or tcja. we reaffirmed our position that we were not subject to transition tax as of december 31, 2017 under the tcja. in addition, we concluded that the $764 million of deferred tax benefit recorded in the 2017 income tax provision was a reasonable estimate of the tcja's effects on our deferred tax balances.
the financial accounting standards board, or fasb, staff also provided additional guidance to address the accounting for the effects of the provisions related to the taxation of global intangible low-taxed income noting that companies should make an accounting policy election to recognize deferred taxes for temporary basis differences expected to reverse as global intangible low-taxed income in future years or to include the tax expense in the year it is incurred. we have completed our analysis of the effects of these provisions and have made a policy election to recognize such taxes as current period expenses when incurred.
we use a portfolio approach with respect to pension, postretirement benefits plan obligations and currency translation matters when we determine the timing and extent to which stranded income tax effects from items that were previously recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income are released.
revenue recognition our revenues primarily consist of transaction and clearing fee revenues for transactions executed and/or cleared through our global electronic derivatives trading and clearing platforms and cash equities trading as well as revenues related to our data services fees and listing fees. we recognize revenue when we transfer promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which we expect to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. we enter into contracts that can include various combinations of products and services, which are generally capable of being distinct and accounted for as separate performance obligations. we also evaluate all contracts in order to determine appropriate gross versus net revenue reporting.
substantially all of our revenues are considered to be revenues from contracts with customers. the related accounts receivable balances are recorded in our balance sheets as customer accounts receivable. we do not have obligations for warranties, returns or refunds to customers, other than the rebates, which are settled each period and therefore, do not result in variable consideration. we do not have significant revenue recognized from performance obligations that were satisfied in prior periods, and we do not have any transaction price allocated to unsatisfied performance obligations other than in our deferred revenue. certain judgments and estimates are used in the identification and timing of satisfaction of performance obligations and the related allocation of transaction price. we believe that these represent a faithful depiction of the transfer of services to our customers.
deferred revenue represents our contract liabilities related to our annual, original and other listings revenues as well as certain data services, clearing services and other revenues. deferred revenue is our only significant contract asset or liability. see note 9 for our discussion of deferred revenue balances, activity, and expected timing of recognition.
we have elected not to provide disclosures about transaction price allocated to unsatisfied performance obligations if contract durations are less than one year, or if we are not required to estimate the transaction price. for all of our contracts with customers, except for listings and certain data and clearing services, our performance obligations are short term in nature and there is no significant variable consideration. in addition, we have elected the practical expedient of excluding sales taxes from transaction prices. we have assessed the costs incurred to obtain or fulfill a contract with a customer and determined them to be immaterial.
see "recently adopted accounting pronouncements" below for the new revenue recognition accounting standard and its impact on our revenues.
activity assessment fees and section 31 fees we pay the securities and exchange commission, or sec, fees pursuant to section 31 of the securities exchange act of 1934 for transactions executed on our u.s. equities and options exchanges. these section 31 fees are designed to recover the costs to the government for supervising and regulating the securities markets and securities professionals. we (or the occ on our behalf), in turn, collect activity assessment fees, which are included in transaction and clearing fees in the accompanying consolidated statements of income, from member organizations clearing or settling trades on the u.s. equities and options exchanges and recognize these amounts as revenue when invoiced. fees received are included in cash at the time of receipt and, as required by law, the amount due to the sec is remitted semi-annually and recorded as an accrued liability until paid. the activity assessment fees are designed so that they are equal to the section 31 fees paid by us to the sec. as a result, section 31 fees do not have an impact on our net income.
stock-based compensation we currently sponsor stock option plans, restricted stock plans and our employee stock purchase plan, or espp, to provide additional and incentive-based compensation to our employees and directors (note 11). stock options and restricted stock are granted at the discretion of the compensation committee of the board of directors. we measure and recognize compensation expense for all share-based payment awards, including employee stock options, restricted stock and shares purchased under the espp based on estimated fair values on the date of grant. the value of the portion of the award that is ultimately expected to vest is recognized as stock-based compensation expense over the requisite service period.
we use the black-scholes pricing model to value stock option awards as well as shares purchased as part of our espp. the values estimated by the model are affected by the price of our stock as well as subjective variables that include assumed interest rates, our expected dividend yield, our expected share price volatility over the term of the awards and actual and projected employee stock option exercise behavior. under our espp, employees may purchase shares of our common stock at a price equal to 85% of the lesser of the fair market value of the stock on the first or the last trading day of each offering period. we record compensation expenses related to the 15% discount given to our participating employees.
treasury stock we record treasury stock activities under the cost method whereby the cost of the acquired stock is recorded as treasury stock (note 12). we retired all of our outstanding treasury shares effective october 27, 2016, the record date of our 5-for-1 stock split which was reflected in our results retroactively. our accounting policy upon the formal retirement of treasury stock is to deduct the par value from common stock and to reflect any excess of cost over par value as a deduction from additional paid-in capital (to the extent created by previous issuances of the shares) and retained earnings.
credit risk and significant customers our clearing houses are exposed to credit risk as a result of maintaining clearing member cash deposits at various financial institutions (note 14). cash deposit accounts are established at large, highly-rated financial institutions and entered into so that they restrict the rights of offset or imposition of liens by the banks. we also limit our risk of loss by holding the majority of the cash deposits in cash accounts at the federal reserve bank of chicago, high quality short-term sovereign debt reverse repurchase agreements with several different counterparty banks or direct investments in short-term high quality sovereign and supranational debt issues primarily with original maturities of less than three months. while we seek to achieve a reasonable rate of return which may generate interest income for our clearing members, we are primarily concerned with preservation of capital and managing the risks associated with these deposits. as the clearing houses may pass on interest revenues, minus costs, to the members, this could include negative or reduced yield due to market conditions.
when engaging in reverse repurchase agreements, our clearing houses take delivery of the underlying securities in custody accounts under clearing house control. additionally, the securities purchased have a market value greater than the reverse repurchase amount. the typical haircut received for high quality sovereign debt is 2% of the reverse repurchase amount. thus, in the event that a reverse repurchase counterparty defaults on its obligation to repurchase the underlying reverse repurchase securities, our clearing house will have possession of securities with a value potentially greater than the reverse repurchase counterparty's obligation to the clearing house.
ice clear credit, a systemically important financial market utility as designated by the financial stability oversight council, maintains a u.s. dollar account at the federal reserve bank of chicago as of december 31, 2018. ice clear europe
maintains a euro-denominated account at the de nederlandsche bank, or dnb, the central bank of the netherlands, as well as a pounds sterling-denominated account at the bank of england, or boe, the central bank of the u.k. these accounts provide the flexibility for ice clear europe to place euro- and pounds sterling-denominated cash margin securely at national banks, in particular during periods when liquidity in the euro and pounds sterling repo markets may temporarily become contracted. such accounts are intended to decrease ice clear credit and ice clear europe's custodial, liquidity and operational risk as compared to alternative custodial and investment arrangements.
our futures businesses have minimal credit risk as the majority of their transaction revenues are currently cleared through our clearing houses. our accounts receivable related to market data revenues, cash trading, listing revenues, technology revenues, cds transaction revenues and bilateral otc energy transaction revenues subjects us to credit (collection) risk, as we do not require these customers to post collateral. we limit our risk of loss by terminating access to trade, remain listed or receive data for entities with delinquent accounts. the concentration of risk on accounts receivable is also mitigated by the large number of entities comprising our customer base.
our accounts receivable are stated at the billed amount. excluding clearing members, there were no individual accounts receivable balances greater than 10% of total consolidated accounts receivable as of december 31, 2018 or december 31, 2017. no single customer accounted for more than 10% of total consolidated revenues during 2018, 2017 or 2016.
leases we expense rent from non-cancellable operating leases, net of sublease income, using a straight-line method based on future minimum lease payments. the net costs are included in rent and occupancy expenses and technology and communication expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements of income (note 15).
acquisition-related transaction and integration costs we incur incremental costs relating to our completed and potential acquisitions and other strategic opportunities. this includes fees for investment banking advisors, lawyers, accountants, tax advisors and public relations firms, deal-related bonuses to certain of our employees, as well as costs associated with credit facilities and other external costs directly related to the proposed or closed transactions.
the acquisition-related transaction and integration costs incurred during 2018 primarily relate to employee termination and lease termination costs related to our interactive data acquisition, professional services costs resulting from our 2018 acquisitions and a $5 million banker success fee in connection with our acquisition of tmc bonds. the acquisition-related transaction and integration costs incurred during 2017 primarily relate to costs incurred for our interactive data integration, legal and professional fees related to the trayport cma review, and various other costs incurred for our other acquisitions that closed during 2017. the acquisition-related transaction and integration costs incurred during 2016 primarily relate to costs incurred for our interactive data and nyse integrations, legal and professional fees related to the trayport cma review, our investment in merscorp holdings, inc., owner of mortgage electronic registrations systems, inc., or collectively mers, our acquisition of s&p securities evaluations and credit market analysis, and various other potential and discontinued acquisitions. the integration of nyse was completed by june 30, 2016, and the integration of interactive data was completed by june 30, 2018.
fair value of financial instruments fair value is the price that would be received from selling an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. our financial instruments consist primarily of certain short-term and long-term assets and liabilities, customer accounts receivable, margin deposits and guaranty funds, equity investments, and short-term and long-term debt (note 17).
the fair value of our financial instruments is measured based on a three-level hierarchy:
â€¢   level 1 inputs - quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets.
â€¢   level 2 inputs - observable inputs other than level 1 inputs such as quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets or inputs other than quoted prices that are directly observable.
â€¢   level 3 inputs - unobservable inputs supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities.
foreign currency translation adjustments and foreign currency transaction gains and losses our functional and reporting currency is the u.s. dollar. we have exposure to foreign currency translation gains and losses arising from our net investment in certain u.k., continental european, asian and canadian subsidiaries. the revenues, expenses and financial results of these subsidiaries are recorded in the functional currency of the countries that these subsidiaries are located in, which are primarily pounds sterling and euros. the financial statements of these subsidiaries are translated into u.s. dollars using a current rate of exchange, with gains or losses, net of tax as applicable, included in the cumulative translation adjustment account, a component of equity. as of december 31, 2018 and 2017, the portion of our equity attributable to accumulated other comprehensive loss from foreign currency translation adjustments was $227 million and $136 million, respectively.
we have foreign currency transaction gains and losses related to the settlement of foreign currency denominated assets, liabilities and payables that occur through our operations. these transaction gains and losses are due to the increase or decrease in the foreign currency exchange rates between periods. forward contracts on foreign currencies are entered into to manage the foreign currency exchange rate risk. gains and losses from foreign currency transactions are included in other income (expense) in the accompanying consolidated statements of income and resulted in net losses of $2 million, $4 million and $1 million in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively.
earnings per common share basic earnings per common share is calculated using the weighted average common shares outstanding during the year. common equivalent shares from stock options and restricted stock awards, using the treasury stock method, are included in the diluted per share calculations unless the effect of inclusion would be antidilutive (note 19).
recently adopted accounting pronouncements the fasb has issued accounting standards codification, or asc, topic 606, revenue from contracts with customers, and asc 340-40, other assets and deferred costs - contracts with customers, collectively referred to as asc 606. asc 606 provides guidance outlining a single comprehensive model for entities to use in accounting for revenue arising from contracts with customers. asc 606 superseded prior revenue recognition guidance and requires us to recognize revenue when we transfer promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. asc 606 requires enhanced disclosures, including (i) revenue recognition policies used to identify performance obligations to customers and (ii) the use of significant judgments in measurement and recognition.
on january 1, 2018, we adopted asc 606 retrospectively and restated each prior period presented. our adoption of asc 606 accelerated the timing of recognition of a portion of original listing fees related to our new york stock exchange, or nyse, businesses. in addition, and to a lesser extent, the adoption decelerated the timing of recognition of a portion of clearing fee revenues. the impact of our adoption of asc 606 on our performance obligations in our clearing business was minimal. revenue recognition related to all other trading, clearing and data businesses remained unchanged. our adoption of asc 606 was subject to the same internal controls over financial reporting that we apply to our consolidated financial statements.
our adoption of asc 606 had the following impact on our reported results for the prior periods presented, driven primarily by the accelerated recognition of listings fee revenue in our nyse businesses (in millions, except earnings per share):
as reported           new revenue standard adjustment       as adjusted year ended december 31, 2017

as reported           new revenue standard adjustment          as adjusted as of december 31, 2017
additional disclosures related to our adoption of asc 606 are provided in note 5.
the fasb has issued asu no. 2017-07, compensation-retirement benefits (topic 715): improving the presentation of net periodic pension cost and net periodic postretirement benefit cost, or asu 2017-07. the amendments in asu 2017-07 require that an employer disaggregate the service cost component from the other components of net benefit cost. the amendments also provide explicit guidance on how to present the service cost component in the same line item as other related compensation costs, and the other components of net benefit cost in the income statement outside of operating income. the guidance only allows the service cost component of net benefit cost to be eligible for capitalization. we adopted asu 2017-07 on january 1, 2018 and applied it retrospectively to each prior period presented. we have a pension plan, a u.s. nonqualified supplemental executive retirement plan, and post-retirement defined benefit plans that are all impacted by the guidance. each of the foregoing plans are frozen and do not have a service cost component, which means the expense or benefit recognized under each plan represents other components of net benefit cost as defined in the guidance. the combined net periodic (expense) benefit of these plans was ($8 million) and $9 million in 2018 and 2017, respectively, and was previously reported as an adjustment to compensation and benefits expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements of income. following our adoption of asu 2017-07, these amounts were reclassified to be included in other income, net, in the accompanying consolidated statements of income, and these adjustments had no impact on net income.
the fasb has issued asu no. 2016-01, which provides updated guidance for the recognition, measurement, presentation, and disclosure of certain financial assets and liabilities, including the requirement that equity investments (except (i) those accounted for under the equity method of accounting or (ii) those that result in consolidation of the investee) are to be measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in net income. we adopted asu 2016-01 on january 1, 2018. our adoption of asu 2016-01 did not result in any fair value adjustments on the date of adoption or during 2018. we have made a policy election under asu 2016-01 to only adjust the fair value of such investments if and when there is an observable price change in an orderly transaction of a similar or identical investment, with any change in fair value recognized in net income.
in december 2017, the sec staff issued staff accounting bulletin no. 118, or sab 118, which provided guidance for companies that have not completed their accounting for the income tax effects of the tcja in the period of enactment, allowing for a measurement period of up to one year after the enactment date to finalize the recording of the related tax impacts. as of december 31, 2018, we have completed our accounting for the tax effects of the enactment of the tcja. we reaffirmed our position that we were not subject to transition tax under the tcja. in addition, we concluded that the $764 million deferred tax benefit recorded as of december 31, 2017 was a reasonable estimate of the tcja impact on our deferred tax.
in january 2018, the fasb staff issued question & answer topic 740, no. 5, accounting for global intangible low-taxed income, stating that a company may either elect to treat taxes due on future inclusions of its non-u.s. income in its u.s. taxable income under the newly enacted global intangible low-taxed income provisions as a current period expense when incurred, or factor them into the company's measurement of its deferred taxes. as of december 31, 2018, we have completed our analysis of the two different accounting policies and have made a policy election to recognize such tax as a current period expense when incurred.
the fasb has issued asu no. 2018-02, reclassification of certain tax effects from accumulative other comprehensive income, or asu 2018-02. asu 2018-02 gives entities the option to reclassify to retained earnings certain tax effects related to items in accumulated other comprehensive income, or oci, that have been stranded in oci as a result of the enactment of the tcja. the guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after december 15, 2018 with early adoption permitted. we have elected early adoption and adopted asu 2018-02 on december 31, 2018. the impact of our adoption was a balance sheet reclassification from oci to retained earnings of $26 million, which is reflected in our consolidated balance sheet as of december 31, 2018. in connection with our adoption of asu 2018-02, we made a policy election to use a portfolio approach with respect to pension, postretirement benefits plan obligations and currency translation matters when we determine the timing and extent to which stranded income tax effects from items that were previously recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income are released.
in the fourth quarter of 2017, we adopted asu 2016-18, statement of cash flows: restricted cash, or asu 2016-18, which requires us to show the changes in the total of cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash and cash equivalents in the statement of cash flows. as a result, we no longer present transfers between cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash and cash equivalents in the statement of cash flows. we have reclassified changes in restricted cash from cash flows provided by (used in) investing activities, to the total change in beginning and end-of-period balances. our statements of cash flows for 2018, 2017 and 2016 reflect this change.
in march 2016, we early adopted asu no. 2016-09, stock compensation (topic 718) - improvements to employee share-based payment accounting, or asu 2016-09, on a prospective basis. under the requirements of asu 2016-09, we recognized $15 million in excess tax benefits for tax deductions in excess of cumulative compensation expenses for financial reporting purposes in 2016 through our consolidated statement of income.
accounting pronouncements not yet adopted the fasb has issued asu no. 2016-02, leases, or asu 2016-02. asu 2016-02 requires an entity to recognize both assets and liabilities arising from finance and operating leases, along with additional qualitative and quantitative disclosures. it requires a lessee to recognize a liability in its balance sheet to make lease payments (the lease liability) and a right-of-use asset representing its right to use the underlying asset for the lease term. in transition, lessees and lessors are required to recognize and measure leases at the beginning of the earliest period presented using a modified retrospective approach. asu 2016-02 is required to be adopted at the beginning of our first quarter of fiscal year 2019. we expect to record a right-of-use asset of approximately $315 million, eliminate deferred rent of approximately $50 million and record a lease liability of approximately $365 million on our adoption date of january 1, 2019, primarily related to our leased office space and data center facilities. we will elect the alternative transition approach allowed under asu 2016-02, under which we will record a cumulative effect adjustment to retained earnings on january 1, 2019, and will not restate prior periods. we expect to implement new accounting policies as well as to elect certain practical expedients available to us under asu 2016-02, including those related to capitalization thresholds, leases with terms of less than 12 months and our application of discount rates. our implementation of the amended lease guidance is subject to the same internal controls over financial reporting that we apply to our consolidated financial statements.
the fasb has issued asu no. 2016-13, financial instruments - measurement of credit losses on financial instruments, or asu 2016-13. asu 2016-13 applies to all financial instruments carried at amortized cost including held-to-maturity debt securities as well as trade receivables. asu 2016-13 requires financial assets carried at amortized cost to be presented at the net amount expected to be collected and available-for-sale debt securities to record credit losses through an allowance for credit losses. asu 2016-13 is required to be adopted at the beginning of our first quarter of fiscal year 2020, with early adoption permitted. we do not expect to adopt asu 2016-13 early and we are currently evaluating this guidance to determine the potential impact on our consolidated financial statements.
3.   acquisitions and divestitures divestiture of trayport and the acquisitions of natural gas exchange inc. and shorcan energy brokers inc.
in december 2015, we acquired 100% of trayport for $620 million, in a stock transaction comprised of 12.6 million shares of our common stock. trayport is a software company that licenses its technology to serve exchanges, otc brokers and traders to facilitate electronic and hybrid trade execution primarily in the energy markets.
the u.k. competition and markets authority, or the cma, undertook a review of our 2015 acquisition of trayport under the merger control laws of the u.k. in 2016, the cma issued its findings calling for a divestment of trayport to remedy what it determined to be a substantial lessening of competition. in 2016, we appealed the decision with the competition appeal
tribunal. in march 2017, the competition appeal tribunal upheld the cma decision. thereafter, we asked for leave to appeal the decision at the u.k. court of appeals that denied our request and as such, we were obligated to sell trayport by january 2018.
we sold trayport to tmx group in december 2017 for Â£550 million ($733 million). the gross proceeds included a combination of Â£350 million ($466 million) in cash and Â£200 million ($267 million) in value relating to our acquisitions of natural gas exchange, inc., or ngx, now named ice ngx, and shorcan energy brokers inc., or shorcan energy, from tmx group. shorcan energy is now named calrock brokers, inc., or calrock. we recognized a net gain of $110 million in other income. the net gain was equal to the $733 million in gross proceeds received less the adjusted carrying value of trayport's net assets of $607 million ($531 million carrying value plus $76 million in accumulated other comprehensive loss from foreign currency translation) less $16 million in disposition costs.
the functional currency of trayport was the pound sterling. the $620 million in trayport net assets were recorded when acquired at a pound sterling/u.s. dollar exchange rate of 1.5218 (Â£407 million). because our financial statements are presented in u.s. dollars, we included trayport net assets in our financial statements based on u.s. dollars using the exchange rates in effect at the end of each reporting period. therefore, exchange rates affected the value of the trayport balance sheet, with gains or losses included in the cumulative translation adjustment account. as a result of the decrease in the pound sterling/u.s. dollar exchange rate to 1.3331 as of its disposition date, the portion of our equity attributable to its net assets in accumulated other comprehensive loss from foreign currency translation was $76 million. in connection with the divestiture, the $76 million loss was included in the net gain on the divestiture as discussed above.
as of june 30, 2017, we classified trayport as held for sale and accordingly ceased recording depreciation and amortization for its property and equipment and other intangible assets.
ice ngx, headquartered in calgary, provides electronic execution, central counterparty clearing and data services to the physical north american natural gas, electricity and oil markets. calrock offers brokerage services for the north american crude oil markets.

technology of $7 million, which has been assigned a useful life of three years. the excess of the purchase price over the preliminary net tangible and identifiable intangible assets was $423 million and was recorded as goodwill.
we now own 100% of mers. mers was previously a privately held, member-based organization that owned and managed the mersÂ® system, made up of lenders, servicers, sub-servicers, investors and government institutions. originally, on june 30, 2016, we acquired a majority equity position in mers and entered into a software development agreement to rebuild the mersÂ® system, a national electronic registry that tracks the changes in servicing rights and beneficial ownership interests in u.s.-based mortgage loans. we treated the investment as an equity method investment since we did not have the ability to control the operations of mers. on july 20, 2018, we exercised our option to purchase all of the remaining equity interests of mers as a result of satisfying our deliverables under the software development agreement. on october 3, 2018, we completed the purchase of all remaining interests and accordingly, own 100% of mers. on that date, we gained control of mers, began to include mers's results as part of our consolidated operations, and recorded a $110 million gain on our initial investment value as other non-operating income. mers is now part of ice mortgage services and is included in our trading and clearing segment.

on january 31, 2017, we acquired 100% of national stock exchange, inc., now named nyse national. the acquisition gave the nyse group a new u.s. exchange license. nyse national is distinct from nyse group's other listings exchanges because nyse national is only a trading venue and not a listings market. nyse group's other listings exchanges, nyse, nyse american, nyse arca and newly-acquired chx, have unique market models designed for corporate and etf issuers. after closing the transaction, nyse national ceased operations on february 1, 2017. nyse group re-launched operations and commenced trading in may 2018. nyse national is included in our trading and clearing segment.

during 2017 we purchased both gasunie's 21% minority ownership interest in ice endex and abn amro clearing bank n.v.'s 25% minority ownership interest in ice clear netherlands. subsequent to these acquisitions, we own 100% of ice endex and ice clear netherlands and no longer include non-controlling interest for ice endex and ice clear netherlands in our consolidated financial statements.

settlement amounts from all litigation and claims arising from the operations of mers prior to the acquisition of the majority equity position. as of december 31, 2018, and subsequent to our october 2018 acquisition and consolidation of the remaining mers interests, it amounted to $81 million and is included in prepaid expenses and other current assets and non-current assets. as of december 31, 2018, the reserve is offset by an equal $81 million due to former mers equity holders and is reflected in other current liabilities and other non-current liabilities.
5.   revenue recognition our primary revenue contract classifications are described below. these categories best represent those with similar economic characteristics of the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of our revenues and cash flows.
â€¢   transaction and clearing, net - transaction and clearing revenues represent fees charged for the performance obligations of derivatives trading and clearing, and from our cash trading, equity options and fixed income exchanges. the derivatives trading and clearing fees contain two performance obligations: (1) trade execution/clearing novation and (2) risk management of open interest. while we allocate the transaction price between these two performance obligations, since they generally are satisfied almost simultaneously, there is no significant deferral of revenue. cash trading, equity options and fixed income fees contain one performance obligation related to trade execution which occurs instantaneously, and the revenue is recorded at the point in time of the trade execution. our transaction and clearing revenues are reported net of rebates, except for the nyse transaction-based expenses. rebates were $844 million, $749 million and $674 million in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. transaction and clearing fees can be variable based on trade volume discounts used in the determination of rebates, however virtually all volume discounts are calculated and recorded on a monthly basis. transaction and clearing fees, as well as any volume discounts rebated to our customers, are calculated and billed monthly in accordance with our published fee schedules. we make liquidity payments to certain customers in our nyse businesses and recognize those payments as a cost of revenue. in addition, we pay nyse regulatory oversight fees to the sec and collect equal amounts from our customers. these are also considered a cost of revenue, and both of these nyse-related fees are included in transaction-based expenses. transaction and clearing revenues and the related transaction-based expenses are all recognized in our trading and clearing segment.
â€¢   data services - data service revenues represent the following:
â—¦   pricing and analytics services provide global securities evaluations, reference data, market indices, risk analytics, derivative pricing and other information designed to meet our customers' portfolio management, trading, risk management, reporting and regulatory compliance needs.
â—¦   exchange data and feeds services represent subscription fees for the provision and feeds of our market data that is created from activity in our trading and clearing segment.
â—¦   desktops and connectivity services provide the connection to our exchanges, clearing houses and data centers and comprise hosting, colocation, infrastructure, technology-based information platforms, workstations and connectivity solutions through the ice global network.
the nature and timing of each contract type for the data services above are similar in nature. data services revenues are primarily subscription-based, billed monthly, quarterly or annually in advance and recognized ratably over time as our performance obligations of data delivery are met consistently throughout the period. considering these contracts primarily consist of single performance obligations with fixed prices, there is no variable consideration and no need to allocate the transaction price. in certain of our data contracts, where third parties are involved, we arrange for the third party to transfer the services to our customers; in these arrangements we are acting as an agent and revenue is recorded net. all data services fees are included in our data and listings segment.
â€¢   listings - listings revenues include original and annual listings fees, and other corporate action fees. each distinct listing fee is allocated to multiple performance obligations including original and incremental listing and investor relations services, as well as a customer's material right to renew the option to list on our exchanges. in performing this allocation, the standalone selling price of the listing services is based on the original and annual listing fees and the standalone selling price of the investor relations services is based on its market value. all listings fees are billed upfront and the identified performance obligations are satisfied over time. revenue related to the investor relations performance obligation is recognized ratably over a two-year period, with the remaining revenue recognized ratably over time as customers continue to list on our exchanges, which is generally estimated to be over a period of up to nine years for nyse and up to five years for nyse arca and nyse american. listings fees related to other corporate actions are considered contract modifications of our listing contracts and are recognized ratably over time as customers continue to list on our exchanges, which is generally estimated to be a period of six years for nyse and three years for nyse arca and nyse american. all listings fees are recognized in our data and listings segment.
â€¢   other revenues - other revenues primarily include interest income on certain clearing margin deposits, regulatory penalties and fines, fees for use of our facilities, regulatory fees charged to member organizations of our u.s. securities exchanges, designated market maker service fees, exchange membership fees and agricultural grading and certification fees. generally, fees for other revenues contain one performance obligation. because these contracts primarily consist of single performance obligations with fixed prices, there is no variable consideration and no need to allocate the transaction price. services for other revenues are primarily satisfied at a point in time. therefore, there is no need to allocate the fee and no deferral results as we have no further obligation to the customer at that time. other revenues are recognized in our trading and clearing segment.
the following table depicts the disaggregation of our revenue according to business line and segment (in millions). segment totals here are consistent with the segment totals in note 18:

the trading and clearing segment revenues above include $248 million, $226 million, and $219 million in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively, for services transferred over time related to risk management of open interest performance obligations. a majority of these performance obligations are performed over a short period of time of one month or less.
6.   short-term and long-term restricted cash and cash equivalents ice futures europe operates as a u.k. recognized investment exchange, and is required by the u.k. financial conduct authority to maintain financial resources sufficient to properly perform its relevant functions equivalent to a minimum of six months of operating costs, subject to certain deductions, which is held in cash or cash equivalents or investments, at all times. as of december 31, 2018 and 2017, the amounts held for this purpose were $90 million and $77 million, respectively, and are included in short-term restricted cash and cash equivalents.
ice clear europe operates as a u.k. recognized clearing house. as such, ice clear europe is required by the boe and the european market infrastructure regulation, or emir, to restrict as cash, cash equivalents or investments an amount to reflect an estimate of the capital required to wind down or restructure the activities of the clearing house, cover operational, legal and business risks and to reserve capital to meet credit, counterparty and market risks not covered by the members' margin and guaranty funds. as of december 31, 2018 and 2017, $435 million and $423 million, respectively, are included in short-term restricted cash and cash equivalents held for these purposes. the increase in the regulatory capital restricted cash at ice clear europe as of december 31, 2018 was primarily due to additional costs incurred due to the growth of our clearing businesses and the consequential additional regulatory capital buffers required by the boe. ice clear europe, in addition to being regulated by the boe, is also regulated by the cftc as a u.s. derivatives clearing organizations, or dco. the regulatory capital available to ice clear europe, as described above, exceeds the cftc requirements.

our clearing houses, other than ice ngx, require each clearing member to make deposits to a fund known as the guaranty fund. as of december 31, 2018 and 2017, our combined contributions to the guaranty funds of our clearing houses are $253 million and $254 million, respectively. in addition, beginning in march 2018, certain of our exchanges are now required to make similar contributions to those made by the clearing houses to be utilized pro rata along with the clearing house contributions in the event of the default of any clearing member. as of december 31, 2018, these cash contributions were $67 million. all of these contributions are included in long-term restricted cash and cash equivalents. see note 14 for additional information on the guaranty funds and our contributions of cash to our clearing houses guaranty funds.

8.   goodwill and other intangible assets the following is a summary of the activity in the goodwill balance (in millions):
the following is a summary of the activity in the other intangible assets balance (in millions):
amortization of other intangible assets                     (272   )
amortization of other intangible assets                     (289   )
we completed the acquisitions of bondpoint, chx holdings, inc., tmc bonds and mers during 2018, and ice ngx, calrock, the ice bofaml indices, tmx atrium and nyse national and sold trayport, nyse governance services and idms during 2017 (note 3).
the foreign currency translation adjustments result from a portion of our goodwill and other intangible assets being held at our u.k., eu and canadian subsidiaries, whose functional currencies are not the u.s. dollar. amortization of other intangible assets in the table above includes an impairment charge of $4 million recorded during 2018 on the remaining value of exchange registration intangible assets in connection with the july 2018 closure of ice futures canada and ice clear canada (note 14) and the $6 million net impairment loss on the sale of nyse governance services in 2017 (notes 2 and 3). ice futures canada and ice clear canada were part of our trading and clearing segment and nyse governance services was part of our data and listings segment. we did not recognize any other impairment losses on goodwill or other intangible assets during 2018 and 2017. the changes in other activity, net, in the tables above primarily relate to adjustments to the fair value of the net tangible assets and intangible assets relating to the acquisitions, with a corresponding adjustment to goodwill.
other intangible assets and the related accumulated amortization consisted of the following (in millions):
as of december 31,       useful life(years)

in 2018, 2017 and 2016, amortization of other intangible assets was $289 million, $272 million and $323 million, respectively. collectively, the remaining weighted average useful lives of the finite-lived intangible assets is 17.7 years as of december 31,
2018. we expect future amortization expense from the finite-lived intangible assets as of december 31, 2018 to be as follows (in millions):
9.   deferred revenue our contract liabilities, or deferred revenue, represent consideration received that is yet to be recognized as revenue. total deferred revenue was $217 million as of december 31, 2018, including $135 million in current deferred revenue and $82 million in non-current deferred revenue. total deferred revenue was $216 million as of december 31, 2017, including $125 million in current deferred revenue and $91 million in non-current deferred revenue. see note 5 for a description of our annual listing, original listing, other listings and data services revenues and the revenue recognition policy for each of these revenue streams. the changes in our deferred revenue during 2018 and 2017 are as follows (in millions), adjusted to reflect the adoption of asc 606 as discussed in note 2:

adjustments for divestitures in the table above resulted from our june 2017 divestiture of nyse governance services and our march 2017 divestiture of idms, as well as our classification of trayport deferred revenue as held for sale during 2017. included in the amortization recognized in 2018, $114 million related to the deferred revenue balance as of january 1, 2018. included in the amortization in 2017, $100 million related to the deferred revenue balance as of january 1, 2017. as of december 31, 2018, we estimate that our deferred revenue will be recognized in the following years (in millions):
original listing revenues                other listing revenues      data services and other revenues                total
10.   debt our total debt, including short-term and long-term debt, consisted of the following (in millions):
as of december 31,
amended credit facility we have a $3.4 billion senior unsecured revolving credit facility pursuant to a credit agreement with wells fargo bank, n.a., as primary administrative agent, issuing lender and swing-line lender, bank of america, n.a., as syndication agent, backup administrative agent and swing-line lender, and the lenders party thereto. on august 9, 2018, we extended the final maturity date of the credit facility from august 18, 2022 to august 9, 2023, and made certain other changes, herein referred to as the amended credit facility. we incurred debt issuance costs of $2 million relating to the amended credit facility and these costs are included in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet as other non-current assets to be amortized over the life of the facility.
the amended credit facility includes an option for us to propose an increase in the aggregate amount available for borrowing by up to $975 million, subject to the consent of the lenders funding the increase and certain other conditions. no amounts were outstanding under the amended credit facility as of december 31, 2018. as of december 31, 2018, of the $3.4 billion that is currently available, $951 million is required to back-stop the amount outstanding under our commercial paper program and $105 million is required to support certain broker dealer subsidiary commitments. the amount required to backstop the amounts outstanding under the commercial paper program will fluctuate as we increase or decrease our commercial paper borrowings. the remaining $2.3 billion is available for working capital and general corporate purposes including, but not limited to, acting as a back-stop to future increases in the amounts outstanding under the commercial paper program.
we also pay an annual commitment fee for unutilized amounts payable in arrears at a rate that ranges from 0.08% to 0.20% determined based on our long-term debt rating. as of december 31, 2018, the applicable rate was 0.125%. amounts borrowed under the facility may be prepaid at any time without premium or penalty.
the facility also contains customary representations and warranties, covenants and events of default, including a leverage ratio, limitations on liens on our assets, indebtedness of non-obligor subsidiaries, the sale of all or substantially all of our assets, and other matters.
commercial paper program we have a u.s. dollar commercial paper program, or the commercial paper program. it is currently backed by the borrowing capacity available under the amended credit facility, as described above. the effective interest rate of commercial paper issuances does not materially differ from short-term interest rates (such as usd libor) which fluctuate due to market conditions and as a result may impact our interest expense.
we repaid a net amount of $283 million of outstanding commercial paper during 2018 using cash flows from operations and cash proceeds received from our 2018 bond issuance. we repaid $409 million of net notes outstanding under the program during 2017 primarily using net cash proceeds received from the sales of cetip and trayport. these reductions were partially offset by notes we issued under the program during 2017, the proceeds of which were used to fund acquisitions and investments and repurchase our common stock. we used net proceeds from notes issued under the program during 2016 for the acquisitions of securities evaluations and credit market analysis and for general corporate purposes. we repaid a portion of the amounts outstanding under the program during 2018, 2017 and 2016 with cash flows from operations.
commercial paper notes of $951 million with original maturities ranging from two to 77 days were outstanding as of december 31, 2018 with a weighted average interest rate of 2.48% per annum, and a weighted average maturity of 12 days. commercial paper notes of $1.2 billion with original maturities ranging from two to 64 days were outstanding as of december 31, 2017, with a weighted average interest rate of 1.49% per annum, and a weighted average maturity of 18 days.
â€¢   newly-issued senior notes: in august 2018, we issued $2.25 billion in new aggregate unsecured fixed-rate senior notes, including $400 million, 3.45% notes due in 2023, or the 2023 senior notes, $600 million, 3.75% notes due in 2028, or the 2028 senior notes, and $1.25 billion, 4.25% notes due in 2048, or the 2048 senior notes, and together with the 2023 senior notes and the 2028 senior notes, the newly-issued senior notes. we used the proceeds from the offering for general corporate purposes, including to fund the redemption of the $600 million, 2.50% senior notes due october 2018 and to refinance all of our issuances under our commercial paper program that resulted from acquisitions and investments in the last year. we incurred debt issuance costs of $21 million relating to the newly-issued senior notes that we recorded as a deduction from the carrying amount of the debt and which is being amortized over the respective note lives.
â€¢   2022 and 2027 senior notes: in august 2017, we issued $1.0 billion in aggregate senior unsecured fixed-rate notes, including $500 million, 2.35% notes due september 2022, or the 2022 senior notes, and $500 million, 3.10% notes due september 2027, or the 2027 senior notes. we used the majority of the proceeds of the offering to fund the redemption in september 2017 of $850 million, 2.00% senior unsecured fixed-rate nyse notes prior to the october 2017 maturity date. we incurred debt issuance costs of $8 million relating to the 2022 senior notes and the 2027 senior notes that we recorded as a deduction from the carrying amount of the debt and which is being amortized over the respective note lives.
â€¢   2020 and 2025 senior notes: in november 2015, we issued $2.5 billion in aggregate senior unsecured fixed-rate notes, including $1.25 billion, 2.75% notes due november 2020, or the 2020 senior notes, and $1.25 billion, 3.75% notes due november 2025, or the 2025 senior notes. we used the proceeds from the offering, together with $1.6 billion of borrowings under our commercial paper program, to finance the cash portion of the purchase price of interactive data.
â€¢   october 2023 senior notes: in october 2013, we issued $800 million, 4.00% senior unsecured fixed-rate notes due october 2023, or the october 2023 senior notes. we used the net proceeds from the october 2023 senior notes to finance a portion of the purchase price of the acquisition of nyse.
the newly-issued senior notes, the 2022 senior notes, the 2027 senior notes, the 2020 senior notes, the 2025 senior notes, the 2023 senior notes and the october 2023 senior notes all contain affirmative and negative covenants, including, but not limited to, certain redemption rights, limitations on liens and indebtedness and limitations on certain mergers, sales, dispositions and lease-back transactions.
debt repayment schedule as of december 31, 2018, the outstanding debt repayment schedule is as follows (in millions):
11.   share-based compensation the non-cash compensation expenses for stock options and restricted stock was $130 million, $135 million and $124 million in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively, net of $15 million, $18 million and $13 million, respectively, that was capitalized as software development costs. as of december 31, 2018, we had 36.6 million shares in total under various equity plans that are available for future issuance as stock option and restricted stock awards.
stock option plans stock options are granted with an exercise price equal to the fair value of our common stock on the grant date. we may grant, under provisions of the plans, both incentive stock options and nonqualified stock options. the options generally vest over three years and may generally be exercised up to ten years after the date of grant, but generally expire either 14 or 60 days after termination of employment. the shares of common stock issued under our stock option plans are made available from authorized and unissued common stock or treasury shares.
the fair value is based on the closing stock price of our stock on the date of grant as well as certain other assumptions. compensation expense arising from option grants is recognized ratably over the vesting period based on the grant date fair value, net of estimated forfeitures.
the following is a summary of our stock option activity:
number of options(in thousands)               weighted average exercise price per option outstanding at january 1, 2016               3,873                                  $31.93
details of stock options outstanding as of december 31, 2018 are as follows:
number of options(in thousands)     weighted average            weighted average   aggregate exercise price              remaining          intrinsic contractual life   value
number of options(in thousands)     weighted average            weighted average   aggregate exercise price              remaining          intrinsic contractual life   value
the total intrinsic value of options exercised during 2018, 2017 and 2016 was $36 million, $22 million and $18 million, respectively. as of december 31, 2018, there were $8 million in total unrecognized compensation costs related to stock options, which are expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of 1.6 years as the stock options vest.
of the options outstanding at december 31, 2018, 2.6 million were exercisable at a weighted-average exercise price of $40.22. of the options outstanding at december 31, 2017, 3.0 million were exercisable at a weighted-average exercise price of $36.36. of the options outstanding at december 31, 2016, 2.8 million were exercisable at a weighted-average exercise price of $31.61.
risk-free interest rate                                                       2.67    %             1.84    %           1.51    %
expected volatility                                                             20    %               21    %             24    %
estimated weighted-average fair value of options granted per share          $14.08                $10.50               $9.88
the risk-free interest rate is based on the zero-coupon u.s. treasury yield curve in effect at the date of grant. the expected life is derived from historical and anticipated future exercise patterns. expected volatility is based on historical volatility data of our stock.
restricted stock plans restricted shares are used as an incentive to attract and retain qualified employees and to increase stockholder returns with actual performance linked to both short and long-term stockholder return as well as retention objectives. the grant date fair value of each award is based on the closing stock price of our stock at the date of grant.
granted but unvested shares are generally forfeited upon termination of employment, whereby compensation costs previously recognized for unvested shares are reversed. until the shares vest and are issued, participants have no voting or dividend rights and the shares may not be sold, assigned, transferred, pledged or otherwise encumbered. unvested restricted stock earns dividend equivalents which are paid in cash on the vesting date.
the grant date fair value of time-based restricted stock units is recognized as expense ratably over the vesting period, which is typically three years, net of forfeitures. our equity plans include a change in control provision that may accelerate vesting on both the time-based and performance-based restricted shares if the awards are not assumed by an acquirer in the case of a change in control.
for awards with performance conditions, we recognize compensation costs, net of forfeitures, using an accelerated attribution method over the vesting period. compensation costs are recognized only if it is probable that the performance condition will be satisfied. if we initially determine that it is not probable of being satisfied and later determine that it is, or vice versa, a cumulative catch-up adjustment is retroactively recorded in the period of change based on the new estimate. we recognize the remaining compensation costs over the remaining vesting period. our compensation committee, pursuant to the terms of the equity plans and the authority delegated to it by our board, can make equitable adjustments to the performance condition in recognition of unusual or non-recurring events.
in february 2018, we reserved a maximum of 1.3 million restricted shares for potential issuance as performance-based restricted shares to certain of our employees. the number of shares ultimately granted under this award was based on our actual financial performance as compared to financial performance targets set by our board for the year ending december 31, 2018, and was also subject to a market condition reduction based on how our 2018 total stockholder return, or tsr, compared to that of the s&p 500 index. our 2018 tsr was higher than the 2018 return of the s&p 500 index. therefore, no share reduction was required. based on our actual 2018 financial performance as compared to the 2018 financial performance
the fair value of awards with a market condition is estimated based on our stock price on the grant date, the valuation of historical awards with market conditions, the relatively low likelihood that the market condition will affect the number of shares granted (as the market condition only affects shares granted in excess of certain financial performance targets), and our expectation of achieving the financial performance targets. the grant date fair value of the awards, when considering the impact of the market condition on fair value, was determined to not be materially different from our stock price on the respective grant dates.
the following is a summary of the nonvested restricted shares under all plans discussed above in 2018, 2017 and 2016:
number of            weighted average restricted             grant-date fair stock shares(in thousands)             value per share nonvested at january 1, 2016                          6,271              $39.99
the shares granted include 1.2 million, 2.4 million and 2.3 million time-based restricted stock units during 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively, and the remainder are performance-based. performance-based shares have been presented to reflect the actual shares to be issued based on the achievement of past performance targets, also considering the impact of any market conditions. non-vested performance-based restricted shares granted are presented at the target number of restricted shares that would vest if the target performance targets are met. as of december 31, 2018, there were $116 million in total unrecognized compensation costs related to time-based and performance-based restricted stock. these costs are expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 1.2 years as the restricted stock vests. during 2018, 2017 and 2016, the total fair value of restricted stock vested under all restricted stock plans was $206 million, $206 million and $130 million, respectively.
employee stock purchase plan in may 2018, our stockholders approved our espp, under which we have reserved and may sell up to 25 million shares of our common stock to employees. the espp grants participating employees the right to acquire our stock in increments of 1% of eligible pay, with a maximum contribution of 25% of eligible pay, subject to applicable annual internal revenue service, or irs, limitations. under our espp, participating employees are limited to $25,000 of common stock annually, and a maximum of 1,250 shares of common stock each offering period. there will be two offering periods each year, which will run from january 1st (or the first trading day thereafter) through june 30th (or the last trading day prior to such date) and from july 1st (or the first trading day thereafter) through december 31st (or the last trading day prior to such date). the first offering period began on july 2, 2018 and ended on december 31, 2018. the purchase price per share of common stock is 85% of the lesser of the fair market value of the stock on the first or the last trading day of each offering period. the prices on the first day and last day of our first trading period were $73.73 and $75.33 per share, respectively. we recorded compensation expenses of $4 million during 2018 related to the 15% discount given to our participating employees.
12.   equity treasury stock during 2018, 2017 and 2016, we received 1.5 million shares, 1.5 million shares and 1.1 million shares, respectively, of common stock from employees to satisfy tax withholdings we made on their behalf for restricted stock and stock option exercises. we recorded the receipt of the shares as treasury stock.
in connection with the record date for a 5-for-1 stock split, on october 27, 2016, all 35.3 million then outstanding treasury stock shares were retired. in connection with the retirement, of the $1.5 billion value assigned to the treasury stock shares, $1.1 billion was allocated to additional paid-in capital and $370 million to retained earnings. the allocation was based on the paid-in capital per share generated from the historical issuances of these shares.
stock repurchase program during 2018, 2017 and 2016, we repurchased 16.3 million shares, 15.0 million shares and 0.9 million shares, respectively, of our outstanding common stock at a cost of $1.2 billion, $949 million and $50 million, respectively, excluding shares withheld upon vesting of equity awards. the shares repurchased are held in treasury stock. the timing and extent of future repurchases, if any, will depend upon many conditions. we periodically review whether to repurchase our stock. in making a determination regarding any stock repurchases, we consider multiple factors that may include: overall stock market conditions, our common stock price movements, the remaining amount authorized for repurchases by our board, the potential impact of a stock repurchase program on our debt ratings, our expected free cash flow and working capital needs, our current and future planned strategic growth initiatives, and other potential uses of our cash and capital resources.
in august 2016, our board approved an aggregate of $1.0 billion for repurchases with no fixed expiration date. in september 2017, our board approved an aggregate of $1.2 billion with no fixed expiration date. in september 2018, our board approved an aggregate of $2.0 billion for future repurchases of our common stock with no fixed expiration date that became effective on january 1, 2019. we expect to fund repurchases, if any, from our operating cash flow or borrowings under our debt facilities or our commercial paper program. repurchases may be made from time to time on the open market, through established trading plans, in privately-negotiated transactions or otherwise, in accordance with all applicable securities laws, rules and regulations. we have entered into a rule 10b5-1 trading plan, as authorized by our board, to govern some or all of the repurchases of our shares of common stock. we may discontinue the stock repurchases at any time and may amend or terminate the rule 10b5-1 trading plan at any time. the approval of our board for the share repurchases does not obligate us to acquire any particular amount of our common stock. in addition, our board may increase or decrease the amount available for repurchases from time to time.
we repurchased shares of our common stock in the open market during the periods presented as follows:
shares repurchased(in thousands)            average repurchase price per share            amount of repurchases(in millions)
total open market common stock repurchases             16,257                                                                                           $1,198
total open market common stock repurchases             14,967                                                                                             $949
total open market common stock repurchases   903   $50
dividends the declaration of dividends is subject to the discretion of our board, and may be affected by various factors, including our future earnings, financial condition, capital requirements, levels of indebtedness, credit ratings and other considerations which our board of directors deem relevant. our board has adopted a quarterly dividend declaration policy providing that the declaration of any dividends will be determined quarterly by the board or its audit committee taking into account such factors as our evolving business model, prevailing business conditions and our financial results and capital requirements, without a predetermined annual net income payout ratio. we declared and paid cash dividends per share during the periods presented as follows:
13.   income taxes income before income taxes and the income tax provision consisted of the following (in millions):
deferred tax expense (benefit):
total income tax expense (benefit)      $500             $(28      )            $586
a reconciliation of the statutory u.s. federal income tax rate to our effective income tax rate is as follows:
state and local income taxes, net of federal benefit    3               3              3
deferred tax benefit due to tax law changes             -             (30   )         (2    )
we were required to revalue our u.s. deferred tax assets and liabilities at the new federal corporate income tax rate as of the date of enactment of the tcja and to include the rate change effect in the tax provision for the period ended december 31, 2017. as a result, we recognized a $764 million deferred tax benefit based on a reasonable estimate of the deferred tax assets and liabilities as of december 22, 2017. this significantly reduced the effective tax rate for the period ended december 31, 2017 in comparison to the effective tax rates in the other years presented. the 2017 effective tax rate would have been 29% without this deferred tax benefit.
the 2018 effective tax rate is lower than the 2017 effective tax rate excluding the deferred tax benefit from the u.s. tax law changes. this is primarily due to the lower u.s. corporate income tax rate that became effective january 1, 2018. in addition, the 2018 effective tax rate was further reduced due to non-taxable gains from the acquisition of mers, deferred tax benefits from changes in estimates, and additional tax benefits associated with our sale of trayport in 2017. the tax benefit from the acquisition of mers is included in "other" in the above effective tax rate reconciliation.
the decrease in the effective tax rate in 2017 from 2016, is primarily due to the deferred tax benefit associated with the tcja and tax benefits associated with a divestiture in the second quarter of 2017, partially offset by the deferred tax benefit from the u.k. corporate income tax reduction in the third quarter of 2016, additional tax expense from an illinois corporate income tax rate increase enacted in the third quarter of 2017, and an income tax expense increase due to a relatively higher u.s. mix of income in 2017.
during the third quarter of 2016, the u.k. further reduced their corporate income tax rate effective april 1, 2020 from 18% to 17%. the reduction in the future u.s. and u.k. corporate income tax rates resulted in deferred tax benefits. the impact of the deferred tax benefits for the u.s. and u.k. corporate income tax rate reductions collectively lowered the effective tax rates by 30% and 2%, in 2017 and 2016, respectively, and resulted in deferred tax benefits of $764 million and $34 million, in 2017 and 2016, respectively.
deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes. as a result of the enactment of tcja on december 22, 2017, we revalued the u.s. deferred tax assets and liabilities at the new federal corporate income tax rate of 21%, for the period ended december 31, 2017. the following table summarizes the significant components of our deferred tax liabilities and assets as of december 31, 2018 and 2017 (in millions):
as of december 31,
total deferred tax assets, net of valuation allowance        $237                  $257
a reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of deferred income tax valuation allowance is as follows (in millions):
beginning balance of deferred income tax valuation allowance      $126                $122                 $72
ending balance of deferred income tax valuation allowance         $119                $126                $122
we recognize valuation allowances on deferred tax assets if, based on the weight of the evidence, we believe that it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. we recorded a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets of $119 million and $126 million as of december 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. decreases in 2018 primarily relate to utilization of certain deferred tax assets on capital losses that we did not expect to be realizable. decreases in 2017 relate to the u.s. corporate income tax rate reduction from 35% to 21% and the net impact from the divestitures of trayport and idms. increases in 2016 primarily relate to deferred tax assets on foreign net operating and capital losses that we do not expect to be realizable in the future. increases charged against goodwill primarily relate to deferred tax assets arising on the 2017 acquisition of national stock exchange and the 2016 acquisition of a foreign branch that we do not expect to be realizable in future periods.
as part of u.s. tax reform, the tcja imposes a transition tax on certain accumulated foreign earnings aggregated across all non-u.s. subsidiaries, net of foreign deficits, as computed under u.s. tax principles. as we were in an aggregate net foreign deficit position for u.s. tax purposes as of december 31, 2017, we were not liable for the transition tax.
effective january 1, 2018, the majority of our 2018 current undistributed earnings of our non-u.s. subsidiaries became subject to the global intangible low-taxed income provisions under the tcja and, as such, are subject to immediate u.s. income taxation and can be distributed to the u.s. in the future with no material additional income tax consequences. consequently, these earnings are not considered to be indefinitely reinvested and the related tax impact is included in our income tax provision for the period ended december 31, 2018.
however, our non-u.s. subsidiaries' cumulative undistributed earnings as of december 31, 2017 and the 2018 current undistributed earnings that are not subject to the global intangible low-taxed income provisions are considered to be
indefinitely reinvested.  accordingly, no provision for u.s. federal and state income taxes has been made in the accompanying consolidated financial statements. further, a determination of the unrecognized deferred tax liability is not practicable.  an estimate of these indefinitely reinvested undistributed earnings as of december 31, 2018, based on post-income tax earnings under u.s. gaap principles, is $4.9 billion.
sab 118 provided guidance for companies that had not completed their accounting for the income tax effects of the tcja in the period of enactment, allowing for a measurement period of up to one year after the enactment date to finalize the recording of the related tax impacts. during 2018, we completed our accounting for the tax effects of the enactment of the tcja. we reaffirmed our position that we were not subject to transition tax under the tcja as of december 31, 2017, and therefore, we did not record any transition tax during the measurement period. we also concluded that the $764 million deferred tax benefit recorded in the 2017 tax provision was a reasonable estimate of the impact of the tcja on our deferred tax balances, and that no further adjustments were necessary during the measurement period.
as of december 31, 2018, we have adopted an accounting policy regarding the treatment of taxes due on future inclusion of non-u.s. income in u.s. taxable income under the global intangible low-taxed income provisions as a current period expense when incurred. therefore, no deferred tax related to these provisions has been recorded as of december 31, 2018.
as of december 31, 2018 and 2017, we have gross u.s. federal net operating loss carryforwards of $133 million and $89 million, respectively, and gross state and local net operating loss carryforwards of $201 million and $353 million, respectively. the increases of u.s federal net operating loss carryforwards are primarily due to acquisitions during 2018. the decrease of state and local net operating loss is primarily due to utilization of certain net operating losses in the current year, partially offset by additions related to acquisitions. the net operating loss carryforwards are available to offset future taxable income until they begin to expire in 2019. in addition, as of december 31, 2018 and 2017, we have gross foreign net operating loss carryforwards of $285 million and $253 million, respectively. the majority of gross foreign net operating losses are not expected to be realizable in future periods and have related valuation allowances.
a reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of unrecognized tax benefits is as follows (in millions):
beginning balance of unrecognized tax benefits                  115                $112                 107
reductions resulting from statute of limitation lapses          (19    )             (8    )             (3    )
ending balance of unrecognized tax benefits                     $98                $115                $112
as of december 31, 2018 and 2017, the balance of unrecognized tax benefits which would, if recognized, affect our effective tax rate was $81 million and $77 million, respectively. it is reasonably possible, as a result of settlements of ongoing audits or statute of limitations expirations, unrecognized tax benefits could increase as much as $13 million and decrease as much as $20 million within the next 12 months. of the $98 million in unrecognized tax benefits as of december 31, 2018, $74 million is recorded as other non-current liabilities and $24 million is recorded as other current liabilities.
we recognize interest accrued on income tax uncertainties and accrued penalties as a component of income tax expense. in 2018, 2017 and 2016, we recognized $6 million, $1 million and $1 million, respectively, of income tax benefit for interest and penalties. as of december 31, 2018 and 2017, accrued interest and penalties were $28 million and $35 million, respectively. of the $28 million in accrued interest and penalties as of december 31, 2018, $13 million is recorded as other non-current liabilities and $15 million is recorded as other current liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet.
we or one of our subsidiaries files income tax returns in the u.s. federal jurisdiction and various state and foreign jurisdictions. the following table summarizes open tax years by major jurisdiction:
although the outcome of tax audits is always uncertain, we believe that adequate amounts of tax, including interest and penalties, have been provided for any adjustments expected to result from open tax years.
14.   clearing operations we operate six clearing houses, each of which acts as a central counterparty that becomes the buyer to every seller and the seller to every buyer for its clearing members. through this central counterparty function, the clearing houses provide financial security for each transaction for the duration of the position by limiting counterparty credit risk. our clearing houses are responsible for providing clearing services to each of our futures exchanges, and in some cases outside of our execution venues, and are as follows, referred to herein collectively as "the ice clearing houses":

as of december 31, 2018, ice ngx maintains a guaranty fund utilizing a $100 million letter of credit discussed below.
we previously operated ice clear canada for the clearing and settlement of our canola contracts traded through ice futures canada. on july 30, 2018, and in connection with the transition of the trading in those contracts to ice futures u.s., we transitioned the clearing of those contracts to ice clear u.s., after which ice clear canada ceased operations.
original & variation margin to reduce their exposure, the ice clearing houses have a risk management program with both initial and ongoing membership standards. each of the ice clearing houses generally require all clearing members or participants to establish guaranty fund (discussed below) and collateral accounts, and require them to maintain cash on deposit or pledge certain assets. such amounts in total are known as "original margin." in addition, they may make intraday original margin calls in circumstances where market conditions require additional protection. the daily profits and losses to and from the ice clearing houses due to the marking-to-market of open contracts is known as "variation margin." with the exception of ice ngx's physical natural gas and physical power products discussed separately below, the ice clearing houses mark all outstanding contracts to market, and therefore pay and collect variation margin, at least once daily.
the amounts that the clearing members and participants are required to maintain are determined by standardized parameters established by each ice clearing house and reviewed by the risk committees and the boards of directors of the respective ice clearing house and may fluctuate over time. each of the ice clearing houses is a separate legal entity and is not subject to the liabilities of the others, or the obligations of the members of the other ice clearing houses.
should a particular clearing member or participant fail to deposit its original margin, provide its collateral, or fail to make a variation margin payment, when and as required, the relevant ice clearing house may liquidate or hedge its open positions and use their original margin and guaranty fund deposits to make up any amount owed. in the event that those deposits are
as of december 31, 2018 and 2017, the ice clearing houses have received or have been pledged $121.4 billion and $92.6 billion, respectively, in cash and non-cash collateral in original margin and guaranty fund deposits to cover price movements of underlying contracts for both periods.
guaranty funds & ice contribution mechanisms have been created, called guaranty funds, to provide partial protection in the event of a clearing member default. each of the ice clearing houses generally require that each clearing member make deposits into a guaranty fund.
we have contributed our own capital, or "skin-in-the-game" on a voluntary basis which could be used if a defaulting clearing member's original margin and guaranty fund deposits are insufficient, recorded as long-term restricted cash and cash equivalents in our balance sheets, and included in the table above.
the contributions to ice clear europe include $100 million for futures and options and $50 million for cds. these contributions, as well as those for ice clear u.s. and ice clear credit, would be used after the funds of the defaulting clearing member but before other amounts within those guaranty funds.
our risk management framework for our cds markets through ice clear credit and ice clear europe is separate from our non-cds clearing operations. our cds clearing houses are open-access, consistent with regulatory requirements, and we accept qualifying trades for clearing that are executed on other venues. as of december 31, 2018, our cds clearing houses collectively clear 515 single name instruments and 154 cds indexes.
beginning in march 2018, certain of our exchanges are required to make similar contributions to be utilized pro rata along with the clearing contributions in the event of a clearing member default, subject to a minimum $10 million and based on average guaranty fund contributions for futures and options contracts per exchange. these are recorded as long-term restricted cash and cash equivalents in our balance sheet (note 6), and were $67 million combined for ice futures europe, ice futures u.s. and ice endex as of december 31, 2018 and included in the table above.
on january 31, 2019, we increased our contribution to ice clear europe's guaranty fund by $27 million due to changes in the size of its futures and options guaranty fund which included an increase to our exchange contribution to reflect an increase in the size of the average guaranty fund contributions.
cash and cash equivalent deposits we have recorded cash and cash equivalent margin deposits and amounts due in our balance sheets as current assets with corresponding current liabilities to the clearing members. as of december 31, 2018, our cash and cash equivalent margin deposits are as follows (in millions):
as of december 31, 2017, our cash and cash equivalent deposits, are as follows (in millions):
(1) $25.8 billion and $5.1 billion is related to futures and options and cds, respectively.
(2) $18.5 billion and $4.3 billion is related to futures and options and cds, respectively.
our cash and cash equivalent margin and guaranty fund deposits are maintained in accounts with national banks and reputable financial institutions or secured through direct investments, primarily in u.s. treasury securities with original maturities of less than three months, or reverse repurchase agreements with primarily overnight maturities. details of our cash and cash equivalent deposits are as follows (in millions):

(2) ice clear credit is a systemically important financial market utility, or sifmu, as designated by the financial stability oversight council, and holds its u.s. dollar cash margin in cash accounts at the federal reserve bank of chicago.
other deposits in addition to the cash deposits above, the ice clearing houses have also received other assets from clearing members, which include government obligations, and may include other non-cash collateral such as certain agency and corporate debt, letters of credit or gold to mitigate credit risk. for certain deposits, we may impose discount or "haircut" rates to ensure adequate collateral if market values fluctuate. the risks and rewards of these assets remain with the clearing members. any gain or loss accrues to the clearing member. the ice clearing houses have not sold or re-pledged these assets or experienced an event of a default. these pledged assets are not reflected in our balance sheets, and are as follows:
as of december 31, 2018
letters of credit                     -                     -                     -                        2,556                -                                        2,556

ice ngx ice ngx is the central counterparty to participants on opposite sides of its physically-settled contracts, and the balance related to delivered but unpaid contracts is recorded as a delivery contract net receivable, with an offsetting delivery contract net payable in our balance sheets. unsettled variation margin equal to the fair value of open contracts is recorded as of each balance sheet date. fair value is determined based on the difference between the original trade price and the settlement price. there is no impact on income for either delivery contracts receivable/payable or unsettled variation margin, and an equivalent amount is recognized as both an asset and a liability. ice ngx marks all outstanding contracts to market daily, but only collects variation margin when a clearing member's or participant's open position falls outside a specified percentage of its pledged collateral.
ice ngx requires participants to maintain cash or letters of credit to serve as collateral in the event of default. the cash is maintained in a segregated bank account that is subject to a collateral agreement between the bank and ice ngx, the trustee, and the cash remains the property of the participant, only accessed by ice ngx if a default occurs. since the cash is held in trust and remains the property of the participant, it is not included in our balance sheets. ice ngx maintains the following accounts with a third-party canadian chartered bank which are available in the event of physical settlement shortfalls:
account type                      as of december 31, 2018(in c$ millions)           as of december 31, 2018(in $usd millions)
because it is not our policy to guaranty credit facilities of our clearing houses which maintain contingent liquidity facilities secured by highly liquid assets, in february 2018 we eliminated a $100 million guaranty that we had previously provided ice ngx. as of december 31, 2018, ice ngx maintains a guaranty fund utilizing a $100 million letter of credit that has been entered into with a major canadian chartered bank and backed by a default insurance policy underwritten by export development corporation, or edc, a canadian government agency. in event of a participant default, where a participant's collateral becomes depleted, the remaining shortfall would be covered by a draw down on the letter of credit following which ice ngx would pay the first $15 million in losses per its deductible and recover additional losses under the insurance policy up to $100 million.
clearing house exposure the net notional value of unsettled contracts was $2.8 trillion as of december 31, 2018. each ice clearing house bears financial counterparty credit risk and provides a central counterparty guarantee, or performance guarantee, to its clearing members or participants. excluding the effects of original and variation margin, guaranty fund and collateral requirements, the ice clearing houses' maximum estimated exposure for this guarantee is $101.0 billion as of december 31, 2018, which represents the maximum estimated value by the ice clearing houses of a hypothetical one-day movement in pricing of the underlying unsettled contracts. this value was determined using proprietary risk management software that simulates gains and losses based on historical market prices, volatility and other factors present at that point in time for those particular unsettled contracts. future actual market price volatility could result in the exposure being significantly different than this amount.
we also performed calculations to determine the fair value of our counterparty performance guarantee taking into consideration factors such as daily settlement of contracts, margining and collateral requirements, other elements of our risk management program, historical evidence of default payments, and estimated probability of potential default payouts by the ice clearing
houses. based on these analyses, the estimated counterparty performance guaranty liability was determined to be nominal and no liability was recorded as of december 31, 2018 or 2017. the ice clearing houses have never experienced an incident of a clearing member default which has required the use of the guaranty funds of non-defaulting clearing members or the assets of the ice clearing houses.
15.   commitments and contingencies leases we have lease agreements for office space, equipment facilities and certain computer equipment for varying periods that expire at various dates through 2028. our leases contain terms which may include renewal options, rent escalations, rent holidays and leasehold improvement incentives. all of our leases are classified as operating leases. rental expense under these leases, included in rent and occupancy and technology and communication expenses, totaled $59 million, $58 million and $58 million in 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively. as of december 31, 2018, future minimum lease payments under non-cancellable operating lease agreements are as follows (in millions):
legal proceedings we are subject to legal proceedings, claims and investigations that arise in the ordinary course of our business. we establish accruals for those matters in circumstances when a loss contingency is considered probable and the related amount is reasonably estimable. any such accruals may be adjusted as circumstances change. assessments of losses are inherently subjective and involve unpredictable factors. we do not believe that the resolution of these legal matters, including the matters described below, will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition, results of operations, or liquidity. it is possible, however, that future results of operations for any particular quarterly or annual period could be materially and adversely affected by any developments relating to the legal proceedings, claims and investigations. a range of possible losses related to the cases below cannot be reasonably estimated at this time, except as otherwise disclosed below.
city of providence litigation in 2014, new york stock exchange llc and nyse arca, inc., two of our subsidiaries, were among more than 40 financial institutions and exchanges named as defendants in four purported class action lawsuits filed in the u.s. district court for the southern district of new york, or the southern district, by the city of providence, rhode island, and other plaintiffs. in subsequent consolidated amended complaints, the plaintiffs asserted claims against the exchange defendants and barclays plc which operates an ats known as barclays lx, on behalf of a class of "all public investors" who bought or sold stock from april 18, 2009 to the present on the u.s.-based equity exchanges operated by the exchange defendants or on barclays lx.
in 2015, the district court granted the defendants' motions to dismiss and dismissed the second amended complaint with prejudice. the court held that the plaintiffs had failed to sufficiently state a claim against the defendants under sections 10(b) and 6(b) of the exchange act, and additionally that some of the claims against the exchanges were barred by the doctrine of self-regulatory organization immunity. in 2015, the plaintiffs filed an appeal of the dismissal of the lawsuit to the u.s. court of appeals for the second circuit, or the second circuit.
on december 19, 2017, the second circuit issued a decision vacating the dismissal and remanding the case to the district court for further proceedings. the second circuit held that the claims against the exchanges were not barred by the doctrine of self-regulatory organization immunity because (according to the second circuit) the exchanges were not carrying out regulatory functions while operating their markets and engaging in the challenged conduct at issue, and that the plaintiffs had adequately pleaded claims against the defendants under section 10(b) of the exchange act. the second circuit directed that, on remand, the district court should address and rule upon various other defenses raised by the exchanges in their motion to dismiss (which the district court did not address in its prior opinion and order). the parties are awaiting a decision on a motion to dismiss filed by the defendant exchanges in the district court seeking dismissal on grounds other than those considered by the second circuit in its december 2017 decision.
on january 15, 2019 and january 31, 2019, two virtually identical purported class action complaints were filed, respectively, by putnam bank, a savings bank based in putnam, connecticut, and two municipal pension funds affiliated with the city of livonia, michigan, in the southern district against ice and several of its subsidiaries, including ice benchmark administration limited ("iba") (the "ice defendants"), as well as 18 multinational banks and various of their respective subsidiaries and affiliates (the "panel bank defendants"). iba is the administrator for various regulated benchmarks, including the ice libor benchmark that is calculated daily based upon the submissions from a reference panel (which includes the panel bank defendants).
the plaintiffs seek to litigate on behalf of a purported class of all u.s.-based persons or entities who transacted with a panel bank defendant by receiving a payment on an interest rate indexed to a libor-benchmarked rate during the period february 1, 2014 to the present. the plaintiffs allege that the ice defendants and panel bank defendants engaged in a conspiracy to set the libor benchmark at artificially low levels, with an alleged purpose and effect of depressing payments by the panel bank defendants to members of the purported class.
the complaints assert claims for violations of the sherman and clayton antitrust acts and for unjust enrichment under common law, and seek unspecified treble damages and other relief. ice intends to vigorously defend these matters.
sec investigation of 2015 nyse outage in december 2015, our subsidiaries new york stock exchange, llc and nyse american received an inquiry from the enforcement staff of the new york regional office, or the staff, of the sec regarding a july 8, 2015 outage on the nyse markets, during which trading was suspended for approximately 3.5 hours in all symbols. the staff's investigation proceeded throughout 2016, and nyse received a wells notice stating that the staff had made a preliminary determination to recommend that the sec file an enforcement action in connection with nyse's response to the circumstances leading into the suspension of trading that day. nyse disputed the appropriateness of the proposed charges and made a written submission to the staff in response to the wells notice. on march 6, 2018, nyse and affiliated exchanges reached a settlement with the sec on this matter and various matters under investigation and agreed to pay a $14 million civil monetary penalty, together with certain non-monetary relief. for further details about the settlement and underlying matters that were under investigation, please refer to order instituting administrative and cease-and-desist proceedings pursuant to section 8a of the securities act of 1933, sections 19(h)(1) and 21c of the securities exchange act of 1934, making findings, and imposing remedial sanctions and a cease-and-desist order, administrative proceeding file no. 3-18388 (in the matter of new york stock exchange llc, nyse american llc, and nyse arca, inc.) entered into on march 6, 2018. for this matter and other sec investigative matters, during 2017, we recorded an aggregate of $14 million in expense accruals.
tax audits we are engaged in ongoing discussions and audits with taxing authorities on various tax matters, the resolutions of which are uncertain. currently, there are matters that may lead to assessments involving us or one of our subsidiaries, some of which may not be resolved for several years. based on currently available information, we believe we have adequately provided for any assessments that could result from those proceedings where it is more likely than not that we will be assessed. we continuously review our positions as these matters progress.
16.   pension and other benefit programs defined benefit pension plan we have a pension plan covering employees in certain of our u.s. operations whose benefit accrual has been frozen. retirement benefits are derived from a formula, which is based on length of service and compensation.
during 2018, we did not make any contributions to our pension plan. during 2017, in connection with our de-risking strategy, we contributed $136 million to our plan. at the same time, we changed the plan's target allocation from 65% equity securities and 35% fixed income securities, to 5% equity securities and 95% fixed income securities. the fixed income allocation includes corporate bonds of companies from diversified industries and u.s. government bonds. as a result of this contribution and change in investment policy, we anticipate that there will be less need for contributions in future years, and the pension plan will not be required to pay the pension benefit guaranty corporation variable rate premiums. income is expected to be lower than it was in prior periods because the expected return on plan assets is lower. during 2016, we contributed $10 million to our pension plan.
we do not expect to make contributions to the pension plan in 2019. we will continue to monitor the plan's funded status, and we will consider modifying the plan's investment policy based on the actuarial and funding characteristics of the retirement plan, the demographic profile of plan participants, and our business objectives. our long-term objective is to keep the plan at or near full funding, while minimizing the risk inherent in pension plans.

we use a market-related value of plan assets when determining the estimated return on plan assets. gains/losses on plan assets are amortized over a four-year period and accumulate in other comprehensive income. we recognize deferred gains and losses in future net income based on a "corridor" approach, where the corridor is equal to 10% of the greater of the benefit obligation or the market-related value of plan assets at the beginning of the year.
supplemental executive retirement plan we have a u.s. nonqualified supplemental executive retirement plan, or serp, which provides supplemental retirement benefits for certain employees. the future benefit accrual of the serp plan is frozen. to provide for the future payments of these benefits, we have purchased insurance on the lives of certain of the participants through company-owned policies. as of december 31, 2018 and 2017, the cash surrender value of such policies was $57 million and $55 million, respectively, and is included in other non-current assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. we also acquired a serp through both the ice ngx and chx acquisitions. the following table provides a summary of the changes in the serp benefit obligations (in millions):

serp plan expense in the accompanying consolidated statements of income was $1 million, $1 million and $1 million in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively, and primarily consisted of interest cost. the following table shows the projected payments for the serp plan based on the actuarial assumptions (in millions):
pension and serp plans assumptions the weighted-average assumptions used to develop the actuarial present value of the projected benefit obligation and net periodic pension/serp costs in 2018, 2017 and 2016 are set forth below:
weighted-average discount rate for determining benefit obligations (pension/serp plans)   4.0% / 3.8%          3.4% / 3.1%          3.9% / 3.4%
expected long-term rate of return on plan assets (pension/serp plans)                      3.5% / n/a           6.5% / n/a           6.5% / n/a rate of compensation increase                                                                     n/a                  n/a                  n/a the assumed discount rate reflects the market rates for high-quality corporate bonds currently available. the discount rate was determined by considering the average of pension yield curves constructed on a large population of high quality corporate bonds. the resulting discount rates reflect the matching of plan liability cash flows to yield curves. to develop the expected long-term rate of return on assets assumption, we considered the historical returns and the future expectations for returns for each asset class as well as the target asset allocation of the pension portfolio.
the determination of the interest cost component utilizes a full yield curve approach by applying the specific spot rates along the yield curve used in the determination of the benefit obligation to each year's discounted cash flow.
post-retirement benefit plans our defined benefit plans provide certain health care and life insurance benefits for certain eligible retired nyse u.s. employees. these post-retirement benefit plans, which may be modified in accordance with their terms, are fully frozen. the net periodic post-retirement benefit costs were $5 million, $5 million and $7 million in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. the defined benefit plans are unfunded and we currently do not expect to fund the post-retirement benefit plans. the weighted-average discount rate for determining the benefit obligation as of december 31, 2018 and 2017 is 4.0% and 3.4%, respectively. the weighted-average discount rate for determining the interest cost as of december 31, 2018 and 2017 is 3.0% and 3.2%, respectively. the following table shows the actuarial determined benefit obligation, interest costs, employee contributions, actuarial (gain) loss, benefits paid during the periods and the accrued employee benefits (in millions):

the amount of prior actuarial loss (gain) included in accumulated other comprehensive income related to the pension, serp and postretirement plans as of december 31, 2018, which are expected to be recognized in net periodic benefit cost in the coming year, is estimated to be (in millions):

other benefit plans and defined contribution plans our u.s. employees are eligible to participate in 401(k) and profit sharing plans and our non-u.s. employees are eligible to participate in defined contribution pension plans. total contributions under the 401(k), profit sharing and defined contribution pension plans were $39 million, $38 million and $31 million in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. no discretionary or profit sharing contributions were made during 2018, 2017 or 2016.
17.   fair value measurements financial assets and liabilities recorded or disclosed at fair value in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets as of december 31, 2018 and 2017 are classified in their entirety based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the asset or liability's fair value measurement.
our mutual funds are equity and fixed income mutual funds held for the purpose of providing future payments for the supplemental executive savings plan and serp and are classified as equity investments and measured at fair value using level 1 inputs with adjustments recorded in net income (note 16).
mers holds fixed income investments in order to satisfy the original terms of the governing documents of our june 2016 acquisition of a majority equity position in mers (note 4). these investments are measured at fair value using level 2 inputs with adjustments recorded in net income.
we did not use level 3 inputs to determine the fair value of assets or liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of december 31, 2018 or 2017.
we measure certain assets, such as intangible assets, at fair value on a non-recurring basis. these assets are recognized at fair value if they are deemed to be impaired. as of december 31, 2018 and 2017, except for the fair value adjustment related to our $4 million impairment of exchange registration intangible assets associated with the closure of ice futures canada and ice clear canada (note 8), none of our intangible assets were required to be recorded at fair value since no other impairments were recorded.
we measure certain equity investments at fair value on a non-recurring basis using our policy election under asu no. 2016-01 (note 2). during 2018, we evaluated transactions involving these investments and concluded that no fair value adjustments were required under this election.
as of december 31, 2018, (i) the fair value of our $1.23 billion 2048 senior notes was $1.24 billion, (ii) the fair value of our $591 million 2028 senior notes was $599 million, (iii) the fair value of our $496 million 2027 senior notes was $477 million, (iv) the fair value of our $1.24 billion 2025 senior notes was $1.26 billion, (v) the fair value of our $793 million october 2023 senior notes was $821 million, (vi) the fair value of our $397 million september 2023 senior notes was $402 million, (vii) the fair value of our $496 million 2022 senior notes was $484 million, and (viii) the fair value of our $1.25 billion 2020 senior notes was $1.24 billion. the fair values of these fixed rate notes were estimated using quoted market prices for these
instruments. the fair value of our commercial paper approximates the carrying value since the rates of interest on this short-term debt approximate market rates as of december 31, 2018.
excluding our equity investments without a readily determinable fair value, all other financial instruments are determined to approximate carrying value due to the short period of time to their maturities.
18.   segment reporting we operate two business segments: our trading and clearing segment and our data and listings segment. this presentation is reflective of how our chief operating decision maker reviews and operates our business. our trading and clearing segment comprises our transaction-based execution and clearing businesses. our data and listings segment comprises our data services and our securities listings businesses, which are both largely subscription-based. our chief operating decision maker does not review total assets or statements of income below operating income by segments; therefore, such information is not presented below. our two segments do not engage in intersegment transactions.
certain prior year segment expenses have been reclassified to conform to our current year's segment financial statement presentation, as follows:
â€¢   in 2018, we began tracking fixed income and credit revenues separately as a result of acquisitions.
â€¢   exchange data revenues increased by $76 million and $66 million in 2017 and 2016, respectively, and desktops and connectivity revenues decreased by the same amount as a result of reclassifying feeds revenues to be included with exchange data revenues.
â€¢   operating expenses for the data and listings segment increased by $55 million in 2016 while decreasing the operating expenses for the trading and clearing segment by the same amount.
financial data for our business segments is as follows in 2018, 2017 and 2016 (in millions):

revenue from one clearing member of the trading and clearing segment comprised $406 million, or 17% of our trading and clearing revenues in 2018. revenue from two clearing members of the trading and clearing segment comprised $477 million, or 22% of our trading and clearing revenues in 2017. revenue from one clearing member of the trading and clearing segment comprised $221 million, or 11% of our trading and clearing revenues in 2016. clearing members are primarily intermediaries and represent a broad range of principal trading firms. if a clearing member ceased its operations, we believe that the trading firms would continue to conduct transactions and would clear those transactions through another clearing member firm. no additional customers or clearing members accounted for more than 10% of our segment revenues or consolidated revenues in 2018, 2017 and 2016.

â€¢   the 2017 effective tax rate is lower than the 2016 effective tax rate due to a $764 million deferred tax benefit associated with the enactment of the tcja in 2017.
business environment and market trends our business environment has been characterized by:
â€¢   globalization of exchanges, customers and competitors;
â€¢   lower interest rates and financial markets uncertainty;
â€¢   rising demand for speed, data, data capacity and connectivity by market participants, necessitating increased investment in technology;
â€¢   increasing focus on capital and cost efficiencies; and
â€¢   consolidation and increasing competition among global markets for trading, clearing and listings.
price volatility increases the need to hedge risk and creates demand among market participants for the exchange of risk through trading and clearing. market liquidity is one of the primary market attributes for attracting and maintaining customers and is an important indicator of a market's strength. in addition, the ability to evolve existing products to serve emerging needs, develop new products and respond to competitive dynamics in pricing, exclusivity and consolidation is important to our business.
recent changes with regard to global financial reform have emphasized the importance of transparent markets, centralized clearing and access to data, all of which are important aspects of our product offering. however, some of the proposed rules have yet to be implemented and some rules that have already been partially implemented are being reconsidered. in addition, some of the global regulations have not been fully harmonized and several of the mifid ii regulations are inconsistent with u.s. rules. as the evolution continues, legislative and regulatory actions may change the way we conduct our business and may create uncertainty for market participants, which could affect trading volumes or demand for market data. as a result, it is difficult to predict all of the effects that the legislation and its implementing regulations will have on us. as discussed more fully in item 1 "- business - regulation" included in this annual report, brexit, the implementation of mifid ii and other regulations may result in operational, regulatory and/or business risk.
in recent years, low interest rates and uncertainty in the financial markets continued to reflect the impact of a relatively slow economic recovery. lower growth in asia and the eu may also continue to affect global financial markets. in addition, economic and regulatory uncertainty, coupled with periods of high market volatility around geopolitical events, low interest rates and low natural gas prices, has affected our clients' activities in recent years. the duration of these trends will determine the continued impact on our business.
we have diversified our business so that we are not dependent on volatility or trading activity in any one asset class. in addition, we have increased our portion of non-transaction and clearing revenues from 39% in 2014 to 56% in 2018. this non-transaction revenue includes data services and listings.
many of the data products we sell and services we provide are required for our clients' business operations regardless of market volatility or shifts in business profitability levels. we anticipate that there will continue to be growth in the financial information services sector driven by a number of global trends, including the following:
â€¢   increasing global regulatory demands;
â€¢   greater use of fair value accounting standards and reliance on independent valuations;
â€¢   greater emphasis on risk management;
â€¢   market fragmentation driven by regulatory changes;
â€¢   ongoing growth in the size and diversity of financial markets;
â€¢   increased automation of fixed income and other less automated markets;
â€¢   the development of new data products;
â€¢   the demand for greater data capacity and connectivity;
â€¢   increasing demand for outsourced services by financial institutions.
we continue to focus on our strategy to grow each of our revenue streams, as well as on our company-wide expense reduction initiatives and our synergies in connection with our acquisitions in order to mitigate these uncertainties and to build on our growth opportunities by leveraging our proprietary data, clearing and markets.
segment results our business is conducted through two reportable business segments:
â€¢   trading and clearing, which comprises our transaction-based execution and clearing businesses; and
â€¢   data and listings, which comprises our subscription-based data services and securities listings businesses.
while revenues are recorded specifically in the segment in which they are earned or to which they relate, a significant portion of our operating expenses are not solely related to a specific segment because the expenses serve functions that are necessary for the operation of both segments. we use a pro-rata revenue approach as the allocation method for the expenses that do not relate solely to one segment. further, we did not allocate expenses to specific revenue streams within these segments since such an allocation is not reasonably possible. our two segments do not engage in intersegment transactions.
trading and clearing segment the following presents selected statements of income data for our trading and clearing segment (dollars in millions):

transaction and clearing revenues our transaction and clearing revenues are reported on a net basis, except for the nyse transaction-based expenses discussed below, and consist of fees collected from our derivatives, fixed income, cash equities and equity options trading and derivatives clearing. in our derivatives markets, we earn transaction and clearing revenues from both counterparties to each contract that is traded and/or cleared, and in our equity and equity options markets, we receive trade execution fees as well as routing fees related to orders in our markets which are routed to other markets for execution.
rates per-contract, or rpc, are driven by the number of contracts or securities traded and the fees charged per contract, net of certain rebates. our per-contract transaction and clearing revenues will depend upon many factors, including, but not limited to, market conditions, transaction and clearing volume, product mix, pricing, applicable revenue sharing and market making agreements, and new product introductions. because transaction and clearing revenues are generally assessed on a per-contract basis, revenues and profitability fluctuate with changes in contract volume and due to product mix.
in 2018, 2017 and 2016, 20%, 20% and 19%, respectively, of our trading and clearing segment revenues, less transaction-based expenses, were billed in pounds sterling or euros. due to the fluctuations of the pound sterling and euro over the last two years compared to the u.s. dollar, our trading and clearing segment revenues, less transaction-based expenses, were higher by $18 million in 2018 from 2017, and were lower by $14 million in 2017 from 2016.
our transaction and clearing revenues are presented net of rebates. we recorded rebates of $844 million, $749 million and $674 million in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. we offer rebates in certain of our markets primarily to support market liquidity and trading volume by providing qualified participants in those markets a discount to the applicable commission rate. such rebates are calculated based on volumes traded. the increase in the rebates is due primarily to an increase in the number of participants in the rebate programs offered on various contracts, an increase in our traded volume and an increase in the number of rebate programs.
â€¢   energy futures and options contracts: total energy volume and revenues increased 1% and 6%, respectively, in 2018 from 2017, and increased 8% and 5%, respectively, in 2017 from 2016. revenues increased in 2018 from 2017 due to a higher mix of gasoil, emissions and ttf gas volumes, which have a higher average rpc than other energy products.
total oil volume increased 3% in 2018 from 2017, and increased 14% in 2017 from 2016. ice brent crude futures and options volume was flat in 2018 from 2017, and increased 15% in 2017 from 2016. ice wti crude futures and options volume increased 5% in 2018 from 2017, and increased 14% in 2017 from 2016. the volume increases were primarily due to increased oil price volatility related to shifting supply and demand dynamics globally; broader market volatility in oil products, equities and foreign exchange rates; acts of central governments; outcomes of elections; and uncertainty around the organization of petroleum exporting countries, or opec, policy. our record gasoil futures and options volume in 2018 increased 11% from 2017, and increased 13% in 2017 from 2016. gasoil futures and options increased during 2018 and 2017 primarily due to increased demand for distillates, strong economic activity in europe and asia and regulatory uncertainty.
our global natural gas futures and options volume decreased 4% in 2018 from 2017, and decreased 1% in 2017 from 2016. the volume decrease in 2018 from 2017 was primarily due to lower u.s. price volatility reducing our commercial customers' need to hedge the henry hub contract, and depressed gas prices driven by a continued surplus of natural gas during 2018 as compared to 2017. our 2018 henry hub natural gas volume decrease was partially offset by increased volumes in our north american basis market and ttf gas in europe. our record ttf gas volumes in 2018 were driven by changing natural gas dynamics due to the continued globalization of natural gas. emission futures and options volumes increased 73% in 2018 from 2017, and increased 1% in 2017 from 2016. our record emissions volumes in 2018 were driven by higher carbon prices and supply-demand dynamics impacted by regulatory uncertainty.
â€¢   agricultural and metals futures and options contracts: total volume and revenues in our agricultural and metals futures and options markets increased 15% and 16%, respectively, in 2018 from 2017, and decreased 7% and 5%, respectively, in 2017 from 2016. volume in our largest agricultural contract, sugar futures and options, increased 20% in 2018 from 2017, and decreased 10% in 2017 from 2016. other agricultural and metal futures and options volume increased 11% in 2018 from 2017, and decreased 4% in 2017 from 2016. the increases in agricultural volumes to record levels in 2018 were primarily driven by price volatility resulting from shifting supply and demand dynamics. the decreases in agricultural volume in 2017 were primarily driven by the reduced price volatility in 2017 compared to the higher price volatility in 2016.
â€¢   financial futures and options contracts: interest rates futures and options volume and revenue increased 14% and 19%, respectively, in 2018 from 2017, and increased 27% and 9%, respectively, in 2017 from 2016. our record level interest rate futures and options volume in 2018 was driven by expectations for heightened central bank activity during 2018, coupled with geopolitical uncertainty in the u.k. and europe. interest rates futures and options revenues were $230 million, $193 million and $177 million in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively.
other financial futures and options volume decreased 9% in 2018 from 2017, and decreased 19% in 2017 from 2016. the decrease was primarily due to the termination of our exclusive license to list futures and options contracts on the russellÂ® indices. excluding the futures and options contracts on the russellÂ® indices, other financial futures and options volume increased 18% in 2018 from 2017. other financial futures and options revenues were $124 million, $133 million and $141 million in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively.
â€¢   cash equities and equity options: cash equities handled volume increased 14% in 2018 from 2017, primarily due to higher total u.s. equity volumes driven by heightened volatility in the u.s. equity markets coupled with the may
2018 commencement of trading of nyse national and the july 2018 acquisition of chx. cash equities handled volume decreased 17% in 2017 from 2016, primarily due to reduced u.s. equities market volatility during 2017 as compared to 2016. cash equities revenues, net of transaction-based expenses, were $220 million, $196 million, and $223 million in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively.
equity options volume increased 43% in 2018 from 2017 primarily due to heightened volatility in the u.s. equity markets, as well as increased market share in 2018 due to greater volatility. equity options volume decreased 13% in 2017 from 2016 primarily due to lower u.s. equity market volatility and the restructuring of the nyse american options business. equity options revenues, net of transaction-based expenses, were $107 million, $90 million and $98 million in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively.
â€¢   fixed income and credit: cds clearing revenues were $139 million, $113 million and $107 million in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. the notional value of cds cleared was $16.4 trillion, $11.5 trillion and $11.5 trillion, in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. buy-side participation at our u.s. cds clearing house, ice clear credit, reached record levels in terms of number of participants and notional cleared due to increased participation from both u.s. and european buy-side customers due to greater regulatory certainty, depth of liquidity, the breadth of products offered, and cost efficient margining in the u.s. relative to europe. fixed income and credit also includes revenues from ice bonds, which includes ice bondpoint, tmc bonds, ice credit trade and ice mortgage services.
â€¢   otc and other transactions: otc and other transactions include revenues from our otc energy business and other trade confirmation services.
â€¢   other revenues: other revenues primarily include interest income on certain clearing margin deposits, regulatory penalties and fines, fees for use of our facilities, regulatory fees charged to member organizations of our u.s. securities exchanges, designated market maker service fees, exchange membership fees and agricultural grading and certification fees. the increase in other revenues in 2018 from 2017 is primarily due to increased interest income earned on certain clearing margin deposits, as well as a $5 million settlement received by nyse regulation from ing financial markets, llc, or ing, following an investigation into improper conduct by ing's lending desk from 2007 to 2015. the 2018 increase was partially offset by a $6 million breakup fee received in august 2017 related to the termination of the derivatives clearing agreement with euronext group n.v.'s, or euronext, under which ice clear netherlands was to provide clearing of euronext's financial and commodity derivatives.

open interest is the aggregate number of contracts (long or short) that clearing members hold either for their own account or on behalf of their clients. open interest refers to the total number of contracts that are currently "open," - in other words, contracts that have been traded but not yet liquidated by either an offsetting trade, exercise, expiration, or assignment. open interest is also a measure of the future activity remaining to be closed out in terms of the number of contracts that members and their clients continue to hold in the particular contract and by the number of contracts held for each contract month listed by the exchange. the following charts and table present our year-end open interest for our futures and options contracts (in thousands, except for percentages):

for nyse cash equities, market share increased in 2018 due to increased equity market volatility, the commencement of trading on nyse national and the acquisition of chx. nyse cash equities market share declined during 2017 due to historically low volatility driving more trading to off-exchange trading venues, particularly dark-pools. for nyse equity options, 2018 market share improved due to greater equity market volatility and decreased in 2017 due to a strategic focus on maximizing revenues in an extremely competitive environment.
transaction-based expenses our equities and equity options markets pay fees to the sec pursuant to section 31 of the exchange act. section 31 fees are recorded on a gross basis as a component of transaction and clearing fee revenue. these section 31 fees are assessed to recover the government's costs of supervising and regulating the securities markets and professionals. we, in turn, collect corresponding activity assessment fees from member organizations clearing or settling trades on the equities and options exchanges, and recognize these amounts in our transaction and clearing revenues when invoiced. the activity assessment fees are designed to equal the section 31 fees. as a result, activity assessment fees and the corresponding section 31 fees do not have an impact on our net income, although the timing of payment by us may vary from collections. the fees we collect are included in cash at the time of receipt and we remit the amounts to the sec semi-annually as required. the total amount is included in accrued liabilities and was $105 million as of december 31, 2018.
we make liquidity payments to cash and options trading customers, as well as routing charges made to other exchanges included in transaction-based expenses. we incur routing charges when we do not have the best bid or offer in the market for a security that a customer is trying to buy or sell on one of our securities exchanges. in that case, we route the customer's order to the external market center that displays the best bid or offer. the external market center charges us a fee per share (denominated in tenths of a cent per share) for routing to its system. we record routing charges on a gross basis as a component of transaction and clearing fee revenue.
operating expenses, operating income and operating margin our trading and clearing segment operating expenses increased $130 million in 2018 from 2017, and decreased $45 million in 2017 from 2016, partially related to the $33 million creditex customer relationship intangible asset impairment expense recorded in 2016. see "- consolidated operating expenses" below for a discussion of the significant changes in our operating expenses. our trading and clearing segment operating income increased $162 million in 2018 from 2017, and increased $71 million in 2017 from 2016. trading and clearing segment operating margins were 62%, 63% and 61% in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. the operating income increases in the last two years were driven by the revenue increases discussed above.
our trading and clearing segment adjusted operating expenses were $824 million, $714 million and $716 million in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. our trading and clearing segment adjusted operating income was $1.6 billion, $1.4 billion and $1.4 billion in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. our trading and clearing segment adjusted operating margins were 66% in 2018, 2017 and 2016. see "- non-gaap financial measures" below.

data services revenues our data and listings segment represents subscription-based, or recurring, revenues from data services and listings services offered across our trading and clearing businesses and ice data services. through ice data services, we generate revenues from a range of global financial and commodity markets, including pricing and reference data, exchange data, analytics, feeds, index services, desktops and connectivity solutions. through nyse, nyse american and nyse arca, we generate listings revenue related to the provision of listings services for public companies and etfs, and related corporate actions for listed companies.
in 2018, 2017 and 2016, 8%, 10% and 12%, respectively, of our data and listings segment revenues were billed in pounds sterling or euros (all relating to our data services revenues). as the pound sterling or euro exchange rate changes, the u.s. equivalent of revenues denominated in foreign currencies changes accordingly. due to the weakening of the u.s. dollar compared to the pound sterling and euro during 2018, our data services revenues were higher by $7 million in 2018 than in 2017. due to the weakening of the pound sterling and euro compared to the u.s. dollar during 2017, our data services revenues were lower by $8 million in 2017 than in 2016.
our data services revenues are primarily subscription-based and increased 1% in 2018 from 2017, and increased 5% in 2017 from 2016. the increases in revenues in both 2018 and 2017 were primarily due to the strong retention rate of
existing customers, the addition of new customers, increased purchases by existing customers and increases in pricing of our products, partially offset by the divestitures of idms in march 2017 and trayport in december 2017 within our desktop and connectivity business. the increase in revenue in 2017 from 2016 was also partially due to our acquisitions of tmx atrium in may 2017 and bofaml's global research division's index business in october 2017 and the impact of foreign currency translation.
â€¢   pricing and analytics: our pricing and analytics revenues increased 7% in 2018 from 2017 and increased 13% in 2017 from 2016. the increases in revenue were driven by the strong retention rate of existing customers, the addition of new customers, increased purchases by existing customers, increases in pricing of our products and the acquisition and further distribution of the ice bofaml indices.
â€¢   exchange data and feeds: our exchange data and feeds revenues increased 6% in 2018 from 2017 and increased 5% in 2017 from 2016. the increases in revenues were driven by the strong retention rate of existing customers, the addition of new customers, increased purchases by existing customers and a larger share of the nms plan revenue.
â€¢   desktops and connectivity: our desktop and connectivity revenues decreased 17% in 2018 from 2017 and decreased 7% in 2017 from 2016 driven primarily by the divestitures of idms and trayport in 2017.
annual subscription value, or asv, represents, at a point in time, the data services revenues subscribed for the succeeding 12 months. asv does not include new sales, contract terminations or price changes that may occur during that 12-month period. asv also does not include certain data services revenue streams that are not subscription-based. revenue from asv businesses has historically represented approximately 90% of our data revenues. thus, while it is an indicative forward-looking metric, it does not provide a growth forecast of the next 12 months of data services revenues.
as of december 31, 2018, asv was $1.922 billion, which increased 6.1% compared to the asv as of december 31, 2017. this does not adjust for year-over-year foreign exchange fluctuations or impacts of acquisitions. underpinning this growth is strength in our pricing & analytics business.
listings revenues listings revenues in our securities markets arise from fees applicable to companies listed on our cash equities exchanges - original listing fees and annual listing fees. original listing fees consist of two components: initial listing fees and fees related to corporate actions. initial listing fees, subject to a minimum and maximum amount, are based on the number of shares that a company initially lists. all listings fees are billed upfront and the identified performance obligations are satisfied over time. revenue related to the investor relations performance obligation is recognized ratably over a two-year period, with the remaining revenue recognized ratably over time as customers continue to list on our exchanges, which is generally estimated to be over a period of up to nine years for nyse and up to five years for nyse arca and nyse american.
in addition, we earn corporate actions-related listing fees in connection with actions involving the issuance of new shares, such as stock splits, rights issues and sales of additional securities, as well as mergers and acquisitions. listings fees related to other corporate actions are considered contract modifications of our listing contracts and are recognized ratably over time as customers continue to list on our exchanges, which is generally estimated to be a period of six years for nyse and three years for nyse arca and nyse american.
our listings revenues increased 4% in 2018 from 2017 and decreased 1% in 2017 from 2016 due to changes in market conditions for ipos.
operating expenses, operating income and operating margin our data and listings segment operating expenses increased $7 million in 2018 from 2017, and decreased $36 million in 2017 from 2016. see "- consolidated operating expenses" below for a discussion of the significant changes in our operating expenses. our data and listings segment operating income increased $42 million in 2018 from 2017, and increased $136 million in 2017 from 2016. our data and listings segment operating margins were 42%, 41% and 37% in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. the operating income and operating margin increases during 2018 and 2017 were driven by the revenue increases discussed above.
our data and listings segment adjusted operating expenses were $1.2 billion in 2018, 2017 and 2016. our data and listings segment adjusted operating income was $1.3 billion, $1.3 billion and $1.2 billion in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. our data and listings segment adjusted operating margins were 51%, 51% and 49% in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. see "- non-gaap financial measures" below.
consolidated operating expenses the following presents our consolidated operating expenses (dollars in millions):
2018                                                                                 2017          change                2017                2016          change compensation and benefits                                    $994                $946             5     %            $946                $953            (1   )%

total operating expenses                                   $2,396              $2,259             6     %          $2,259              $2,340            (3   )%
the majority of our operating expenses do not vary directly with changes in our volume and revenues, except for certain technology and communication expenses and a portion of our compensation expense that is tied directly to our data sales or overall financial performance.
we expect our operating expenses to increase in absolute terms in future periods in connection with our acquisitions and growth of our business, and to vary from year-to-year based on the type and level of our acquisitions, our integrations and other investments.
in 2018, 2017 and 2016, 13%, 14% and 18%, respectively, of our operating expenses were incurred in pounds sterling or euros. due to the weakening of the u.s. dollar compared to the pound sterling and euro in 2018, our consolidated operating expenses were higher by $12 million in 2018 than in 2017. due to the weakening of the pound sterling and euro as compared to the u.s. dollar in 2017, our consolidated operating expenses were lower by $14 million in 2017 than in 2016. see item 7(a) "- quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk - foreign currency exchange rate risk" below for additional information.
compensation and benefits expenses compensation and benefits expense is our most significant operating expense and includes non-capitalized employee wages, bonuses, non-cash or stock compensation, certain severance costs, benefits and employer taxes. the bonus component of our compensation and benefits expense is based on both our financial performance and the individual employee performance. the performance-based restricted stock compensation expense is also based on our financial performance. therefore, our compensation and benefits expense will vary year-to-year based on our financial performance and fluctuations in the number of employees.
as of december 31, 2018, we had 5,161 employees, compared to 4,952 and 5,631 as of december 31, 2017 and december 31, 2016, respectively. our employee headcount increased in 2018 from 2017 primarily due to new employees related to the acquisitions of bondpoint in january 2018, chx holdings, inc. and tmc bonds in july 2018 and mers in october 2018, partially offset by continued employee terminations associated with our integration of interactive data. our employee headcount decreased in 2017 from 2016 primarily due to the divestitures in 2017 of idms, trayport and nyse governance services, and employee terminations in connection with our integration of interactive data, partially offset by new employees related to the acquisitions of ice ngx and tmx atrium in 2017. see "- recent developments" above.
our compensation and benefits expenses increased in 2018 from 2017 primarily due to employee severance and retention costs and a net increase in our employee headcount, partially offset by a decrease in non-cash compensation expense. we incurred employee severance and retention costs of $41 million, $21 million and $10 million in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. the decrease in compensation and benefits expenses in 2017 from 2016 was minimal.
non-cash compensation expenses recognized in our consolidated financial statements for employee stock options and restricted stock were $130 million, $135 million and $123 million in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. the decrease in non-cash compensation expenses in 2018 from 2017 was primarily related to a change in ice's non-cash incentive plans that reduced the overall amount of non-cash incentives awarded. the increase in non-cash compensation expenses in 2017 from 2016 primarily relates to the integration of the interactive data employees into the ice non-cash incentive plans.
professional services expenses this expense includes fees for consulting services received on strategic and technology initiatives, temporary labor, as well as regulatory, legal and accounting fees, and may fluctuate as a result of changes in consulting and technology services, temporary labor, and regulatory, accounting and legal proceedings.
professional services expenses increased in 2018 from 2017 primarily due to consulting and legal fees related to software development consulting costs. professional services expenses decreased in 2017 from 2016 primarily due to the continued reduction in professional services and contractors at nyse. we eliminated or replaced certain contractor positions with full-time employees at nyse in 2016. in addition, during 2016, we recorded a credit from a third-party service provider related to fees charged in a prior period. legal fees, which are included in professional services expenses, primarily related to class action lawsuits in which nyse was a defendant. these decreases were partially offset by professional services expenses incurred by interactive data, trayport, securities evaluations and credit market analysis.
acquisition-related transaction and integration costs in 2018, we incurred $34 million in acquisition-related transaction and integration costs, primarily relating to employee terminations and lease terminations in connection with our our integrations of interactive data, securities evaluations and
credit market analysis, professional services costs from our 2018 acquisitions, and a $5 million banker success fee in connection with our acquisition of tmc bonds. the integration of interactive data was completed by june 30, 2018.
in 2017, we incurred $36 million in acquisition-related transaction and integration costs, primarily relating to our integrations of interactive data, securities evaluations and credit market analysis and our acquisitions of bondpoint, tmx atrium, the ice bofaml indices and nyse national. of this amount, $11 million was primarily related to the acquisitions. we incurred $25 million for interactive data, securities evaluations and credit market analysis integration costs relating to employee and lease termination costs and professional services costs.
in 2016, we incurred $80 million in acquisition-related transaction and integration costs primarily relating to our integrations of interactive data and nyse, legal and professional fees related to the trayport cma review, our investment in mers, our acquisitions of securities evaluations and credit market analysis, and various other potential and discontinued acquisitions. of this amount, $41 million was primarily related to the acquisitions and other transaction costs. we incurred $39 million for interactive data and nyse integration costs during 2016, primarily relating to employee and lease termination costs and professional services costs. the integration of nyse was completed in 2016 and no nyse integration costs were incurred after 2016.
we expect to continue to explore and pursue various potential acquisitions and other strategic opportunities to strengthen our competitive position and support our growth. as a result, we may incur acquisition-related transaction costs in future periods. see "- non-gaap financial measures" below.
technology and communication expenses technology support services consist of costs for running our wholly-owned data centers, hosting costs paid to third-party data centers, and maintenance of our computer hardware and software required to support our technology and cybersecurity. these costs are driven by system capacity, functionality and redundancy requirements. communication expenses consist of costs for network connection for our electronic platforms, telecommunications costs, and fees paid for access to external market data. this expense also includes licensing and other fee agreement expenses which may be impacted by growth in electronic contract volume, our capacity requirements, changes in the number of telecommunications hubs and connections with customers to access our electronic platforms directly.
technology and communications expenses increased in 2018 from 2017, primarily due to $17 million in data center migrations, hardware support upgrades and cybersecurity investments, $11 million in increased costs related to our recent acquisitions, net of divestitures, and $7 million in increased costs for external market data content acquisition and revenue share agreements related to our product offering. technology and communications expenses increased in 2017 from 2016, primarily due to $14 million in increased hardware support upgrades and cybersecurity investments, and $10 million in costs related to our recent acquisitions, net of divestitures.
rent and occupancy expenses rent and occupancy expense relates to leased and owned property and includes rent, maintenance, real estate taxes, utilities and other related costs. we have significant operations located in and around atlanta, new york and london with smaller offices located throughout the world. see item 2 "- properties" above for additional information regarding our leased and owned property.
excluding the impact of the acquisitions, rent and occupancy expenses decreased the last two years primarily due to reduced rent and occupancy costs realized from the continued consolidation of our atlanta, new york and london office locations.
selling, general and administrative expenses selling, general and administrative expenses include marketing, advertising, public relations, insurance, bank service charges, dues and subscriptions, travel and entertainment, non-income taxes and other general and administrative costs.
selling, general and administrative expenses decreased in 2018 from 2017, primarily due to $14 million in accruals relating to sec investigations and inquiries made during 2017. selling, general and administrative expenses increased in 2017 from 2016, primarily due to the acquisitions of securities evaluations and credit market analysis and $14 million in accruals relating to sec investigations and inquiries. excluding the impact of acquisitions and the sec investigations and inquiries, selling, general and administrative expenses decreased the last two years primarily due to lower marketing expenses. refer to note 15 to our consolidated financial statements, included elsewhere in this annual report, for more information on the sec investigations and inquiries.
depreciation and amortization expenses depreciation and amortization expense results from depreciation of long-lived assets such as buildings, leasehold improvements, planes, furniture, fixtures and equipment over their estimated useful lives. this expense includes amortization of intangible assets obtained in our acquisitions of businesses, as well as on various licensing agreements, over their estimated useful lives. intangible assets subject to amortization consist primarily of customer relationships, trading products with finite lives and technology. this expense also includes amortization of internally-developed and purchased software over its estimated useful life.
we recorded amortization expenses on intangible assets acquired as part of our acquisitions, as well as on other intangible assets, of $289 million, $272 million and $323 million in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. amortization expense increased in 2018 from 2017, as a result of ice ngx, bondpoint, tmc bonds, the ice bofaml indices, mers and tmx atrium intangible assets. in addition, in 2018, we recorded a $4 million impairment loss on exchange registration intangible assets related to our closure of ice futures canada and ice clear canada as amortization expense. this increase in amortization expense was partially offset by a decrease in amortization recorded on our russell license intangible assets in 2018 from 2017 due to these assets becoming fully amortized, and amortization expense recorded in 2017 as a result of the net loss of $6 million on the sale of nyse governance services.
the decrease in the amortization expenses recorded on the intangible assets in 2017 from 2016 is primarily due to a reduction in amortization expenses recorded on intangible assets which became fully amortized (primarily related to certain of the nyse intangible assets) and the divestitures of trayport and nyse governance services, partially offset by amortization expenses recorded on the securities evaluations, credit market analysis, ice ngx and tmx atrium intangible assets. in 2016, we recorded an impairment of the creditex customer relationship intangible asset of $33 million, which was recorded in depreciation and amortization expenses. in 2016, we sold certain of creditex's u.s. voice brokerage operations to tullett prebon and discontinued creditex's u.k. voice brokerage operations. we continue to operate creditex's electronically traded markets and systems, post-trade connectivity platforms and intellectual property.
we recorded depreciation expenses on our fixed assets of $293 million, $257 million and $254 million in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively, with the increase in 2018 primarily due to depreciation resulting from increased software development.
consolidated non-operating income (expense)
income and expenses incurred through activities outside of our core operations are considered non-operating. the following tables present our non-operating income (expenses) (dollars in millions):
2018                                                                           2017          change              2017              2016          change other income (expense):
interest income we recognized interest income on our investments of $22 million, $8 million and $3 million during 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. interest income increased in 2018 from 2017 primarily due to a rise in short-term interest rates on various investments.
interest expense interest expense increased in 2018 from 2017, primarily due to an increase in the principal and coupon of our bond refinancing in august 2018, as well as a rise in short-term interest rates impacting our commercial paper program. interest expense increased in 2017 from 2016, primarily due to interest expense that we recognized relating to our bond refinancing in august 2017, partially offset by the september 2017 repayment of $850 million of 2.00% senior unsecured fixed rate notes that were due in october 2017. see "- debt" below.
other income, net in december 2017, we sold trayport to tmx group for Â£550 million ($733 million). we recognized a net gain of $110 million on the divestiture of trayport, which was recorded as other income in 2017.
in connection with cetip's merger with bm&fbovespa s.a., now b3, and its subsequent sale, we recognized a $176 million realized investment gain in other income in 2017 and $9 million in foreign exchange losses and transaction expenses in other expense in 2017. we recognized dividend income received relating to our investment in cetip in other income, which was $5 million and $17 million in 2017 and 2016, respectively. we no longer receive dividends from cetip subsequent to its sale in the first quarter of 2017.
we account for our investments in the options clearing corporation, or occ, and mers until our october 2018 acquisition of mers, as equity method investments. we recognized $46 million, $36 million and $25 million in equity income related to these investments during 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively, as other income. prior to october 2018, we owned a majority stake in mers and treated it as an equity method investment because we did not have the ability to control its operations. on october 3, 2018, we completed the purchase of all remaining interests of mers and subsequently own 100% of mers. on that date, we gained control of mers, began to include mers's results as part of our consolidated operations and recognized a $110 million gain on our initial investment value in mers as other income. mers is now part of ice mortgage services.
in connection with our equity investment in euroclear, we recognized dividend income of $15 million in 2018, which is included in other income.
in connection with our adoption of asu 2017-07, we are recognizing the other components of net benefit cost of our defined benefit plans in the income statement as non-operating income on a full retrospective basis. the combined net periodic (expense) benefit of these plans was ($8 million) and $9 million in 2018 and 2017, respectively.
we incurred foreign currency transaction losses of $2 million, $4 million and $1 million in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. this was primarily attributable to the fluctuations of the pound sterling and euro relative to the u.s. dollar. foreign currency gains and losses are recorded in other income, net, when the settlement of foreign currency assets, liabilities and payables that occur through our foreign operations that are received in non-functional currencies due to the increase or decrease in the period-end foreign currency exchange rates between periods. see item 7a "- quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk - foreign currency exchange rate risk" included elsewhere in this annual report for more information on these items.
non-controlling interest for consolidated subsidiaries in which our ownership is less than 100%, and for which we have control over the assets, liabilities and management of the entity, the outside stockholders' interests are shown as non-controlling interest in our consolidated financial statements. as of december 31, 2016, non-controlling interests included those related to the operating results of our cds clearing subsidiaries in which non-ice limited partners held a 42.5% net profit sharing interest; ice endex in which gasunie held a 21% ownership interest; and ice clear netherlands in which abn amro clearing held a 25% ownership interest.
in 2017, we purchased both gasunie's 21% interest in ice endex and abn amro clearing's 25% interest in ice clear netherlands. subsequent to these acquisitions, we own 100% of ice endex and ice clear netherlands and no longer include any non-controlling interest related to either company in our consolidated financial statements. in addition, in 2017, we purchased 12.6% of the net profit sharing interest in our cds clearing subsidiaries from several non-ice limited partners and the remaining partners held a 29.9% net profit sharing interest in our cds clearing subsidiaries as of december 31, 2017.
during september 2018, we purchased a 3.2% interest in a non-ice limited partner of our cds clearing subsidiaries, and the remaining non-ice limited partners hold a 26.7% ownership interest as of december 31, 2018. as of december 31, 2018, there are no other non-controlling interests included in our consolidated financial statements, other than that related to the non-ice partners in bakkt. refer to note 3 to our consolidated financial statements contained elsewhere in this annual report.
in december 2018, bakkt, llc, or bakkt, a newly formed entity, was capitalized with $183 million in initial funding by us as majority owner, along with a group of other minority investors. we hold a call option over these interests subject to certain terms, similarly the non-ice partners in bakkt hold a put option to require us to repurchase their interests subject to certain
consolidated income tax provision consolidated income tax expense (benefit) was $500 million, ($28 million) and $586 million in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. the change in consolidated income tax expense (benefit) between years is primarily due to the tax impact of changes in our pre-tax income and the changes in our effective tax rate each year. our effective tax rate was 20%, (1)% and 29% in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. the effective tax rate in 2018 is lower than the federal statutory rate primarily due to the enactment of the tcja which reduced the u.s. corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21% effective january 1, 2018. the 2018 effective tax rate was further reduced due to tax benefits from the acquisition of mers, deferred tax benefits from changes in estimates and additional tax benefits associated with our sale of trayport in 2017. see "- recent developments" above. the effective tax rates in 2017 and 2016 are lower than the federal statutory rate primarily due to favorable u.s. and u.k. tax law changes and favorable foreign income tax rate differentials, partially offset by state income taxes. favorable foreign income tax rate differentials result primarily from lower income tax rates in the u.k. and various other lower tax jurisdictions as compared to the historical income tax rates in the u.s.
the reductions in u.s. and u.k. corporate income tax rates resulted in deferred tax benefits in the respective periods of enactment. the impact of the deferred tax benefits for the u.s. and u.k. corporate income tax rate reductions in 2017 and 2016 lowered the effective tax rates by 30% and 2%, respectively, and resulted in deferred tax benefits of $764 million and $34 million, respectively.
the decrease in the effective tax rate in 2017 from 2016, is primarily due to the deferred tax benefit associated with the future u.s. income tax rate reduction and tax benefits associated with a divestiture in the second quarter of 2017, partially offset by the deferred tax benefit from the u.k. corporate income tax reduction in the third quarter of 2016, additional tax expense from an illinois corporate income tax rate increase enacted in the third quarter of 2017, and an income tax expense increase due to a relatively higher u.s. mix of income in 2017. see note 13 to our consolidated financial statements and related notes, which are included in this annual report, for additional information on these tax items.
quarterly results of operations the following quarterly unaudited consolidated statements of income data have been prepared on substantially the same basis as our audited consolidated financial statements and include all adjustments, consisting only of normal recurring adjustments, necessary for the fair presentation of our consolidated results of operations for the quarters presented. the historical results for any quarter do not necessarily indicate the results expected for any future period. this unaudited condensed consolidated quarterly data should be read together with our consolidated financial statements and related notes included in this annual report. the following table sets forth quarterly consolidated statements of income data (in millions):

(1) other income (expense), net includes the following: a $110 million gain in connection with our acquisition of mers (see "- recent developments" above); a $110 million gain on our sale of trayport for the three months ended december 31, 2017; and in connection with the cetip merger and its subsequent sale, $9 million in foreign tax losses and transaction expenses for the three months ended june 30, 2017 and a $176 million realized investment gain for the three months ended march 31, 2017.
(2) the decrease in the income tax expenses for the three months ended december 31, 2017 is primarily due to a $764 million deferred tax benefit associated with future u.s. income tax reductions, and the decrease for the three months ended june 30, 2017 is primarily due to the tax benefit associated with a divestiture. see "- consolidated income tax provision" above.
liquidity and capital resources below are charts that reflect our capital allocation. the acquisition and integration costs in the chart below includes cash paid for acquisitions, net of cash received for divestitures, cash paid for investments, cash paid for non-controlling interest and redeemable non-controlling interest, and the acquisition-related transaction and integration costs, net of divestitures, in each year.
we have financed our operations, growth and cash needs primarily through income from operations and borrowings under our various debt facilities. our principal capital requirements have been to fund capital expenditures, working capital, strategic acquisitions and investments, stock repurchases, dividends and the development of our technology platforms. we believe that our cash on hand and cash flows from operations will be sufficient to repay our outstanding debt, but we may also need to incur additional debt or issue additional equity securities in the future. see "- future capital requirements" below.
see "- recent developments" above for a discussion of the acquisitions and investments that we made during 2018. these acquisitions and investments were initially funded from borrowing under our commercial paper program along with cash flows from operations and subsequently refinanced with our 2018 debt issuance.
our commercial paper program enables us to borrow efficiently at reasonable short-term interest rates and provides us with the flexibility to de-lever using our strong annual cash flows from operating activities whenever our leverage becomes elevated as a result of investment or acquisition activities. we repaid a net amount of $283 million under our commercial paper program during 2018.
upon maturity of our commercial paper and to the extent old issuances are not repaid by cash on hand, we are exposed to the rollover risk of not being able to issue new commercial paper. to mitigate this risk, we maintain an undrawn back-stop bank revolving credit facility for an aggregate amount equaling at any time the amount issued under our commercial paper program. if we were not able to issue new commercial paper, we have the option of drawing on the back-stop revolving
facility. however, electing to do so would result in higher interest expense. for a discussion of our commercial paper program and other indebtedness, see "- debt" below.
consolidated cash and cash equivalents were $724 million and $535 million as of december 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. we had $1.1 billion and $1.0 billion in short-term and long-term restricted cash and cash equivalents as of december 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. we consider all short-term, highly-liquid investments with original maturity dates of three months or less to be cash equivalents. we classify all investments with original maturity dates in excess of three months but less than one year as short-term investments and all investments that we intend to hold for more than one year as long-term investments. short-term and long-term investments are included in other current and other non-current assets, respectively. cash and cash equivalents that are not available for general use, either due to regulatory requirements or through restrictions in specific agreements, are classified as restricted cash and cash equivalents and investments.
as of december 31, 2018, the amount of unrestricted cash held by our non-u.s. subsidiaries was $253 million. due to u.s. tax reform, a significant amount of 2018 current-year undistributed earnings within our non-u.s. subsidiaries (in excess of their unrestricted cash balance) have been subject to the global intangible low-taxed income provisions under the tcja. accordingly, these earnings have been subject to immediate u.s. income taxation and any non-u.s. unrestricted cash balances can be distributed to the u.s. in the future with no material additional income tax consequences.
our cash and cash equivalents and financial investments are managed as a global treasury portfolio of non-speculative financial instruments that are readily convertible into cash, such as overnight deposits, term deposits, money market funds, mutual funds for treasury investments, short duration fixed income investments and other money market instruments, thus ensuring high liquidity of financial assets. we may invest a portion of our cash in excess of short-term operating needs in investment-grade marketable debt securities, including government or government-sponsored agencies and corporate debt securities.
repurchases of our common stock may be made from time to time on the open market, through established trading plans, in privately-negotiated transactions or otherwise, in accordance with all applicable securities laws, rules and regulations. in 2018, 2017 and 2016, we repurchased 16.3 million shares, 15.0 million shares and 0.9 million shares, respectively, of our outstanding common stock at a cost of $1.2 billion, $949 million and $50 million, respectively. the shares repurchased are held in treasury stock and were completed on the open market and under rule 10b5-1 trading plans.
from time to time, we enter into rule 10b5-1 trading plans, as authorized by our board of directors, to govern some or all of the repurchases of our shares of common stock. the timing and extent of future repurchases that are not made pursuant to a rule 10b5-1 trading plan will be at our discretion and will depend upon many conditions. in making a determination regarding any stock repurchases, management considers multiple factors, including overall stock market conditions, our common stock price movements, the remaining amount authorized for repurchases by our board of directors, the potential impact of a stock repurchase program on our corporate debt ratings, our expected free cash flow and working capital needs, our current and future planned strategic growth initiatives, and other potential uses of our cash and capital resources.
in august 2016, our board of directors approved an aggregate of $1.0 billion for future repurchases of our common stock with no fixed expiration date. in september 2017, our board of directors approved an aggregate of $1.2 billion for future repurchases of our common stock with no fixed expiration date that became effective on january 1, 2018. in september 2018, our board of directors approved an aggregate of $2.0 billion for future repurchases of our common stock with no fixed expiration date that became effective january 1, 2019. we expect this authorization to provide us with capacity for buybacks over six quarters and flexibility to act opportunistically. we expect funding for any share repurchases to come from our operating cash flow or borrowings under our commercial paper program or our debt facilities.
we may discontinue stock repurchases at any time and may amend or terminate a rule 10b5-1 trading plan at any time. the approval of our board of directors for the share repurchases does not obligate us to acquire any particular amount of our common stock. in addition, our board of directors may increase or decrease the amount of capacity we have for repurchases from time to time.
cash flow the following table presents the major components of net changes in cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash and cash equivalents (in millions):
operating activities                                                                             $2,533                $2,085                $2,149
effect of exchange rate changes                                                                     (11    )               12                   (24    )
in the fourth quarter of 2017, we adopted a new accounting standard, fasb asu 2016-18, which requires that the changes in the total cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash and cash equivalents be reflected in the statement of cash flows. as a result, we no longer present transfers between cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash and cash equivalents in our statement of cash flows. we have reclassified changes in restricted cash from cash flows provided by (used in) investing activities, to the total change in beginning and end-of-year total changes. our statements of cash flows for 2018, 2017 and 2016 reflect this change.
operating activities net cash provided by operating activities primarily consists of net income adjusted for certain non-cash items, including depreciation and amortization and the effects of changes in working capital.
the $448 million increase in net cash provided by operating activities in 2018 from 2017, is primarily a result of the increase in our net income excluding our net non-cash adjustments, fluctuations in our working capital, less cash paid for income taxes in 2018 than in 2017, and a $136 million contribution that was made to our pension plan in 2017. the non-cash adjustments include our mers investment gain of $110 million during 2018, as well as our deferred tax benefit of $764 million due to tax reform, our gain on the sale of our cetip investment of $114 million and our trayport gain of $110 million during 2017. the $136 million contribution to our pension plan in 2017 allowed us to reach 99% funding of our pension obligation and allowed us to immunize the liability against future market fluctuations. for additional information on our pension plan, refer to note 16 to our consolidated financial statements.
the $64 million decrease in net cash provided by operating activities in 2017 from 2016 is primarily due to the $136 million pension plan contribution in 2017, compared to a $10 million contribution in 2016.
investing activities consolidated net cash provided by (used in) investing activities in 2018, 2017 and 2016 primarily relates to cash paid for acquisitions, cash received from divestitures, net cash received from the sale of our investment in cetip, purchases of investments, proceeds from term deposits, and changes in capital expenditures and capitalized software development costs.
we paid cash for acquisitions, net of the cash of the companies acquired, of $1.2 billion, $423 million and $425 million, in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively, primarily relating to the bondpoint, tmc bonds and mers acquisitions during 2018, the ice ngx, shorcan energy, now named calrock brokers, inc., or calrock, the ice bofaml indices and tmx atrium acquisitions during 2017, and the securities evaluations and credit market analysis acquisitions during 2016. in 2017, we received $761 million relating to the sales of trayport, idms and nyse governance services and we received net cash proceeds from the sale of our investment in cetip of $438 million. we made cash investments of $306 million, $327 million and $70 million during 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively, in euroclear, mers and occ. see "- recent developments" above for more details on our 2018 acquisitions, divestitures and investments.
we had capital expenditures of $134 million, $220 million and $250 million in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively, and we had capitalized software development expenditures of $146 million, $137 million and $115 million in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. the capital expenditures primarily relate to hardware and software purchases to continue the development and expansion of our electronic platforms, data services and clearing houses and leasehold improvements associated with the new and renovated office spaces in atlanta, new york and london. the software development expenditures primarily relate to the continued development and expansion of our electronic trading platforms, data services and clearing houses.
financing activities consolidated net cash used in financing activities in 2018 primarily relates to $1.2 billion in repurchases of common stock, $600 million in repayments of our october 2018 senior notes, $555 million in dividend payments to our stockholders, $283
million in net repayments under our commercial paper program, and $80 million in cash payments related to treasury shares received for restricted stock tax payments and stock options exercises, partially offset by $2.2 billion in net proceeds from our senior notes issued in 2018 (the 2023, 2028 and 2048 senior notes). see "- debt" below.

debt our total debt, including short-term and long-term debt, consisted of the following:
as of december 31,
the following summarizes significant developments and changes associated with our debt:
amended credit facility we have a $3.4 billion senior unsecured revolving credit facility, pursuant to a credit agreement with wells fargo bank, n.a., as primary administrative agent, issuing lender and swing-line lender, bank of america, n.a., as syndication agent, backup administrative agent and swing-line lender, and the lenders party thereto. on august 9, 2018, we extended the final maturity date of the credit facility from august 18, 2022 to august 9, 2023, and made certain other changes, herein referred to as the amended credit facility.
the amended credit facility includes an option for us to propose an increase in the aggregate amount available for borrowing by up to $975 million, subject to the consent of the lenders funding the increase and certain other conditions. no amounts were outstanding under the amended credit facility as of december 31, 2018. as of december 31, 2018, of the $3.4 billion that is currently available, $951 million is required to back-stop the amount outstanding under our commercial paper program, and $105 million is required to support certain broker-dealer subsidiary commitments. the amount required to backstop the amounts outstanding under the commercial paper program will fluctuate as we increase or decrease our commercial paper borrowings. the remaining $2.3 billion is available for working capital and general corporate purposes including, but not limited to, acting as a back-stop to future increases in the amounts outstanding under the commercial paper program.
commercial paper program we have a u.s. dollar commercial paper program, or the commercial paper program. it is currently backed by the borrowing capacity available under the amended credit facility, as described above. the effective interest rate of commercial paper issuances does not materially differ from short-term interest rates (such as usd libor), which fluctuate due to market conditions and as a result may impact our interest expense.
we repaid a net amount of $283 million of outstanding commercial paper during 2018 using cash flows from operations and cash proceeds received from our 2018 bond issuance. we repaid $409 million of net notes outstanding under the program during 2017 primarily using cash proceeds received from the sales of cetip and trayport. these reductions were partially offset by notes we issued under the program during 2017, the proceeds of which were used to fund acquisitions and investments and repurchase our common stock. we used net proceeds from notes issued under the program during 2016 for the acquisitions of securities evaluations and credit market analysis and for general corporate purposes. we repaid a portion of the amounts outstanding under the program during 2018, 2017 and 2016 with cash flows from operations.
commercial paper notes of $951 million with original maturities ranging from two to 77 days were outstanding as of december 31, 2018 with a weighted average interest rate of 2.48% per annum, and a weighted average maturity of 12 days. commercial paper notes of $1.2 billion with original maturities ranging from two to 64 days were outstanding as of december 31, 2017 with a weighted average interest rate of 1.49% per annum, and a weighted average maturity of 18 days.
â€¢   newly-issued senior notes: in august 2018, we issued $2.25 billion in new aggregate unsecured fixed-rate senior notes, including $400 million, 3.45% notes due in 2023, or the 2023 senior notes, $600 million, 3.75% notes due in 2028, or the 2028 senior notes, and $1.25 billion, 4.25% notes due in 2048, or the 2048 senior notes, and together with the 2023 senior notes and the 2028 senior notes, the newly-issued senior notes. we used the proceeds from the offering for general corporate purposes, including to fund the redemption of the $600 million, 2.50% senior notes due october 2018 and to refinance all of our issuances under our commercial paper program that resulted from acquisitions and investments in the last year. see "- recent developments" above.
â€¢   2022 and 2027 senior notes: in august 2017, we issued $1.0 billion in aggregate unsecured fixed-rate senior notes, including $500 million, 2.35% notes due september 2022, or the 2022 senior notes, and $500 million, 3.10% notes due september 2027, or the 2027 senior notes. we used the majority of the proceeds from the offering to fund the redemption in september 2017 of $850 million, 2.00% senior unsecured fixed-rate nyse notes prior to the october 2017 maturity date.
â€¢   2020 and 2025 senior notes: in november 2015, we issued $2.5 billion in aggregate senior unsecured fixed rate notes, including $1.25 billion, 2.75% notes due november 2020, or the 2020 senior notes, and $1.25 billion, 3.75% notes due november 2025, or the 2025 senior notes. we used the proceeds from the offering, together with $1.6 billion of borrowings under our commercial paper program, to finance the cash portion of the purchase price of interactive data.
â€¢   october 2023 senior notes: in october 2013, we issued $800 million, 4.00% senior unsecured fixed-rate notes due october 2023, or the october 2023 senior notes. we used the net proceeds from the october 2023 senior notes to finance a portion of the purchase price of the acquisition of nyse.
committed repo and committed fx facilities to provide a tool to address the liquidity needs of our clearing houses and manage the liquidation of margin and guaranty fund deposits held in the form of cash and high quality sovereign debt, ice clear europe, ice clear credit and ice clear u.s. have entered into committed repurchase agreement facilities, or committed repo. additionally, ice clear credit has entered into committed fx facilities to support these liquidity needs. as of december 31, 2018 the following facilities were in place:
future capital requirements our future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including the rate of growth across our trading and clearing and data and listings segments, strategic plans and acquisitions, available sources for financing activities, required and discretionary technology and clearing initiatives, regulatory requirements, the timing and introduction of new products and enhancements to existing products, the geographic mix of our business and potential stock repurchases.
we currently expect to incur capital expenditures (including operational and real estate capital expenditures) and to incur software development costs that are eligible for capitalization ranging in the aggregate between $290 million and $320 million in 2019, which we believe will support the enhancement of our technology, business integration and the continued growth of our businesses.
in september 2018, our board of directors approved an aggregate of $2.0 billion for future repurchases of our common stock with no fixed expiration date that became effective on january 1, 2019. we expect this authorization to provide us with capacity for buybacks over six quarters and flexibility to act opportunistically. refer to note 12 to our consolidated financial statements, included in this annual report, for additional details on our stock repurchase plans.
our board of directors has adopted a quarterly dividend policy providing that dividends will be approved quarterly by the board or its audit committee taking into account factors such as our evolving business model, prevailing business conditions and our financial results and capital requirements, without a predetermined net income payout ratio. during 2018, we paid cash dividends of $0.96 per share of our common stock in the aggregate, including quarterly dividends of $0.24 per share, for an aggregate payout of $555 million, which includes the payment of dividend equivalents on unvested employee restricted stock units. refer to note 12 to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report, for details on the amounts of our quarterly dividend payouts for the last three years. for the first quarter of 2019, we announced a $0.275 per share dividend payable on march 29, 2019 to stockholders of record as of march 15, 2019.
as of december 31, 2018, we had $7.4 billion in outstanding debt. we currently also have a $3.4 billion amended credit facility, of which $2.3 billion is available for general corporate purposes as previously described. other than the facilities discussed above for the ice clearing houses, the amended credit facility and our commercial paper program are currently the only significant agreements or arrangements that we have for liquidity and capital resources with third parties. in the event of any strategic acquisitions, mergers or investments, or if we are required to raise capital for any reason or desire to return capital to our stockholders, we may incur additional debt, issue additional equity to raise necessary funds, repurchase additional shares of our common stock or pay a dividend. however, we cannot provide assurance that such financing or transactions will be available or successful, or that the terms of such financing or transactions will be favorable to us. see "-risk factors" and "- debt" above.
non-gaap measures we use certain financial measures internally to evaluate our performance and make financial and operational decisions that are presented in a manner that adjusts from their equivalent gaap measures or that supplement the information provided by our gaap measures. we use these adjusted results because we believe they more clearly highlight trends in our business that may not otherwise be apparent when relying solely on gaap financial measures, since these measures eliminate from our results specific financial items that have less bearing on our core operating performance.
we use these measures in communicating certain aspects of our results and performance, including in this annual report, and believe that these measures, when viewed in conjunction with our gaap results and the accompanying reconciliation, can provide investors with greater transparency and a greater understanding of factors affecting our financial condition and results of operations than gaap measures alone. in addition, we believe the presentation of these measures is useful to investors for making period-to-period comparisons of results because the adjustments to gaap are not reflective of our core business performance.
these financial measures are not presented in accordance with, or as an alternative to, gaap financial measures and may be different from non-gaap measures used by other companies. we encourage investors to review the gaap financial measures included in this annual report, including our consolidated financial statements, to aid in their analysis and understanding of our performance and in making comparisons.
the table below outlines our adjusted operating expenses, adjusted operating income, adjusted operating margin, adjusted net income attributable to ice common stockholders and adjusted earnings per share, which are non-gaap measures that are calculated by making adjustments for items we view as not reflective of our cash operations and core business
performance. these measures, including the adjustments and their related income tax effect and other tax adjustments (in millions, except for percentages and per share amounts), are as follows:

acquisition-related transaction costs are included as part of our core business expenses, except for those that are directly related to the announcement, closing, financing or termination of a transaction. however, we adjust for the acquisition-related transaction and integration costs relating to interactive data and nyse given the sizes of these acquisitions. the integration of nyse was completed by june 2016 and the integration of interactive data was completed by june 2018. amortization of acquisition-related intangibles are included in non-gaap adjustments as excluding these non-cash expenses provides greater clarity regarding our financial strength and stability of cash operating results.
in addition, we also include the following items as non-gaap adjustments, as each of these are not considered a part of our core business operations:
â€¢   2018: the gain recognized on our initial majority investment in mers in connection with our acquisition of 100% of the remaining mers interests;
â€¢   2018: the impairment loss on exchange registration intangible assets and employee severance costs related to the closure of ice futures canada and ice clear canada;
â€¢   2017: the net gain on the divestiture of trayport, and in 2018, a subsequent adjustment to reduce of the gain on the divestiture;
â€¢   2017: the realized investment gain and the foreign exchange loss and transaction expenses on the sale of our investment in cetip;
â€¢   2017: the nyse governance services net impairment loss on its divestiture; and
â€¢   2016: the creditex u.k. voice brokerage severance costs related to its discontinuance and the creditex customer relationship intangible asset impairment loss.
the tax items in non-gaap adjustments are either the tax impacts of the pre-tax non-gaap adjustments or tax items as described below that are not in the normal course of business and are not indicative of our core business performance. the following tax-related items are included as non-gaap adjustments:
â€¢   the income tax effects relating to all non-gaap adjustments;
â€¢   deferred tax adjustments on acquisition-related intangibles; including the impact of u.s. state tax law changes and apportionment updates, as well as foreign tax law changes which resulted in deferred tax (benefit) expense of ($5 million), $10 million and ($22 million) in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. in addition, deferred tax adjustments on acquisition-related intangibles include $34 million of deferred tax benefits due to u.k. corporate income tax rate reductions in 2016;
â€¢   deferred tax benefits of $11 million and $764 million in 2018 and 2017, respectively, resulting from changes in estimates as a result of the enactment of the tcja which reduced the corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%;
â€¢   2018: other tax adjustments including a $17 million tax benefit on the sale of trayport offset by an audit settlement for a pre-acquisition period in connection with our acquisition of nyse in 2013; and
â€¢   2016: other tax adjustments including a $15 million valuation allowance on singapore pre-acquisition net operating losses and other deferred tax assets and an $8 million deferred tax adjustment with respect to our occ equity method investment.

off-balance sheet arrangements we do not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities.
contractual obligations and commercial commitments the following presents our contractual obligations (which we intend to fund from existing cash as well as cash flow from operations) and commercial commitments as of december 31, 2018 (in millions):
operating lease obligations                        417                  64                   121                    99         133
purchase obligations include our estimate of the minimum outstanding obligations under agreements to purchase goods or services that we believe are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed, minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. purchase obligations exclude agreements that are cancellable at any time without penalty.
we have excluded from the contractual obligations and commercial commitments listed above $64.0 billion in cash margin deposits, guaranty funds and delivery contracts payable. clearing members of our clearing houses are required to deposit original margin and variation margin and to make deposits to a guaranty fund. the cash deposits made to these margin accounts and to the guaranty fund are recorded in the consolidated balance sheet as current assets with corresponding current liabilities to the clearing members that deposited them. ice ngx administers the physical delivery of energy trading contracts. it has an equal and offsetting claim to and from its respective participants on opposite sides of the physically-settled contract, each of which is reflected as a delivery contract receivable with an offsetting delivery contract payable. see note 14 to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report for additional information on our clearing houses and the margin deposits, guaranty funds and delivery contracts payable.
we have also excluded unrecognized tax benefits, or utbs. as of december 31, 2018, our cumulative utbs were $98 million. interest and penalties related to utbs were $28 million as of december 31, 2018. we are under examination by various tax authorities. we are unable to make a reasonable estimate of the periods of cash settlement because it is not possible to reasonably predict the amount of tax, interest and penalties, if any, that might be assessed by a tax authority or the timing of an assessment or payment. it is also not possible to reasonably predict whether or not the applicable statutes of limitations might expire without us being examined by any particular tax authority. see note 13 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information on our utbs.
as of december 31, 2018, in connection with our acquisition of nyse, we have obligations related to our pension and other benefit programs. the date of payment under these obligations cannot be determined and have been excluded from the table above. see note 16 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information on our pension and other benefit programs.
we have a 40% ownership in occ. under the occ's capital plan, the occ stockholders have committed to contribute up to $200 million in equity capital if certain capital thresholds are breached, including up to $80 million to be contributed by nyse, which has also been excluded from the table above.
in 2016, the sec approved a plan to establish a market-wide consolidated audit trail, or cat, to improve regulators' ability to monitor trading activity. in 2018, the first phase of implementation went live and required participants to begin reporting to the cat, with a phased implementation of the provisions of the cat through 2019. funding of the implementation and operation of the cat is ultimately expected to be provided by both the execution venues and industry members. to date, however, funding has been provided solely by the execution venues in exchange for promissory notes expected to be repaid if industry member fees are approved by the sec and are collected to fund the cat.
new and recently adopted accounting pronouncements refer to note 2 to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report for information on the new and recently adopted accounting pronouncements that are applicable to us.
critical accounting policies we have identified the policies below as critical to our business operations and the understanding of our results of operations. the impact of, and any associated risks related to, these policies on our business operations is discussed throughout "-
management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations." for a detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies, see note 2 to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report.
our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with u.s. gaap. the preparation of financial statements in conformity with these accounting principles requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities, and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities, at the date of our financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
we base our estimates and judgments on our historical experience and other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances when we make these estimates and judgments and re-evaluate them on a periodic basis. based on these factors, we make estimates and judgments about, among other things, the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from market prices or other independent sources and about the recognition and characterization of our revenues and expenses. the values and results based on these estimates and judgments could differ significantly under different assumptions or conditions and could change materially in the future.
we believe that the following critical accounting policies, among others, affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements and could materially increase or decrease our reported results, assets and liabilities.
goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets assets acquired and liabilities assumed in connection with our acquisitions are recorded at their estimated fair values. goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price of an acquired company over the fair value of its identifiable net assets, including identified intangible assets. we recognize specifically identifiable intangibles, such as customer relationships, trademarks, technology, trading products, data, exchange registrations, trade names and licenses when a specific right or contract is acquired. our determination of the fair value of the intangible assets and whether or not these assets may be impaired following their acquisition requires us to apply significant judgments and make significant estimates and assumptions regarding future cash flows. if we change our strategy or if market conditions shift, our judgments and estimates may change, which may result in adjustments to recorded asset balances. intangible assets with finite useful lives are amortized over their estimated useful lives whereas goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are not.
in performing the allocation of the acquisitions' purchase price to assets and liabilities, we consider, among other factors, the intended use of the acquired assets, analysis of past financial performance and estimates of future performance of the acquired business. at the acquisition date, a preliminary allocation of the purchase price is recorded based upon a preliminary valuation performed with the assistance of a third-party valuation specialist. we continue to review and assess our estimates, assumptions and valuation methodologies during the measurement period provided by gaap, which ends as soon as we receive the information about facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date or we learn that more information is not obtainable, which usually does not exceed one year from the date of acquisition. accordingly, these estimates and assumptions are subject to change, which could have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.
we allocate goodwill to reporting units based on the reporting unit expected to benefit from the business combination. we have identified four reporting units: our futures reporting unit, our data and listings reporting unit, our cash equities reporting unit, and our fixed income and cds reporting unit.
our goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets are evaluated for impairment annually in our fiscal fourth quarter or more frequently if conditions exist that indicate that the value may be impaired. we test our goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level. these impairment evaluations are performed by comparing the carrying value of the goodwill or other indefinite-lived intangibles to its estimated fair value.
goodwill impairment testing consists of a two-step methodology. the initial step requires us to determine the fair value of each reporting unit and compare it to the carrying value, including goodwill and other intangible assets, of such reporting unit. if the fair value exceeds the carrying value, no impairment loss is recognized and the second step, which is a calculation of the impairment, is not performed. however, if the carrying value exceeds its fair value, an impairment charge is recorded equal to the extent that the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value. for annual goodwill impairment testing, we have the option to first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, including goodwill and other intangible assets. if we conclude that this is the case, we must perform the two-step methodology described above. otherwise, we can skip the two-step methodology and do not need to perform any further testing. for annual indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment testing, we also have
the option to first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible assets is less than its carrying amount.
application of the impairment test requires judgment, including the identification of reporting units, assignment of assets and liabilities to reporting units, assignment of goodwill to reporting units, and determination of the fair value of each reporting unit. we have historically determined the fair value of our reporting units based on various valuation techniques, including discounted cash flow analysis and a multiple of earnings approach. in assessing whether goodwill and other intangible assets are impaired, we must make estimates and assumptions regarding future cash flows, long-term growth rates of our business, operating margins, discount rates, weighted average cost of capital and other factors to determine the fair value of our assets. these estimates and assumptions require management's judgment, and changes to these estimates and assumptions, as a result of changing economic and competitive conditions, could materially affect the determination of fair value and/or impairment.
the cash flows employed in the discounted cash flow analysis are based on our most recent budgets and business plans and, when applicable, various growth rates have been assumed for years beyond the current business plan period. future events could cause us to conclude that indicators of impairment exist for goodwill or other intangible assets. impairment may result from, among other things, deterioration in the performance of our business, adverse market conditions, adverse changes in applicable laws and regulations, competition, or the sale or disposition of a reporting unit. any resulting impairment loss could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations.
we are also required to evaluate other finite-lived intangible assets and property and equipment for impairment by first determining whether events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of these assets to be held and used may not be recoverable. if impairment indicators are present, then an estimate of undiscounted future cash flows produced by these long-lived assets is compared to the carrying value of those assets to determine if the asset is recoverable. if an asset is not recoverable, the loss is measured as the difference between fair value and carrying value of the impaired asset. fair value of these assets is based on various valuation techniques, including discounted cash flow analysis.
income taxes we are subject to income taxes in the u.s., u.k. and other foreign jurisdictions where we operate. the determination of our provision for income taxes and related accruals, deferred tax assets and liabilities requires the use of significant judgment, estimates, and the interpretation and application of complex tax laws. we recognize a current tax liability or tax asset for the estimated taxes payable or refundable on tax returns for the current year. we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax bases of our assets and liabilities. we establish valuation allowances if we believe that it is more likely than not that some or all of our deferred tax assets will not be realized. deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using current enacted tax rates in effect for the years in which those temporary differences and carryforwards are expected to reverse.
sec staff accounting bulletin no. 118, or sab 118, provided guidance for companies that had not completed their accounting for the income tax effects of the tcja in the period of enactment, allowing for a measurement period of up to one year after the enactment date to finalize the recording of the related tax impacts. as of december 31, 2018, we have completed our accounting for the tax effects of the enactment of the tcja. we reaffirmed our position that we were not subject to transition tax under the tcja as of december 31, 2017. in addition, we concluded that the $764 million of deferred tax benefit recorded in the 2017 financial statements was a reasonable estimate of the tcja's impact on our deferred tax and no further adjustments are necessary.
the fasb staff also provided additional guidance to address the accounting for the effects of the provisions related to the taxation of global intangible low-taxed income noting that companies should make an accounting policy election to recognize deferred taxes for temporary basis differences expected to reverse in future years or to include the tax expense in the year it is incurred. we have completed our analysis of the effects of these provisions and have made a policy election to recognize such taxes as current period expenses when incurred.
we do not recognize a tax benefit unless we conclude that it is more likely than not that the benefit will be sustained on audit by the taxing authority based solely on the technical merits of the associated tax position. if the recognition threshold is met, we recognize a tax benefit measured at the largest amount of the tax benefit that, in our judgment, is greater than 50 percent likely to be realized. we recognize accrued interest and penalties related to uncertain income tax positions as income tax expense in the consolidated statements of income.
we operate within multiple domestic and foreign taxing jurisdictions and are subject to audit in these jurisdictions by domestic and foreign tax authorities. these audits include questions regarding our tax filing positions, including the timing and amount of deductions taken and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions. we record accruals for the estimated
outcomes of these audits, and the accruals may change in the future due to new developments in each matter. at any point in time, many tax years are subject to or in the process of being audited by various taxing authorities. to the extent our estimates of settlements change or the final tax outcome of these matters is different from the amounts recorded, such differences will impact the income tax provision in the period in which such determinations are made. our income tax expense includes changes in our estimated liability for exposures associated with our various tax filing positions. determining the income tax expense for these potential assessments requires management to make assumptions that are subject to factors such as proposed assessments by tax authorities, changes in facts and circumstances, issuance of new regulations, and resolution of tax audits.
item 7 (a).     quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk as a result of our operating and financing activities, we are exposed to market risks such as interest rate risk, foreign currency exchange rate risk and credit risk. we have implemented policies and procedures designed to measure, manage, monitor and report risk exposures, which are regularly reviewed by the appropriate management and supervisory bodies.
interest rate risk we have exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relating to our cash and cash equivalents, short-term and long-term restricted cash, short-term and long-term investments and indebtedness. as of december 31, 2018 and 2017, our cash and cash equivalents, short-term and long-term restricted cash and cash equivalents, and short-term and long-term investments were $2.0 billion and $1.6 billion, respectively, of which $275 million and $293 million, respectively, were denominated in pounds sterling, euros or canadian dollars. the remaining cash and cash equivalents, and short-term and long-term restricted cash and cash equivalents are denominated in u.s. dollars. we do not use our investment portfolio for trading or other speculative purposes. a hypothetical decrease in long-term interest rates to zero basis points would decrease annual pre-tax earnings by $25 million as of december 31, 2018, assuming no change in the amount or composition of our cash and cash equivalents and short-term and long-term restricted cash and cash equivalents.
as of december 31, 2018, we had $7.4 billion in outstanding debt, of which $6.5 billion relates to our senior notes, which bear interest at fixed interest rates. the remaining amount outstanding of $951 million relates to the commercial paper program, which bears interest at fluctuating rates and, therefore, subjects us to interest rate risk. a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in long-term interest rates relating to the amounts outstanding under the commercial paper program as of december 31, 2018 would decrease annual pre-tax earnings by $10 million, assuming no change in the volume or composition of our outstanding indebtedness and no hedging activity. see item 7 "- management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations - debt" included in this annual report.
the interest rates on our commercial paper program are currently evaluated based upon current maturities and market conditions. the weighted average interest rate on our commercial paper program increased from 1.49% as of december 31, 2017 to 2.48% as of december 31, 2018. the increase in the commercial paper program weighted average interest rate was primarily due to the decisions by the u.s. federal reserve in march 2018, june 2018, september 2018, and in december 2018 to increase the federal funds short-term interest rate by an aggregate 100 basis points to 2.50%. the effective interest rate of commercial paper issuance will continue to fluctuate based on the movement in short-term interest rates along with shifts in supply and demand within the commercial paper market.
foreign currency exchange rate risk as an international business, we are subject to foreign currency exchange rate risk. we may experience gains or losses from foreign currency transactions in the future given that a significant part of our assets and liabilities are recorded in pounds sterling, canadian dollars or euros, and a significant portion of our revenues and expenses are recorded in pounds sterling or euros. certain assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses of foreign subsidiaries are denominated in the local functional currency of such subsidiaries. our exposure to foreign denominated earnings in 2018 and 2017 is presented by primary foreign currency in the following table (dollars in millions, except exchange rates):

(1)   represents the impact of currency fluctuation for the year compared to the same period in the prior year.
we have a significant part of our assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses recorded in pounds sterling or euros. in 2018, 2017 and 2016, 14%, 15% and 15%, respectively, of our consolidated revenues, less transaction-based expenses, were denominated in pounds sterling or euros, and 13%, 14%, and 18%, respectively, of our consolidated operating expenses were denominated in pounds sterling or euros. as the pound sterling or euro exchange rate changes, the u.s. equivalent of revenues and expenses denominated in foreign currencies changes accordingly.
foreign currency transaction risk related to the settlement of foreign currency denominated assets, liabilities and payables occur through our operations, which are received in or paid in pounds sterling, canadian dollars, or euros, due to the increase or decrease in the foreign currency exchange rates between periods. we incurred foreign currency transaction losses of $2 million, $4 million and $1 million in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. the foreign currency transactions losses were primarily attributable to the fluctuations of the pound sterling and euro relative to the u.s. dollar. a 10% adverse change in the underlying foreign currency exchange rates as of december 31, 2018, assuming no change in the composition of the foreign currency denominated assets, liabilities and payables and assuming no hedging activity, would result in no additional foreign currency gain or loss.
we entered into foreign currency hedging transactions during 2018, 2017 and 2016 as economic hedges to help mitigate a portion of our foreign exchange risk exposure and may enter into additional hedging transactions in the future to help mitigate our foreign exchange risk exposure. although we may enter into additional hedging transactions in the future to help mitigate our foreign exchange risk exposure, these hedging arrangements may not be effective, particularly in the event of imprecise forecasts of the levels of our non-u.s. denominated assets and liabilities.
we have foreign currency translation risk equal to our net investment in our foreign subsidiaries. the financial statements of these subsidiaries are translated into u.s. dollars using a current rate of exchange, with gains or losses included in the cumulative translation adjustment account, a component of equity. our exposure to the net investment in foreign currencies is presented by primary foreign currencies in the table below (in millions):
as of december 31, 2018
of which goodwill represents                                                                  638                                 413                                                      92
negative impact on consolidated equity of a 10% decrease in foreign currency exchange rates   $95                                      $30                                      $11
as of december 31, 2018 and 2017, the portion of our equity attributable to accumulated other comprehensive loss from foreign currency translation was $227 million and $136 million, respectively. in 2018, 2017 and 2016, currency exchange rate differences had a positive/(negative) impact of ($91 million), $209 million and ($300 million), respectively, on our
consolidated equity. the decrease in 2018 is primarily due to the decrease in the pound sterling/u.s. dollar exchange rate to 1.2756 as of december 31, 2018 (from 1.3510 as of december 31, 2017) due to the weakening of the pound sterling as compared to the u.s. dollar. the increase in 2017 is primarily due to the increase in the pound sterling/u.s. dollar exchange rate to 1.3510 as of december 31, 2017 (from 1.2336 as of december 31, 2016) due to the strengthening pound sterling as compared to the u.s. dollar. the future impact on our business relating to the u.k. leaving the eu and the corresponding regulatory changes are uncertain at this time, including future impacts on currency exchange rates.
credit risk we are exposed to credit risk in our operations in the event of a counterparty default. we limit our exposure to credit risk by rigorously selecting the counterparties with which we make our investments, monitoring them on an ongoing basis and executing agreements to protect our interests.
clearing house cash deposit risks the ice clearing houses hold material amounts of clearing member cash and cash equivalent deposits which are held or invested primarily to provide security of capital while minimizing credit, market and liquidity risks. refer to note 14 to our consolidated financial statements for more information on the ice clearing houses' cash and cash equivalent deposits, which were $64.0 billion as of december 31, 2018. while we seek to achieve a reasonable rate of return which may generate interest income for our clearing members, we are primarily concerned with preservation of capital and managing the risks associated with these deposits. as the ice clearing houses may pass on interest revenues (minus costs) to the clearing members, this could include negative or reduced yield due to market conditions. the following is a summary of the risks associated with these deposits and how these risks are mitigated.
â€¢   credit risk: when a clearing house has the ability to hold cash collateral at a central bank, the clearing house utilizes its access to the central bank system to minimize credit risk exposures. credit risk is monitored by using exposure limits depending on ratings assigned by rating agencies as well as the nature and maturity of transactions. our investment objective is to invest in securities that preserve principal while maximizing yields, without significantly increasing risk. we seek to substantially mitigate credit risk associated with investments by placing them with governments, well-capitalized financial institutions and other creditworthy counterparties.
an ongoing review is performed to evaluate changes in the financial status of counterparties. in addition to the intrinsic creditworthiness of counterparties, our policies require diversification of counterparties (banks, financial institutions, bond issuers and funds) so as to avoid a concentration of risk.
â€¢   liquidity risk: liquidity risk is the risk a clearing house may not be able to meet its payment obligations in the right currency, in the right place and the right time. to mitigate this risk, the clearing houses monitor liquidity requirements closely and maintain funds and assets in a manner which minimizes the risk of loss or delay in the access by the clearing house to such funds and assets. for example, holding funds with a central bank where possible or making only short term investments such as overnight reverse repurchase agreements serves to reduce liquidity risks.
â€¢   interest rate risk: interest rate risk is the risk that interest rates rise and cause the value of securities we hold or invest in to decline. if we were required to sell securities prior to maturity, and interest rates had risen, the sale might be made at a loss relative to the carrying value. our clearing houses seek to manage this risk by making short term investments. for example, where possible and in accordance with regulatory requirements, the clearing houses invest cash pursuant to overnight reverse repurchase agreements or term reverse repurchase agreements with short dated maturities. in addition, the clearing house investment guidelines allow for direct purchases of high quality sovereign debt (for example, u.s. treasury securities) and supranational debt instruments (euro cash deposits only) with short dated maturities.
â€¢   security issuer risk: security issuer risk is the risk that an issuer of a security defaults on the payment when the security matures or debt is serviced. this risk is mitigated by limiting allowable investments under the reverse repurchase agreements to high quality sovereign or government agency debt and limiting any direct investments to high quality sovereign debt instruments.
â€¢   investment counterparty risk: investment counterparty risk is the risk that a reverse repurchase agreement counterparty might become insolvent and, thus, fail to meet its obligations to our clearing houses. we mitigate this risk by only engaging in transactions with high credit quality counterparties and by limiting the acceptable collateral to securities of high quality issuers. when engaging in reverse repurchase agreements, our clearing houses take delivery of the securities underlying the reverse repurchase arrangement in custody accounts under clearing house
control. additionally, the securities purchased subject to reverse repurchase have a market value greater than the reverse repurchase amount. the typical haircut for high quality sovereign debt is 2% of the reverse repurchase amount which provides additional excess collateral. thus, in the event that a reverse repurchase counterparty defaults on its obligation to repurchase the underlying reverse repurchase securities, our clearing house will have possession of a security with a value potentially greater than the counterparty's obligation.
the ice clearing houses may use third-party investment advisors who make investments subject to the guidelines provided by each clearing house. such advisors do not hold clearing member cash or cash equivalent deposits or the underlying investments. clearing house property is held in custody accounts under clearing house control with credit worthy custodians including jpmorgan chase bank n.a., citibank n.a., bny mellon, bmo harris n.a. and euroclear bank brussels (for non-u.s. dollar deposits). the ice clearing houses employ (or may employ) multiple investment advisors and custodians to ensure that in the event a single advisor or custodian is unable to fulfill its role, additional advisors or custodians are available as alternatives.
â€¢   cross-currency margin deposit risk: each of the ice clearing houses may permit posting of cross-currency collateral to satisfy margin requirements (for example, accepting margin deposits denominated in u.s. dollars to secure a euro margin obligation). the ice clearing houses mitigate the risk of a currency value exposure by applying a "haircut" to the currency posted as margin at a level viewed as sufficient to provide financial protection during periods of currency volatility. cross-currency balances are marked-to-market on a daily basis. should the currency posted to satisfy margin requirements decline in value, the clearing member is required to increase its margin deposit on a same-day basis.
impact of inflation we have not been adversely affected by inflation as technological advances and competition have generally caused prices for the hardware and software that we use for our electronic platforms to remain constant. in the event of inflation, we believe that we will be able to pass on any price increases to our participants, as the prices that we charge are not governed by long-term contracts.

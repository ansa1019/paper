item 1a.   risk factors our operations and financial results are subject to various risks and uncertainties including those described below. the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face. additional risks and uncertainties that we are unaware of, or that we currently believe are not material, also may become important factors that affect us. if any of the following risks or others not specified below materialize, our business, financial condition, and operating results could be materially adversely affected and the market price of our common stock could decline.
risks related to our business and our industry our business and operations have experienced rapid growth in recent periods, and if we do not effectively manage any future growth or are unable to improve our systems, processes, and controls, our operating results could be adversely affected.
we have experienced rapid growth and increased demand for our products and subscriptions over the last few years. as a result, our employee headcount and number of end-customers have increased significantly, and we expect both to continue to grow over the next year. for example, from the end of fiscal 2017 to the end of fiscal 2018, our headcount increased from 4,562 to 5,348 employees, and our number of end-customers increased from more than 42,500 to more than 54,000. in addition, as we have grown, we have increasingly managed more complex deployments of our products and subscriptions with larger end-customers. the growth and expansion of our business and product, subscription, and support offerings places a significant strain on our management, operational, and financial resources. to manage any future growth effectively, we must continue to improve and expand our information technology and financial infrastructure, our operating and administrative systems and controls, and our ability to manage headcount, capital, and processes in an efficient manner.
we may not be able to successfully implement or scale improvements to our systems, processes, and controls in an efficient or timely manner. in addition, our existing systems, processes, and controls may not prevent or detect all errors, omissions, or fraud. we may also experience difficulties in managing improvements to our systems, processes, and controls or in connection with third-party software licensed to help us with such improvements. any future growth would add complexity to our organization and require effective coordination throughout our organization. failure to manage any future growth effectively could result in increased costs, disrupt our existing end-customer relationships, reduce demand for or limit us to smaller deployments of our platform, or harm our business performance and operating results.
our operating results may vary significantly from period to period and be unpredictable, which could cause the market price of our common stock to decline.
our operating results, in particular, our revenues, gross margins, operating margins, and operating expenses, have historically varied from period to period, and even though we have experienced growth, we expect variation to continue as a result of a number of factors, many of which are outside of our control and may be difficult to predict, including:
•   our ability to attract and retain new end-customers or sell additional products and subscriptions to our existing end-customers;
•   the budgeting cycles, seasonal buying patterns, and purchasing practices of our end-customers;
•   changes in end-customer, distributor or reseller requirements, or market needs;
•   the timing and success of new product and service introductions by us or our competitors or any other change in the competitive landscape of our industry, including consolidation among our competitors or end-customers and strategic partnerships entered into by and between our competitors;
•   changes in the mix of our products, subscriptions, and support, including changes in multi-year subscriptions and support;
•   our ability to successfully and continuously expand our business domestically and internationally;
•   changes in the growth rate of the enterprise security market;
•   deferral of orders from end-customers in anticipation of new products or product enhancements announced by us or our competitors;
•   the timing and costs related to the development or acquisition of technologies or businesses or strategic partnerships;
•   lack of synergy or the inability to realize expected synergies, resulting from acquisitions or strategic partnerships;
•   our inability to execute, complete or integrate efficiently any acquisitions that we may undertake;
•   increased expenses, unforeseen liabilities, or write-downs and any impact on our operating results from any acquisitions we consummate;
•   our ability to increase the size and productivity of our distribution channel;
•   decisions by potential end-customers to purchase security solutions from larger, more established security vendors or from their primary network equipment vendors;
•   changes in end-customer penetration or attach and renewal rates for our subscriptions;
•   timing of revenue recognition and revenue deferrals;
•   our ability to manage production and manufacturing related costs, global customer service organization costs, inventory excess and obsolescence costs, and warranty costs;
•   insolvency or credit difficulties confronting our end-customers, which could adversely affect their ability to purchase or pay for our products and subscription and support offerings, or confronting our key suppliers, including our sole source suppliers, which could disrupt our supply chain;
•   any disruption in our channel or termination of our relationships with important channel partners, including as a result of consolidation among distributors and resellers of security solutions;
•   our inability to fulfill our end-customers' orders due to supply chain delays or events that impact our manufacturers or their suppliers;
•   the cost and potential outcomes of litigation, which could have a material adverse effect on our business;
•   seasonality or cyclical fluctuations in our markets;
•   future accounting pronouncements or changes in our accounting policies, including the potential impact of the adoption and implementation of the financial accounting standards board's new standard regarding revenue recognition;
•   increases or decreases in our expenses caused by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, as an increasing amount of our expenses is incurred and paid in currencies other than the u.s. dollar;
•   political, economic and social instability caused by the referendum in june 2016, in which voters in the united kingdom (the "u.k.") approved an exit from the european union (the "e.u.") and the u.k. government subsequently notified the e.u. of its withdrawal, which is commonly referred to as "brexit," continued hostilities in the middle east, terrorist activities, and any disruption these events may cause to the broader global industrial economy; and
•   general macroeconomic conditions, both domestically and in our foreign markets that could impact some or all regions where we operate.
any one of the factors above, or the cumulative effect of some of the factors referred to above, may result in significant fluctuations in our financial and other operating results. this variability and unpredictability could result in our failure to meet our revenue, margin, or other operating result expectations or those of securities analysts or investors for a particular period. if we fail to meet or exceed such expectations for these or any other reasons, the market price of our common stock could fall substantially, and we could face costly lawsuits, including securities class action suits.
uncertain or weakened global economic conditions could have an adverse effect on our business and operating results.
we operate globally and as a result our business and revenues are impacted by global macroeconomic conditions. the global macroeconomic environment has been and may continue to be inconsistent and challenging due to instability in the global credit markets, the current economic challenges in china, falling demand for oil and other commodities, uncertainties regarding the effects of "brexit," uncertainties related to changes in public policies such as domestic and international regulations, taxes, or international trade agreements, geopolitical turmoil and other disruptions to global and regional economies and markets. as a result, any continued or further uncertainty, weakness or deterioration in global macroeconomic and market conditions may cause our end-customers to modify spending priorities or delay purchasing decisions, and result in lengthened sales cycles, any of which could harm our business and operating results.
our revenue growth rate in recent periods may not be indicative of our future performance.
we have experienced revenue growth rates of 29.0% and 27.8% in fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2017, respectively. our revenue for any prior quarterly or annual period should not be relied upon as an indication of our future revenue or revenue growth for any future period. if we are unable to maintain consistent or increasing revenue or revenue growth, the market price of our common stock could be volatile, and it may be difficult for us to achieve and maintain profitability or maintain or increase cash flow on a consistent basis.
we have a history of losses, anticipate increasing our operating expenses in the future, and may not be able to achieve or maintain profitability or maintain or increase cash flow on a consistent basis, which could cause our business, financial condition, and operating results to suffer.
other than fiscal 2012, we have incurred losses in all fiscal years since our inception. as a result, we had an accumulated deficit of $984.6 million as of july 31, 2018. we anticipate that our operating expenses will continue to increase in the foreseeable future as we continue to grow our business. our growth efforts may prove more expensive than we currently anticipate, and we may not succeed in increasing our revenues sufficiently, or at all, to offset increasing expenses. revenue growth may slow or revenue may decline for a number of possible reasons, including slowing demand for our products or subscriptions, increasing competition, a decrease in the growth of our overall market, or a failure to capitalize on growth opportunities. any failure to increase our revenue as we grow our business could prevent us from achieving or maintaining profitability or maintaining or increasing cash flow on a consistent basis. in addition, we may have difficulty achieving profitability under u.s. generally accepted accounting principles ("gaap") due to share-based compensation expense and other non-cash charges. if we are unable to navigate these challenges as we encounter them, our business, financial condition, and operating results may suffer.
if we are unable to sell additional product, subscription, and support offerings to our end-customers, our future revenue and operating results will be harmed.
our future success depends, in part, on our ability to expand the deployment of our platform with existing end-customers. this may require increasingly sophisticated and costly sales efforts that may not result in additional sales. the rate at which our end-customers purchase additional products, subscriptions, and support depends on a number of factors, including the perceived need for additional security products, including subscription and support offerings, as well as general economic conditions. further, existing end-customers have no contractual obligation to and may not renew their subscription and support contracts after the completion of their initial contract period. our end-customers' renewal rates may decline or fluctuate as a result of a number of factors, including their level of satisfaction with our subscriptions and our support offerings, the frequency and severity of subscription outages, our product uptime or latency, and the pricing of our, or competing, subscriptions. additionally, our end-customers may renew their subscription and support agreements for shorter contract lengths or on other terms that are less economically beneficial to us. we also cannot be certain that our end-customers will renew their subscription and support agreements. if our efforts to sell additional products and subscriptions to our end-customers are not successful or our end-customers do not renew their subscription and support agreements or renew them on less favorable terms, our revenues may grow more slowly than expected or decline.
we face intense competition in our market, especially from larger, well-established companies, and we may lack sufficient financial or other resources to maintain or improve our competitive position.
the market for enterprise security products is intensely competitive, and we expect competition to increase in the future from established competitors and new market entrants. our main competitors fall into three categories:
•   large companies that incorporate security features in their products, such as cisco and juniper, or those that have acquired, or may acquire, large network and endpoint security vendors and have the technical and financial resources to bring competitive solutions to the market;
•   independent security vendors, such as symantec, check point, fortinet, and fireeye, that offer a mix of network and endpoint security products; and
•   small and large companies that offer point solutions and/or cloud security services that compete with some of the features present in our platform.
many of our existing competitors have, and some of our potential competitors could have, substantial competitive advantages such as:
•   greater name recognition and longer operating histories;
•   larger sales and marketing budgets and resources;
•   broader distribution and established relationships with distribution partners and end-customers;
•   greater customer support resources;
•   greater resources to make strategic acquisitions or enter into strategic partnerships;
•   lower labor and development costs;
•   substantially greater financial, technical, and other resources.
in addition, some of our larger competitors have substantially broader and more diverse product and services offerings, which may make them less susceptible to downturns in a particular market and allow them to leverage their relationships based on other products or incorporate functionality into existing products to gain business in a manner that discourages users from purchasing our products and subscriptions, including through selling at zero or negative margins, offering concessions, product bundling, or closed technology platforms. many of our smaller competitors that specialize in providing protection from a single type of security threat are often able to deliver these specialized security products to the market more quickly than we can.
organizations that use legacy products and services may believe that these products and services are sufficient to meet their security needs or that our platform only serves the needs of a portion of the enterprise security market. accordingly, these organizations may continue allocating their information technology budgets for legacy products and services and may not adopt our security platform. further, many organizations have invested substantial personnel and financial resources to design and operate their networks and have established deep relationships with other providers of networking and security products. as a result, these organizations may prefer to purchase from their existing suppliers rather than add or switch to a new supplier such as us regardless of product performance, features, or greater services offerings or may be more willing to incrementally add solutions to their existing security infrastructure from existing suppliers than to replace it wholesale with our solutions.
conditions in our market could change rapidly and significantly as a result of technological advancements, partnering or acquisitions by our competitors, or continuing market consolidation. new start-up companies that innovate and large competitors that are making significant investments in research and development may invent similar or superior products and technologies that compete with our products and subscriptions. some of our competitors have made or could make acquisitions of businesses that may allow them to offer more directly competitive and comprehensive solutions than they had previously offered and adapt more quickly to new technologies and end-customer needs. our current and potential competitors may also establish cooperative relationships among themselves or with third parties that may further enhance their resources.
these competitive pressures in our market or our failure to compete effectively may result in price reductions, fewer orders, reduced revenue and gross margins, and loss of market share. any failure to meet and address these factors could seriously harm our business and operating results.
a network or data security incident may allow unauthorized access to our network or data, harm our reputation, create additional liability and adversely impact our financial results.
increasingly, companies are subject to a wide variety of attacks on their networks on an ongoing basis. in addition to traditional computer "hackers," malicious code (such as viruses and worms), phishing attempts, employee theft or misuse, and denial of service attacks, sophisticated nation-state and nation-state supported actors engage in intrusions and attacks (including advanced persistent threat intrusions) and add to the risks to our internal networks, cloud deployed enterprise and customer facing environments and the information they store and process. despite significant efforts to create security barriers to such threats, it is virtually impossible for us to entirely mitigate these risks. we and our third-party service providers may face security threats and attacks from a variety of sources. our data, corporate systems, third-party systems and security measures may be breached due to the actions of outside parties, employee error, malfeasance, a combination of these, or otherwise, and, as a result, an unauthorized party may obtain access to our data. furthermore, as a well-known provider of security solutions, we may be a more attractive target for such attacks. a breach in our data security or an attack against our service availability, or that of our third-party service providers, could impact our networks or networks secured by our products and subscriptions, creating system disruptions or slowdowns and exploiting security vulnerabilities of our products, and the information stored on our networks or those of our third-party service providers could be accessed, publicly disclosed, altered, lost, or stolen, which could subject us to liability and cause us financial harm. although we have not yet
experienced significant damages from unauthorized access by a third party of our internal network, any actual or perceived breach of network security in our systems or networks, or any other actual or perceived data security incident we or our third-party service providers suffer, could result in damage to our reputation, negative publicity, loss of channel partners, end-customers and sales, loss of competitive advantages over our competitors, increased costs to remedy any problems and otherwise respond to any incident, regulatory investigations and enforcement actions, costly litigation, and other liability. in addition, we may incur significant costs and operational consequences of investigating, remediating, eliminating and putting in place additional tools and devices designed to prevent actual or perceived security incidents, as well as the costs to comply with any notification obligations resulting from any security incidents. while we maintain cybersecurity insurance, our insurance may be insufficient to cover all liabilities incurred by these incidents, and any incidents may result in loss of, or increased costs of, our cybersecurity insurance. any of these negative outcomes could adversely impact the market perception of our products and subscriptions and end-customer and investor confidence in our company and could seriously harm our business or operating results.
reliance on shipments at the end of the quarter could cause our revenue for the applicable period to fall below expected levels.
as a result of end-customer buying patterns and the efforts of our sales force and channel partners to meet or exceed their sales objectives, we have historically received a substantial portion of sales orders and generated a substantial portion of revenue during the last few weeks of each fiscal quarter. if expected revenue at the end of any fiscal quarter is delayed for any reason, including the failure of anticipated purchase orders to materialize (particularly for large enterprise end-customers with lengthy sales cycles), our logistics partners' inability to ship products prior to fiscal quarter-end to fulfill purchase orders received near the end of the fiscal quarter, our failure to manage inventory to meet demand, any failure of our systems related to order review and processing, or any delays in shipments based on trade compliance requirements (including new compliance requirements imposed by new or renegotiated trade agreements), revenue could fall below our expectations and the estimates of analysts for that quarter, which could adversely impact our business and operating results and cause a decline in the market price of our common stock.
we believe there are significant seasonal factors that may cause our second and fourth fiscal quarters to record greater revenue sequentially than our first and third fiscal quarters. we believe that this seasonality results from a number of factors, including:
•   end-customers with a december 31 fiscal year-end choosing to spend remaining unused portions of their discretionary budgets before their fiscal year-end, which potentially results in a positive impact on our revenue in our second fiscal quarter;
•   our sales compensation plans, which are typically structured around annual quotas and commission rate accelerators, which potentially results in a positive impact on our revenue in our fourth fiscal quarter;
•   seasonal reductions in business activity during august in the united states, europe and certain other regions, which potentially results in a negative impact on our first fiscal quarter revenue; and
•   the timing of end-customer budget planning at the beginning of the calendar year, which can result in a delay in spending at the beginning of the calendar year potentially resulting in a negative impact on our revenue in our third fiscal quarter.
as we continue to grow, seasonal or cyclical variations in our operations may become more pronounced, and our business, operating results and financial position may be adversely affected.
if we are unable to hire, integrate, train, retain, and motivate qualified personnel and senior management, our business could suffer.
our future success depends, in part, on our ability to continue to hire, integrate, train, and retain qualified and highly skilled personnel. we are substantially dependent on the continued service of our existing engineering personnel because of the complexity of our platform. additionally, any failure to hire, integrate, train, and adequately incentivize our sales personnel or the inability of our recently hired sales personnel to effectively ramp to target productivity levels could negatively impact our growth and operating margins. competition for highly skilled personnel, particularly in engineering, is often intense, especially in the san francisco bay area, where we have a substantial presence and need for such personnel. additionally, potential changes in u.s. immigration and work authorization laws and regulations may make it difficult to renew or obtain visas for any highly skilled personnel that we have hired or are actively recruiting.
in addition, the industry in which we operate generally experiences high employee attrition. although we have entered into employment offer letters with our key personnel, these agreements have no specific duration and constitute at-will employment. we do not maintain key person life insurance policies on any of our employees. the loss of one or more of our key employees, and any failure to have in place and execute an effective succession plan for key executives, could seriously harm our business. if we are unable to hire, integrate, train, or retain the qualified and highly skilled personnel required to fulfill our current or future needs, our business, financial condition, and operating results could be harmed.
our future performance also depends on the continued services and continuing contributions of our senior management to execute on our business plan and to identify and pursue new opportunities and product innovations. the loss of services of senior management or the ineffective management of any leadership transitions, especially within our sales organization, could significantly delay or prevent the achievement of our development and strategic objectives, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and operating results.
further, we believe that a critical contributor to our success and our ability to retain highly skilled personnel has been our corporate culture, which we believe fosters innovation, teamwork, passion for end-customers, focus on execution, and the facilitation of critical knowledge transfer and knowledge sharing. as we grow and change, we may find it difficult to maintain these important aspects of our corporate culture. any failure to preserve our culture as we grow could limit our ability to innovate and could negatively affect our ability to retain and recruit personnel, continue to perform at current levels or execute on our business strategy.
if we are not successful in executing our strategy to increase sales of our products and subscriptions to new and existing medium and large enterprise end-customers, our operating results may suffer.
our growth strategy is dependent, in part, upon increasing sales of our products to new and existing medium and large enterprise end-customers. sales to these end-customers involve risks that may not be present, or that are present to a lesser extent, with sales to smaller entities. these risks include:
•   competition from larger competitors, such as cisco, check point, and juniper, that traditionally target larger enterprises, service providers, and government entities and that may have pre-existing relationships or purchase commitments from those end-customers;
•   increased purchasing power and leverage held by large end-customers in negotiating contractual arrangements with us;
•   more stringent requirements in our worldwide support contracts, including stricter support response times and penalties for any failure to meet support requirements; and
•   longer sales cycles, in some cases over 12 months, and the associated risk that substantial time and resources may be spent on a potential end-customer that elects not to purchase our products and subscriptions.
in addition, product purchases by large enterprises are frequently subject to budget constraints, multiple approvals, and unplanned administrative, processing, and other delays. finally, large enterprises typically have longer implementation cycles, require greater product functionality and scalability and a broader range of services, demand that vendors take on a larger share of risks, sometimes require acceptance provisions that can lead to a delay in revenue recognition, and expect greater payment flexibility from vendors. all of these factors can add further risk to business conducted with these end-customers. if we fail to realize an expected sale from a large end-customer in a particular quarter or at all, our business, operating results, and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected.
we rely on revenue from subscription and support offerings, and because we recognize revenue from subscription and support over the term of the relevant service period, downturns or upturns in sales of these subscription and support offerings are not immediately reflected in full in our operating results.
subscription and support revenue accounts for a significant portion of our revenue, comprising 61.7% of total revenue in fiscal 2018, 59.7% of total revenue in fiscal 2017, and 51.3% of total revenue in fiscal 2016. sales of new or renewal subscription and support contracts may decline and fluctuate as a result of a number of factors, including end-customers' level of satisfaction with our products and subscriptions, the prices of our products and subscriptions, the prices of products and services offered by our competitors, and reductions in our end-customers' spending levels. if our sales of new or renewal subscription and support contracts decline, our total revenue and revenue growth rate may decline and our business will suffer. in addition, we recognize subscription and support revenue monthly over the term of the relevant service period, which is typically one to five years. as a result, much of the subscription and support revenue we report each fiscal quarter is the recognition of deferred revenue from subscription and support contracts entered into during previous fiscal quarters. consequently, a decline in new or renewed subscription or support contracts in any one fiscal quarter will not be fully or immediately reflected in revenue in that fiscal quarter but will negatively affect our revenue in future fiscal quarters. also, it is difficult for us to rapidly increase our subscription and support revenue through additional subscription and support sales in any period, as revenue from new and renewal subscription and support contracts must be recognized over the applicable service period.
defects, errors, or vulnerabilities in our products, subscriptions, or support offerings, the failure of our products or subscriptions to block a virus or prevent a security breach, misuse of our products, or risks of product liability claims could harm our reputation and adversely impact our operating results.
because our products and subscriptions are complex, they have contained and may contain design or manufacturing defects or errors that are not detected until after their commercial release and deployment by our end-customers. for example, from time to time,
certain of our end-customers have reported defects in our products related to performance, scalability, and compatibility. additionally, defects may cause our products or subscriptions to be vulnerable to security attacks, cause them to fail to help secure networks, or temporarily interrupt end-customers' networking traffic. because the techniques used by computer hackers to access or sabotage networks change frequently and generally are not recognized until launched against a target, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques and provide a solution in time to protect our end-customers' networks. furthermore, as a well-known provider of security solutions, our networks, products, including cloud-based technology, and subscriptions could be targeted by attacks specifically designed to disrupt our business and harm our reputation. in addition, defects or errors in our subscription updates or our products could result in a failure of our subscriptions to effectively update end-customers' hardware and cloud-based products. our data centers and networks may experience technical failures and downtime, may fail to distribute appropriate updates, or may fail to meet the increased requirements of a growing installed end-customer base, any of which could temporarily or permanently expose our end-customers' networks, leaving their networks unprotected against the latest security threats. moreover, our products must interoperate with our end-customers' existing infrastructure, which often have different specifications, utilize multiple protocol standards, deploy products from multiple vendors, and contain multiple generations of products that have been added over time. as a result, when problems occur in a network, it may be difficult to identify the sources of these problems.
the occurrence of any such problem in our products and subscriptions, whether real or perceived, could result in:
•   expenditure of significant financial and product development resources in efforts to analyze, correct, eliminate, or work-around errors or defects or to address and eliminate vulnerabilities;
•   loss of existing or potential end-customers or channel partners;
•   delay or failure to attain market acceptance;
•   an increase in warranty claims compared with our historical experience, or an increased cost of servicing warranty claims, either of which would adversely affect our gross margins; and
•   litigation, regulatory inquiries, or investigations, each of which may be costly and harm our reputation.
further, our products and subscriptions may be misused by end-customers or third parties that obtain access to our products and subscriptions. for example, our products and subscriptions could be used to censor private access to certain information on the internet. such use of our products and subscriptions for censorship could result in negative press coverage and negatively affect our reputation.
the limitation of liability provisions in our standard terms and conditions of sale may not fully or effectively protect us from claims as a result of federal, state, or local laws or ordinances, or unfavorable judicial decisions in the united states or other countries. the sale and support of our products and subscriptions also entails the risk of product liability claims. although we may be indemnified by our third-party manufacturers for product liability claims arising out of manufacturing defects, because we control the design of our products and subscriptions, we may not be indemnified for product liability claims arising out of design defects. we maintain insurance to protect against certain claims associated with the use of our products and subscriptions, but our insurance coverage may not adequately cover any claim asserted against us. in addition, even claims that ultimately are unsuccessful could result in our expenditure of funds in litigation, divert management's time and other resources, and harm our reputation.
false detection of applications, viruses, spyware, vulnerability exploits, data patterns, or url categories could adversely affect our business.
our classifications of application type, virus, spyware, vulnerability exploits, data, or url categories may falsely detect, report and act on applications, content, or threats that do not actually exist. this risk is heightened by the inclusion of a "heuristics" feature in our products and subscriptions, which attempts to identify applications and other threats not based on any known signatures but based on characteristics or anomalies which indicate that a particular item may be a threat. these false positives may impair the perceived reliability of our products and subscriptions and may therefore adversely impact market acceptance of our products and subscriptions. if our products and subscriptions restrict important files or applications based on falsely identifying them as malware or some other item that should be restricted, this could adversely affect end-customers' systems and cause material system failures. any such false identification of important files or applications could result in damage to our reputation, negative publicity, loss of channel partners, end-customers and sales, increased costs to remedy any problem, and costly litigation.
we rely on our channel partners to sell substantially all of our products, including subscriptions and support, and if these channel partners fail to perform, our ability to sell and distribute our products and subscriptions will be limited, and our operating results will be harmed.
substantially all of our revenue is generated by sales through our channel partners, including distributors and resellers. we provide our channel partners with specific training and programs to assist them in selling our products, including subscriptions and
support offerings, but there can be no assurance that these steps will be utilized or effective. in addition, our channel partners may be unsuccessful in marketing, selling, and supporting our products and subscriptions. we may not be able to incentivize these channel partners to sell our products and subscriptions to end-customers and, in particular, to large enterprises. these channel partners may also have incentives to promote our competitors' products and may devote more resources to the marketing, sales, and support of competitive products. our agreements with our channel partners may generally be terminated for any reason by either party with advance notice prior to each annual renewal date. we cannot be certain that we will retain these channel partners or that we will be able to secure additional or replacement channel partners. in addition, any new channel partner requires extensive training and may take several months or more to achieve productivity. our channel partner sales structure could subject us to lawsuits, potential liability, and reputational harm if, for example, any of our channel partners misrepresent the functionality of our products or subscriptions to end-customers or violate laws or our corporate policies. if we fail to effectively manage our sales channels or channel partners, our ability to sell our products and subscriptions and operating results will be harmed.
if we do not accurately predict, prepare for, and respond promptly to rapidly evolving technological and market developments and successfully manage product and subscription introductions and transitions to meet changing end-customer needs in the enterprise security market, our competitive position and prospects will be harmed.
the enterprise security market has grown quickly and is expected to continue to evolve rapidly. moreover, many of our end-customers operate in markets characterized by rapidly changing technologies and business plans, which require them to add numerous network access points and adapt increasingly complex enterprise networks, incorporating a variety of hardware, software applications, operating systems, and networking protocols. if we fail to accurately predict end-customers' changing needs and emerging technological trends in the enterprise security industry, including in the areas of mobility, virtualization, cloud computing, and software defined networks ("sdn"), our business could be harmed. the technology in our platform is especially complex because it needs to effectively identify and respond to new and increasingly sophisticated methods of attack, while minimizing the impact on network performance. additionally, some of our new platform features and related platform enhancements may require us to develop new hardware architectures that involve complex, expensive, and time-consuming research and development processes. the development of our platform is difficult and the timetable for commercial release and availability is uncertain as there can be long time periods between releases and availability of new platform features. if we experience unanticipated delays in the availability of new products, platform features, and subscriptions, and fail to meet customer expectations for such availability, our competitive position and business prospects will be harmed.
additionally, we must commit significant resources to developing new platform features before knowing whether our investments will result in products, subscriptions, and platform features the market will accept. the success of new platform features depends on several factors, including appropriate new product definition, differentiation of new products, subscriptions, and platform features from those of our competitors, and market acceptance of these products, services and platform features. moreover, successful new product introduction and transition depends on a number of factors including, our ability to manage the risks associated with new product production ramp-up issues, the availability of application software for new products, the effective management of purchase commitments and inventory, the availability of products in appropriate quantities and costs to meet anticipated demand, and the risk that new products may have quality or other defects or deficiencies, especially in the early stages of introduction. there can be no assurance that we will successfully identify opportunities for new products and subscriptions, develop and bring new products and subscriptions to market in a timely manner, or achieve market acceptance of our products and subscriptions, or that products, subscriptions, and technologies developed by others will not render our products, subscriptions, or technologies obsolete or noncompetitive.
our current research and development efforts may not produce successful products, subscriptions, or platform features that result in significant revenue, cost savings or other benefits in the near future, if at all.
developing our products, subscriptions, platform features, and related enhancements is expensive. our investments in research and development may not result in significant design improvements, marketable products, subscriptions, or platform features, or may result in products, subscriptions, or platform features that are more expensive than anticipated. additionally, we may not achieve the cost savings or the anticipated performance improvements we expect, and we may take longer to generate revenue, or generate less revenue, than we anticipate. our future plans include significant investments in research and development and related product and subscription opportunities. we believe that we must continue to dedicate a significant amount of resources to our research and development efforts to maintain our competitive position. however, we may not receive significant revenue from these investments in the near future, if at all, or these investments may not yield the expected benefits, either of which could adversely affect our business and operating results.
because we depend on manufacturing partners to build and ship our products, we are susceptible to manufacturing and logistics delays and pricing fluctuations that could prevent us from shipping customer orders on time, if at all, or on a cost-effective basis, which may result in the loss of sales and end-customers.
we depend on manufacturing partners, primarily flex, our ems provider, as sole source manufacturers for our product lines. our reliance on these manufacturing partners reduces our control over the manufacturing process and exposes us to risks, including reduced control over quality assurance, product costs, product supply, timing and transportation risk. our products are manufactured by our manufacturing partners at facilities located in the united states. some of the components in our products are sourced either through flex or directly by us from component suppliers outside the united states. the portion of our products that are sourced outside the united states may subject us to additional logistical risks or risks associated with complying with local rules and regulations in foreign countries. significant changes to existing international trade agreements could lead to sourcing or logistics disruption resulting from import delays or the imposition of increased tariffs on our sourcing partners. for example, the united states and chinese governments have each enacted, and discussed potential, import tariffs. these tariffs, depending on their ultimate scope and how they are implemented, could negatively impact our business by increasing our costs. each of these factors could severely impair our ability to fulfill orders.
in addition, we are subject to requirements under the dodd-frank wall street reform and consumer protection act of 2010 (the "dodd-frank act") to diligence, disclose, and report whether or not our products contain minerals originating from the democratic republic of the congo and adjoining countries, or conflict minerals. although the sec has provided guidance with respect to a portion of the conflict minerals filing requirements that may somewhat reduce our reporting practices, we have incurred and expect to incur additional costs to comply with these disclosure requirements, including costs related to determining the source of any of the relevant minerals and metals used in our products. these requirements could adversely affect the sourcing, availability, and pricing of minerals used in the manufacture of semiconductor devices or other components used in our products. we may also encounter end-customers who require that all of the components of our products be certified as conflict free. if we are not able to meet this requirement, such end-customers may choose not to purchase our products.
our manufacturing partners typically fulfill our supply requirements on the basis of individual purchase orders. we do not have long-term contracts with these manufacturers that guarantee capacity, the continuation of particular pricing terms, or the extension of credit limits. accordingly, they are not obligated to continue to fulfill our supply requirements and the prices we pay for manufacturing services could be increased on short notice. our contract with flex permits them to terminate the agreement for their convenience, subject to prior notice requirements. if we are required to change manufacturing partners, our ability to meet our scheduled product deliveries to our end-customers could be adversely affected, which could cause the loss of sales to existing or potential end-customers, delayed revenue or an increase in our costs which could adversely affect our gross margins. any production interruptions for any reason, such as a natural disaster, epidemic, capacity shortages, or quality problems, at one of our manufacturing partners would negatively affect sales of our product lines manufactured by that manufacturing partner and adversely affect our business and operating results.
managing the supply of our products and product components is complex. insufficient supply and inventory may result in lost sales opportunities or delayed revenue, while excess inventory may harm our gross margins.
our manufacturing partners procure components and build our products based on our forecasts, and we generally do not hold inventory for a prolonged period of time. these forecasts are based on estimates of future demand for our products, which are in turn based on historical trends and analyses from our sales and product management organizations, adjusted for overall market conditions. in order to reduce manufacturing lead times and plan for adequate component supply, from time to time we may issue forecasts for components and products that are non-cancelable and non-returnable.
our inventory management systems and related supply chain visibility tools may be inadequate to enable us to forecast accurately and effectively manage supply of our products and product components. if we ultimately determine that we have excess supply, we may have to reduce our prices and write-down inventory, which in turn could result in lower gross margins. if our actual component usage and product demand are lower than the forecast we provide to our manufacturing partners, we accrue for losses on manufacturing commitments in excess of forecasted demand. alternatively, insufficient supply levels may lead to shortages that result in delayed product revenue or loss of sales opportunities altogether as potential end-customers turn to competitors' products that are readily available. if we are unable to effectively manage our supply and inventory, our operating results could be adversely affected.
because some of the key components in our products come from limited sources of supply, we are susceptible to supply shortages or supply changes, which could disrupt or delay our scheduled product deliveries to our end-customers and may result in the loss of sales and end-customers.
our products rely on key components, including integrated circuit components, which our manufacturing partners purchase on our behalf from a limited number of component suppliers, including sole source providers. the manufacturing operations of some of our component suppliers are geographically concentrated in asia and elsewhere, which makes our supply chain vulnerable to regional
disruptions, such as natural disasters, fire, political instability, civil unrest, a power outage, or a localized health risk, and as a result could impair the volume of components that we are able to obtain.
further, we do not have volume purchase contracts with any of our component suppliers, and they could cease selling to us at any time. if we are unable to obtain a sufficient quantity of these components in a timely manner for any reason, sales of our products could be delayed or halted or we could be forced to expedite shipment of such components or our products at dramatically increased costs. our component suppliers also change their selling prices frequently in response to market trends, including industry-wide increases in demand, and because we do not have volume purchase contracts with these component suppliers, we are susceptible to price fluctuations related to raw materials and components and may not be able to adjust our prices accordingly. additionally, poor quality in any of the sole-sourced components in our products could result in lost sales or sales opportunities.
if we are unable to obtain a sufficient volume of the necessary components for our products on commercially reasonable terms or the quality of the components do not meet our requirements, we could also be forced to redesign our products and qualify new components from alternate component suppliers. the resulting stoppage or delay in selling our products and the expense of redesigning our products could result in lost sales opportunities and damage to customer relationships, which would adversely affect our business and operating results.
the sales prices of our products and subscriptions may decrease, which may reduce our gross profits and adversely impact our financial results.
the sales prices for our products and subscriptions may decline for a variety of reasons, including competitive pricing pressures, discounts, a change in our mix of products and subscriptions, anticipation of the introduction of new products or subscriptions, or promotional programs. competition continues to increase in the market segments in which we participate, and we expect competition to further increase in the future, thereby leading to increased pricing pressures. larger competitors with more diverse product and service offerings may reduce the price of products or subscriptions that compete with ours or may bundle them with other products and subscriptions. additionally, although we price our products and subscriptions worldwide in u.s. dollars, currency fluctuations in certain countries and regions may negatively impact actual prices that channel partners and end-customers are willing to pay in those countries and regions. furthermore, we anticipate that the sales prices and gross profits for our products will decrease over product life cycles. we cannot guarantee that we will be successful in developing and introducing new offerings with enhanced functionality on a timely basis, or that our product and subscription offerings, if introduced, will enable us to maintain our prices and gross profits at levels that will allow us to achieve and maintain profitability.
we generate a significant amount of revenue from sales to distributors, resellers, and end-customers outside of the united states, and we are therefore subject to a number of risks associated with international sales and operations.
we have a limited history of marketing, selling, and supporting our products and subscriptions internationally. we may experience difficulties in recruiting, training, managing, and retaining an international staff, and specifically staff related to sales management and sales personnel. we also may not be able to maintain successful strategic distributor relationships internationally or recruit additional companies to enter into strategic distributor relationships. business practices in the international markets that we serve may differ from those in the united states and may require us in the future to include terms other than our standard terms related to payment, warranties, or performance obligations in end-customer contracts.
additionally, our international sales and operations are subject to a number of risks, including the following:
•   political, economic and social uncertainty around the world, macroeconomic challenges in europe, terrorist activities, and continued hostilities in the middle east;
•   the uncertainty of protection for intellectual property rights in some countries;
•   greater risk of unexpected changes in foreign and domestic regulatory practices, tariffs, and tax laws and treaties, including regulatory and trade policy changes adopted by the current administration or foreign countries in response to regulatory changes adopted by the current administration;
•   risks associated with trade restrictions and foreign legal requirements, including the importation, certification, and localization of our products required in foreign countries;
•   greater risk of a failure of foreign employees, channel partners, distributors, and resellers to comply with both u.s. and foreign laws, including antitrust regulations, the u.s. foreign corrupt practices act, the u.k. bribery act, u.s. or foreign sanctions regimes and export or import control laws, and any trade regulations ensuring fair trade practices, which non-compliance could include increased costs;
•   heightened risk of unfair or corrupt business practices in certain geographies and of improper or fraudulent sales arrangements;
•   increased expenses incurred in establishing and maintaining office space and equipment for our international operations;
•   management communication and integration problems resulting from cultural and geographic dispersion; and
•   fluctuations in exchange rates between the u.s. dollar and foreign currencies in markets where we do business and related impact on sales cycles.
these and other factors could harm our future international revenues and, consequently, materially impact our business, operating results, and financial condition. the expansion of our existing international operations and entry into additional international markets will require significant management attention and financial resources. our failure to successfully manage our international operations and the associated risks effectively could limit the future growth of our business.
further, we are subject to risks associated with changes in economic and political conditions in countries in which we operate or sell our products and subscriptions. for instance, the u.k.'s notification of its intention to leave the e.u. creates an uncertain political and economic environment in the u.k. and potentially across other e.u. member states for the foreseeable future, including during any period while the terms of any u.k. exit from the e.u. are being negotiated and/or during any transitional period connected to the u.k.'s eventual withdrawal from the e.u. any agreements arising out of negotiations which the u.k. government makes to retain access to e.u. markets either during a transitional period or more permanently may lead to greater restrictions on the free movement of goods, services, people and capital between the u.k. and the remaining e.u. member states. our financial condition and operating results in the u.k. and the e.u. may be impacted by such uncertainty with potential disruptions to our relationships with existing and future customers, suppliers and employees all possibly having a material adverse impact on our business, prospects, financial condition and/or operating results.
we are exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates, which could negatively affect our financial condition and operating results.
our sales contracts are primarily denominated in u.s. dollars, and therefore, substantially all of our revenue is not subject to foreign currency risk. however, including as a result of concerns regarding the impact of brexit, there has been, and may continue to be, significant volatility in global stock markets and foreign currency exchange rates that result in the strengthening of the u.s. dollar against foreign currencies in which we conduct business. the strengthening of the u.s. dollar increases the real cost of our platform to our end-customers outside of the united states and may lead to delays in the purchase of our products, subscriptions, and support, and the lengthening of our sales cycle. if the u.s. dollar continues to strengthen, this could adversely affect our financial condition and operating results. in addition, increased international sales in the future, including through our channel partners and other partnerships, may result in greater foreign currency denominated sales, increasing our foreign currency risk.
our operating expenses incurred outside the united states and denominated in foreign currencies are increasing and are subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. if we are not able to successfully hedge against the risks associated with foreign currency fluctuations, our financial condition and operating results could be adversely affected. we have entered into forward contracts in an effort to reduce our foreign currency exchange exposure related to our foreign currency denominated expenditures. as of july 31, 2018, the total notional amount of our outstanding foreign currency forward contracts was $288.5 million. for more information on our hedging transactions, refer to note 4. derivative instruments in part ii, item 8 of this annual report on form 10-k. the effectiveness of our existing hedging transactions and the availability and effectiveness of any hedging transactions we may decide to enter into in the future may be limited and we may not be able to successfully hedge our exposure, which could adversely affect our financial condition and operating results.
a small number of channel partners represent a large percentage of our revenue and gross accounts receivable. we are exposed to the credit and liquidity risk of some of our channel partners and to credit exposure in weakened markets, which could result in material losses.
for fiscal 2018, three distributors represented 67.1% of our total revenue, and as of july 31, 2018, four distributors represented 71.9% of our gross accounts receivable. most of our sales to our channel partners are made on an open credit basis. although we have programs in place that are designed to monitor and mitigate these risks, we cannot guarantee these programs will be effective in reducing our credit risks, especially as we expand our business internationally. if we are unable to adequately control these risks, our business, operating results, and financial condition could be harmed.
a portion of our revenue is generated by sales to government entities, which are subject to a number of challenges and risks.
sales to government entities are subject to a number of risks. selling to government entities can be highly competitive, expensive, and time-consuming, often requiring significant upfront time and expense without any assurance that these efforts will generate a sale. the substantial majority of our sales to date to government entities have been made indirectly through our channel partners. government certification requirements for products and subscriptions like ours may change, thereby restricting our ability to sell into the federal government sector until we have attained the revised certification. if our products and subscriptions are late in achieving or fail to achieve compliance with these certifications and standards, or our competitors achieve compliance with these
certifications and standards, we may be disqualified from selling our products and subscriptions to such governmental entity, or be at a competitive disadvantage, which would harm our business, operating results, and financial condition. government demand and payment for our products and subscriptions may be impacted by government shutdowns, public sector budgetary cycles, contracting requirements, and funding authorizations, with funding reductions or delays adversely affecting public sector demand for our products and subscriptions. government entities may have statutory, contractual, or other legal rights to terminate contracts with our distributors and resellers for convenience or due to a default, and any such termination may adversely impact our future operating results. governments routinely investigate and audit government contractors' administrative processes, and any unfavorable audit could result in the government refusing to continue buying our products and subscriptions, a reduction of revenue, or fines or civil or criminal liability if the audit uncovers improper or illegal activities, which could adversely impact our operating results in a material way. additionally, the u.s. government may require certain of the products that it purchases to be manufactured in the united states and other relatively high cost manufacturing locations, and we may not manufacture all products in locations that meet such requirements, affecting our ability to sell these products and subscriptions to the u.s. government.
our ability to sell our products and subscriptions is dependent on the quality of our technical support services and those of our channel partners, and the failure to offer high-quality technical support services could have a material adverse effect on our end-customers' satisfaction with our products and subscriptions, our sales, and our operating results.
after our products and subscriptions are deployed within our end-customers' networks, our end-customers depend on our technical support services, as well as the support of our channel partners, to resolve any issues relating to our products. our channel partners often provide similar technical support for third parties' products, and may therefore have fewer resources to dedicate to the support of our products and subscriptions. if we or our channel partners do not effectively assist our end-customers in deploying our products and subscriptions, succeed in helping our end-customers quickly resolve post-deployment issues, or provide effective ongoing support, our ability to sell additional products and subscriptions to existing end-customers would be adversely affected and our reputation with potential end-customers could be damaged. many larger enterprise, service provider, and government entity end-customers have more complex networks and require higher levels of support than smaller end-customers. if we or our channel partners fail to meet the requirements of these larger end-customers, it may be more difficult to execute on our strategy to increase our coverage with larger end-customers. additionally, if our channel partners do not effectively provide support to the satisfaction of our end-customers, we may be required to provide direct support to such end-customers, which would require us to hire additional personnel and to invest in additional resources. it can take several months to recruit, hire, and train qualified technical support employees. we may not be able to hire such resources fast enough to keep up with unexpected demand, particularly if the sales of our products exceed our internal forecasts. as a result, our ability, and the ability of our channel partners to provide adequate and timely support to our end-customers will be negatively impacted, and our end-customers' satisfaction with our products and subscriptions will be adversely affected. additionally, to the extent that we may need to rely on our sales engineers to provide post-sales support while we are ramping our support resources, our sales productivity will be negatively impacted, which would harm our revenues. our failure or our channel partners' failure to provide and maintain high-quality support services could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and operating results.
we may acquire other businesses, which could require significant management attention, disrupt our business, dilute stockholder value, and adversely affect our operating results.
as part of our business strategy, we may acquire or make investments in complementary companies, products, or technologies. for example, in april 2014, we acquired cyvera ltd. ("cyvera"), in may 2015, we acquired cirrosecure, inc., in february 2017, we acquired lightcyber ltd. ("lightcyber"), in march 2018, we acquired evident.io, and in april 2018, we acquired secdo. our ability as an organization to acquire and integrate other companies, products, or technologies in a successful and timely manner is still relatively unproven. the identification of suitable acquisition candidates is difficult, and we may not be able to complete such acquisitions on favorable terms, if at all. if we do complete future acquisitions, we may not ultimately strengthen our competitive position or achieve our goals and business strategy, we may be subject to claims or liabilities assumed from an acquired company, product, or technology, and any acquisitions we complete could be viewed negatively by our end-customers, investors, and securities analysts. additionally, we may be subject to litigation or other claims in connection with the acquired company, including claims from terminated employees, customers, former stockholders or other third parties, which may differ from or be more significant than the risks our business faces. if we are unsuccessful at integrating past or future acquisitions, or the technologies and operations associated with such acquisitions, into our company, the revenue and operating results of the combined company could be adversely affected. any integration process may require significant time and resources, which may disrupt our ongoing business and divert management's attention, and we may not be able to manage the integration process successfully. we may not successfully evaluate or utilize the acquired technology or personnel, realize anticipated synergies from the acquisition, or accurately forecast the financial impact of an acquisition transaction and integration of such acquisition, including accounting charges and any potential impairment of goodwill and intangible assets recognized in connection with such acquisitions. we may have to pay cash, incur debt, or issue equity or equity-linked securities to pay for any future acquisitions, each of which could adversely affect our financial condition or the market price of our common stock. furthermore, the sale of equity or issuance of equity-linked debt to finance any future acquisitions could result in dilution to our stockholders. see the risk factors entitled "our failure to raise additional capital or generate the significant capital
necessary to expand our operations and invest in new products and subscriptions could reduce our ability to compete and could harm our business" and "the issuance of additional stock in connection with financings, acquisitions, investments, our stock incentive plans, the conversion of our notes or exercise of the related warrants, or otherwise will dilute all other stockholders." the occurrence of any of these risks could harm our business, operating results, and financial condition.
claims by others that we infringe their proprietary technology or other rights could harm our business.
companies in the enterprise security industry own large numbers of patents, copyrights, trademarks, domain names, and trade secrets and frequently enter into litigation based on allegations of infringement, misappropriation, or other violations of intellectual property or other rights. third parties have asserted and may in the future assert claims of infringement of intellectual property rights against us. for example, in december 2011, juniper, one of our competitors, filed a lawsuit against us alleging patent infringement. in september 2013, we filed a lawsuit against juniper alleging patent infringement. in may 2014, we entered into a settlement, release and cross-license agreement with juniper to resolve all pending disputes between juniper and us, including dismissal of all pending litigation.
third parties may also assert such claims against our end-customers or channel partners, whom our standard license and other agreements obligate us to indemnify against claims that our products and subscriptions infringe the intellectual property rights of third parties. in addition, to the extent we hire personnel from competitors, we may be subject to allegations that they have been improperly solicited, that they have divulged proprietary or other confidential information, or that their former employers own their inventions or other work product. furthermore, we may be unaware of the intellectual property rights of others that may cover some or all of our technology or products and subscriptions. as the number of products and competitors in our market increases and overlaps occur, infringement claims may increase. while we intend to increase the size of our patent portfolio, our competitors and others may now and in the future have significantly larger and more mature patent portfolios than we have. in addition, litigation may involve patent holding companies or other adverse patent owners who have no relevant product revenue and against whom our own patents may therefore provide little or no deterrence or protection. in addition, we have not registered our trademarks in all of our geographic markets and failure to secure those registrations could adversely affect our ability to enforce and defend our trademark rights. any claim of infringement by a third party, even those without merit, could cause us to incur substantial costs defending against the claim, could distract our management from our business, and could require us to cease use of such intellectual property. furthermore, because of the substantial amount of discovery required in connection with intellectual property litigation, there is a risk that some of our confidential information could be compromised by disclosure during this type of litigation. a successful claimant could secure a judgment or we may agree to a settlement that prevents us from distributing certain products or performing certain services or that requires us to pay substantial damages, royalties, or other fees. any of these events could seriously harm our business, financial condition, and operating results.
our proprietary rights may be difficult to enforce or protect, which could enable others to copy or use aspects of our products or subscriptions without compensating us.
we rely and expect to continue to rely on a combination of confidentiality and license agreements with our employees, consultants, and third parties with whom we have relationships, as well as trademark, copyright, patent, and trade secret protection laws, to protect our proprietary rights. we have filed various applications for certain aspects of our intellectual property. valid patents may not issue from our pending applications, and the claims eventually allowed on any patents may not be sufficiently broad to protect our technology or products and subscriptions. we cannot be certain that we were the first to make the inventions claimed in our pending patent applications or that we were the first to file for patent protection, which could prevent our patent applications from issuing as patents or invalidate our patents following issuance. additionally, the process of obtaining patent protection is expensive and time-consuming, and we may not be able to prosecute all necessary or desirable patent applications at a reasonable cost or in a timely manner. any issued patents may be challenged, invalidated or circumvented, and any rights granted under these patents may not actually provide adequate defensive protection or competitive advantages to us. additional uncertainty may result from changes to patent-related laws and court rulings in the united states and other jurisdictions. as a result, we may not be able to obtain adequate patent protection or effectively enforce any issued patents.
despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights, unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of our products or subscriptions or obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary. we generally enter into confidentiality or license agreements with our employees, consultants, vendors, and end-customers, and generally limit access to and distribution of our proprietary information. however, we cannot be certain that we have entered into such agreements with all parties who may have or have had access to our confidential information or that the agreements we have entered into will not be breached. we cannot guarantee that any of the measures we have taken will prevent misappropriation of our technology. because we may be an attractive target for computer hackers, we may have a greater risk of unauthorized access to, and misappropriation of, our proprietary information. in addition, the laws of some foreign countries do not protect our proprietary rights to as great an extent as the laws of the united states, and many foreign countries do not enforce these laws as diligently as government agencies and private parties in the united states. from time to time, we may need to take legal action to enforce our patents and other intellectual property rights, to protect our trade secrets, to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others or to defend against claims of infringement or invalidity. such
litigation could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and could negatively affect our business, operating results, and financial condition. attempts to enforce our rights against third parties could also provoke these third parties to assert their own intellectual property or other rights against us, or result in a holding that invalidates or narrows the scope of our rights, in whole or in part. if we are unable to protect our proprietary rights (including aspects of our software and products protected other than by patent rights), we may find ourselves at a competitive disadvantage to others who need not incur the additional expense, time, and effort required to create the innovative products that have enabled us to be successful to date. any of these events would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and operating results.
our use of open source software in our products and subscriptions could negatively affect our ability to sell our products and subscriptions and subject us to possible litigation.
our products and subscriptions contain software modules licensed to us by third-party authors under "open source" licenses. some open source licenses contain requirements that we make available applicable source code for modifications or derivative works we create based upon the type of open source software we use. if we combine our proprietary software with open source software in a certain manner, we could, under certain open source licenses, be required to release the source code of our proprietary software to the public. this would allow our competitors to create similar products or subscriptions with lower development effort and time and ultimately could result in a loss of product sales for us.
although we monitor our use of open source software to avoid subjecting our products and subscriptions to conditions we do not intend, the terms of many open source licenses have not been interpreted by united states courts, and there is a risk that these licenses could be construed in a way that could impose unanticipated conditions or restrictions on our ability to commercialize our products and subscriptions. from time to time, there have been claims against companies that distribute or use open source software in their products and subscriptions, asserting that open source software infringes the claimants' intellectual property rights. we could be subject to suits by parties claiming infringement of intellectual property rights in what we believe to be licensed open source software. if we are held to have breached the terms of an open source software license, we could be required to seek licenses from third parties to continue offering our products and subscriptions on terms that are not economically feasible, to reengineer our products and subscriptions, to discontinue the sale of our products and subscriptions if reengineering could not be accomplished on a timely basis, or to make generally available, in source code form, our proprietary code, any of which could adversely affect our business, operating results, and financial condition.
in addition to risks related to license requirements, usage of open source software can lead to greater risks than use of third-party commercial software, as open source licensors generally do not provide warranties or assurance of title or controls on origin of the software. in addition, many of the risks associated with usage of open source software, such as the lack of warranties or assurances of title, cannot be eliminated, and could, if not properly addressed, negatively affect our business. we have established processes to help alleviate these risks, including a review process for screening requests from our development organizations for the use of open source software, but we cannot be sure that our processes for controlling our use of open source software in our products and subscriptions will be effective.
we license technology from third parties, and our inability to maintain those licenses could harm our business.
we incorporate technology that we license from third parties, including software, into our products and subscriptions. we cannot be certain that our licensors are not infringing the intellectual property rights of third parties or that our licensors have sufficient rights to the licensed intellectual property in all jurisdictions in which we may sell our products and subscriptions. in addition, some licenses may be non-exclusive, and therefore our competitors may have access to the same technology licensed to us. some of our agreements with our licensors may be terminated for convenience by them. we may also be subject to additional fees or be required to obtain new licenses if any of our licensors allege that we have not properly paid for such licenses or that we have improperly used the technologies under such licenses, and such licenses may not be available on terms acceptable to us or at all. if we are unable to continue to license any of this technology because of intellectual property infringement claims brought by third parties against our licensors or against us, or claims against us by our licensors, or if we are unable to continue our license agreements or enter into new licenses on commercially reasonable terms, our ability to develop and sell products and subscriptions containing such technology would be severely limited, and our business could be harmed. additionally, if we are unable to license necessary technology from third parties, we may be forced to acquire or develop alternative technology, which we may be unable to do in a commercially feasible manner or at all, and we may be required to use alternative technology of lower quality or performance standards. this would limit and delay our ability to offer new or competitive products and subscriptions and increase our costs of production. as a result, our margins, market share, and operating results could be significantly harmed.
we face risks associated with having operations and employees located in israel.
as a result of our acquisitions of cyvera, lightcyber, and secdo, we have an office and employees located in israel. accordingly, political, economic, and military conditions in israel directly affect our operations. the future of peace efforts between israel and its arab neighbors remains uncertain. there has been a significant increase in hostilities and political unrest between hamas
and israel in the past few years. the effects of these hostilities and violence on the israeli economy and our operations in israel are unclear, and we cannot predict the effect on us of further increases in these hostilities or future armed conflict, political instability or violence in the region. current or future tensions and conflicts in the middle east could adversely affect our business, operating results, financial condition and cash flows.
in addition, many of our employees in israel are obligated to perform annual reserve duty in the israeli military and are subject to being called for active duty under emergency circumstances. we cannot predict the full impact of these conditions on us in the future, particularly if emergency circumstances or an escalation in the political situation occurs. if many of our employees in israel are called for active duty for a significant period of time, our operations and our business could be disrupted and may not be able to function at full capacity. any disruption in our operations in israel could adversely affect our business.
our failure to adequately protect personal information could have a material adverse effect on our business.
a wide variety of provincial, state, national, and international laws and regulations apply to the collection, use, retention, protection, disclosure, transfer, and other processing of personal data. these data protection and privacy-related laws and regulations are evolving and being tested in courts and may result in ever-increasing regulatory and public scrutiny as well as escalating levels of enforcement and sanctions. further, the interpretation and application of foreign laws and regulations in many cases is uncertain, and our legal and regulatory obligations in foreign jurisdictions are subject to frequent and unexpected changes, including the potential for various regulatory or other governmental bodies to enact new or additional laws or regulations, to issue rulings that invalidate prior laws or regulations, or to increase penalties significantly.
for example, the e.u. general data protection regulation ("gdpr"), which became effective in may 2018, imposes more stringent data protection requirements, and provides for greater penalties for noncompliance, than e.u. laws that previously applied. in the u.k., a data protection bill that substantially implements the gdpr also became law in may 2018. additionally, california recently enacted legislation, the california consumer privacy act ("ccpa"), that will, among other things, require covered companies to provide new disclosures to california consumers, and afford such consumers new abilities to opt-out of certain sales of personal information, when it goes into effect on january 1, 2020. legislators have stated that they intend to propose amendments to the ccpa before it goes into effect, and it remains unclear what, if any, modifications will be made to this legislation or how it will be interpreted. the effects of the ccpa potentially are significant, however, and may require us to modify our data processing practices and policies and to incur substantial costs and expenses in an effort to comply. we may also from time to time be subject to, or face assertions that we are subject to, additional obligations relating to personal data by contract or due to assertions that self-regulatory obligations or industry standards apply to our practices.
our actual or perceived failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations or other obligations to which we may be subject relating to personal data, or to protect personal data from unauthorized acquisition, use or other processing, could result in consequences such as enforcement actions and regulatory investigations against us, fines, public censure, claims for damages by end-customers and other affected individuals, damage to our reputation and loss of goodwill (both in relation to existing end-customers and prospective end-customers), any of which could have a material adverse effect on our operations, financial performance, and business. evolving and changing definitions of personal data and personal information, within the e.u., the united states, and elsewhere, especially relating to classification of ip addresses, machine identification, location data, and other information, may limit or inhibit our ability to operate or expand our business, including limiting strategic partnerships that may involve the sharing or uses of data, and may require significant expenditures and efforts in order to comply. even the perception of privacy, data protection or information security concerns, whether or not valid, may harm our reputation and inhibit adoption of our products and subscriptions by current and future end-customers.
we are subject to governmental export and import controls that could subject us to liability or impair our ability to compete in international markets.
because we incorporate encryption technology into our products, certain of our products are subject to u.s. export controls and may be exported outside the united states only with the required export license or through an export license exception. if we were to fail to comply with u.s. export licensing requirements, u.s. customs regulations, u.s. economic sanctions, or other laws, we could be subject to substantial civil and criminal penalties, including fines, incarceration for responsible employees and managers, and the possible loss of export or import privileges. obtaining the necessary export license for a particular sale may be time-consuming and may result in the delay or loss of sales opportunities. furthermore, u.s. export control laws and economic sanctions prohibit the shipment of certain products to u.s. embargoed or sanctioned countries, governments, and persons. even though we take precautions to ensure that our channel partners comply with all relevant regulations, any failure by our channel partners to comply with such regulations could have negative consequences for us, including reputational harm, government investigations, and penalties.
in addition, various countries regulate the import of certain encryption technology, including through import permit and license requirements, and have enacted laws that could limit our ability to distribute our products or could limit our end-customers' ability to implement our products in those countries. changes in our products or changes in export and import regulations may create delays in the introduction of our products into international markets, prevent our end-customers with international operations from deploying
our products globally or, in some cases, prevent or delay the export or import of our products to certain countries, governments, or persons altogether. any change in export or import regulations, economic sanctions or related legislation, shift in the enforcement or scope of existing regulations, or change in the countries, governments, persons, or technologies targeted by such regulations, could result in decreased use of our products by, or in our decreased ability to export or sell our products to, existing or potential end-customers with international operations. any decreased use of our products or limitation on our ability to export to or sell our products in international markets would likely adversely affect our business, financial condition, and operating results.
our failure to raise additional capital or generate the significant capital necessary to expand our operations and invest in new products and subscriptions could reduce our ability to compete and could harm our business.
we intend to continue to make investments to support our business growth and may require additional funds to respond to business challenges, including the need to develop new features to enhance our platform, improve our operating infrastructure, or acquire complementary businesses and technologies. accordingly, we may need to engage in equity or debt financings to secure additional funds. if we raise additional equity or equity-linked financing, our stockholders may experience significant dilution of their ownership interests and the market price of our common stock could decline. for example, in june 2014, we issued 0.0% convertible senior notes due 2019 (the "2019 notes") and in july 2018, we issued 0.75% convertible senior notes due 2023 (the "2023 notes" and, together with the 2019 notes, the "notes"); any conversion of some or all of either series of notes into common stock will dilute the ownership interests of existing stockholders to the extent we deliver shares upon conversion of such notes. see the risk factor entitled "the issuance of additional stock in connection with financings, acquisitions, investments, our stock incentive plans, the conversion of our notes, or otherwise will dilute all other stockholders." the holders of the notes have priority over holders of our common stock, and if we engage in future debt financings, the holders of such additional debt would also have priority over the holders of our common stock. future indebtedness may also contain terms that, among other things, restrict our ability to incur additional indebtedness. we may also be required to take other actions that would otherwise be in the interests of the debt holders and would require us to maintain specified liquidity or other ratios, any of which could harm our business, operating results, and financial condition. we may not be able to obtain additional financing on terms favorable to us, if at all. if we are unable to obtain adequate financing or financing on terms satisfactory to us when we require it, our ability to continue to support our business growth and to respond to business challenges could be significantly impaired, and our business may be adversely affected.
we have a corporate structure aligned with the international nature of our business activities, and if we do not achieve increased tax benefits as a result of our corporate structure, our financial condition and operating results could be adversely affected.
we have reorganized our corporate structure and intercompany relationships to more closely align with the international nature of our business activities. this corporate structure may allow us to reduce our overall effective tax rate through changes in how we use our intellectual property, international procurement, and sales operations. this corporate structure may also allow us to obtain financial and operational efficiencies. these efforts require us to incur expenses in the near term for which we may not realize related benefits. if the structure is not accepted by the applicable tax authorities, if there are any changes in domestic and international tax laws that negatively impact the structure, including, but not limited to, the u.s. tax reform legislation enacted into law on december 22, 2017, and commonly referred to as the tax cuts and jobs act ("tcja") and guidance regarding base erosion and profit shifting ("beps") provided by the organisation for economic co-operation and development, or if we do not operate our business consistent with the structure and applicable tax provisions, we may fail to achieve the reduction in our overall effective tax rate and the other financial and operational efficiencies that we anticipate as a result of the structure and our future financial condition and operating results may be negatively impacted. in addition, we continue to evaluate our corporate structure in light of current and pending tax legislation, and any changes to our corporate structure may require us to incur additional expenses and may impact our overall effective tax rate.
our income tax obligations are based in part on our corporate structure and intercompany arrangements, including the manner in which we develop, value, and use our intellectual property and the valuations of our intercompany transactions. the tax laws applicable to our business, including the laws of the united states and other jurisdictions, are subject to interpretation and certain jurisdictions may aggressively interpret their laws in an effort to raise additional tax revenue. the tax authorities of the jurisdictions in which we operate may challenge our methodologies for valuing developed technology or intercompany arrangements, which could increase our worldwide effective tax rate and harm our financial position and operating results. it is possible that tax authorities may disagree with certain positions we have taken and any adverse outcome of such a review or audit could have a negative effect on our financial position and operating results. further, the determination of our worldwide provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities requires significant judgment by management, and there are transactions where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. although we believe that our estimates are reasonable, the ultimate tax outcome may differ from the amounts recorded in our consolidated financial statements and may materially affect our financial results in the period or periods for which such determination is made.
in addition, our future income tax obligations could be adversely affected by changes in tax laws in the united states or in other jurisdictions in which we operate. in the united states, the tcja contains many significant changes to the u.s. federal income tax laws, the consequences of which, to us, have not yet been fully determined and which could have material impact on the value of our deferred tax assets and could increase our future u.s. income tax expense. furthermore, changes to the taxation of undistributed foreign earnings, if any, could change our future intentions regarding reinvestment of such earnings. the foregoing items could have a material adverse effect on our business, cash flows, operating results, or financial condition.
if our estimates or judgments relating to our critical accounting policies are based on assumptions that change or prove to be incorrect, our operating results could fall below our publicly announced guidance or the expectations of securities analysts and investors, resulting in a decline in the market price of our common stock.
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets, liabilities, equity, revenue, and expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources. for more information, refer to the section entitled "critical accounting estimates" in "management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations" in part ii, item 7 of this annual report on form 10-k. additionally, as we work toward adopting and implementing the new revenue accounting standard, management will make judgments and assumptions based on our interpretation of the new standard. the new revenue standard is principle based and interpretation of those principles may vary from company to company based on their unique circumstances. it is possible that interpretation, industry practice, and guidance may evolve as we work toward implementing the new standard. if our assumptions change or if actual circumstances differ from our assumptions, our operating results may be adversely affected and could fall below our publicly announced guidance or the expectations of securities analysts and investors, resulting in a decline in the market price of our common stock.
failure to comply with governmental laws and regulations could harm our business.
our business is subject to regulation by various federal, state, local, and foreign governmental agencies, including agencies responsible for monitoring and enforcing employment and labor laws, workplace safety, product safety, environmental laws, consumer protection laws, anti-bribery laws (including the u.s. foreign corrupt practices act and the u.k. anti-bribery act), import/export controls, federal securities laws, and tax laws and regulations. in certain jurisdictions, these regulatory requirements may be more stringent than those in the united states. noncompliance with applicable regulations or requirements could subject us to investigations, sanctions, mandatory product recalls, enforcement actions, disgorgement of profits, fines, damages, civil and criminal penalties, or injunctions. if any governmental sanctions are imposed, or if we do not prevail in any possible civil or criminal litigation resulting from any alleged noncompliance, our business, operating results, and financial condition could be materially adversely affected. in addition, responding to any action will likely result in a significant diversion of management's attention and resources and an increase in professional fees. enforcement actions, litigation, and sanctions could harm our business, operating results, and financial condition.
if we fail to comply with environmental requirements, our business, financial condition, operating results, and reputation could be adversely affected.
we are subject to various environmental laws and regulations including laws governing the hazardous material content of our products and laws relating to the collection of and recycling of electrical and electronic equipment. examples of these laws and regulations include the e.u. restriction on the use of certain hazardous substances in electrical and electronic equipment directive ("rohs") and the e.u. waste electrical and electronic equipment directive ("weee directive"), as well as the implementing legislation of the e.u. member states. similar laws and regulations have been passed or are pending in china, south korea, norway, and japan and may be enacted in other regions, including in the united states, and we are, or may in the future be, subject to these laws and regulations.
the e.u. rohs and the similar laws of other jurisdictions limit the content of certain hazardous materials such as lead, mercury, and cadmium in the manufacture of electrical equipment, including our products. our current products comply with the e.u. rohs requirements. however, if there are changes to this or other laws (or their interpretation) or if new similar laws are passed in other jurisdictions, we may be required to reengineer our products to use components compatible with these regulations. this reengineering and component substitution could result in additional costs to us or disrupt our operations or logistics.
the weee directive requires electronic goods producers to be responsible for the collection, recycling, and treatment of such products. changes in interpretation of the directive may cause us to incur costs or have additional regulatory requirements to meet in the future in order to comply with this directive, or with any similar laws adopted in other jurisdictions.
we are also subject to environmental laws and regulations governing the management of hazardous materials, which we use in small quantities in our engineering labs. our failure to comply with past, present, and future similar laws could result in reduced sales
of our products, substantial product inventory write-offs, reputational damage, penalties, and other sanctions, any of which could harm our business and financial condition. we also expect that our products will be affected by new environmental laws and regulations on an ongoing basis. to date, our expenditures for environmental compliance have not had a material impact on our operating results or cash flows, and although we cannot predict the future impact of such laws or regulations, they will likely result in additional costs and may increase penalties associated with violations or require us to change the content of our products or how they are manufactured, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, and financial condition.
our business is subject to the risks of earthquakes, fire, power outages, floods, and other catastrophic events, and to interruption by man-made problems such as terrorism.
both our corporate headquarters and the location where our products are manufactured are located in the san francisco bay area, a region known for seismic activity. in addition, other natural disasters, such as fire or floods, a significant power outage, telecommunications failure, terrorism, an armed conflict, cyberattacks, or other geo-political unrest could affect our supply chain, manufacturers, logistics providers, channel partners, or end-customers or the economy as a whole and such disruption could impact our shipments and sales. these risks may be further increased if the disaster recovery plans for us and our suppliers prove to be inadequate. to the extent that any of the above should result in delays or cancellations of customer orders, the loss of customers, or the delay in the manufacture, deployment, or shipment of our products, our business, financial condition, and operating results would be adversely affected.
risks related to our notes we may not have the ability to raise the funds necessary to settle conversions of the notes, repurchase the notes upon a fundamental change or repay the notes in cash at their maturity, and our future debt may contain limitations on our ability to pay cash upon conversion or repurchase of the notes.
holders of the notes of either series will have the right under the applicable indenture governing the notes to require us to repurchase all or a portion of their notes of such series upon the occurrence of a fundamental change before the applicable maturity date at a repurchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount of such notes to be repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the applicable fundamental change repurchase date. in addition, upon conversion of the notes of either series, we will be required to make cash payments for each $1,000 in principal amount of such notes converted of at least the lesser of $1,000 and the sum of the daily conversion values for such series of notes. moreover, we will be required to repay the notes in cash at their respective maturity, unless earlier converted or repurchased. however, we may not have enough available cash or be able to obtain financing at the time we are required to make repurchases of such notes surrendered or pay cash with respect to such notes being converted.
in addition, our ability to repurchase or to pay cash upon conversion of either series of notes may be limited by law, regulatory authority or agreements governing our future indebtedness. our failure to repurchase the notes at a time when the repurchase is required by the relevant indenture governing such notes or to pay cash upon conversion of such notes as required by the relevant indenture would constitute a default under such indenture. a default under the relevant indenture or the fundamental change itself could also lead to a default under agreements governing our future indebtedness. if the payment of the related indebtedness were to be accelerated after any applicable notice or grace periods, we may not have sufficient funds to repay the indebtedness and repurchase the notes or to pay cash upon conversion of the notes.
we and our subsidiaries may be able to incur substantial additional debt in the future, subject to the restrictions contained in our debt instruments, some of which may be secured debt. we are not restricted under the terms of the applicable indenture governing such series of notes from incurring additional debt, securing existing or future debt, recapitalizing our debt or taking a number of other actions that are not limited by the terms of such indenture governing such notes that could have the effect of diminishing our ability to make payments on such notes when due. while the terms of any future indebtedness we may incur could restrict our ability to incur additional indebtedness, any such restrictions will indirectly benefit holders of the applicable series of notes only to the extent any such indebtedness or credit facility is not repaid or does not mature while such notes are outstanding.
risks related to our common stock our actual operating results may differ significantly from our guidance.
from time to time, we have released, and may continue to release, guidance in our quarterly earnings releases, quarterly earnings conference calls, or otherwise, regarding our future performance that represents our management's estimates as of the date of release. this guidance, which includes forward-looking statements, has been and will be based on projections prepared by our
management. these projections are not prepared with a view toward compliance with published guidelines of the american institute of certified public accountants, and neither our registered public accountants nor any other independent expert or outside party compiles or examines the projections. accordingly, no such person expresses any opinion or any other form of assurance with respect to the projections.
projections are based upon a number of assumptions and estimates that, while presented with numerical specificity, are inherently subject to significant business, economic and competitive uncertainties and contingencies, many of which are beyond our control and are based upon specific assumptions with respect to future business decisions, some of which will change. the rapidly evolving market in which we operate may make it difficult to evaluate our current business and our future prospects, including our ability to plan for and model future growth. we intend to state possible outcomes as high and low ranges which are intended to provide a sensitivity analysis as variables are changed. however, actual results will vary from our guidance and the variations may be material. the principal reason that we release guidance is to provide a basis for our management to discuss our business outlook as of the date of release with analysts and investors. we do not accept any responsibility for any projections or reports published by any such persons. investors are urged not to rely upon our guidance in making an investment decision regarding our common stock.
any failure to successfully implement our operating strategy or the occurrence of any of the events or circumstances set forth in this "risk factors" section in this annual report on form 10-k could result in our actual operating results being different from our guidance, and the differences may be adverse and material.
the market price of our common stock historically has been volatile and the value of your investment could decline.
the market price of our common stock has been volatile since our initial public offering ("ipo"). since shares of our common stock were sold in our ipo in july 2012 at a price of $42.00 per share, the reported high and low sales prices of our common stock has ranged from $232.31 to $39.08, through august 30, 2018. the market price of our common stock may fluctuate widely in response to various factors, some of which are beyond our control. these factors include:
•   announcements of new products, subscriptions or technologies, commercial relationships, strategic partnerships, acquisitions or other events by us or our competitors;
•   price and volume fluctuations in the overall stock market from time to time;
•   news announcements that affect investor perception of our industry, including reports related to the discovery of significant cyberattacks;
•   significant volatility in the market price and trading volume of technology companies in general and of companies in our industry;
•   fluctuations in the trading volume of our shares or the size of our public float;
•   actual or anticipated changes in our operating results or fluctuations in our operating results;
•   whether our operating results meet the expectations of securities analysts or investors;
•   actual or anticipated changes in the expectations of securities analysts or investors, whether as a result of our forward- looking statements, our failure to meet such expectations or otherwise;
•   inaccurate or unfavorable research reports about our business and industry published by securities analysts or reduced coverage of our company by securities analysts;
•   regulatory developments in the united states, foreign countries or both;
•   major catastrophic events;
•   sales or repurchases of large blocks of our common stock or substantial future sales by our directors, executive officers, employees and significant stockholders;
•   sales of our common stock by investors who view the notes as a more attractive means of equity participation in us;
•   hedging or arbitrage trading activity involving our common stock as a result of the existence of the notes;
•   departures of key personnel; or
•   economic uncertainty around the world, in particular, macroeconomic challenges in europe.
the market price of our common stock could decline for reasons unrelated to our business, operating results, or financial condition and as a result of events that do not directly affect us. in the past, following periods of volatility in the market price of a
company's securities, securities class action litigation has often been brought against that company. securities litigation could result in substantial costs and divert our management's attention and resources from our business. this could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, and financial condition.
the convertible note hedge and warrant transactions may affect the value of our common stock.
in connection with the sale of each series of notes, we entered into convertible note hedge transactions (the "note hedges") with certain counterparties. in connection with each such sale of the notes, we also entered into warrant transactions with the counterparties pursuant to which we sold warrants (the "warrants") for the purchase of our common stock. the note hedges are expected generally to reduce the potential dilution to our common stock upon any conversion of either series of notes and/or offset any cash payments we are required to make in excess of the principal amount of any such converted notes of the applicable series. the warrants could separately have a dilutive effect to the extent that the market price per share of our common stock exceeds the applicable strike price of the warrants unless, subject to certain conditions, we elect to cash settle such warrants.
the applicable counterparties or their respective affiliates may modify their hedge positions by entering into or unwinding various derivatives with respect to our common stock and/or purchasing or selling our common stock or other securities of ours in secondary market transactions prior to the maturity of the applicable series of notes (and are likely to do so during any applicable observation period related to a conversion of such notes). this activity could also cause or avoid an increase or a decrease in the market price of our common stock or the notes of a series, which could affect a note holder's ability to convert its notes of such series and, to the extent the activity occurs during any observation period related to a conversion of such notes, it could affect the amount and value of the consideration that such note holder will receive upon conversion of such notes of such series.
we do not make any representation or prediction as to the direction or magnitude of any potential effect that the transactions described above may have on the price of either series of notes or our common stock. in addition, we do not make any representation that the counterparties or their respective affiliates will engage in these transactions or that these transactions, once commenced, will not be discontinued without notice.
the issuance of additional stock in connection with financings, acquisitions, investments, our stock incentive plans, the conversion of our notes or exercise of the related warrants, or otherwise will dilute all other stockholders.
our amended and restated certificate of incorporation authorizes us to issue up to 1.0 billion shares of common stock and up to 100.0 million shares of preferred stock with such rights and preferences as may be determined by our board of directors. subject to compliance with applicable rules and regulations, we may issue shares of common stock or securities convertible into shares of our common stock from time to time in connection with a financing, acquisition, investment, our stock incentive plans, the conversion of our notes, the settlement of our warrants, or otherwise. any such issuance could result in substantial dilution to our existing stockholders and cause the market price of our common stock to decline.
we are subject to risks associated with our strategic investments. other-than-temporary impairments in the value of our investments could negatively impact our financial results.
in june 2017, we announced our plans to form the $20.0 million palo alto networks venture fund. the fund is aimed at seed-, early-, and growth-stage security companies with a cloud-based application approach. we may not realize a return on our capital investments. many such private companies generate net losses and the market for their products, services or technologies may be slow to develop, and, therefore, are dependent on the availability of later rounds of financing from banks or investors on favorable terms to continue their operations. the financial success of our investment in any company is typically dependent on a liquidity event, such as a public offering, acquisition or other favorable market event reflecting appreciation to the cost of our initial investment. the capital markets for public offerings and acquisitions are dynamic and the likelihood of liquidity events for the companies we have and intend to invest in could significantly change. further, valuations of privately-held companies are inherently complex due to the lack of readily available market data and as such, the basis for these valuations is subject to the timing and accuracy of the data received from these companies. if we determine that any of our investments in such companies have experienced a decline in value, we may be required to record an other-than-temporary impairment, which could be material and negatively impact our financial results. all of our investments are subject to a risk of a partial or total loss of investment capital.
we do not intend to pay dividends for the foreseeable future.
we have never declared or paid any dividends on our common stock. we intend to retain any earnings to finance the operation and expansion of our business, and we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the future. as a result, you may only receive a return on your investment in our common stock if the market price of our common stock increases.
the requirements of being a public company may strain our resources, divert management's attention, and affect our ability to attract and retain qualified board members.
as a public company, we are subject to the reporting requirements of the exchange act, the sarbanes-oxley act, the dodd-frank act, the listing requirements of the new york stock exchange ("nyse"), and other applicable securities rules and regulations. compliance with these rules and regulations have increased our legal and financial compliance costs, made some activities more difficult, time-consuming or costly, and increased demand on our systems and resources. among other things, the exchange act requires that we file annual, quarterly, and current reports with respect to our business and operating results. in addition, the sarbanes-oxley act requires, among other things, that we maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting. in order to meet the requirements of this standard, significant resources and management oversight may be required. as a result, management's attention may be diverted from other business concerns, which could harm our business and operating results. although we have already hired additional employees to comply with these requirements, we may need to hire even more employees in the future, which will increase our costs and expenses.
in addition, changing laws, regulations, and standards related to corporate governance and public disclosure are creating uncertainty for public companies, increasing legal and financial compliance costs, and making some activities more time-consuming. these laws, regulations, and standards are subject to varying interpretations, in many cases due to their lack of specificity, and, as a result, their application in practice may evolve over time as new guidance is provided by regulatory and governing bodies. this could result in continuing uncertainty regarding compliance matters and higher costs necessitated by ongoing revisions to disclosure and governance practices. we intend to invest resources to comply with evolving laws, regulations, and standards, and this investment may result in increased general and administrative expense and a diversion of management's time and attention from revenue-generating activities to compliance activities. if our efforts to comply with new laws, regulations, and standards differ from the activities intended by regulatory or governing bodies, regulatory authorities may initiate legal proceedings against us and our business may be harmed.
we are obligated to maintain proper and effective internal control over financial reporting. we may not complete our analysis of our internal control over financial reporting in a timely manner, or this internal control may not be determined to be effective, which may adversely affect investor confidence in our company and, as a result, the value of our common stock.
while we were able to determine in our management's report for fiscal 2018 that our internal control over financial reporting is effective, as well as provide an unqualified attestation report from our independent registered public accounting firm to that effect, we may not be able to complete our evaluation, testing, and any required remediation in a timely fashion, may be unable to assert that our internal controls are effective, or our independent registered public accounting firm may not be able to formally attest to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting in the future. in the event that our chief executive officer, chief financial officer, or independent registered public accounting firm determines in the future that our internal control over financial reporting is not effective as defined under section 404, we could be subject to one or more investigations or enforcement actions by state or federal regulatory agencies, stockholder lawsuits or other adverse actions requiring us to incur defense costs, pay fines, settlements or judgments and causing investor perceptions to be adversely affected and potentially resulting in a decline in the market price of our stock.
our charter documents and delaware law, as well as certain provisions contained in the indentures governing the notes, could discourage takeover attempts and lead to management entrenchment, which could also reduce the market price of our common stock.
provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control of our company or changes in our management. our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws include provisions that:
•   establish that our board of directors is divided into three classes, class i, class ii and class iii, with three-year staggered terms;
•   authorize our board of directors to issue shares of preferred stock and to determine the price and other terms of those shares, including preferences and voting rights, without stockholder approval;
•   provide our board of directors with the exclusive right to elect a director to fill a vacancy created by the expansion of our board of directors or the resignation, death or removal of a director;
•   specify that special meetings of our stockholders may be called only by the chairman of our board of directors, our president, our secretary, or a majority vote of our board of directors;
•   require the affirmative vote of holders of at least 66 2/3% of the voting power of all of the then outstanding shares of the voting stock, voting together as a single class, to amend the provisions of our amended and restated certificate of
incorporation relating to the issuance of preferred stock and management of our business or our amended and restated bylaws;
•   authorize our board of directors to amend our bylaws by majority vote; and
•   establish advance notice procedures with which our stockholders must comply to nominate candidates to our board of directors or to propose matters to be acted upon at a stockholders' meeting.
these provisions may frustrate or prevent any attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management by making it more difficult for our stockholders to replace members of our board of directors, which is responsible for appointing the members of management. in addition, as a delaware corporation, we are subject to section 203 of the delaware general corporation law. these provisions may prohibit large stockholders, in particular those owning 15% or more of our outstanding voting stock, from merging or combining with us for a certain period of time. additionally, certain provisions contained in the applicable indenture governing each series of notes could make it more difficult or more expensive for a third party to acquire us. the application of section 203 or certain provisions contained in the applicable indenture governing each series of notes also could have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control of us. any of these provisions could, under certain circumstances, depress the market price of our common stock.
item 7.   management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this annual report on form 10-k. the following discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to risks and uncertainties, which could cause our actual results to differ materially from those anticipated or implied by any forward-looking statements. factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to, those discussed in this annual report on form 10-k, and in particular, the risks discussed under the caption "risk factors" in part i, item 1a of this report.
our management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations ("md&a") is organized as follows:
•   overview. a discussion of our business and overall analysis of financial and other highlights in order to provide context for the remainder of md&amp;a.
•   key financial metrics. a summary of our gaap and non-gaap key financial metrics, which management monitors to evaluate our performance.
•   results of operations. a discussion of the nature and trends in our financial results and an analysis of our financial results comparing fiscal 2018 to 2017 and fiscal 2017 to 2016.
•   liquidity and capital resources. an analysis of changes in our balance sheets and cash flows, and a discussion of our financial condition and our ability to meet cash needs.
•   contractual obligations and commitments. an overview of our contractual obligations, contingent liabilities, commitments, and off-balance sheet arrangements outstanding as of july 31, 2018, including expected payment schedules.
•   critical accounting estimates. a discussion of our accounting policies that require critical estimates, assumptions, and judgments.
•   recent accounting pronouncements. a discussion of expected impacts of impending accounting changes on financial information to be reported in the future.
overview we have pioneered the next generation of security through our innovative security operating platform that empowers enterprises, service providers, and government entities to secure their organizations by safely enabling applications and data running in their networks, on their endpoints, and in the cloud, and by preventing breaches that stem from targeted cyberattacks. our platform uses an innovative traffic classification engine that identifies network traffic by application, user, and content and provides consistent security across the network, endpoint, and cloud. accordingly, our platform enables our end-customers to pursue transformative digital initiatives, like public cloud and mobility, that grow their business, while maintaining the visibility and control needed to protect their valued data and critical control systems. we believe the architecture of our platform offers superior performance compared to legacy approaches and reduces the total cost of ownership for organizations by simplifying their security operations and infrastructure and eliminating the need for multiple, stand-alone hardware and software security products, and consists of four primary security capabilities:
•   security for networks through our next-generation firewalls, available as physical appliances, virtual appliances (called vm-series), or a cloud-delivered service (called globalprotect cloud service) and panorama management delivered as an appliance or as a virtual machine for the public or private cloud.
•   security for endpoints through our traps advanced endpoint protection software, delivered as a light-weight software agent with cloud or on-premise management capabilities.
•   security for the cloud through our vm-series for in-line protection of workloads in public and private clouds, traps for host-based public cloud infrastructure protection, evident for infrastructure monitoring and compliance in public clouds, and aperture for protecting saas applications. these products are delivered as software or saas applications.
•   other security services, such as wildfire, threat prevention, url filtering, and globalprotect subscriptions that are delivered as attached software services to our appliances, as well as applications delivered in connection with our application framework, such as autofocus, magnifier, and logging service that are delivered as saas applications.
for fiscal 2018, 2017, and 2016, total revenue was $2.3 billion, $1.8 billion, and $1.4 billion, respectively, representing year-over-year growth of 29.0% for fiscal 2018 and 27.8% for fiscal 2017. our growth reflects the increased adoption of our hybrid saas revenue model, which consists of product, subscriptions, and support. we believe this model will enable us to benefit from recurring revenues as we continue to grow our installed end-customer base. as of july 31, 2018, we had more than 54,000 end-customers in
over 150 countries. our end-customers represent a broad range of industries including education, energy, financial services, government entities, healthcare, internet and media, manufacturing, public sector, and telecommunications, and include some of the largest fortune 100 and global 2000 companies in the world. we maintain a field sales force that works closely with our channel partners in developing sales opportunities. we use a two-tiered, indirect fulfillment model whereby we sell our products, subscriptions, and support to our distributors, which, in turn, sell to our resellers, which then sell to our end-customers.
our product revenue grew to $871.5 million or 38.3% of total revenue for fiscal 2018, representing year-over-year growth of 22.9%. product revenue is generated from sales of our appliances, primarily our next-generation firewall, which is available in physical and virtualized form. our next-generation firewall incorporates our proprietary pan-os operating system, which provides a consistent set of capabilities across our entire product line. our products are designed for different performance requirements throughout an organization, ranging from our pa-200, which is designed for enterprise remote offices, to our top-of-the-line pa-7080, which is especially suited for very large enterprise deployments and service provider customers. the same firewall functionality that is delivered in our physical appliances is also available in our vm-series virtual firewalls, which secure virtualized and cloud-based computing environments.
our subscription and support revenue grew to $1.4 billion or 61.7% of total revenue for fiscal 2018, representing year-over-year growth of 33.2%. our subscriptions provide our end-customers with real-time access to the latest antivirus, intrusion prevention, web filtering, and modern malware prevention capabilities across the network, endpoints, and the cloud. when end-customers purchase our physical or virtual firewall appliances, they typically purchase support in order to receive ongoing security updates, upgrades, bug fixes, and repairs. in addition to the subscriptions purchased with these appliances, end-customers may also purchase other subscriptions on a per-user, per-endpoint, or capacity-based basis.
we continue to invest in innovation as we evolve and further extend the capabilities of our platform, as we believe that innovation and timely development of new features and products is essential to meeting the needs of our end-customers and improving our competitive position. we introduced several new offerings during fiscal 2018, including:
•   our globalprotect cloud service subscription, which provides our security operating platform as a cloud-based service for remote offices and mobile users;
•   our logging service subscription, which functions as the central cloud-based repository for application data and logs generated by our security offerings, including those of our firewalls and globalprotect cloud service subscription, and allows end-customers to collect data without needing to plan for local processing power and storage;
•   magnifier, a cloud-based subscription that enables organizations to identify and prevent behavior-based threats by applying machine learning to rich network, endpoint, and cloud data;
•   pan-os 8.1, with over 60 new features, and several new models of appliances, including the pa-3200 series, which increase ssl decryption throughput, bring higher performance and capacity for securing large data centers, and provide additional capabilities for managing large firewall deployments; and
•   traps 5.0, which included a cloud-delivered management service and integration with our logging service to allow for the collection of detailed endpoint event data.
we also expanded the capabilities of our platform with extended protections to the gcp and enhanced capabilities for aws and azure environments to enable customers to easily integrate with their cloud infrastructure and workloads in multi-cloud environments. further, in march 2018, we acquired evident.io, which has expanded our api-based security capabilities for the public cloud with the addition of evident.io's cloud services infrastructure protection technology, and, in april 2018, we acquired secdo, which expands the functionality of traps, as well as other capabilities of our platform, by adding endpoint detection and response capabilities, including unique data collection and visualization.
we believe that the growth of our business and our short-term and long-term success are dependent upon many factors, including our ability to extend our technology leadership, grow our base of end-customers, expand deployment of our platform and support offerings within existing end-customers, and focus on end-customer satisfaction. to manage any future growth effectively, we must continue to improve and expand our information technology and financial infrastructure, our operating and administrative systems and controls, and our ability to manage headcount, capital, and processes in an efficient manner. while these areas present significant opportunities for us, they also pose challenges and risks that we must successfully address in order to sustain the growth of our business and improve our operating results. for additional information regarding the challenges and risks we face, see the "risk factors" section in part i, item 1a of this annual report on form 10-k.
key financial metrics we monitor the key financial metrics set forth in the tables below to help us evaluate growth trends, establish budgets, measure the effectiveness of our sales and marketing efforts, and assess operational efficiencies. we discuss revenue, gross margin, and the components of operating loss and margin below under "-results of operations."
operating loss                                         $(129.1    )           $(179.8    )           $(157.3    )
operating margin                                          (5.7   )%             (10.2   )%             (11.4   )%
cash flow provided by operating activities            $1,037.0                 $868.5                 $658.6
•   deferred revenue. our deferred revenue primarily consists of amounts that have been invoiced but have not been recognized as revenue as of the period end. the majority of our deferred revenue balance consists of subscription and support revenue that is recognized ratably over the contractual service period. we monitor our deferred revenue balance because it represents a significant portion of revenue to be recognized in future periods.
•   billings. we define billings as total revenue plus the change in total deferred revenue, net of acquired deferred revenue, during the period. we consider billings to be a key measure used by management to manage our business given our hybrid saas revenue model, and believe billings provides investors with an important indicator of the health and visibility of our business because it includes subscription and support revenue, which is recognized ratably over the contractual service period, and product revenue, which is recognized at the time of shipment, provided that all other revenue recognition criteria have been met. we consider billings to be a useful metric for management and investors, particularly if we continue to experience increased sales of subscriptions and strong renewal rates for subscription and support offerings, and as we monitor our near term cash flows. while we believe that billings provides useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating our operating results in the same manner as our management, it is important to note that other companies, including companies in our industry, may not use billings, may calculate billings differently, may have different billing frequencies, or may use other financial measures to evaluate their performance, all of which could reduce the usefulness of billings as a comparative measure. we calculate billings in the following manner:
add: change in total deferred revenue, net of acquired deferred revenue         587.1       531.8                 527.1
•   cash flow provided by operating activities. we monitor cash flow provided by operating activities as a measure of our overall business performance. our cash flow provided by operating activities is driven in large part by sales of our products and from up-front payments for subscription and support offerings. monitoring cash flow provided by operating
activities enables us to analyze our financial performance without the non-cash effects of certain items such as depreciation, amortization, and share-based compensation costs, thereby allowing us to better understand and manage the cash needs of our business.
•   free cash flow (non-gaap). we define free cash flow, a non-gaap financial measure, as cash provided by operating activities less purchases of property, equipment, and other assets. we consider free cash flow to be a profitability and liquidity measure that provides useful information to management and investors about the amount of cash generated by the business after necessary capital expenditures. a limitation of the utility of free cash flow as a measure of our financial performance and liquidity is that it does not represent the total increase or decrease in our cash balance for the period. in addition, it is important to note that other companies, including companies in our industry, may not use free cash flow, may calculate free cash flow in a different manner than we do, or may use other financial measures to evaluate their performance, all of which could reduce the usefulness of free cash flow as a comparative measure. a reconciliation of free cash flow to cash flow provided by operating activities, the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with gaap, is provided below:
net cash provided by operating activities                     $1,037.0           $868.5                 $658.6
less: purchases of property, equipment, and other assets         112.0       163.4               72.5

revenue our revenue consists of product revenue and subscription and support revenue. revenue is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, the fee is fixed or determinable, and collectability is reasonably assured. we expect our revenue to vary from quarter to quarter based on seasonal and cyclical factors.
product revenue product revenue is derived primarily from sales of our appliances. product revenue also includes revenue derived from software licenses of panorama and the vm-series. we recognize product revenue at the time of shipment, provided that all other revenue recognition criteria have been met.

product revenue increased year-over-year for both fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2017 due to increased demand for our newly introduced appliances. the change in product revenue due to pricing was not significant for either period.
subscription and support revenue subscription and support revenue is derived primarily from sales of our subscription and support offerings. our contractual subscription and support terms are typically one to five years. we recognize revenue from subscriptions and support over the contractual service period. as a percentage of total revenue, we expect our subscription and support revenue to vary from quarter to quarter and increase over the long term as we introduce new subscriptions, renew existing subscription and support contracts, and expand our installed end-customer base. prior to fiscal 2017, subscription and support revenue was referred to as services revenue. the composition of subscription and support revenue has not been modified.

with respect to geographic theaters, the americas contributed the largest portion of the year-over-year increases in revenue for both fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2017 due to its larger and more established sales force compared to our other theaters. revenue from both emea and apac increased year-over-year for both fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2017 due to our investment in increasing the size of our sales force and number of channel partners in these theaters.
cost of revenue our cost of revenue consists of cost of product revenue and cost of subscription and support revenue.
cost of product revenue cost of product revenue primarily includes costs paid to our manufacturing partners. our cost of product revenue also includes personnel costs, which consist of salaries, benefits, bonuses, share-based compensation, and travel and entertainment associated with our operations organization, amortization of intellectual property licenses, product testing costs, shipping costs, and allocated costs. allocated costs consist of certain facilities, depreciation, benefits, recruiting, and information technology costs that we allocate based on headcount. we expect our cost of product revenue to increase as our product revenue increases.

cost of product revenue increased year-over-year for both fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2017 primarily due to higher product costs related to our newly introduced appliances.
cost of subscription and support revenue cost of subscription and support revenue includes personnel costs for our global customer support and technical operations organizations, customer support and repair costs, third-party professional services costs, data center and cloud hosting costs, amortization of acquired intangible assets, and allocated costs. we expect our cost of subscription and support revenue to increase as our installed end-customer base grows and adoption of our cloud-based subscription offerings increases. prior to fiscal 2017, cost of subscription and support revenue was referred to as cost of services revenue. the composition of cost of subscription and support revenue has not been modified.

cost of subscription and support revenue increased for fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017 primarily due to an increase in personnel costs for our global customer support and technical operations organizations, which grew $53.5 million to $208.9 million, primarily due to headcount growth. the remaining increase was primarily due to data center and cloud hosting costs to support the adoption of our cloud-based subscription offerings, costs to expand our customer service capabilities, and allocated costs. the increase in allocated costs was primarily due to our expansion of facilities to support the growth of our business.
cost of subscription and support revenue increased for fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016 primarily due to an increase in personnel costs, which grew $45.3 million to $155.4 million, largely due to headcount growth. the remaining increase was primarily driven by costs to expand our customer service capabilities and infrastructure, customer support and repair costs, and allocated costs. the increase in allocated costs was primarily due to our expansion of facilities to support the growth of our business.
gross margin gross margin, or gross profit as a percentage of revenue, has been and will continue to be affected by a variety of factors, including the introduction of new products, manufacturing costs, the average sales price of our products, the mix of products sold, and the mix of revenue between product and subscription and support offerings. for sales of our products, our higher-end firewall products generally have higher gross margins than our lower-end firewall products within each product series. for sales of our subscription and support offerings, our subscription offerings typically have higher gross margins than our support offerings. we expect our gross margins to fluctuate over time depending on the factors described above.

subscription and support gross margin decreased slightly for fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017, primarily due to higher data center and cloud hosting costs to support the adoption of our cloud-based subscription offerings and costs to expand our customer service capabilities, partially offset by a decrease in customer support and repair costs. subscription and support gross margin increased for fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016 due to contributions from our higher margin subscription offerings.
operating expenses our operating expenses consist of research and development, sales and marketing, and general and administrative expense. personnel costs are the most significant component of operating expenses and consist of salaries, benefits, bonuses, share-based compensation, travel and entertainment, and with regard to sales and marketing expense, sales commissions. our operating expenses also include allocated costs, which consist of certain facilities, depreciation, benefits, recruiting, and information technology costs that we allocate based on headcount. we expect operating expenses to increase in absolute dollars and decrease over the long term as a percentage of revenue as we continue to scale our business. as of july 31, 2018, we expect to recognize approximately $1.1 billion of share-based compensation expense over a weighted-average period of approximately 3.0 years, excluding additional share-based compensation expense related to any future grants of share-based awards. share-based compensation expense is generally recognized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service periods of the awards.
research and development research and development expense consists primarily of personnel costs. research and development expense also includes prototype related expenses and allocated costs. we expect research and development expense to increase in absolute dollars as we continue to invest in our future products and services, although our research and development expense may fluctuate as a percentage of total revenue.

research and development expense increased year-over-year for both fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2017. the increase in both periods was primarily due to an increase in personnel costs, which grew $36.8 million to $330.9 million for fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017 and grew $46.4 million to $286.0 million for fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016. the increases in personnel costs in both periods were primarily due to headcount growth. the remaining increase for fiscal 2018 was primarily driven by an increase in allocated costs due to our expansion of facilities to support the growth of our business. the remaining increase for fiscal 2017 was primarily driven by an increase in allocated costs, due to our expansion of facilities to support the growth of our business, and development costs related to investments in our new and future offerings.
sales and marketing sales and marketing expense consists primarily of personnel costs, including commission expense. sales and marketing expense also includes costs for market development programs, promotional and other marketing costs, professional services, and allocated costs. we continue to thoughtfully invest in headcount and have substantially grown our sales presence internationally. we expect sales and marketing expense to continue to increase in absolute dollars as we increase the size of our sales and marketing organizations to increase touch points with end-customers and to expand our international presence, although our sales and marketing expense may fluctuate as a percentage of total revenue.

sales and marketing expense increased year-over-year for both fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2017. the increase in both periods was primarily due to an increase in personnel costs, which grew $137.7 million to $853.8 million for fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017 and grew $145.0 million to $716.1 million for fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016. the increases in personnel costs in both periods were primarily due to headcount growth. the remaining increase for fiscal 2018 was primarily driven by an increase in allocated costs due to our expansion of facilities to support the growth of our business. the remaining increase for fiscal 2017 was primarily driven by an increase in allocated costs, due to our expansion of facilities to support the growth of our business, and an increase in demand generation activities and sales related events to support our revenue growth.
general and administrative general and administrative expense consists primarily of personnel costs for our executive, finance, human resources, legal, and information technology organizations, and professional services costs, which consist primarily of legal, auditing, accounting, and other consulting costs. general and administrative expense also includes certain non-recurring general expenses and impairment losses. certain facilities, depreciation, benefits, recruiting, and information technology costs are allocated to other organizations based on headcount. we expect general and administrative expense to increase in absolute dollars due to additional costs associated with accounting, compliance, and insurance, although our general and administrative expense may fluctuate as a percentage of total revenue.

general and administrative expense increased for fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017 primarily due to a cease-use loss of $39.2 million recognized on the lease of our previous headquarter facilities during fiscal 2018. refer to note 9. commitments and contingencies in part ii, item 8 of this annual report on form 10-k for more information. the remaining increase was primarily driven by costs related to business acquisitions completed during fiscal 2018, an increase in personnel costs, and increase in allocated costs due to our expansion of facilities to support the growth of our business. personnel costs grew $10.2 million to $138.7 million for fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017, largely due to headcount growth. these increases were partially offset by a decrease in impairment losses due to the $20.9 million loss recognized in fiscal 2017 on property and equipment related to the relocation of our corporate headquarters.
general and administrative expense increased for fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016 primarily due to an increase in personnel costs, which grew $29.3 million to $128.1 million, largely due to headcount growth, and a fiscal 2017 impairment loss of $20.9 million on property and equipment related to the relocation of our corporate headquarters. the remaining increase for fiscal 2017 was primarily driven by an increase in allocated costs due to our expansion of facilities to support the growth of our business.
interest expense interest expense primarily consists of non-cash interest expense from the amortization of the debt discount and debt issuance costs related to our 2019 notes and 2023 notes, and also includes the contractual interest expense related to our 2023 notes.

interest expense increased for fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017 primarily due to interest expense recognized on the 2023 notes issued in july 2018. we expect interest expense to increase in fiscal 2019 due to interest expense to be incurred on the 2023 notes, partially offset by a reduction in interest expense on the 2019 notes due to conversions before or upon maturity. interest expense recognized in fiscal 2017 and fiscal 2016 was primarily related to the 2019 notes. refer to note 8. convertible senior notes in part ii, item 8 of this annual report on form 10-k for more information on the notes.

other income, net increased for fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017 primarily driven by a $12.4 million increase in interest income, largely due to higher cash, cash equivalents, and investments balances and higher yields on these balances during fiscal 2018, and an increase in foreign currency remeasurement gains. other income, net increased for fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016 due to an increase in interest income, partially offset by increased foreign currency remeasurement losses.
provision for income taxes provision for income taxes consists primarily of income taxes in foreign jurisdictions in which we conduct business, withholding taxes, u.s. state income taxes, and amortization of our deferred tax charges. we maintain a full valuation allowance for domestic and certain foreign deferred tax assets, including net operating loss carryforwards and certain domestic tax credits. in recent years, we reorganized our corporate structure and intercompany relationships to more closely align with the international nature of our business activities. our corporate structure has caused, and may continue to cause, disproportionate relationships between our overall effective tax rate and other jurisdictional measures. to the extent we revisit our corporate structure, it may have an impact on our tax provision.
on december 22, 2017, the tax cuts and jobs act ("tcja") was enacted into law. the tcja provides for significant tax law changes and modifications including, but not limited to, the reduction of the u.s. federal corporate statutory tax rate from 35% to 21%
as of january 1, 2018, the requirement for companies to pay a one-time transition tax on earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries that were previously tax deferred, and the creation of new taxes on certain foreign-sourced earnings. as a fiscal year-end taxpayer, certain provisions of the tcja began to impact us during the three months ended january 31, 2018, while other provisions will impact us beginning in our fiscal year ending july 31, 2019.
2018                                        2017                   change                          2017               2016                   change amount              amount            amount             %                amount              amount            amount              %
we recorded an income tax provision for fiscal 2018 due to foreign income taxes, withholding taxes, and amortization of our deferred tax charges. the provision for income taxes decreased for fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017 primarily due to changes in valuation allowance related to the acquisition of evident.io and future benefits from alternative minimum tax credits under the tcja.
during the year ended july 31, 2018, we recognized provisional amounts for the tax effects of the tcja which were included as components of income tax expense and reflected in the effective tax rates above. we will continue to assess the impact of the tcja on our business and our consolidated financial statements, however, the final impact of the tcja may differ from the provisional amounts due to a number of uncertainties and factors, including the need for further guidance and clarification of the new law by u.s. federal and state tax authorities, and the need for further guidance on the related income tax accounting. refer to note 12. income taxes in part ii, item 8 of this annual report on form 10-k for more information on the tcja and its expected impact.
we recorded an income tax provision for fiscal 2017 due to foreign income taxes, withholding taxes, and amortization of our deferred tax charges. the provision for income taxes increased for fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016 primarily due to increases in foreign withholding taxes and u.s. income taxes related to intercompany transactions, offset by tax benefits from our adoption of new share-based payment accounting guidance in fiscal 2017.
liquidity and capital resources july 31,
working capital(1)                                 $1,992.6                $775.0
(1)   the net carrying amount of the 2019 notes was classified in current liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets as of july 31, 2018. refer to note 8. convertible senior notes in part ii, item 8 of this annual report on form 10-k for information on the notes.
as of july 31, 2018, our total cash, cash equivalents, and investments of $4.0 billion were held for general corporate purposes, of which approximately $271.4 million was held outside of the united states. as of july 31, 2018, we had no unremitted earnings when evaluating our outside basis difference relating to our u.s. investment in foreign subsidiaries. however, there could be local withholding taxes payable due to various foreign countries if certain lower tier earnings are distributed. withholding taxes that would be payable upon remittance of these lower tier earnings were not material as of july 31, 2018.
in june 2014, we issued the 2019 notes with an aggregate principal amount of $575.0 million and in july 2018, we issued the 2023 notes with an aggregate principal amount of $1.7 billion. as of july 31, 2018, all of the outstanding aggregate principal amount of the notes of each series remained outstanding. the 2019 notes and the 2023 notes mature on july 1, 2019 and july 1, 2023, respectively; however, under certain circumstances, holders may surrender their notes of a series for conversion prior to the applicable maturity dates. upon conversion of the notes of a series, we will pay cash equal to the aggregate principal amount of the notes of such series to be converted, and, at our election, will pay or deliver cash and/or shares of our common stock for the amount of our conversion obligation in excess of the aggregate principal amount of the notes of such series being converted. refer to note 8.
convertible senior notes in part ii, item 8 of this annual report on form 10-k for more information on the notes. subsequent to july 31, 2018, through the filing date of this annual report on form 10-k, $327.3 million in principal amount of the 2019 notes was converted or had been submitted by the holders for conversion and will settle during the fiscal quarter ending october 31, 2018.
on september 4, 2018, we entered into a credit agreement (the "credit agreement") that provides for a $400.0 million unsecured revolving credit facility, with an option to increase the amount of the credit facility up to an additional $350.0 million, subject to certain conditions. refer to note 18. subsequent event in part ii, item 8 of this annual report on form 10-k for more information on the credit agreement.
in august 2016, our board of directors authorized a $500.0 million share repurchase and, in february 2017, authorized a $500.0 million increase to the repurchase program, bringing the total authorization to $1.0 billion. repurchases are funded from available working capital and may be made at management's discretion from time to time. the repurchase authorization will expire on december 31, 2018, and may be suspended or discontinued at any time. as of july 31, 2018, $330.0 million was available for future share repurchases under the repurchase authorization. refer to note 10. stockholders' equity in part ii, item 8 of this annual report on form 10-k for information on the repurchase authorization.
net cash provided by operating activities                $1,037.0              $868.5              $658.6
we believe that our cash flow from operations with existing cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs for the foreseeable future. our future capital requirements will depend on many factors including our growth rate, the timing and extent of spending to support development efforts, the expansion of sales and marketing activities, the introduction of new and enhanced products and subscription and support offerings, the costs to acquire or invest in complementary businesses and technologies, the costs to ensure access to adequate manufacturing capacity, the investments in our infrastructure to support the adoption of our cloud-based subscription offerings, the investments in our new corporate headquarters, and the continuing market acceptance of our products and subscription and support offerings. in addition, from time to time we may incur additional tax liability in connection with certain corporate structuring decisions.
we may also choose to seek additional equity or debt financing. in the event that additional financing is required from outside sources, we may not be able to raise it on terms acceptable to us or at all. if we are unable to raise additional capital when desired, our business, operating results, and financial condition may be adversely affected.
operating activities our operating activities have consisted of net losses adjusted for certain non-cash items and changes in assets and liabilities.
cash provided by operating activities in fiscal 2018 was $1,037.0 million, an increase of $168.5 million compared to fiscal 2017. the increase was due to growth of our business, as reflected by an increase in billings during fiscal 2018.
cash provided by operating activities in fiscal 2017 was $868.5 million, an increase of $209.9 million compared to fiscal 2016. the increase was due to growth of our business, as reflected by an increase in billings, and an increase in collections on accounts receivable during fiscal 2017.
investing activities our investing activities have consisted of capital expenditures, net investment purchases, sales, and maturities, and business acquisitions. we expect to continue such activities as our business grows.
cash used in investing activities during fiscal 2018 was $520.0 million, an increase of $47.4 million compared to fiscal 2017, due to an increase in net cash payments for acquisitions, partially offset by lower net purchases of available-for-sale investments and capital expenditures.
cash used in investing activities during fiscal 2017 was $472.6 million, an increase of $133.7 million compared to fiscal 2016, due to increased investment in facilities to support the growth of our business and a net cash payment of $90.7 million for our acquisition of lightcyber, partially offset by lower net purchases of available-for-sale investments during fiscal 2017.
financing activities our financing activities have consisted of net proceeds from the issuance of the notes and related transactions, proceeds from sales of shares through employee equity incentive plans, cash used to repurchase shares of our common stock, and payments for tax withholding obligations of certain employees related to the net share settlement of equity awards.
cash provided by financing activities during fiscal 2018 was $1,245.6 million, an increase of $1,631.6 million compared to fiscal 2017. the increase was mainly due to net proceeds of $1,495.8 million from the issuance of the 2023 notes, issuance of warrants, and purchase of note hedges, partially offset by an increase in payments for tax withholding obligations of certain employees related to the net share settlement of equity awards during fiscal 2018.
cash used in financing activities during fiscal 2017 was $386.0 million, a change of $424.9 million compared to fiscal 2016, due to the repurchase of $411.0 million of our common stock and payments for tax withholding obligations of certain employees related to the net share settlement of equity awards of $21.4 million during fiscal 2017.
contractual obligations and commitments the following summarizes our contractual obligations and commitments as of july 31, 2018:
operating lease obligations(2)                    540.6                66.3         132.2                 118.3                   223.8
(1)   as of july 31, 2018, holders may convert their 2019 notes at any time during the fiscal quarter ending october 31, 2018. refer to note 8. convertible senior notes in part ii, item 8 of this annual report on form 10-k for more information.
(2)   consists of contractual obligations from our non-cancelable operating leases. excludes contractual sublease proceeds of $14.0 million, which consists of $5.0 million to be received in less than one year, and $9.0 million to be received in one to three years. refer to note 9. commitments and contingencies in part ii, item 8 of this annual report on form 10-k for more information on our operating leases.
(3)   consists of minimum purchase commitments of products and components with our manufacturing partners and component suppliers, as well as minimum purchase commitments for our use of certain cloud services with a third-party provider. obligations under contracts that we can cancel without a significant penalty are not included in the table above.
(4)   no amounts related to income taxes are included. as of july 31, 2018, we had approximately $78.9 million of tax liabilities recorded related to uncertainty in income tax positions.
off-balance sheet arrangements as of july 31, 2018, we did not have any relationships with unconsolidated organizations or financial partnerships, such as structured finance or special purpose entities that would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes.
critical accounting estimates our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with gaap. the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, expenses, and related disclosures. we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances. we evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis. actual results may differ from these estimates. to the extent that there are material differences between these estimates and our actual results, our future financial statements will be affected.
we believe that of our significant accounting policies described in note 1. description of business and summary of significant accounting policies in part ii, item 8 of this annual report on form 10-k, the critical accounting policies requiring estimates, assumptions, and judgments that have the most significant impact on our consolidated financial statements are described below.
revenue recognition we recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, the fee is fixed or determinable, and collectability is reasonably assured. most of our arrangements, other than renewals of subscriptions and support contracts, are multiple-element arrangements with a combination of hardware, software, subscriptions, support, and other services. for multiple-element arrangements, we allocate revenue to each unit of accounting based on an estimated selling price at the arrangement inception. the estimated selling price for each element is based upon the following hierarchy:
•   vendor-specific objective evidence ("vsoe") of selling price, if available,
•   third-party evidence ("tpe") of selling price, if vsoe of selling price is not available, or
•   best estimate of selling price ("besp"), if neither vsoe of selling price nor tpe of selling price are available.
we establish vsoe of selling price using the prices charged for a deliverable when sold separately. we establish tpe of selling price by evaluating similar and interchangeable competitor products or services in standalone arrangements with similarly situated partners. we establish besp primarily based on historical transaction pricing, whereby historical transactions are segregated based on our pricing model and our go-to-market strategy, which include factors such as type of sales channel (reseller, distributor, or end-customer), the geographies in which our products and services were sold (domestic or international), and offering type (products or services). to further support besp as determined by the historical transaction pricing or when such information is unavailable, such as when there are limited sales of a new product or service, we consider the same factors we have established through our pricing model and go-to-market strategy. the determination of besp is made through consultation with and approval by our management. in determining besp, we rely on certain assumptions and apply significant judgment. as our business offerings evolve over time, we may be required to modify our estimated selling prices in subsequent periods, and the timing of our revenue recognition could be affected.
income taxes we account for income taxes using the asset and liability method, which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns. in addition, deferred tax assets are recorded for the future benefit of utilizing net operating losses and research and development credit carryforwards. valuation allowances are provided when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized.
significant judgment is required in determining any valuation allowance recorded against deferred tax assets. in assessing the need for a valuation allowance, we consider all available evidence, including past operating results, estimates of future taxable income, and the feasibility of tax planning strategies. in the event that we change our determination as to the amount of deferred tax assets that can be realized, we will adjust our valuation allowance with a corresponding impact to the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made.
we apply the authoritative accounting guidance prescribing a threshold and measurement attribute for the financial recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. we recognize liabilities for uncertain tax positions based on a two-step process. the first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit, including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes, if any. the second step requires us to estimate and measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more likely than not to be realized upon ultimate settlement.
significant judgment is also required in evaluating our uncertain tax positions and determining our provision for income taxes. although we believe our reserves are reasonable, no assurance can be given that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be different from that which is reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals. we adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the closing of a tax audit or the refinement of an estimate. to the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters is different than the amounts recorded, such differences may impact the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made.
accounting standards require companies to recognize the effect of tax law changes in the period of enactment. however, the sec staff and fasb issued guidance that allows companies to record provisional amounts for the effects of the tcja during a measurement period not to extend beyond one year from the enactment date. in accordance with this guidance, we have determined the amounts recorded and positions taken, as discussed, are provisional as of july 31, 2018. we continue to assess the impacts of the tcja, and the final impact of the tcja recorded by us may differ from the provisional amounts due to a number of uncertainties and factors, including the need for further guidance and clarification of the new law by u.s. federal and state tax authorities, and the need for further guidance on the related income tax accounting.
manufacturing partner and supplier liabilities we outsource most of our manufacturing, repair, and supply chain management operations to our ems provider, which procures components and assembles our products based on our demand forecasts. these forecasts of future demand are based upon historical trends and analysis from our sales and product management functions as adjusted for overall market conditions. we accrue for costs for manufacturing purchase commitments in excess of our forecasted demand, including costs for excess components or for carrying costs incurred by our manufacturing partners and component suppliers. actual component usage and product demand may be materially different from our forecast, and could be caused by factors outside of our control, which could have an adverse impact on our results of operations. to date, we have not accrued significant costs associated with this exposure.
loss contingencies we are subject to the possibility of various loss contingencies arising in the ordinary course of business. we accrue for loss contingencies when it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. if we determine that a loss is possible and the range of the loss can be reasonably determined, then we disclose the range of the possible loss. we regularly evaluate current information available to us to determine whether an accrual is required, an accrual should be adjusted or a range of possible loss should be disclosed.
from time to time, we are involved in disputes, litigation, and other legal actions. however, there are many uncertainties associated with any litigation, and these actions or other third-party claims against us may cause us to incur substantial settlement charges, which are inherently difficult to estimate and could adversely affect our results of operations. the actual liability in any such matters may be materially different from our estimates, which could result in the need to adjust our liability and record additional expenses.
goodwill, intangibles, and other long-lived assets we make significant estimates, assumptions, and judgments when valuing goodwill and other purchased intangible assets in connection with the initial purchase price allocation of an acquired entity, as well as when evaluating impairment of goodwill and other purchased intangible assets on an ongoing basis. these estimates are based upon a number of factors, including historical experience, market conditions, and information obtained from the management of the acquired company. critical estimates in valuing certain intangible assets include, but are not limited to, cash flows that an asset is expected to generate in the future, discount rates, the time and expense that would be necessary to recreate the assets, and the profit margin a market participant would receive. the amounts and useful lives assigned to identified intangible assets impacts the amount and timing of future amortization expense.
we evaluate goodwill for impairment on an annual basis in our fourth fiscal quarter or more frequently if we believe impairment indicators exist. we have elected to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of our reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, including goodwill. the qualitative assessment includes our evaluation of relevant events and circumstances affecting our single reporting unit, including macroeconomic, industry, and market conditions, our overall financial performance, and trends in the market price of our common stock. if qualitative factors indicate that it is more likely than not that our reporting unit's fair value is less than its carrying amount, then we will perform the quantitative impairment test by comparing our reporting unit's carrying amount, including goodwill, to its fair value. if the carrying amount of our reporting unit exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss will be recognized in an amount equal to that excess. to date, the results of our qualitative assessment have indicated that the quantitative goodwill impairment test is not necessary.
we evaluate long-lived assets, such as property, equipment, and purchased intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable. such events or changes in circumstances include, but are not limited to, a significant decrease in the fair value of the underlying asset or asset group, a significant decrease in the benefits realized from the acquired assets, difficulty and delays in integrating the business, or a significant change in the operations of the acquired assets or use of an asset or asset group. a long-lived asset is considered impaired if its carrying amount exceeds the estimated future undiscounted cash flows the asset or asset group is expected to generate. critical estimates in determining whether a long-lived asset is considered impaired include the amount and timing of future cash flows that the asset or asset group is expected to generate. if a long-lived asset is considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized is the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset or asset group, which is estimated using a present value technique. critical estimates in determining the fair value of an asset or asset group and the amount of impairment to recognize include, but are not limited to, the amount and timing of future cash flows that the asset or asset group is expected to generate and the discount rate. determining the fair value of an asset or asset group is highly judgmental in nature and involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions for market participants. we base our fair value estimates on assumptions we believe to be reasonable but that are unpredictable and inherently uncertain. actual future results may differ from those estimates.
cease-use loss upon exiting a leased property before the lease term expires, we assess the fair value of our remaining obligation under the lease and record a cease-use loss, if needed. the cease-use loss is calculated as the present value of the amount by which the remaining lease obligation, adjusted for the effects of any deferred items recognized under the lease and related costs, exceeds the estimated sublease rentals that could be reasonably obtained. the key assumptions used in our discounted cash flow model include the amount and timing of estimated sublease rental receipts and the discount rate. the cease-use loss recorded or to be recorded may change significantly as a result of the remeasurement of the cease-use liability, if the timing or amount of estimated cash flows change.
recent accounting pronouncements refer to "recently issued accounting pronouncements" in note 1. description of business and summary of significant accounting policies in part ii, item 8 of this annual report on form 10-k for a description of recent accounting pronouncements and our expectation of their impact, if any, on our results of operations and financial condition.

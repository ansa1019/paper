item 1a.   risk factors investors should review carefully the following material risk factors and the other information contained in this report. the risks that the ameren companies face are not limited to those in this section. there may be further risks and uncertainties that are not presently known or that are not currently believed to be material that may adversely affect the results of operations, financial position, and liquidity of the ameren companies.
regulatory and legislative risks we are subject to extensive regulation of our businesses, which could adversely affect our results of operations, financial position, and liquidity.
we are subject to federal, state, and local regulation. our extensive regulatory frameworks, some of which are more specifically identified in the following risk factors, regulate, among other matters, the electric and natural gas utility industries; the rate and cost structure of utilities; the operation of nuclear power plants; the construction and operation of generation, transmission, and distribution facilities; the acquisition, disposal, depreciation and amortization of assets and facilities; the electric transmission system reliability; and wholesale and retail competition. in the planning and management of our operations, we must address the effects of existing and proposed laws and regulations and potential changes in our regulatory frameworks, including initiatives by federal and state legislatures, rtos, utility regulators, and taxing authorities. significant changes in the nature of the regulation of our businesses could require changes to our business planning and management of our businesses and could adversely affect our results of operations, financial position, and liquidity. failure to obtain adequate rates or regulatory approvals in a timely manner; failure to obtain necessary licenses or permits from regulatory authorities; the impact of new or modified laws, regulations, standards, interpretations, or other legal requirements; or increased compliance costs could adversely affect our results of operations, financial position, and liquidity.
the electric and natural gas rates that we are allowed to charge are determined through regulatory proceedings, which are subject to intervention and appeal. rates are also subject to legislative actions, which are largely outside of our control. any events that prevent us from recovering our costs in a timely manner or from earning adequate returns on our investments could adversely affect our results of operations, financial position, and liquidity.
the rates that we are allowed to charge for our utility services significantly influence our results of operations, financial position, and liquidity. the electric and natural gas utility industry is highly regulated. the utility rates charged to customers are determined by governmental entities, including the mopsc, the icc, and the ferc. decisions by these entities are influenced by many factors, including the cost of providing service, the prudency of expenditures, the quality of service, regulatory staff knowledge and experience, customer intervention, and economic conditions, as well as social and political views. decisions made by these governmental entities regarding rates are largely outside of our control. we are exposed to regulatory lag and cost disallowances to varying degrees by jurisdiction, which, if unmitigated, could adversely affect our results of operations, financial position, and liquidity. rate orders are also subject to appeal, which creates additional uncertainty as to the rates that we will ultimately be allowed to charge for our services. from time to time, our regulators may approve trackers, riders, or other mechanisms that allow electric or natural gas rates to be adjusted without a traditional rate proceeding. these mechanisms could be changed or terminated.
historical costs and revenues. ameren illinois' natural gas rates established in those proceedings are based on estimated future costs and revenues. thus, the rates that we are allowed to charge for utility services may not match our actual costs at any given time.
rates include an allowed rate of return on investments established by the regulator, including a return on invested capital, both debt and equity, and an amount for income taxes. although rate regulation is premised on providing an opportunity to earn a reasonable rate of return on invested capital, there can be no assurance that the regulator will determine that our costs were prudently incurred or that the regulatory process will result in rates that will produce full recovery of such costs or provide for an opportunity to earn a reasonable return on those investments. ameren missouri and ameren illinois, and the utility industry generally, have an increased need for cost recovery, primarily driven by capital investments, which is likely to continue in the future. the resulting increase to the revenue requirement needed to recover such costs and earn a return on investments could result in more frequent regulatory rate reviews and requests for cost recovery mechanisms. additionally, increasing rates could result in regulatory or legislative actions, as well as competitive or political pressures, all of which could adversely affect our results of operations, financial position, and liquidity.
as a result of its participation in performance-based formula ratemaking, ameren illinois' return on equity for its electric distribution service and its electric energy-efficiency investments is directly correlated to yields on united states treasury bonds. additionally, ameren illinois is required to achieve certain performance standards. failure to meet these requirements could adversely affect ameren's and ameren illinois' results of operations, financial position, and liquidity.
ameren illinois participates in a performance-based formula ratemaking framework established pursuant to the ieima for its electric distribution service. ameren illinois is allowed to recover its electric distribution revenue requirement for a given year, independent of actual sales volumes. ameren illinois also has an electric energy-efficiency program rider, which includes a return on its program investments that is subject to performance-based formula ratemaking. the icc annually reviews ameren illinois' rate filings for reasonableness and prudency. if the icc were to conclude that ameren illinois' costs were not prudently incurred, the icc would disallow recovery of such costs. the electric distribution service performance-based formula ratemaking framework expires at the end of 2022, while the decoupling provisions extend beyond the end of formula ratemaking by law. ameren illinois would then be required to establish future rates through a traditional rate proceeding with the icc, which might result in rates that do not produce a full or timely recovery of costs or provide for an adequate return on investments and would expose ameren illinois' electric distribution business to the risks described in the immediately preceding risk factor.
the return on equity component under both formula ratemaking recovery mechanisms is equal to the annual average of the monthly yields of the 30-year united states treasury bonds plus 580 basis points. therefore, ameren illinois' annual return on equity for its electric distribution business is directly correlated to the yields on such bonds, which are outside of ameren illinois' control. with respect to electric distribution service, a 50 basis point change in the annual average of the monthly yields of the 30-year united states treasury bonds would result in an estimated $8 million change in ameren's and ameren illinois' net income, based on its 2019 projected rate base.
ameren illinois is also subject to performance standards. failure to achieve the standards would result in a reduction in the company's allowed return on equity calculated under the ratemaking formulas. the performance standards applicable to electric distribution service include improvements in service reliability to reduce both the frequency and duration of outages, a reduction in the number of estimated bills, a reduction of consumption from inactive meters, and a reduction in bad debt expense. the electric distribution service regulatory framework provides for return on equity penalties up to 38 basis points in each year from 2019 through 2022, if these performance standards are not met. beginning in 2018, the rider for electric energy-efficiency investments provides for increases or decreases of up to 200 basis points to the return on equity. any adjustments to the return on equity for energy-efficiency investments will depend on annual performance of a historical period relative to energy savings goals. in 2018, there were no performance-related basis point adjustments.
ameren illinois plans to invest approximately $100 million per year in electric energy-efficiency programs through 2023, consistent with targets established by the feja. the icc has the ability to reduce electric energy-efficiency savings goals if there are insufficient cost-effective programs available or if the savings goals would require investment levels that exceed amounts allowed by legislation.
as a result of pisa, ameren missouri's electric rates are subject to a rate cap. failure to align capital investments and expenses under the rate cap will adversely affect ameren's and ameren missouri's results of operations, financial position, and liquidity.
as a result of ameren missouri's decision to participate in pisa, its rate increases are limited to a 2.85% compound annual growth rate in the average overall customer rate per kilowatthour, based on the electric rates that became effective in april 2017, less half of the annual savings from the tcja that was passed on to customers as approved in the july 2018 mopsc order. additionally, ameren missouri's electric base rates, as determined in the july 2018 mopsc order, are frozen until april 1, 2020. customer rates under the meeia, the fac, and the resram riders have not been frozen. if rate changes from the fac or the resram riders would cause rates to temporarily exceed the 2.85% rate cap, the overage would be deferred for future recovery in the next regulatory rate review; however, rates established in such regulatory rate review will be subject to the rate cap. any deferred overages approved for recovery will be recovered in a manner consistent with costs recovered under pisa. increased capital investments and operating costs could cause customer rates to exceed the rate cap. excluding customer rates under the meeia rider, which are not subject to the rate cap, ameren missouri would incur a penalty equal to the
amount of deferred overage that would cause customer rates to exceed the 2.85% rate cap. a penalty incurred as the result of exceeding the rate cap could adversely affect ameren's and ameren missouri's results of operations, financial position, and liquidity.
both the rate cap and pisa election are effective through december 2023, unless ameren missouri requests and receives mopsc approval of an extension through december 2028.
ameren and ameren illinois may not realize the expected return on their electric transmission investments, which could adversely affect their results of operations, financial position, and liquidity.
ameren, through atxi and ameren illinois, is investing significant capital resources in electric transmission. these investments are based on the ferc's regulatory framework and a rate of return on common equity that is currently higher than that allowed by our state commissions. however, the ferc regulatory framework and rate of return are subject to change, including change as a result of existing and future third-party complaints and challenges at the ferc and the new methodology for determining the base return on common equity proposed by the ferc in november 2018. accordingly, the regulatory framework may be less favorable or the rate of return may be lower in the future, compared with the current regulatory environment and rate of return, all of which may adversely affect ameren's and ameren illinois' results of operations, financial position, and liquidity. a pending complaint case filed with the ferc in february 2015 could reduce the allowed return on common equity and could require customer refunds. a 50 basis point reduction in the ferc-allowed return on common equity would reduce ameren's and ameren illinois' earnings by an estimated $9 million and $5 million, respectively, based on each company's 2019 projected rate base.
we are subject to various environmental laws. significant capital expenditures are required to achieve and to maintain compliance with these environmental laws. failure to comply with these laws could result in the closing of facilities, alterations to the manner in which these facilities operate, increased operating costs, or exposure to fines and liabilities.
we are subject to various environmental laws, including statutes and regulations, enforced by federal, state, and local authorities. the development and operation of electric generation, transmission, and distribution facilities and natural gas storage, transmission, and distribution facilities can trigger compliance obligations with respect to environmental laws. these laws address emissions, discharges to water, water intake, impacts to air, land, and water, and chemical and waste handling. complex and lengthy processes are required to obtain and renew approvals, permits, and licenses for new, existing or modified facilities. additionally, the use and handling of various chemicals or hazardous materials require release prevention plans and emergency response procedures. ameren is also subject to risks from changing or conflicting interpretations of existing laws.
we are also subject to liability under environmental laws that address the remediation of environmental contamination on property currently or formerly owned by us or by our predecessors, as well as property contaminated by hazardous substances that we generated. such properties include mgp sites and third-party sites, such as landfills. additionally, private individuals may seek to enforce environmental laws against us. they could allege injury from exposure to hazardous materials, allege a failure to comply with environmental laws, seek to compel remediation of environmental contamination, or seek to recover damages resulting from that contamination.
the epa has promulgated environmental regulations that have a significant impact on the electric utility industry. over time, compliance with these regulations could be costly for ameren missouri, which operates coal-fired power plants. as of december 31, 2018, ameren missouri's fossil fuel-fired energy centers represented 16% and 32% of ameren's and ameren missouri's rate base, respectively. regulations that apply to air emissions from the electric utility industry include the nsps, the csapr, the mats, and the national ambient air quality standards, which are subject to periodic review for certain pollutants. collectively, these regulations cover a variety of pollutants, such as so2, particulate matter, nox, mercury, toxic metals, and acid gases, and co2 emissions from new power plants. water intake and discharges from power plants are regulated under the clean water act. such regulation could require modifications to water intake structures or more stringent limitations on wastewater discharges at ameren missouri's energy centers, either of which could result in significant capital expenditures. the management and disposal of coal ash is regulated under the ccr rule, which will require the closure of surface impoundments and the installations of dry ash handling systems at several of ameren missouri's energy centers. the individual or combined effects of existing environmental regulations could result in significant capital expenditures, increased operating costs, or the closure or alteration of operations at some of ameren missouri's energy centers.
in january 2011, the department of justice, on behalf of the epa, filed a complaint against ameren missouri in the united states district court for the eastern district of missouri. the complaint, as amended in october 2013, alleged that in performing projects at its rush island coal-fired energy center in 2007 and 2010, ameren missouri violated provisions of the clean air act and missouri law. the litigation has been divided into two phases: liability and remedy. in the first phase, in january 2017, the district court issued a liability ruling that the projects violated provisions of the clean air act and missouri law. in the second phase, the district court will determine the actions required to remedy the violations found in the liability phase. the epa previously withdrew all claims for penalties and fines. hearings on remedy-related issues are scheduled for april 2019. the ultimate resolution of this matter could have a material adverse effect on the results of operations, financial position, and liquidity of ameren and ameren missouri. among other things and subject to economic and regulatory considerations, resolution
of this matter could result in increased capital expenditures for the installation of pollution control equipment, as well as increased operations and maintenance expenses.
in 2015, the epa issued the clean power plan, which would have established co2 emissions standards applicable to existing power plants. the united states supreme court stayed the rule in february 2016, pending various legal challenges. in august 2018, the epa proposed to repeal and replace the clean power plan with a proposed new rule known as the affordable clean energy rule, which establishes emission guidelines for states to follow in developing plans to limit co2 emissions from power plants. the epa proposes to use certain efficiency measures as the best system of emission reduction for coal-fired power plants. we cannot predict the outcome of the epa's future rulemaking or the outcome of any legal challenges relating to such future rulemakings, any of which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position, and liquidity.
ameren and ameren missouri have incurred and expect to incur significant costs with respect to environmental compliance and site remediation. new or revised environmental regulations, enforcement initiatives, or legislation could result in a significant increase in capital expenditures and operating costs, decreased revenues, increased financing requirements, penalties or fines, or reduced operations of some of ameren missouri's coal-fired energy centers, which, in turn, could lead to increased liquidity needs and higher financing costs. actions required to ensure that ameren missouri's facilities and operations are in compliance with environmental laws could be prohibitively expensive for ameren missouri if the costs are not fully recovered through rates. environmental laws could require ameren missouri to close or to alter significantly the operations of its energy centers. if ameren missouri requests recovery of capital expenditures and costs for environmental compliance through rates, the mopsc could deny recovery of all or a portion of these costs, prevent timely recovery, or make changes to the regulatory framework in an effort to minimize rate volatility and customer rate increases. capital expenditures and costs to comply with future legislation or regulations might result in ameren missouri closing coal-fired energy centers earlier than planned. if these costs are not recoverable through rates, it could lead to an impairment of assets and reduced revenues. any of the foregoing could have an adverse effect on our results of operations, financial positions, and liquidity.
customers', legislators', and regulators' opinions of us are affected by many factors, including system reliability, implementation of our investment plans, protection of customer information, rates, and media coverage. to the extent that customers, legislators, or regulators have or develop a negative opinion of us, our results of operations, financial position, and liquidity could be adversely affected.
service interruptions can occur due to failures of equipment as a result of severe or destructive weather or other causes. the ability of ameren missouri and ameren illinois to respond promptly to such failures can affect customer satisfaction. in addition to system reliability issues, the success of modernization efforts, our ability to safeguard sensitive customer information and protect our systems from cyber attacks, and other actions can affect customer satisfaction. the level of rates, the timing and magnitude of rate increases, and the volatility of rates can also affect customer satisfaction. customers', legislators', and regulators' opinions of us can also be affected by media coverage, including social media, which may include information, whether factual or not, that damages our brand and reputation.
if customers, legislators, or regulators have or develop a negative opinion of us and our utility services, this could result in increased costs associated with regulatory oversight and could affect the returns on common equity we are allowed to earn. additionally, negative opinions about us could make it more difficult for our utilities to achieve favorable legislative or regulatory outcomes. negative opinions could also result in sales volume reductions or increased use of distributed generation by our customers. any of these consequences could adversely affect our results of operations, financial position, and liquidity.
the ferc can impose civil penalties of approximately $1.3 million per violation per day for violation of its regulations, rules, and orders, including mandatory nerc reliability standards. as owners and operators of bulk power transmission systems and electric energy centers, we are subject to mandatory nerc reliability standards, including cybersecurity standards. compliance with these mandatory reliability standards may subject us to higher operating costs and may result in increased capital expenditures. if we were found not to be in compliance with these mandatory reliability standards, ferc regulations, rules, and orders, we could incur substantial monetary penalties and other sanctions, which could adversely affect our results of operations, financial position, and liquidity. the ferc also conducts audits and reviews of ameren missouri's, ameren illinois', and atxi's accounting records to assess the accuracy of its formula ratemaking process, and it can require refunds to customers for previously billed amounts, with interest.
operational risks the construction and acquisition of, and capital improvements to, electric and natural gas utility infrastructure involve substantial risks. these risks include escalating costs, unsatisfactory performance by the projects when completed, the inability to complete projects as scheduled, cost disallowances by regulators, and the inability to earn an adequate return on invested capital, any of which could result in higher costs and facility closures.
we expect to make significant capital expenditures to maintain and improve our electric and natural gas utility infrastructure and to comply with existing environmental regulations. we estimate that we will invest up to $13.9 billion (ameren missouri - up to $7.1 billion; ameren illinois - up to $6.6 billion; atxi - up to $0.2 billion) of capital expenditures from 2019 through 2023. these estimates include allowance for equity funds used during construction, but do not include any additional wind generation investments by ameren missouri beyond the two facilities that ameren missouri has agreed to acquire after construction. investments in ameren's rate-regulated operations are expected to be recoverable from customers, but they are subject to prudence reviews and are exposed to regulatory lag of varying degrees by jurisdiction.
our ability to complete construction projects successfully within projected estimates and to acquire wind generation facilities after they are constructed is contingent upon many variables and subject to substantial risks. these variables include, but are not limited to, project management expertise, escalating costs for labor and materials, including changes to tariffs on materials, reliance on third parties, the ability to obtain required project approvals, and the ability to obtain necessary rights-of-way, easements, and transmission connections. delays in obtaining permits or regulatory approvals, shortages in materials and qualified labor, suppliers and contractors who do not perform as required under their contracts, changes in the scope and timing of projects, the inability to raise capital on reasonable terms, or other events beyond our control could affect the schedule, cost, and performance of these projects. there is a risk that an energy center might not be permitted to continue to operate if pollution control equipment is not installed by prescribed deadlines or does not perform as expected. should any such pollution control equipment not be installed on time or not perform as expected, ameren missouri could be subject to additional costs and to the loss of its investment in the project or facility. all of these project and construction risks could adversely affect our results of operations, financial position, and liquidity.
our electric generation, transmission, and distribution facilities are subject to operational risks that could adversely affect our results of operations, financial position, and liquidity.
our financial performance depends on the successful operation of electric generation, transmission, and distribution facilities. operation of electric generation, transmission, and distribution facilities involves many risks, including:
•   facility shutdowns due to operator error, or a failure of equipment or processes;
•   longer-than-anticipated maintenance outages;
•   failures of equipment that can result in unanticipated liabilities or unplanned outages;
•   disruptions in the delivery of fuel, failure of our fuel suppliers to provide adequate quantities or quality of fuel, or lack of adequate inventories of fuel, including ultra-low-sulfur coal used by ameren missouri to comply with environmental regulations;
•   lack of adequate water required for cooling plant operations;
•   disruptions in the delivery of electricity to our customers;
•   suppliers and contractors who do not perform as required under their contracts;
•   failure of other operators' facilities and the effect of that failure on our electric system and customers;
•   inability to comply with regulatory or permit requirements, including those relating to environmental laws;
•   handling, storage, and disposition of ccr;
•   unusual or adverse weather conditions or other natural disasters, including severe storms, droughts, floods, tornadoes, earthquakes, solar flares, and electromagnetic pulses;
•   the occurrence of catastrophic events such as fires, explosions, acts of sabotage or terrorism, pandemic health events, or other similar events;
•   accidents that might result in injury or loss of life, extensive property damage, or environmental damage;
•   ineffective vegetation management programs;
•   cybersecurity risks, including loss of operational control of ameren missouri's energy centers and our transmission and distribution systems and loss of data, including sensitive customer, employee, financial, and operating system information, through insider or outsider actions;
•   limitations on amounts of insurance available to cover losses that might arise in connection with operating our electric generation, transmission, and distribution facilities;
•   inability to implement or maintain information systems;
•   failure to keep pace with and the ability to adapt to rapid technological change; and
•   other unanticipated operations and maintenance expenses and liabilities.
the foregoing risks could affect the controls and operations of our facilities or impede our ability to meet regulatory requirements, which could increase operating costs, increase our capital requirements and costs, reduce our revenues or have an adverse effect on our liquidity.
ameren missouri's ownership and operation of a nuclear energy center creates business, financial, and waste disposal risks.
ameren missouri's ownership of the callaway energy center subjects it to risks associated with nuclear generation, including:
•   potential harmful effects on the environment and human health resulting from radiological releases associated with the operation of nuclear facilities and the storage, handling, and disposal of radioactive materials;
•   continued uncertainty regarding the federal government's plan to permanently store spent nuclear fuel and, as a result, the need to provide for long-term storage of spent nuclear fuel at the callaway energy center;
•   limitations on the amounts and types of insurance available to cover losses that might arise in connection with the callaway energy center or other united states nuclear facilities;
•   uncertainties about contingencies and retrospective premium assessments relating to claims at the callaway energy center or any other united states nuclear facilities;
•   public and governmental concerns about the safety and adequacy of security at nuclear facilities;
•   limited availability of fuel supply and our reliance on licensed fuel assemblies from the one nrc-licensed supplier of callaway energy center's assemblies;
•   costly and extended outages for scheduled or unscheduled maintenance and refueling;
•   uncertainties about the technological and financial aspects of decommissioning nuclear facilities at the end of their licensed lives;
•   the adverse effect of poor market performance and other economic factors on the asset values of nuclear decommissioning trust funds and the corresponding increase, upon mopsc approval, in customer rates to fund the estimated decommissioning costs; and
•   potential adverse effects of a natural disaster, acts of sabotage or terrorism, including cyber attack, or any accident leading to a radiological release.
the nrc has broad authority under federal law to impose licensing and safety requirements for nuclear facilities. in the event of noncompliance, the nrc has the authority to impose fines or to shut down a unit, or both, depending upon its assessment of the severity of the situation, until compliance is achieved. revised safety requirements promulgated from time to time by the nrc could necessitate substantial capital expenditures at the callaway energy center. in addition, if a serious nuclear incident were to occur, it could adversely affect ameren's and ameren missouri's results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity. a major incident at a nuclear facility anywhere in the world could cause the nrc to limit or prohibit the operation of any domestic nuclear unit and could also cause the nrc to impose additional conditions or requirements on the industry, which could increase costs and result in additional capital expenditures. nrc standards relating to seismic risk require ameren missouri to further evaluate the impact of an earthquake on its callaway energy center due to its proximity to a fault line, which could require the installation of additional capital equipment.
our natural gas distribution and storage activities involve numerous risks that may result in accidents and increased operating costs.
inherent in our natural gas distribution and storage activities are a variety of hazards and operating risks, such as leaks, explosions, mechanical problems and cybersecurity risks, which could cause substantial financial losses. in addition, these hazards could result in serious injury, loss of human life, significant damage to property, environmental impacts, and impairment of our operations, which in turn could lead us to incur substantial losses. the location of distribution mains and storage facilities near populated areas, including residential areas, business centers, industrial sites, and other public gathering places, could increase the level of damages resulting from these risks. a major domestic incident involving natural gas systems could lead to additional capital expenditures, increased regulation, and fines and penalties on natural gas utilities. the occurrence of any of these events could adversely affect our results of operations, financial position, and liquidity.
significant portions of our electric generation, transmission, and distribution facilities and natural gas transmission and distribution facilities are aging. this aging infrastructure may require significant additional maintenance or replacement that could adversely affect our results of operations, financial position, and liquidity. additionally, ameren missouri's results of operations, financial position, and liquidity could be adversely affected if an energy center's costs or decommissioning costs associated with an energy center's retirement are not fully recovered.
our aging infrastructure may pose risks to system reliability and expose us to expedited or unplanned significant capital expenditures and operating costs. all of ameren missouri's coal-fired energy centers were constructed prior to 1978, and the callaway energy center began operating in 1984. the age of these energy centers increases the risks of unplanned outages, reduced generation output, and higher maintenance expense. if, at the end of its life, an energy center's cost has not been fully recovered, ameren missouri may be adversely affected if the mopsc does not allow such cost to be recovered in rates. ameren missouri may also be adversely affected if the mopsc does
not allow full or timely recovery of decommissioning costs associated with the retirement of an energy center. aging transmission and distribution facilities are more prone to failure than new facilities, which results in higher maintenance expense and the need to replace these facilities with new infrastructure. even if the system is properly maintained, its reliability may ultimately deteriorate and negatively affect our ability to serve our customers, which could result in increased costs associated with regulatory oversight. the frequency and duration of customer outages are among the ieima performance standards. any failure to achieve these standards will result in a reduction in ameren illinois' allowed return on equity on electric distribution assets. the higher maintenance costs associated with aging infrastructure and capital expenditures for new or replacement infrastructure could cause additional rate volatility for our customers, resistance by our regulators to allow customer rate increases, and/or regulatory lag in some of our jurisdictions, any of which could adversely affect our results of operations, financial position, and liquidity.
energy conservation, energy efficiency, distributed generation, energy storage, technological advances, and other factors could reduce energy demand from ameren missouri's customers.
without a regulatory mechanism to ensure recovery, declines in energy usage could result in an under-recovery of ameren missouri's revenue requirement, which could adversely affect ameren and ameren missouri's results of operations, financial position, and liquidity. such declines could occur due to a number of factors:
•   distributed generation and other energy-efficiency efforts. ameren missouri is exposed to declining usage from energy-efficiency efforts not related to its energy-efficiency programs, as well as from distributed generation sources, such as solar panels and other technologies. ameren missouri generates power at utility-scale energy centers to achieve economies of scale and to produce power at a competitive cost. some distributed generation technologies have become more cost-competitive, with decreasing costs expected in the future. the costs of these distributed generation technologies may decline over time to a level that is competitive with that of ameren missouri's energy centers. additionally, technological advances in energy storage may be coupled with distributed generation to reduce the demand for our electric utility services. increased adoption of these technologies by customers could decrease our revenues if customers cease to use our generation, transmission, and distribution services at current levels. ameren missouri might incur stranded costs, which ultimately might not be recovered through rates.
•   macroeconomic factors. macroeconomic factors resulting in low economic growth or contraction within ameren missouri's service territories could reduce energy demand.
we are subject to employee work force factors that could adversely affect our operations.
our businesses depend upon our ability to employ and retain key officers and other skilled professional and technical employees. a significant portion of our work force is nearing retirement, including many employees with specialized skills, such as maintaining and servicing our electric and natural gas infrastructure and operating our energy centers. we are also party to collective bargaining agreements that collectively represent about 51% of ameren's total employees. any work stoppage experienced in connection with negotiations of collective bargaining agreements could adversely affect our operations.
our operations are subject to acts of terrorism, cyber attacks, and other intentionally disruptive acts.
like other electric and natural gas utilities, our energy centers, fuel storage facilities, transmission and distribution facilities, and information systems may be affected by terrorist activities and other intentionally disruptive acts, including cyber attacks, which could disrupt our ability to produce or distribute our energy products. within our industry, there have been attacks on energy infrastructure, such as substations and related assets, in the past, and there may be more attacks in the future. any such incident could limit our ability to generate, purchase, or transmit power or natural gas and could have significant regional economic consequences. any such disruption could result in a significant decrease in revenues, a significant increase in costs including those for repair, or adversely affect economic activity in our service territory which, in turn, could adversely affect our results of operations, financial position, and liquidity.
there has been an increase in the number and sophistication of cyber attacks across all industries worldwide. a security breach at our physical assets or in our information systems could affect the reliability of the transmission and distribution system, disrupt electric generation, including nuclear generation, and/or subject us to financial harm resulting from theft or the inappropriate release of certain types of information, including sensitive customer, employee, financial, and operating system information. many of our suppliers, vendors, contractors, and information technology providers have access to systems that support our operations and maintain customer and employee data. a breach of these third-party systems could adversely affect our business as if it was a breach of our own system. if a significant breach occurred, our reputation could be adversely affected, customer confidence could be diminished, and/or we could be subject to increased costs associated with regulatory oversight, fines or legal claims, any of which could result in a significant decrease in revenues or significant costs for remedying the impacts of such a breach. our generation, transmission, and distribution systems are part of an interconnected system. therefore, a disruption caused by a cyber incident at another utility, electric generator, rto, or commodity supplier could also adversely affect our businesses. insurance might not be adequate to cover losses that arise in connection with these events. in addition, new
regulations could require changes in our security measures and result in increased costs. the occurrence of any of these events could adversely affect our results of operations, financial position, and liquidity.
financial, economic, and market risks our businesses are dependent on our ability to access the capital markets successfully. we might not have access to sufficient capital in the amounts and at the times needed.
we rely on the issuance of short-term and long-term debt as significant sources of liquidity and funding for capital requirements not satisfied by our operating cash flow, as well as to refinance existing long-term debt. the inability to raise debt or equity capital at reasonable terms, or at all, could negatively affect our ability to maintain and to expand our businesses. events beyond our control, such as depressed economic conditions or extreme volatility in the debt, equity, or credit markets, might create uncertainty that could increase our cost of capital or impair or eliminate our ability to access the debt, equity, or credit markets, including our ability to draw on bank credit facilities. the unfavorable near-term impacts of the tcja on our operating cash flows may adversely affect our credit ratings. any adverse change in our credit ratings could reduce access to capital and trigger collateral postings and prepayments. such changes could also increase the cost of borrowing and the costs of fuel, power, and natural gas supply, among other things, which could adversely affect our results of operations, financial position, and liquidity.
ameren's holding company structure could limit its ability to pay common stock dividends and to service its debt obligations.
ameren is a holding company; therefore, its primary assets are its investments in the common stock of its subsidiaries, including ameren missouri, ameren illinois, and atxi. as a result, ameren's ability to pay dividends on its common stock depends on the earnings of its subsidiaries and the ability of its subsidiaries to pay dividends or otherwise transfer funds to ameren. similarly, ameren's ability to service its debt obligations is dependent upon the earnings of its operating subsidiaries and the distribution of those earnings and other payments, including payments of principal and interest under affiliate indebtedness. the payment of dividends to ameren by its subsidiaries in turn depends on their results of operations, and other items affecting retained earnings, and available cash. ameren's subsidiaries are separate and distinct legal entities and have no obligation, contingent or otherwise, to pay any dividends or make any other distributions (except for payments required pursuant to the terms of affiliate borrowing arrangements and cash payments under the tax allocation agreement) to ameren. certain financing agreements, corporate organizational documents, and certain statutory and regulatory requirements may impose restrictions on the ability of ameren missouri, ameren illinois, and atxi to transfer funds to ameren in the form of cash dividends, loans, or advances.
increasing costs associated with our defined benefit retirement and postretirement plans, health care plans, and other employee benefits could adversely affect our financial position and liquidity.
ameren offers defined benefit pension and postretirement benefit plans covering substantially all of its union employees. ameren offers defined benefit pension plans covering substantially all of its non-union employees and postretirement benefit plans covering non-union employees hired before october 2015. assumptions related to future costs, returns on investments, interest rates, timing of employee retirements, and mortality, as well as other actuarial matters, have a significant impact on our customers' rates and our plan funding requirements. ameren's total unfunded obligation under its pension and postretirement benefit plans was $481 million as of december 31, 2018. ameren expects to fund its pension plans at a level equal to the greater of the pension cost or the legally required minimum contribution. based on ameren's assumptions at december 31, 2018, its investment performance in 2018, and its pension funding policy, ameren expects to make annual contributions of approximately $20 million to $70 million in each of the next five years, with aggregate estimated contributions of $200 million. ameren missouri's and ameren illinois' portions of the future funding requirements are estimated to be 30% and 60%, respectively. these estimates may change with actual investment performance, changes in interest rates, changes in our assumptions, changes in government regulations, and any voluntary contributions.
in addition to the costs of our pension plans, the costs of providing health care benefits to our employees and retirees have increased in recent years. we believe that our employee benefit costs, including costs of health care plans for our employees and former employees, will continue to rise. future legislative changes related to health care could also significantly change our benefit programs and costs. the increasing costs and funding requirements associated with our defined benefit retirement plans, health care plans, and other employee benefits could increase our financing needs and otherwise adversely affect our financial position and liquidity.
item 7.   management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations ameren, headquartered in st. louis, missouri, is a public utility holding company whose primary assets are its equity interests in its subsidiaries. ameren's subsidiaries are separate, independent legal entities with separate businesses, assets, and liabilities. dividends on ameren's common stock and the payment of expenses by ameren depend on distributions made to it by its subsidiaries.
below is a summary description of ameren's principal subsidiaries, which includes ameren missouri, ameren illinois, and atxi. ameren also has other subsidiaries that conduct other activities, such as providing shared services. a more detailed description can be found in note 1 - summary of significant accounting policies under part ii, item 8, of this report.
•   ameren missouri operates a rate-regulated electric generation, transmission, and distribution business and a rate-regulated natural gas distribution business in missouri.
•   ameren illinois operates rate-regulated electric transmission, electric distribution, and natural gas distribution businesses in illinois.
•   atxi operates a ferc rate-regulated electric transmission business. atxi is constructing miso-approved electric transmission projects, including the illinois rivers and mark twain projects, and operates the spoon river project, which was placed in service in february 2018. ameren also evaluates competitive electric transmission investment opportunities as they arise.
ameren has four segments: ameren missouri, ameren illinois electric distribution, ameren illinois natural gas, and ameren transmission. the ameren missouri segment includes all of the operations of ameren missouri. ameren illinois electric distribution consists of the electric distribution business of ameren illinois. ameren illinois natural gas consists of the natural gas business of ameren illinois. ameren transmission primarily consists of the aggregated electric transmission businesses of ameren illinois and atxi. see note 15 - segment information under part ii, item 8, of this report for further discussion of ameren's, ameren missouri's, and ameren illinois' segments.
ameren's financial statements are prepared on a consolidated basis and therefore include the accounts of its majority-owned subsidiaries. all intercompany transactions have been eliminated. ameren missouri and ameren illinois have no subsidiaries. all tabular dollar amounts are in millions, unless otherwise indicated.
in addition to presenting results of operations and earnings amounts in total, we present certain information in cents per share. these amounts reflect factors that directly affect ameren's earnings. we believe this per share information helps readers to understand the impact of these factors on ameren's earnings per share. all references in this report to earnings per share are based on average diluted common shares outstanding for the relevant period.
overview ameren's strategic plan includes investing in, and operating its utilities in, a manner consistent with existing regulatory frameworks, enhancing those frameworks, and advocating for responsible energy and economic policies, as well as creating and capitalizing on opportunities for investment for the benefit of its customers and shareholders. ameren remains focused on disciplined cost management and strategic capital allocation. as discussed below, ameren successfully executed on its strategic plan in 2018, with constructive outcomes received in various regulatory proceedings. with the enactment of legislation in missouri, we believe constructive regulatory frameworks for investment exist at all of ameren's utility businesses. in february 2019, ameren missouri announced its smart energy plan to upgrade the electric grid and accommodate more renewable energy. in addition, ameren missouri advanced its transition of generation to a cleaner, more diverse portfolio by entering into two build-transfer agreements for the acquisition of up to 557 megawatts of wind generation in missouri.
in 2018, ameren's utility businesses each received orders to reduce customer rates to reflect the benefits of a lower federal tax rate and, over time, to reflect the return of excess deferred taxes of over $2 billion. the return of excess deferred taxes to customers reduces operating cash flows but is expected to increase the rate base on which customer rates are established.
in june 2018, legislation was enacted in missouri that enhanced ameren missouri's electric regulatory framework. pursuant to its pisa election, ameren missouri is permitted to defer and recover 85% of the depreciation expense and a weighted-average cost of capital return on rate base on certain property, plant, and equipment placed in service after september 1, 2018, and not included in base rates. accumulated pisa deferrals earn carrying costs at the weighted-average cost of capital, and all approved pisa deferrals will be added to rate base prospectively and recovered over a period of 20 years following a regulatory rate review. pisa mitigates the impacts of regulatory lag between regulatory rate reviews. the remaining 15% of certain property, plant, and equipment placed in service and not eligible for recovery under pisa, unless eligible for recovery under the resram, remain subject to regulatory lag. as a result of the pisa election, additional provisions of the new law apply to ameren missouri, including limitations on electric customer rate increases and an electric base rate freeze until april 2020. both the rate increase limitation and pisa are effective through december 2023, unless ameren missouri requests and receives mopsc approval of an extension through december 2028. this missouri law maintains strong mopsc oversight and consumer protections while supporting ameren missouri's ability to strengthen and modernize missouri's electric grid.
in the second quarter of 2018, ameren missouri entered into a build-transfer agreement with a subsidiary of terra-gen, llc to acquire, after construction, a 400-megawatt wind generation facility, which is expected to be located in northeastern missouri. in october 2018, the mopsc issued an order approving a unanimous stipulation and agreement regarding a requested certificate of convenience and necessity for the facility. in december 2018, ameren missouri received ferc approval to acquire the facility after construction. a transmission interconnection agreement with the miso for this facility is expected in the fall of 2019. also, in october 2018, ameren missouri entered into a build-transfer agreement with a subsidiary of edf renewables, inc. to acquire, after construction, a wind generation facility of up to 157 megawatts. in february 2019, ameren missouri filed with the mopsc a nonunanimous stipulation and agreement regarding a requested certificate of convenience and necessity for the facility. the up to 157-megawatt facility is expected to be located in northwestern missouri. a transmission interconnection agreement with the miso for this facility is expected in early 2020. both facilities are expected to be completed by the end of 2020 and would help ameren missouri comply with the missouri renewable energy standard. each acquisition is subject to certain conditions, including entering into a miso transmission interconnection agreement at an acceptable cost for each facility and obtaining ferc approval and the issuance of a certificate of convenience and necessity by the mopsc for the up to 157-megawatt facility, as well as other customary contract terms and conditions. these agreements collectively represent approximately $1 billion in capital expenditures expected in 2020, which is included in ameren missouri's smart energy plan. as outlined in its 2017 irp, ameren missouri is pursuing at least 700 megawatts of wind generation by the end of 2020. in october and december 2018, the mopsc issued orders approving a resram that allows ameren missouri to adjust customer rates on an annual basis without a traditional regulatory rate review. the resram is designed to mitigate the impacts of regulatory lag for the cost of compliance with renewable energy standards, including recovery of investments in wind and other renewable generation, by providing more timely recovery of costs and a return on investments not already provided for in customer rates or recovered under pisa.
in february 2019, ameren missouri announced its smart energy plan, which includes a five-year capital investment overview with a detailed one-year plan for 2019, designed to upgrade ameren missouri's electric infrastructure. the plan includes investments that will upgrade the grid and accommodate more renewable energy. investments under the plan are expected to total approximately $6.3 billion over the five-year period from 2019 through 2023, with costs largely recoverable under pisa and, for the portion of wind and other renewable generation investments that are not recoverable under pisa, recoverable under the resram.
in december 2018, the mopsc issued an order approving ameren missouri's meeia 2019 plan. the plan includes a portfolio of customer energy-efficiency programs through december 2021 and low-income customer energy-efficiency programs through december 2024, along with a regulatory recovery mechanism. ameren missouri intends to invest $226 million over the life of the plan, including $65 million per year through 2021. the plan includes the continued use of the meeia rider, which allows ameren missouri to collect from, or refund to, customers any difference in actual meeia program costs and related lost electric margins and the amounts collected from customers. in addition, the plan includes a performance incentive that provides ameren missouri an opportunity to earn additional revenues by achieving certain customer energy-efficiency goals, including $30 million if 100% of the goals are achieved during the period ended december 2021. additional revenues may be earned if ameren missouri exceeds 100% of its energy savings goals.
in april 2018, ameren illinois filed its annual electric distribution service formula rate update to establish the revenue requirement to be used for 2019 rates with the icc. in november 2018, the icc issued an order in ameren illinois' annual update filing that approved a $72 million increase in ameren illinois' electric distribution service rates beginning in january 2019.
in november 2018, the icc issued an order approving a stipulation and agreement that resulted in an annual natural gas rate increase of $32 million, based on a 9.87% return on common equity, a capital structure composed of 50% common equity, and a rate base of $1.6 billion. this increase reflects the reduction in the federal statutory corporate income tax rate enacted under the tcja, as well as the increase in the illinois corporate income tax rate that became effective in july 2017, which collectively decreased annual rates by approximately $17 million. the new customer rates were effective in november 2018. as a result of this order, the rate base under the qip rider was reset to zero. ameren illinois used a 2019 future test year in this proceeding.
atxi's spoon river project, located in northwest illinois, was placed in service in february 2018. construction of the illinois rivers project is substantially complete, with the last section awaiting the outcome of certain legal proceedings, which will delay the expected completion date to 2020. this delay is not expected to materially affect 2019 rate base or earnings. construction activities for atxi's mark twain project began in the second quarter of 2018, and the project is expected to be completed by the end of 2019.
in october 2018, ameren's board of directors increased the quarterly common stock dividend to 47.5 cents per share, resulting in an annualized equivalent dividend rate of $1.90 per share.
earnings net income attributable to ameren common shareholders was $815 million, or $3.32 per diluted share, for 2018, and $523 million, or $2.14 per diluted share, for 2017. net income was favorably affected in 2018 compared with 2017 by the absence of a noncash charge to earnings for the revaluation of deferred taxes, primarily at ameren (parent) as a result of federal and illinois tax law changes, and by increased demand at ameren missouri, primarily due to warmer summer and colder winter temperatures in 2018. earnings were also
favorably affected in 2018 compared with 2017 by an increase in base rates and a reduction in operating expenses for net energy costs and other expenses subject to regulatory tracking mechanisms at ameren missouri pursuant to the mopsc's march 2017 electric rate order, by the absence of a callaway energy center scheduled refueling and maintenance outage at ameren missouri, and by increased investments in infrastructure at the ameren illinois electric distribution and ameren transmission segments. net income was unfavorably affected in 2018, compared with 2017 by increased other operation and maintenance expenses not subject to riders or regulatory tracking mechanisms, primarily due to higher-than-normal energy center scheduled outage and electric distribution maintenance costs at ameren missouri, and by increased depreciation and amortization expenses at ameren missouri.
liquidity at december 31, 2018, ameren, on a consolidated basis, had available liquidity in the form of cash on hand and amounts available under the credit agreements of $1.5 billion. in december 2018, the credit agreements were extended and now mature in december 2022.
capital expenditures in 2018, ameren continued to make significant investment in its utility businesses by making capital expenditures of $0.9 billion, $0.6 billion, $0.5 billion, and $0.3 billion in ameren missouri, ameren transmission, ameren illinois electric distribution, and ameren illinois natural gas, respectively. for 2019 through 2023, ameren's cumulative capital expenditures are projected to range from $12.8 billion to $13.9 billion. the projected spending by segment includes up to $7.1 billion, $2.7 billion, $2.5 billion, and $1.6 billion for ameren missouri, ameren illinois electric distribution, ameren transmission, and ameren illinois natural gas, respectively, including approximately $1 billion to acquire two wind generation facilities in 2020 at ameren missouri.
results of operations our results of operations and financial position are affected by many factors. economic conditions, energy-efficiency investments by our customers and by us, and the actions of key customers can significantly affect the demand for our services. ameren and ameren missouri results are also affected by seasonal fluctuations in winter heating and summer cooling demands, as well as by nuclear refueling and other energy center maintenance outages. additionally, fluctuations in interest rates and conditions in the capital and credit markets affect our cost of borrowing and our pension and postretirement benefits costs. almost all of ameren's revenues are subject to state or federal regulation. this regulation has a material impact on the prices we charge for our services. our results of operations, financial position, and liquidity are affected by our ability to align our overall spending, both operating and capital, within the frameworks established by our regulators. our 2018 revenues include a reduction from 2017 revenues for the pass-through to customers of reduced income taxes resulting from tcja, which is substantially offset by a reduction in income tax expense.
ameren missouri principally uses coal and nuclear fuel for fuel in its electric operations and purchases natural gas for its customers. ameren illinois purchases power and natural gas for its customers. the prices for these commodities can fluctuate significantly because of the global economic and political environment, weather, supply, demand, and many other factors. as described below, we have natural gas cost recovery mechanisms for our illinois and missouri natural gas distribution businesses, a purchased power cost recovery mechanism for ameren illinois' electric distribution business, and a fac for ameren missouri's electric business.
ameren missouri's electric service and natural gas distribution service rates are established in a traditional regulatory rate review based on a historical test year and an allowed return on equity. to mitigate the effects of regulatory lag, ameren missouri has recovery mechanisms in place for certain costs that allow customer rates to be adjusted without a traditional regulatory rate review. ameren missouri's fac cost recovery mechanism allows it to recover or refund, through customer rates, 95% of the variance in net energy costs from the amount set in base rates without a traditional regulatory rate review, subject to mopsc prudence reviews, with the remaining 5% of changes retained by ameren missouri. net recovery of these costs through customer rates does not affect ameren missouri's electric margins, as any change in revenue is offset by a corresponding change in fuel expense. in addition, ameren missouri's meeia customer energy-efficiency program costs, the related lost electric margins, and any performance incentive are recoverable through the meeia cost recovery mechanism without a traditional regulatory rate review. ameren missouri also has a cost recovery mechanism for natural gas purchased on behalf of its customers. these pass-through purchased gas costs do not affect ameren missouri's natural gas margins, as any change in costs is offset by a corresponding change in revenues. ameren missouri employs other cost recovery mechanisms, including a pension and postretirement benefit cost tracker, an uncertain tax position tracker, a tracker on certain excess deferred taxes, a renewable energy standards cost tracker, and a solar rebate program tracker. each of these trackers allows ameren missouri to defer the difference between actual costs incurred and costs included in customer rates as a regulatory asset or regulatory liability. the difference will be reflected in base rates in a subsequent mopsc rate order. pursuant to its pisa election, ameren missouri is permitted to defer and recover 85% of the depreciation expense and a weighted-average cost of capital return on rate base on certain property, plant, and equipment placed in service after september 1, 2018, and not included in base rates. additionally, under the resram, ameren missouri is permitted to recover the 15% of renewable generation plant placed in service not recovered under pisa. see note 2 - rate and regulatory matters under part ii, item 8, of this report for information regarding ameren missouri's pisa election and the resram.
ameren illinois' electric distribution service rates are reconciled annually to its actual revenue requirement and allowed return on equity, under a formula ratemaking process effective through 2022. if a given year's revenue requirement varies from the amount collected from customers, an adjustment is made to electric operating revenues with an offset to a regulatory asset or liability to reflect that year's actual revenue requirement, independent of actual sales volumes. the regulatory balance is then collected from, or refunded to, customers within two years. in addition, ameren illinois' electric customer energy-efficiency rider provides ameren illinois' electric distribution service business with recovery of, and return on, energy-efficiency investments. under formula ratemaking for both its electric distribution service and its electric energy-efficiency investments, the revenue requirements are based on recoverable costs, year-end rate base, a capital structure of 50% common equity, and a return on equity. the return on equity component is equal to the annual average of the monthly yields of the 30-year united states treasury bonds plus 580 basis points. therefore, ameren illinois' annual return on equity for its electric distribution business is directly correlated to the yields on such bonds.
ameren illinois' natural gas distribution service rates are established in a traditional regulatory rate review based on a future test year and allowed return on equity. ameren illinois employs a vba to ensure recoverability of the natural gas distribution service revenue requirement for residential and small nonresidential customers that is dependent on sales volumes. for these rate classes, the vba allows ameren illinois to adjust natural gas distribution service rates without a traditional regulatory rate review when changes occur in sales volumes from normalized sales volumes approved by the icc in a previous regulatory rate review. in addition, the qip rider provides ameren illinois' natural gas business with recovery of, and a return on, qualifying infrastructure plant investments that are placed in service between regulatory rate reviews.
ameren illinois also has recovery mechanisms in place for certain costs that allow customer rates to be adjusted without a traditional regulatory rate review. ameren illinois' electric distribution service business has cost recovery mechanisms for power purchased and transmission services incurred on behalf of its customers, renewable energy credit compliance, and zero emission credits. ameren illinois' natural gas business has a cost recovery mechanism for natural gas purchased on behalf of its customers. these pass-through costs do not affect ameren illinois' electric or natural gas margins, as any change in costs is offset by a corresponding change in revenues. ameren illinois employs other cost recovery mechanisms for natural gas customer energy-efficiency program costs and certain environmental costs, as well as bad debt expenses and costs of certain asbestos-related claims not recovered in base rates.
ferc's electric transmission formula rate framework provides for an annual reconciliation of the electric transmission service revenue requirement, which reflects the actual recoverable costs incurred and the 13-month average rate base for a given year, with the revenue requirement in customer rates, including an allowed return on equity. ameren illinois and atxi use a company-specific, forward-looking formula ratemaking framework in setting their transmission rates. these rates are updated each january with forecasted information. if a given year's revenue requirement varies from the amount collected from customers, an adjustment is made to electric operating revenues with an offset to a regulatory asset or liability to reflect that year's actual revenue requirement. the regulatory balance is collected from, or refunded to, customers within two years. the total return on equity currently allowed for ameren illinois' and atxi's electric transmission service businesses is 10.82% and is subject to a ferc complaint case. see note 2 - rate and regulatory matters under part ii, item 8, of this report for additional information.
we employ various risk management strategies to reduce our exposure to commodity risk and other risks inherent in our business. the reliability of ameren missouri's energy centers and our transmission and distribution systems and the level and timing of operations and maintenance costs and capital investment are key factors that we seek to manage in order to optimize our results of operations, financial position, and liquidity.
earnings summary the following table presents a summary of ameren's earnings for the years ended december 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016:
net income attributable to ameren common shareholders in 2018 increased $292 million, or $1.18 per diluted share, from 2017. the increase was due to net income increases of $155 million, $24 million, $10 million, and $5 million at ameren missouri, ameren transmission, ameren illinois natural gas, and ameren illinois electric distribution, respectively. additionally, the net loss for activity not reported as part of a segment, primarily at ameren (parent), decreased $98 million.
•   the absence of a noncash charge to earnings, primarily at ameren (parent), for the revaluation of deferred taxes recorded in 2017, as a
result of a decrease in the federal statutory corporate income tax rate under the tcja and an increase in the illinois corporate income tax rate, partially offset by a noncash charge for updates to the revaluation of deferred taxes recorded in 2018 (64 cents per share);
•   increased base rates and reduced operating expenses for net energy costs and other expenses subject to regulatory tracking mechanisms at ameren missouri, pursuant to the mopsc's march 2017 electric rate order (9 cents per share);
•   the absence of a callaway energy center scheduled refueling and maintenance outage in 2018, which last occurred in the fourth quarter of 2017, partially offset by preparation costs incurred in 2018 for the 2019 scheduled refueling outage (9 cents per share);
•   increased ameren transmission earnings under formula ratemaking, primarily due to additional investment (8 cents per share);
•   increased ameren illinois electric distribution earnings under formula ratemaking, primarily due to additional investment and a higher return on equity (5 cents per share);
•   increased ameren illinois natural gas earnings from investments in qualifying infrastructure recovered under the qip rider and increased base rates pursuant to the icc's november 2018 gas rate order (5 cents per share);
•   decreased financing costs, primarily at ameren missouri, due to lower interest rates and higher levels of the allowance for funds used during construction (3 cents per share); and
•   the recognition of a meeia 2016 performance incentive in 2018 at ameren missouri (3 cents per share).
•   increased other operation and maintenance expenses not subject to riders or regulatory tracking mechanisms, primarily due to higher-than-normal energy center scheduled outage and electric distribution maintenance costs at ameren missouri (19 cents per share) and due to changes in the market value of company-owned life insurance (7 cents per share);
•   increased depreciation and amortization expenses not subject to riders or regulatory tracking mechanisms, primarily at ameren missouri, resulting from additional electric property, plant, and equipment (7 cents per share); and
•   the dilutive effect of issuing common stock (2 cents per share).
the cents per share information presented is based on the weighted-average basic shares outstanding in 2017 and does not reflect any change in earnings per share resulting from dilution, unless otherwise noted. amounts other than variances related to income taxes have been presented net of income taxes using ameren's 2018 statutory tax rate of 27%.
net income attributable to ameren common shareholders in 2017 decreased $130 million, or $0.54 per diluted share, from 2016. the decrease was due to an increase in net loss of $125 million for activity not reported as part of a segment, primarily at ameren (parent), and a net income decrease of $34 million at ameren missouri, both of which were primarily due to the enactment of the tcja. the decrease was partially offset by a $23 million and a $5 million increase in net income from ameren transmission and ameren illinois electric distribution, respectively.
•   an increase in income tax expense, primarily at ameren (parent), due to the revaluation of deferred taxes, as a result of a decrease in the federal statutory corporate income tax rate due to enactment of the tcja (63 cents per share) and an increase in the illinois corporate income tax rate (6 cents per share);
•   the absence in 2017 of a meeia 2013 performance incentive at ameren missouri recognized in 2016 (7 cents per share);
•   increased depreciation and amortization expenses not subject to riders or regulatory tracking mechanisms at ameren missouri resulting from additional electric property, plant, and equipment (6 cents per share); and
•   increased transmission services charges at ameren missouri resulting from cost-sharing by all miso participants of additional miso-approved electric transmission investments made by other entities (2 cents per share).
•   an increase in base rates, net of increased revenues in 2016 from the suspension of operations at the new madrid smelter, and reduced operating expenses for net energy costs and other expenses subject to regulatory tracking mechanisms at ameren missouri pursuant to the mopsc's march 2017 electric rate order (32 cents per share);
•   increased ameren transmission earnings under formula ratemaking, primarily due to additional investment, partially offset by a lower recognized return on equity (9 cents per share);
•   increased ameren illinois electric distribution earnings under formula ratemaking, primarily due to additional investment and a higher recognized return on equity (4 cents per share); and
•   decreased income tax expense, excluding the effect of corporate income tax rate changes discussed above, primarily at ameren (parent) resulting from changes in the valuation allowance for charitable contributions, tax benefits related to company-owned life insurance, and tax credits in 2017, partially offset by a lower income tax benefit in 2017 related to stock-based compensation compared with 2016 (1 cent per share).
the cents per share information presented is based on the weighted-average basic shares outstanding in 2016 and does not reflect any change in earnings per share resulting from dilution, unless otherwise noted. amounts other than variances related to income taxes have been presented net of income taxes using ameren's 2017 statutory tax rate of 39%.

ameren the effective income tax rate was lower in 2018 compared with 2017, primarily because of the decrease in the federal statutory corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%, beginning in 2018, and revaluation of deferred taxes in 2017, resulting from both the enactment of the tcja in 2017 and an increase in the illinois corporate income tax rate in mid-2017. additionally, the effective tax rate was lower due to amortization of excess deferred taxes in 2018. these items were offset by higher state income tax expense, as the increase in the illinois corporate income tax rate in 2017 applied to the full year in 2018, and lower tax benefits related to company-owned life insurance in 2018.
ameren transmission the effective income tax rate was lower in 2018 compared with 2017, primarily because of the decrease in the federal statutory corporate income tax rate, along with amortization of excess deferred taxes in 2018, partially offset by the increase in the illinois corporate income tax rate applied to the full year in 2018.
ameren missouri the effective income tax rate was lower in 2018 compared with 2017, primarily because of the decrease in the federal statutory corporate income tax rate in 2018, amortization of excess deferred taxes in 2018, and revaluation of deferred taxes in 2017.
ameren illinois the effective tax rate was lower in 2018 compared with 2017 at ameren illinois and its respective segments, primarily because of the decrease in the federal statutory corporate income tax rate and amortization of excess deferred taxes in 2018, partially offset by the increase in the illinois corporate income tax rate applied to the full year in 2018.
ameren the effective income tax rate was higher in 2017 compared with 2016, primarily because of revaluation of deferred taxes due to enactment of the tcja in 2017. in addition, income tax expense increased due to the revaluation of deferred taxes as a result of an increase in the illinois income tax rate in 2017 and due to a decrease in the recognition of tax benefits associated with share-based compensation, resulting from the difference between the deduction for tax purposes and the compensation cost recognized for financial reporting purposes. these items were partially offset by a reduction in the valuation allowance related to charitable contributions, due to higher-than-expected current-year taxable income.
ameren missouri the effective income tax rate was higher, primarily because of revaluation of deferred taxes due to the reduction in the federal statutory corporate income tax rate described above.
liquidity and capital resources collections from our tariff-based revenues are our principal source of cash provided by operating activities. a diversified retail customer mix, primarily consisting of rate-regulated residential, commercial, and industrial customers, provides us with a reasonably predictable source of cash. in addition to using cash provided by operating activities, we use available cash, borrowings under the credit agreements, commercial paper issuances, and/or, in the case of ameren missouri and ameren illinois, other short-term affiliate borrowings to support normal operations and temporary capital requirements. we may reduce our short-term borrowings with cash provided by operations or, at our discretion, with long-term borrowings, or, in the case of ameren missouri and ameren illinois, with capital contributions from ameren (parent). in the near term, our operating cash flows will decrease due to the reduction in the federal statutory income tax rate enacted under the tcja. the decrease in operating cash flows results from reduced customer rates, reflecting the tax rate decrease, without a corresponding reduction in income tax payments until about 2020 because of our use of net operating losses and tax credit carryforwards. additionally, operating cash flows will be further reduced by lower customer rates, resulting from the return of excess deferred taxes. over time, the decrease in operating cash flows will be offset as temporary differences between book and taxable income reverse, and by increased customer rates due to higher rate base amounts resulting from lower accumulated deferred income tax liabilities. we expect to make significant capital expenditures over the next five years as we invest in our electric and natural gas utility infrastructure to support overall system reliability, grid modernization, renewable energy requirements, environmental compliance, and other improvements. as part of its plan to fund these cash flow requirements, beginning in the first quarter of 2018, ameren began using newly issued shares, rather than market-purchased shares, to satisfy requirements under the drplus and employee benefit plans and expects to continue to do so through at least 2023. ameren also plans to issue incremental common equity to fund a portion of ameren missouri's wind generation investments. ameren, ameren missouri, and ameren illinois expect their respective equity to total capitalization levels over the period ending december 2023 to remain in-line with their respective equity to total capitalization levels as of december 31, 2018.
the use of cash provided by operating activities and short-term borrowings to fund capital expenditures and other long-term investments may periodically result in a working capital deficit, defined as current liabilities exceeding current assets, as was the case at december 31, 2018, for the ameren companies. the working capital deficit as of december 31, 2018, was primarily the result of current maturities of long-term debt and our decision to finance our businesses with lower-cost commercial paper issuances. with the credit capacity available under the credit agreements, along with cash and cash equivalents, ameren had net available liquidity of $1.5 billion at december 31, 2018. see credit facility borrowings and liquidity below for additional information.
the following table presents net cash provided by (used in) operating, investing and financing activities for the years ended december 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016:
net cash provided byoperating activities                                  net cash used ininvesting activities                              net cash provided by (used in) financing activities
cash flows from operating activities our cash provided by operating activities is affected by fluctuations of trade accounts receivable, inventories, and accounts and wages payable, among other things, as well as the unique regulatory environment for each of our businesses. substantially all expenditures related to fuel, purchased power, and natural gas purchased for resale are recovered from customers through rate adjustment mechanisms, which may be adjusted without a traditional rate proceeding. similar regulatory mechanisms exist for certain operating expenses that can also affect the timing of cash provided by operating activities. the timing of cash payments for costs recoverable under our regulatory mechanisms differs from the recovery period of those costs. additionally, the seasonality of our electric and natural gas businesses, primarily caused by changes in customer demand due to weather, significantly affect the amount and timing of our cash provided by operating activities. see part 1, item 1, and note 1 - summary of significant accounting policies and note 2 - rate and regulatory matters under part ii, item 8, of this report for more information about our rate-adjustment mechanisms.
ameren ameren's cash from operating activities increased $52 million in 2018 compared with 2017. the following items contributed to the increase:

•   a $40 million decrease resulting from income tax payments of $21 million in 2018, compared with income tax refunds of $19 million in 2017, primarily due to state income tax refunds and the sale of state tax credits.
•   a $25 million increase in energy center maintenance costs at ameren missouri, primarily due to higher-than-normal, non-nuclear scheduled outage costs, and an increase in routine maintenance work.
ameren missouri ameren missouri's cash from operating activities increased $243 million in 2018 compared with 2017. the following items contributed to the increase:
•   a $136 million increase resulting from electric and natural gas margins, as discussed in results of operations, excluding certain noncash items, as well as the change in customer receivable balances.
•   a net $95 million increase resulting from net energy costs and associated collections from customers under the fac.

•   a $27 million decrease in payments for scheduled nuclear refueling and maintenance outages at the callaway energy center. there was no refueling and maintenance outage in 2018; however, there were cash expenditures related to the 2019 scheduled outage paid in 2018.
the increase was partially offset by a $25 million increase in energy center maintenance costs, primarily due to higher-than-normal nonnuclear scheduled outage costs, and an increase in routine maintenance work between periods.
ameren illinois ameren illinois' cash from operating activities decreased $169 million in 2018 compared with 2017. the following items contributed to the decrease:

•   a net $83 million decrease resulting from costs and associated collections under various cost recovery mechanisms from ameren missouri and ameren illinois customers.
•   the absence of a $42 million insurance receipt received in 2016 at ameren missouri related to the taum sauk breach that occurred in december 2005.
•   refunds paid in 2017 of $21 million associated with the november 2013 ferc complaint case, as discussed in note 2 - rate and regulatory matters under part ii, item 8, of this report.

ameren missouri ameren missouri's cash from operating activities decreased $152 million in 2017 compared with 2016. the following items contributed to the decrease:
•   an increase in income tax payments of $151 million to ameren (parent) pursuant to the tax allocation agreement, primarily related to higher taxable income in 2017, because of significantly lower property-related deductions.
•   the absence of a $42 million insurance receipt received in 2016 related to the taum sauk breach that occurred in december 2005.
•   a net $47 million decrease resulting from costs and associated collections under various cost recovery mechanisms from customers.

pension plans ameren's pension plans are funded in compliance with income tax regulations, federal funding, and other regulatory requirements. as a result, ameren expects to fund its pension plans at a level equal to the greater of the pension cost or the legally required minimum contribution. based on ameren's assumptions at december 31, 2018, its investment performance in 2018, and its pension funding policy, ameren expects to make annual contributions of $20 million to $70 million in each of the next five years, with aggregate estimated contributions of $200 million. we estimate that ameren missouri's and ameren illinois' portions of the future funding requirements will be approximately 30% and 60%, respectively. these estimates may change based on actual investment performance, changes in interest rates, changes in our assumptions, changes in government regulations, and any voluntary contributions. in 2018, ameren contributed $60 million to its pension plans. see note 10 - retirement benefits under part ii, item 8, of this report for additional information.
ameren's cash used in investing activities increased $132 million during 2018 compared with 2017, primarily as a result of increased capital expenditures of $154 million, partially offset by an $11 million decrease due to the timing of nuclear fuel expenditures. increased capital expenditures at ameren missouri and ameren illinois, discussed below, were partially offset by a $171 million decrease in capital expenditures at atxi. atxi's capital expenditures decreased as a result of decreased expenditures on the illinois rivers and spoon river projects. the spoon river project was placed in service in february 2018.
ameren missouri's cash used in investing activities increased $292 million during 2018 compared with 2017, primarily due to money pool activity and increased capital expenditures. during 2018, ameren missouri had no money pool activity, compared with $161 million in returns of net money pool advances received during 2017. additionally, capital expenditures increased $141 million between periods, primarily related to energy center projects and electric distribution system reliability projects. the increase in capital expenditures was partially offset by an $11 million decrease due to the timing of nuclear fuel expenditures.
ameren illinois' cash used in investing activities increased $178 million during 2018 compared with 2017 due to an increase in capital expenditures of $182 million, primarily related to substation upgrades, upgrades to natural gas main infrastructure, and electric transmission system reliability projects.
ameren's cash used in investing activities increased $46 million during 2017 compared with 2016, primarily as a result of increased capital expenditures of $56 million. increased capital expenditures at ameren missouri and ameren illinois, discussed below, were partially offset by a $127 million decrease in capital expenditures at atxi. reduced spending on atxi's illinois rivers project was partially offset by an increase in spending on its spoon river project.
ameren missouri's cash used in investing activities decreased $253 million during 2017 compared with 2016, primarily because of net money pool advances. during 2017, ameren missouri received $161 million in returns of net money pool advances compared with investing $125 million in net money pool advances in 2016. this decrease was partially offset by a $35 million increase in capital expenditures, primarily related to electric distribution and transmission system reliability projects and energy center projects.
ameren illinois' cash used in investing activities increased $152 million during 2017 compared with 2016 because of increased capital expenditures, primarily related to electric transmission system reliability projects and natural gas infrastructure projects.

the following table presents ameren's estimate of capital expenditures that will be incurred from 2019 through 2023, including construction expenditures, allowance for funds used during construction, and expenditures for compliance with existing environmental regulations:
ameren missouri's estimated capital expenditures include transmission, distribution, grid modernization, and generation-related investments, as well as expenditures for compliance with environmental regulations. in addition, ameren missouri's estimated capital expenditures include approximately $1 billion in wind generation investments expected in 2020. ameren illinois' estimated capital expenditures are primarily for electric and natural gas transmission and distribution-related investments, capital expenditures to modernize its distribution system pursuant to the ieima, and capital expenditures for qualified investments in natural gas infrastructure under the qip rider. atxi's estimated capital expenditures include expenditures for the two miso-approved multi-value transmission projects. for additional information regarding ameren missouri's build-transfer wind agreements, ieima capital expenditure requirements, the qip rider, and atxi's transmission projects, see part i, item 1, of this report.
ameren missouri continually reviews its generation portfolio and expected power needs. as a result, ameren missouri could modify its plan for generation capacity, the type of generation asset technology that will be employed, and whether capacity or power may be purchased, among other changes. additionally, we continually review the reliability of our transmission and distribution systems, expected capacity needs, and opportunities for transmission investments within and outside our service territories. the timing and amount of investments could vary because of changes in expected capacity, the condition of transmission and distribution systems, and our ability and willingness to pursue transmission investments, among other factors. any changes in future generation, transmission, or distribution needs could result in significant changes in capital expenditures or losses, which could be material. compliance with environmental regulations could also have significant impacts on the level of capital expenditures.
environmental capital expenditures ameren missouri will continue to incur costs to comply with federal and state regulations, including those requiring the reduction of so2, nox, and mercury emissions from its coal-fired energy centers. see note 14 - commitments and contingencies under part ii, item 8, of this report for a discussion of existing and proposed environmental laws that affect, or may affect, our facilities and capital expenditures to comply with such laws.
cash flows from financing activities cash provided by, or used in, financing activities is a result of our financing needs, which depend on the level of cash provided by operating activities, the level of cash used in investing activities, the level of dividends, and our long-term debt maturities, among other things.

credit facility borrowings and liquidity the liquidity needs of ameren, ameren missouri, and ameren illinois are typically supported through the use of available cash, or proceeds from borrowings under the credit agreements, commercial paper issuances and/or, in the case of ameren missouri and ameren illinois, short-term affiliate borrowings. see note 4 - short-term debt and liquidity under part ii, item 8, of this report for additional
information on credit agreements, commercial paper issuances, borrowings under ameren's money pool arrangements, and relevant interest rates.
the following table presents ameren's consolidated net available liquidity as of december 31, 2018:
missouri credit agreement - borrowing capacity                            $1,000
less: letters of credit                                                        7
illinois credit agreement - borrowing capacity                             1,100
less: letters of credit                                                        2
(a)   the maximum aggregate amount available to ameren (parent) and ameren missouri under the missouri credit agreement is $700 million and $800 million, respectively. see note 4 - short-term debt and liquidity under part ii, item 8, of this report for further discussion of the credit agreements.
(b)   the maximum aggregate amount available to ameren (parent) and ameren illinois under the illinois credit agreement is $500 million and $800 million, respectively. see note 4 - short-term debt and liquidity under part ii, item 8, of this report for further discussion of the credit agreements.
in december 2018, the credit agreements, which were scheduled to mature in december 2021, were extended and now mature in december 2022. the credit agreements provide $2.1 billion of credit cumulatively through maturity. the maturity date may be extended for an additional one-year period upon mutual consent of the borrowers and lenders. borrowings by ameren (parent) under either of the credit agreements are due and payable no later than the maturity date, while borrowings by ameren missouri and ameren illinois are due and payable no later than the earlier of the maturity date or 364 days after the date of such borrowing (subject to the right of each borrower to re-borrow in accordance with the terms of the applicable credit agreement). the credit agreements are used to borrow cash, to issue letters of credit, and to support issuances under ameren (parent)'s, ameren missouri's, and ameren illinois' commercial paper programs. both of the credit agreements are available to ameren (parent) to support issuances under ameren (parent)'s commercial paper program, subject to available credit capacity under the agreements. the missouri credit agreement is available to support issuances under ameren missouri's commercial paper program. the illinois credit agreement is available to support issuances under ameren illinois' commercial paper program. issuances under the ameren (parent), ameren missouri, and ameren illinois commercial paper programs were available at lower interest rates than the interest rates of borrowings under the credit agreements. commercial paper issuances were thus preferred to credit facility borrowings as a source of third-party short-term debt.
ameren has a money pool agreement with and among its utility subsidiaries to coordinate and to provide for certain short-term cash and working capital requirements. as short-term capital needs arise, and based on availability of funding sources, ameren missouri and ameren illinois will access funds from the utility money pool, the credit agreements, or the commercial paper programs depending on which option has the lowest interest rates. see note 4 - short-term debt and liquidity under part ii, item 8, of this report for a detailed explanation of the utility money pool arrangement.
the issuance of short-term debt securities by ameren's utility subsidiaries is subject to ferc approval under the federal power act. in 2018, the ferc issued orders authorizing ameren missouri and ameren illinois to each issue up to $1 billion of short-term debt securities through march 2020 and september 2020, respectively. in june 2017, the ferc issued an order authorizing atxi to issue up to $300 million of short-term debt securities through july 2019.
the ameren companies continually evaluate the adequacy and appropriateness of their liquidity arrangements for changing business conditions. when business conditions warrant, changes may be made to existing credit agreements or to other short-term borrowing arrangements.
long-term debt and equity the following table presents ameren's equity issuances, as well as issuances (net of issuance premiums or discounts), redemptions, repurchases, and maturities of long-term debt for the years ended december 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016. for additional information related to the terms and uses of these issuances and effective registration statements, see note 5 - long-term debt and equity financings under part ii, item 8, of this report. for information on capital contributions received by ameren missouri and ameren illinois from ameren (parent), see note 13 - related-party transactions under part ii, item 8 of this report.

the ameren companies may sell securities registered under their effective registration statements if market conditions and capital requirements warrant such sales. any offer and sale will be made only by means of a prospectus that meets the requirements of the securities act of 1933 and the rules and regulations thereunder.
indebtedness provisions and other covenants at december 31, 2018, the ameren companies were in compliance with the provisions and covenants contained within their credit agreements, indentures, and articles of incorporation, as applicable, and atxi was in compliance with the provisions and covenants contained in its note purchase agreement. see note 4 - short-term debt and liquidity and note 5 - long-term debt and equity financings under part ii, item 8, of this report for a discussion of covenants and provisions (and applicable cross-default provisions) contained in our credit agreements, certain of the ameren companies' indentures and articles of incorporation, and atxi's note purchase agreement.
we consider access to short-term and long-term capital markets to be a significant source of funding for capital requirements not satisfied by cash provided by our operating activities. inability to raise capital on reasonable terms, particularly during times of uncertainty in
the capital markets, could negatively affect our ability to maintain and expand our businesses. after assessing its current operating performance, liquidity, and credit ratings (see credit ratings below), ameren, ameren missouri, and ameren illinois each believes that it will continue to have access to the capital markets. however, events beyond ameren's, ameren missouri's, and ameren illinois' control may create uncertainty in the capital markets or make access to the capital markets uncertain or limited. such events could increase our cost of capital and adversely affect our ability to access the capital markets.
the amount and timing of dividends payable on ameren's common stock are within the sole discretion of ameren's board of directors. ameren's board of directors has not set specific targets or payout parameters when declaring common stock dividends, but it considers various factors, including ameren's overall payout ratio, payout ratios of our peers, projected cash flow and potential future cash flow requirements, historical earnings and cash flow, projected earnings, impacts of regulatory orders or legislation, and other key business considerations. ameren expects its dividend payout ratio to be between 55% and 70% of earnings over the next few years. on february 8, 2019, the board of directors of ameren declared a quarterly dividend on ameren's common stock of 47.5 cents per share, payable on march 29, 2019, to shareholders of record on march 13, 2019.
certain of our financial agreements and corporate organizational documents contain covenants and conditions that, among other things, restrict the ameren companies' payment of dividends in certain circumstances.
ameren illinois' articles of incorporation require its dividend payments on common stock to be based on ratios of common stock to total capitalization and other provisions with respect to certain operating expenses and accumulations of earned surplus. additionally, ameren has committed to the ferc to maintain a minimum of 30% equity in the capital structure at ameren illinois.
ameren missouri and ameren illinois, as well as certain other nonregistrant ameren subsidiaries, are subject to section 305(a) of the federal power act, which makes it unlawful for any officer or director of a public utility, as defined in the federal power act, to participate in the making or paying of any dividend from any funds "properly included in capital account." the ferc has consistently interpreted the provision to allow dividends to be paid as long as (1) the source of the dividends is clearly disclosed, (2) the dividends are not excessive, and (3) there is no self-dealing on the part of corporate officials. at a minimum, ameren believes that dividends can be paid by its subsidiaries that are public utilities from net income and from retained earnings. in addition, under illinois law, ameren illinois and atxi may not pay any dividend on their respective stock unless, among other things, their respective earnings and earned surplus are sufficient to declare and pay a dividend after provisions are made for reasonable and proper reserves, or unless ameren illinois or atxi has specific authorization from the icc.
at december 31, 2018, the amount of restricted net assets of ameren's subsidiaries that may not be distributed to ameren in the form of a loan or dividend was $2.8 billion.
ameren missouri and ameren illinois each have issued preferred stock, which provides for cumulative preferred stock dividends. each company's board of directors considers the declaration of preferred stock dividends to shareholders of record on a certain date, stating the date on which the dividend is payable and the amount to be paid. see note 5 - long-term debt and equity financings under part ii, item 8, of this report for further detail concerning the preferred stock issuances.
contractual obligations the following table presents our contractual obligations as of december 31, 2018. see note 10 - retirement benefits under part ii, item 8, of this report for information regarding expected minimum funding levels for our pension plans, which are not included in the table below. in addition, routine short-term purchase order commitments are not included.

(b)   excludes unamortized discount and premium and debt issuance costs of $70 million, $31 million, and $34 million at ameren, ameren missouri, and ameren illinois, respectively. see note 5 - long-term debt and equity financings under part ii, item 8 of this report, for discussion of items included herein.
(c)   the weighted-average variable-rate debt has been calculated using the interest rate as of december 31, 2018.
(d)   see other obligations in note 14 - commitments and contingencies under part ii, item 8 of this report, for discussion of items included herein.
off-balance-sheet arrangements at december 31, 2018, none of the ameren companies had any significant off-balance-sheet financing arrangements, other than operating leases entered into in the ordinary course of business, variable interest entities, letters of credit, and ameren (parent) guarantee arrangements on behalf of its subsidiaries. see note 1 - summary of significant accounting policies under part ii, item 8, of this report for further detail concerning variable interest entities.
credit ratings our credit ratings affect our liquidity, our access to the capital markets and credit markets, our cost of borrowing under our credit facilities and our commercial paper programs, and our collateral posting requirements under commodity contracts.
the following table presents the principal credit ratings of the ameren companies by moody's and s&p effective on the date of this report:
issuer credit rating             a2        not rated senior unsecured debt            a2        not rated a credit rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell, or hold securities. it should be evaluated independently of any other rating. ratings are subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the rating organization.
collateral postings any weakening of our credit ratings may reduce access to capital and trigger additional collateral postings and prepayments. such changes may also increase the cost of borrowing, resulting in an adverse effect on earnings. cash collateral postings and prepayments made with external parties, including postings related to exchange-traded contracts, and cash collateral posted by external parties were immaterial at december 31, 2018. a sub-investment-grade issuer or senior unsecured debt rating (below "baa3" from moody's or below "bbb-" from s&p) at december 31, 2018, could have resulted in ameren, ameren missouri, or ameren illinois being required to post additional collateral or other assurances for certain trade obligations amounting to $94 million, $64 million, and $30 million, respectively.
changes in commodity prices could trigger additional collateral postings and prepayments. based on credit ratings at december 31, 2018, if market prices were 15% higher or lower than december 31, 2018, levels in the next 12 months and 20% higher or lower thereafter through the end of the term of the commodity contracts, then ameren, ameren missouri, or ameren illinois could be required to post an immaterial amount, compared to each company's liquidity, of collateral or provide other assurances for certain trade obligations.
outlook we seek to earn competitive returns on investments in our businesses. we seek to improve our regulatory frameworks and cost recovery mechanisms and are simultaneously pursuing constructive regulatory outcomes within existing frameworks, while also advocating for responsible energy policies. we align our overall spending, both operating and capital, with economic conditions and with the frameworks established by our regulators, to create and capitalize on investment opportunities for the benefit of our customers and shareholders. we focus on minimizing the gap between allowed and earned returns on equity and allocating capital resources to business opportunities that we expect will offer the most attractive risk-adjusted return potential.
as part of ameren's strategic plan, we pursue projects to meet our customers' energy needs and to improve electric and natural gas system reliability, safety, and security within our service territories. ameren also evaluates competitive electric transmission investment opportunities as they arise. additionally, ameren missouri expects to make investments over time that will enable it to transition to a more diverse energy generation portfolio, including investments in renewable energy resources and the retirement of its coal-fired generation at the end of each energy center's useful life.
below are some key trends, events, and uncertainties that may reasonably affect our results of operations, financial condition, or liquidity, as well as our ability to achieve strategic and financial objectives, for 2019 and beyond.
•   on june 1, 2018, missouri senate bill 564 was enacted. the provision of the law applicable to the tcja was effective immediately; the remaining provisions, including the ability to elect pisa, became effective august 28, 2018. the law required the mopsc to authorize a reduction in ameren missouri's rates to pass through the effect of the tcja within 90 days of the law's effective date. in july 2018, the mopsc authorized ameren missouri to reduce its annual revenue requirement by $167 million and reflect that reduction in rates beginning august 1, 2018. the reduction included $74 million for the amortization of excess accumulated deferred income taxes. in addition, ameren missouri recorded a reduction to revenue and a corresponding regulatory liability of $60 million for the excess amounts collected in rates related to the tcja from january 1, 2018, through july 31, 2018. the regulatory liability will be reflected in customer rates over a period of time to be determined by the mopsc in the next regulatory rate review. pursuant to its pisa election, ameren missouri is permitted to defer and recover 85% of the depreciation expense and a weighted-average cost of capital return on rate base on certain property, plant, and equipment placed in service after september 1, 2018, and not included in base rates. accumulated pisa deferrals earn carrying costs at the weighted-average cost of capital, and all approved pisa deferrals will be added to rate base prospectively and recovered over a period of 20 years following a regulatory rate review. pisa mitigates the impacts of regulatory lag between regulatory rate reviews. the remaining 15% of certain property, plant, and equipment placed in service and not eligible for recovery under pisa, unless eligible for recovery under the resram, remain subject to regulatory lag. as a result of the pisa election, additional provisions of the new law apply to ameren missouri, including limitations on electric customer rate increases and an electric base rate freeze until april 2020. both the rate increase limitation and pisa are effective through december 2023, unless ameren missouri requests and receives mopsc approval of an extension through december 2028. see note 2 - rate and regulatory matters under part ii, item 8, of this report for information regarding missouri senate bill 564.
•   in february 2019, ameren missouri announced its smart energy plan, which includes a five-year capital investment overview with a detailed one-year plan for 2019, designed to upgrade ameren missouri's electric infrastructure. the plan includes investments that will upgrade the grid and accommodate more renewable energy. investments under the plan are expected to total approximately $6.3 billion over the five-year period from 2019 through 2023, with costs largely recoverable under pisa and, for the portion of wind and other renewable generation investments that are not recoverable under pisa, recoverable under the resram.
•   in june 2018, the mopsc approved ameren missouri's renewable choice program, which allows large commercial and industrial customers and municipalities to elect to receive up to 100% of their energy from renewable resources. the tariff-based program is designed to recover the costs of the election, net of changes in the market price of such energy. based on customer contracts, the program enables ameren missouri to supply up to 400 megawatts of renewable wind energy generation, up to 200 megawatts of which it could own. as applicable, the addition of generation by ameren missouri would be subject to the issuance of a certificate of convenience and necessity by the mopsc, obtaining transmission interconnection agreements with miso or other rtos, and ferc approval. this generation would be incremental to estimated capital expenditures through 2023 discussed below. ameren missouri anticipates finalizing customer interest and pursuing renewable energy projects to fulfill requirements in 2019. without extension, the option to elect into the program will terminate in the third quarter of 2023.
•   in december 2018, the mopsc issued an order approving ameren missouri's meeia 2019 plan. the plan includes a portfolio of customer energy-efficiency programs through december 2021 and low-income customer energy-efficiency programs through december 2024, along with a regulatory recovery mechanism. ameren missouri intends to invest $226 million over the life of the plan, including $65 million per year through 2021. the plan includes the continued use of the meeia rider, which allows ameren missouri to collect from, or refund to, customers any difference in actual meeia program costs and related lost electric margins and the amounts collected from customers. in addition, the plan includes a performance incentive that provides ameren missouri an opportunity to earn additional revenues by achieving certain customer energy-efficiency goals, including $30 million if 100% of the goals are achieved during the period ended december 2021. additional revenues may be earned if ameren missouri exceeds 100% of its energy savings goals.
•   ameren continues to make significant investments in ferc regulated electric transmission businesses. ameren illinois expects to invest $2.2 billion in electric transmission assets from 2019 through 2023, to replace aging infrastructure and improve reliability. atxi has three miso-approved multi-value projects: the spoon river, illinois rivers, and mark twain projects. the spoon river project, located in northwest illinois, was placed in service in february 2018. the illinois rivers project involves the construction of a transmission line from eastern missouri across illinois to western indiana. construction of the illinois rivers project is substantially complete, with the last section awaiting the outcome of certain legal proceedings, which will delay the expected completion date to 2020. this delay is not expected to materially affect 2019 rate base or earnings. the mark twain project involves the construction of a transmission line from northeast missouri, connecting the illinois rivers project to iowa. construction of the mark twain project began in the second quarter of 2018, and is expected to be completed by the end of 2019. atxi's expected remaining investment in its multi-value projects is approximately $150 million in 2019, with the total investment expected to be more than $1.6 billion.
•   ameren illinois and atxi use a forward-looking rate calculation with an annual revenue requirement reconciliation for each company's electric transmission business. based on expected rate base growth and the currently allowed 10.82% return on common equity, the
2019 revenue requirements included in rates for ameren illinois' and atxi's electric transmission businesses are $297 million and $177 million, respectively. these revenue requirements represent an increase in ameren illinois' and atxi's revenue requirements of $24 million and $3 million, respectively, primarily because of the rate base growth. these rates will affect ameren illinois' and atxi's cash receipts during 2019, but will not determine their respective electric transmission service operating revenues, which will instead be based on 2019 actual recoverable costs, rate base, and return on common equity as calculated under the ferc formula ratemaking framework.
•   the return on common equity for miso transmission owners, including ameren illinois and atxi, is the subject of a ferc complaint case filed in february 2015 challenging the allowed base return on common equity. ameren illinois and atxi currently use the ferc authorized total allowed return on common equity of 10.82% in customer rates. a final ferc order would establish the allowed return on common equity to be applied to the 15-month period from february 2015 to may 2016 and also establish the return on common equity to be included in customer rates prospectively from the effective date of such order, replacing the current 10.82% total return on common equity. in october 2018, the ferc issued an order addressing the remanded issues in an unrelated case. that order proposed a new methodology for determining the base return on equity and required further briefs from the participants. in november 2018, the ferc issued an order related to the february 2015 complaint case and the september 2016 final order, which required briefs from the participants to be filed in february 2019 regarding a new methodology for determining the base return on common equity and whether and how to apply the new methodology to the two miso complaint cases. ameren is unable to predict the ultimate impact of the proposed methodology on these complaint cases at this time. as the ferc is under no deadline to issue a final order, the timing of the issuance of the final order in the february 2015 complaint case, or any potential impact to the amounts refunded as a result of the september 2016 final order, is uncertain. see note 2 - rate and regulatory matters under part ii, item 8, of this report for information regarding ferc complaint cases. a 50 basis point reduction in the ferc-allowed base return on common equity would reduce ameren's and ameren illinois' net income by an estimated $9 million and $5 million, respectively, based on each company's 2019 projected rate base.
•   in november 2018, the icc issued an order in ameren illinois' annual update filing that approved a $72 million increase in ameren illinois' electric distribution service rates beginning in january 2019. however, illinois law provides for an annual reconciliation of the electric distribution revenue requirement as is necessary to reflect the actual costs incurred and investment return in a given year with the revenue requirement that was reflected in customer rates for that year. consequently, ameren illinois' 2019 electric distribution service revenues will be based on its 2019 actual recoverable costs, rate base, and return on common equity as calculated under the illinois performance-based formula ratemaking framework. the 2019 revenue requirement is expected to be higher than the 2018 revenue requirement because of an expected increase in recoverable costs, expected rate base growth of approximately 8%, and an expected increase in the annual average of the monthly yields of the 30-year united states treasury bonds. the 2019 revenue requirement reconciliation is expected to result in a regulatory asset that will be collected from customers in 2021. a 50 basis point change in the annual average of the monthly yields of the 30-year united states treasury bonds would result in an estimated $8 million change in ameren's and ameren illinois' net income, based on ameren illinois' 2019 projected year-end rate base.
•   ameren illinois is allowed to earn a return on its electric energy-efficiency program investments. ameren illinois' electric energy-efficiency investments are deferred as a regulatory asset and earn a return at its weighted-average cost of capital, with the equity return based on the annual average of the monthly yields of the 30-year united states treasury bonds plus 580 basis points. the equity portion of ameren illinois' return on electric energy-efficiency investments can be increased or decreased by up to 200 basis points, depending on the achievement of annual energy savings goals. pursuant to the feja, ameren illinois plans to invest up to $100 million per year in electric energy-efficiency programs through 2023 and will earn a return on those investments. the icc has the ability to reduce electric energy-efficiency savings goals if there are insufficient cost-effective programs available or if the savings goals would require investment levels that exceed amounts allowed by legislation. the electric energy-efficiency program investments and the return on those investments are collected from customers through a rider and are not included in the electric distribution formula ratemaking framework. see note 2 - rate and regulatory matters under part ii, item 8, of this report for information regarding ameren illinois' energy-efficiency program.
•   in november 2018, the icc issued an order approving a stipulation and agreement that resulted in an annual natural gas rate increase of $32 million, based on a 9.87% return on common equity, a capital structure composed of 50% common equity, and a rate base of $1.6 billion. this increase reflects the reduction in the federal statutory corporate income tax rate enacted under the tcja, as well as the increase in the illinois corporate income tax rate that became effective in july 2017, which collectively decreased annual rates by approximately $17 million. the new customer rates were effective in november 2018. as a result of this order, the rate base under the qip rider was reset to zero. ameren illinois used a 2019 future test year in this proceeding.
•   ameren missouri's next scheduled refueling and maintenance outage at its callaway energy center is scheduled for the spring of 2019. during the 2017 refueling, ameren missouri incurred maintenance expenses of $35 million. during a scheduled refueling, which occurs every 18 months, maintenance expenses increase relative to non-outage years. additionally, depending on the availability of its other generation sources and the market prices for power, ameren missouri's purchased power costs may increase and the amount of excess
power available for sale may decrease versus non-outage years. changes in purchased power costs and excess power available for sale are included in the fac, which results in limited impacts to earnings. in addition, ameren missouri may incur increased nonnuclear energy center maintenance costs in non-outage years.
•   ameren missouri expects to realize lower costs of fuel for generation through 2023, compared to 2018 levels, based on coal and related transportation contracts and management's outlook for future prices. substantially all the benefit of these lower costs would be passed through to customers through the fac.
•   ameren missouri and ameren illinois continue to make infrastructure investments and expect to seek regular electric and natural gas rate increases to recover the cost of investments and earn an adequate return. ameren missouri and ameren illinois will also seek legislative solutions, as necessary, to address regulatory lag and to support investment in their utility infrastructure for the benefit of their customers. ameren missouri and ameren illinois continue to face cost recovery pressures, including limited economic growth in their service territories, customer conservation efforts, the impacts of additional customer energy-efficiency programs, and increased customer use of increasingly cost-effective technological advances, including private generation and energy storage. however, over the long-term, we expect the decreased demand to be partially offset by increased demand resulting from increased electrification of the economy for efficiencies and as a means to address co2 emission concerns. increased investments, including expected future investments for environmental compliance, system reliability improvements, and potential new generation sources, result in rate base and revenue growth but also higher depreciation and financing costs.
for additional information regarding recent rate orders, lawsuits, and pending requests filed with state and federal regulatory commissions, see note 2 - rate and regulatory matters under part ii, item 8, of this report.
liquidity and capital resources
•   ameren missouri's 2017 irp targets cleaner and more diverse sources of energy generation, including solar, wind, natural gas, hydro, and nuclear power. it also includes expanding renewable sources by adding at least 700 megawatts of wind generation by the end of 2020 in missouri and neighboring states and adding 100 megawatts of solar generation by 2027. these new renewable energy sources would support ameren missouri's compliance with the state of missouri's requirement of achieving 15% of native load sales from renewable energy sources by 2021, subject to customer rate increase limitations. based on current and projected market prices for energy and for wind and solar generation technologies, among other factors, ameren missouri expects its ownership of these renewable resources would represent the lowest-cost option for customers. the plan also provides for the expected implementation of continued customer energy-efficiency programs. ameren missouri's plan for the addition of renewable resources could be affected by, among other factors: the availability of federal production and investment tax credits related to renewable energy and ameren missouri's ability to use such credits; the cost of wind and solar generation technologies; energy prices; ameren missouri's ability to obtain timely interconnection agreements with miso or other rtos, as well as the cost of such interconnections; and ameren missouri's ability to obtain a certificate of convenience and necessity from the mopsc, and any other required project approvals.
•   in connection with the 2017 irp filing, ameren missouri established a goal of reducing co2 emissions 80% by 2050 from a 2005 base level. ameren missouri is also targeting a 35% co2 emission reduction by 2030 and a 50% reduction by 2040 from the 2005 level. in order to meet these goals, among other things, ameren missouri expects to retire its coal-fired generation at the end of each energy center's useful life.
•   in the second quarter of 2018, ameren missouri entered into a build-transfer agreement with a subsidiary of terra-gen, llc to acquire, after construction, a 400-megawatt wind generation facility, which is expected to be located in northeastern missouri. in october 2018, the mopsc issued an order approving a unanimous stipulation and agreement regarding a requested certificate of convenience and necessity for the facility. in december 2018, ameren missouri received ferc approval to acquire the facility after construction. a transmission interconnection agreement with the miso for this facility is expected in the fall of 2019. also, in october 2018, ameren missouri entered into a build-transfer agreement with a subsidiary of edf renewables, inc. to acquire, after construction, a wind generation facility of up to 157 megawatts. in february 2019, ameren missouri filed with the mopsc a nonunanimous stipulation and agreement regarding a requested certificate of convenience and necessity for the facility. the up to 157-megawatt facility is expected to be located in northwestern missouri. a transmission interconnection agreement with the miso for this facility is expected in early 2020. both facilities are expected to be completed by the end of 2020 and would help ameren missouri comply with the missouri renewable energy standard. each acquisition is subject to certain conditions, including entering into a miso transmission interconnection agreement at an acceptable cost for each facility and obtaining ferc approval and the issuance of a certificate of convenience and necessity by the mopsc for the up to 157-megawatt facility, as well as other customary contract terms and conditions. these agreements collectively represent approximately $1 billion in capital expenditures expected in 2020, which is included in ameren missouri's smart energy plan. in october and december 2018, the mopsc issued orders approving a resram that allows ameren missouri to adjust customer rates on an annual basis without a traditional regulatory rate review. the resram is designed to mitigate the impacts of regulatory lag for the cost of compliance with renewable energy standards, including recovery of investments in wind and
other renewable generation, by providing more timely recovery of costs and a return on investments not already provided for in customer rates or recovered under pisa.
•   through 2023, we expect to make significant capital expenditures to improve our electric and natural gas utility infrastructure, with a major portion directed to our transmission and distribution systems. we estimate that we will invest up to $13.9 billion (ameren missouri - up to $7.1 billion; ameren illinois - up to $6.6 billion; atxi - up to $0.2 billion) of capital expenditures during the period from 2019 through 2023. any additional wind generation investments by ameren missouri beyond the two facilities that ameren missouri has agreed to acquire after construction would be incremental to these estimates.
•   environmental regulations, including those related to co2 emissions, or other actions taken by the epa, could result in significant increases in capital expenditures and operating costs. certain of these regulations are being challenged through litigation, are being reviewed or recommended for repeal by the epa or new replacement or alternative regulations are being contemplated or proposed by the epa and state regulators; therefore, the ultimate implementation of any of these regulations, as well as the timing of any such implementation, is uncertain. however, the individual or combined effects of existing and new environmental regulations could result in significant capital expenditures, increased operating costs, or the closure or alteration of some of ameren missouri's coal-fired energy centers. ameren missouri's capital expenditures are subject to mopsc prudence reviews, which could result in cost disallowances as well as regulatory lag. the cost of ameren illinois' purchased power and natural gas purchased for resale could increase. however, ameren illinois expects that these costs would be recovered from customers with no material adverse effect on its results of operations, financial position, or liquidity. ameren's and ameren missouri's earnings could benefit from increased investment to comply with environmental regulations if those investments are reflected and recovered on a timely basis in customer rates.
•   the ameren companies have multiyear credit agreements that cumulatively provide $2.1 billion of credit through december 2022, subject to a 364-day repayment term for ameren missouri and ameren illinois, with the option to seek incremental commitments to increase the cumulative credit provided to $2.5 billion. see note 4 - short-term debt and liquidity under part ii, item 8, of this report for additional information regarding the credit agreements. ameren, ameren missouri, and ameren illinois believe that their liquidity is adequate given their expected operating cash flows, capital expenditures, and related financing plans. however, there can be no assurance that significant changes in economic conditions, disruptions in the capital and credit markets, or other unforeseen events will not materially affect their ability to execute their expected operating, capital, or financing plans.
•   federal income tax legislation enacted under the tcja will continue to have significant impacts on our results of operations, financial position, liquidity, and financial metrics. the tcja, among other things, reduced the federal statutory corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%, effective january 1, 2018. customer rates were reduced to reflect the lower income tax rate, without a corresponding reduction in income tax payments because of our use of net operating losses and tax credit carryforwards until about 2020. customer rates were also reduced to reflect the return of excess deferred taxes. the result of these customer rate reductions is a decrease in operating cash flows in the near term. over time, the decrease in operating cash flows will be offset as temporary differences between book and taxable income reverse, and by increased customer rates due to higher rate base amounts resulting from lower accumulated deferred income tax liabilities.
•   ameren missouri expects a decrease in operating cash flows of approximately $100 million in 2019 compared with 2018, as a result of the tcja. over time, the decrease in operating cash flows will be offset as temporary differences between book and taxable income reverse, and by increased customer rates due to higher rate base amounts, once approved by the mopsc, resulting from lower accumulated deferred income tax liabilities.
•   the following table presents the net regulatory liabilities associated with excess deferred taxes as of december 31, 2018, and the related amortization periods:
•   in 2018, our rate-regulated businesses began to amortize excess deferred taxes. ameren illinois and atxi's 2018 income tax expense reflect a full year of amortization, while ameren missouri's 2018 income tax expense reflects five months of amortization related to its electric business, in accordance with a mopsc order received in july 2018. the amortization of such balances related to ameren missouri's gas business started in january 2019, in accordance with a mopsc order received in december 2018. these amortizations reduce our income tax expense and effective tax rates. due to formula ratemaking, ameren illinois electric distribution and ameren transmission have an offsetting reduction in revenue from customers, with no overall impact on earnings. ameren missouri and ameren
illinois natural gas 2019 interim period earnings may be affected by timing differences between income tax expense and revenue reductions based on their revenue patterns; however, no material impact to year-over-year earnings is expected.
•   as of december 31, 2018, ameren had $91 million in tax benefits from federal and state net operating loss carryforwards and $127 million in federal and state income tax credit carryforwards. these carryforwards are expected to largely offset income tax obligations in 2019. ameren does not expect to make material federal or state income tax payments over the next five years based on planned capital expenditures and related income tax credits. consistent with the tax allocation agreement between ameren (parent) and its subsidiaries, ameren missouri expects to make material income tax payments to ameren (parent) in 2019 and 2020 and immaterial payments in 2021 through 2023 based on planned capital expenditures and related income tax credits, while ameren illinois expects to make material income tax payments to ameren (parent) in 2020 through 2023.
•   ameren expects its cash used for currently planned capital expenditures and dividends to exceed cash provided by operating activities over the next several years. to fund a portion of these cash requirements, beginning in the first quarter of 2018, ameren began using newly issued shares, rather than market-purchased shares, to satisfy requirements under its drplus and employee benefit plans and expects to continue to do so over the next five years. ameren also plans to issue incremental common equity to fund a portion of ameren missouri's wind generation investments. ameren, ameren missouri, and ameren illinois expect their respective equity to total capitalization levels over the period ending december 2023 to remain in-line with their respective equity to total capitalization levels as of december 31, 2018. ameren missouri and ameren illinois expect to fund cash flow needs through debt issuances, adjustments of dividends to ameren (parent), and/or capital contributions from ameren (parent).
the above items could have a material impact on our results of operations, financial position, and liquidity. additionally, in the ordinary course of business, we evaluate strategies to enhance our results of operations, financial position, and liquidity. these strategies may include acquisitions, divestitures, opportunities to reduce costs or increase revenues, and other strategic initiatives to increase ameren's shareholder value. we are unable to predict which, if any, of these initiatives will be executed. the execution of these initiatives may have a material impact on our future results of operations, financial position, or liquidity.
regulatory matters see note 2 - rate and regulatory matters under part ii, item 8, of this report.
accounting matters critical accounting estimates preparation of the financial statements and related disclosures in compliance with gaap requires the application of appropriate technical accounting rules and guidance, as well as the use of estimates. these estimates involve judgments regarding many factors that in and of themselves could materially affect the financial statements and disclosures. we have outlined below the critical accounting estimates that we believe are the most difficult, subjective, or complex. any change in the assumptions or judgments applied in determining the following matters, among others, could have a material impact on future financial results.
accounting estimate   uncertainties affecting application regulatory mechanisms and cost recovery we defer costs and recognize revenues that we intend to collect in future rates.
•   regulatory environment and external regulatory decisions and requirements
•   anticipated future regulatory decisions and our assessment of their impact
•   the impact of prudence reviews, complaint cases, limitations on electric rate increases in missouri, and opposition during the ratemaking process that may limit our ability to timely recover costs and earn a fair return on our investments
•   ameren illinois' assessment of and ability to estimate the current year's electric distribution service costs to be reflected in revenues and recovered from customers in a subsequent year under performance-based formula ratemaking framework
•   ameren illinois' and atxi's assessment of and ability to estimate the current year's electric transmission service costs to be reflected in revenues and recovered from customers in a subsequent year under the ferc ratemaking frameworks
•   ameren missouri's estimate of revenue recovery under the meeia plans basis for judgment the application of accounting guidance for rate-regulated businesses results in recording regulatory assets and liabilities. regulatory assets represent the deferral of incurred costs that are probable of future recovery in customer rates. regulatory assets are amortized as the incurred costs are recovered through customer rates. in some cases, we record regulatory assets before approval for recovery has been received from the applicable regulatory commission. we must use judgment to conclude that costs deferred as regulatory assets are probable of future recovery. we base our conclusion on certain factors including, but not limited to, orders issued by our regulatory commissions, legislation, or historical experience, as well as discussions with legal counsel. if facts and circumstances lead us to conclude that a recorded regulatory asset is no longer probable of recovery or that plant assets are probable of disallowance, we record a charge to earnings, which could be material. regulatory liabilities represent revenues received from customers to fund expected costs that have not yet been incurred or that are probable of future refunds to customers. we also recognize revenues for alternative revenue programs authorized by our regulators that allow for an automatic rate adjustment, are probable of recovery, and are collected within 24 months following the end of the annual period in which they are recognized. ameren illinois estimates its annual electric distribution revenue requirement under performance-based formula ratemaking for interim periods by using internal forecasted rate base and published forecasted data regarding the annual average of the monthly yields of the 30-year united states treasury bonds. ameren illinois estimates its annual revenue requirement as of december 31 of each year using that year's actual operating results and assesses the probability of recovery from or refund to customers that the icc will order at the end of the following year. variations in investments made or orders by the icc or courts can result in a subsequent change in ameren illinois' estimate. ameren illinois and atxi follow a similar process for their ferc rate-regulated electric transmission businesses. ameren missouri estimates electric margins resulting from its meeia customer energy-efficiency programs. ameren missouri uses a meeia rider to collect from, or refund to, customers any annual difference in the actual amounts incurred and the amounts collected from customers. see note 2 - rate and regulatory matters under part ii, item 8, of this report for quantification of these assets or liabilities for each of the ameren companies. see note 1 - summary of significant accounting policies under part ii, item 8, of this report for a listing of regulatory mechanisms used by ameren missouri and ameren illinois.
benefit plan accounting based on actuarial calculations, we accrue costs of providing future employee benefits for the benefit plans we offer our employees. see note 10 - retirement benefits under part ii, item 8, of this report.
•   future rate of return on pension and other plan assets
•   valuation inputs and assumptions used in the fair value measurements of plan assets, excluding those inputs that are readily observable
•   future compensation increase assumption
•   health care cost trend rates
•   timing of employee retirements and mortality assumptions
•   ability to recover certain benefit plan costs from our customers
•   changing market conditions that may affect investment and interest rate environments basis for judgment ameren has defined benefit pension and postretirement benefit plans covering substantially all of its union employees. ameren has defined benefit pension plans covering substantially all of its non-union employees and postretirement benefit plans covering non-union employees hired before october 2015. our ultimate selection of the discount rate, health care trend rate, and expected rate of return on pension and other postretirement benefit plan assets is based on our consistent application of assumption-setting methodologies and our review of available historical, current, and projected rates, as applicable. we also make mortality assumptions to estimate our pension and other postretirement benefit obligations. see note 10 - retirement benefits under part ii, item 8, of this report for these assumptions and the sensitivity of ameren's benefit plans to potential changes in these assumptions.
accounting for contingencies we make judgments and estimates in the recording and the disclosing of liabilities for claims, litigation, environmental remediation, the actions of various regulatory agencies, or other matters that occur in the normal course of business. we record a loss contingency when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and that the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated.
•   estimating financial impact of events
•   estimating likelihood of various potential outcomes
•   regulatory and political environments and requirements
•   outcome of legal proceedings, settlements, or other factors
•   changes in regulation, expected scope of work, technology or timing of environmental remediation basis for judgment the determination of a loss contingency requires significant judgment as to the expected outcome of the contingency in future periods. in making the determination as to the amount of potential loss and the probability of loss, we consider the nature of the litigation, the claim or assessment, opinions or views of legal counsel, and the expected outcome of potential litigation, among other things. if no estimate is better than another within our range of estimates, we record as our best estimate of a loss the minimum value of our estimated range of outcomes. as additional information becomes available, we reassess the potential liability related to the contingency and revise our estimates. the amount recorded for any contingency may differ from actual costs incurred when the contingency is resolved. contingencies are normally resolved over long periods of time. in our evaluation of legal matters, management consults with legal counsel and relies on analysis of relevant case law and legal precedents. see note 2 - rate and regulatory matters, note 9 - callaway energy center, and note 14 - commitments and contingencies under part ii, item 8, of this report for information on the ameren companies' contingencies.
accounting for income taxes we record a provision for income taxes, deferred tax assets and liabilities, and a valuation allowance against net deferred tax assets, if any. see note 12 - income taxes under part ii, item 8, of this report.
•   changes in business, industry, laws, technology, or economic and market conditions affecting forecasted financial condition and/or results of operations
•   estimates of the amount and character of future taxable income and forecasted use of our tax credit carryforwards
•   effectiveness of implementing tax planning strategies
•   changes in income tax laws, including amounts subject to income tax, and the regulatory treatment of any tax reform changes
•   results of audits and examinations by taxing authorities
basis for judgment the reporting of tax-related assets and liabilities requires the use of estimates and significant management judgment. deferred tax assets and liabilities are recorded to represent future effects on income taxes for temporary differences between the basis of assets for financial reporting and tax purposes. although management believes that current estimates for deferred tax assets and liabilities are reasonable, actual results could differ from these estimates for a variety of reasons, including: a change in forecasted financial condition and/or results of operations; changes in income tax laws, enacted tax rates or amounts subject to income tax; the form, structure, and timing of asset or stock sales or dispositions; changes in the regulatory treatment of any tax reform benefits; and changes resulting from audits and examinations by taxing authorities. valuation allowances against deferred tax assets are recorded when management concludes it is more likely than not such asset will not be realized in future periods. accounting for income taxes also requires that only tax benefits for positions taken or expected to be taken on tax returns that meet the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold can be recognized or continue to be recognized. management evaluates each position solely on the technical merits and facts and circumstances of the position, assuming that the position will be examined by a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information. significant judgment is required to determine recognition thresholds and the related amount of tax benefits to be recognized. at each period end, and as new developments occur, management reevaluates its tax positions. see note 12 - income taxes under part ii, item 8, of this report for the amount of deferred income taxes recorded at december 31, 2018.
impact of new accounting pronouncements see note 1 - summary of significant accounting policies under part ii, item 8, of this report.
effects of inflation and changing prices ameren's rates for retail electric and natural gas utility service are regulated by the mopsc and the icc. nonretail electric rates are regulated by the ferc. rate regulation is generally based on the recovery of historical or projected costs. as a result, revenue increases could lag behind changing prices. the current replacement cost of our utility plant substantially exceeds our recorded historical cost. under existing regulatory practice, only the historical cost of plant is recoverable from customers. as a result, customer rates designed to provide recovery of historical costs through depreciation might not be adequate to replace plant in future years.
ameren illinois participates in performance-based formula ratemaking for its electric distribution business and its electric energy-efficiency investments. within ameren illinois' formula ratemaking mechanisms, the annual average of the monthly yields of the 30-year united states treasury bonds are the basis for ameren illinois' return on equity. therefore, there is a direct correlation between the yield of united states treasury bonds, which are affected by inflation, and the annual return on equity applicable to ameren illinois' electric distribution business and electric energy-efficiency investments. ameren illinois' and atxi's electric transmission rates are determined pursuant to formula ratemaking. additionally, ameren illinois and atxi use a company-specific, forward-looking formula ratemaking framework in setting their transmission rates. these forward-looking rates are updated each january with forecasted information. a reconciliation during the year, which adjusts for the actual revenue requirement and for actual sales volumes, is used to adjust billing rates in a subsequent year.
ameren missouri recovers the cost of fuel for electric generation and the cost of purchased power by adjusting rates as allowed through the fac. however, the fac excludes substantially all transmission revenues and charges. ameren missouri is therefore exposed to transmission charges to the extent that they exceed transmission revenues. ameren illinois is required to purchase all of its expected power supply through procurement processes administered by the ipa. the cost of procured power can be affected by inflation. ameren illinois recovers power supply costs from electric customers by adjusting rates through a rider mechanism to accommodate changes in power prices.
in our missouri and illinois retail natural gas utility jurisdictions, changes in natural gas costs are generally reflected in billings to natural gas customers through pga clauses.
see part i, item 1, and note 2 - rate and regulatory matters under part ii, item 8, of this report for additional information on our cost recovery mechanisms.

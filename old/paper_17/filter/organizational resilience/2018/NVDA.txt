item 1a. risk factors in evaluating nvidia and our business, the following factors should be considered in addition to the other information in this annual report on form 10-k. before you buy our common stock, you should know that making such an investment involves risks including, but not limited to, the risks described below. any one of the following risks could harm our business, financial condition, results of operations or reputation, which could cause our stock price to decline, and you may lose all or a part of your investment. additional risks, trends and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe are immaterial may also harm our business, financial condition, results of operations or reputation.
risks related to our business, industry and partners if we fail to meet the evolving needs of our markets, or identify new products, services or technologies, our revenue and financial results may be adversely impacted.
we have created gpu-based visual and accelerated computing platforms that address four large markets: gaming, professional visualization, datacenter, and automotive. these markets often experience rapid technological change, changes in customer requirements, new product introductions and enhancements, and evolving industry standards. our success depends on our ability to identify these emerging industry changes and to develop new (or enhance our existing) products, services and technologies that meet the evolving needs of these markets. such activities may require considerable technical, financial, compliance, sales and marketing investments. we currently devote significant resources to the development of technologies and business offerings in markets where we have a limited operating history, such as the automotive and datacenter markets, which presents additional risks to our business. we must also continue to develop the infrastructure needed to appropriately scale our business in these areas, including customer service and customer support. we also must meet customer safety and compliance standards, which are subject to change. additionally, we continue to make considerable investments in research and development, which may not produce significant revenue for several years, if at all. if our investments are unsuccessful and we fail to develop new products, services and technologies, or if we focus on technologies that do not become widely adopted, our business, revenue, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected. we cannot assure you that our strategic direction will result in innovative products and technologies that provide value to our customers, partners and ultimately, our shareholders. if we fail to anticipate the changing needs of our target markets and emerging technology trends, or if we do not appropriately adapt that strategy as market conditions evolve, in a timely manner to exploit potential market opportunities, our business will be harmed.
competition in our current and target markets could prevent us from growing our revenue.
our target markets remain extremely competitive, and we expect competition to intensify as current competitors expand their product and/or service offerings, industry standards continue to evolve, customer needs change and new competitors enter these markets. our competitors' products, services and technologies may be less costly, or may offer superior functionality or better features, than ours, which may result, among other things, in lower than expected selling prices for our products. in addition, some of our competitors operate and maintain their own fabrication facilities, have longer operating histories, larger customer bases, more comprehensive intellectual property, or ip, portfolios and patent protections, and greater financial, sales, marketing and distribution resources than we do. these competitors may be able to more effectively identify and capitalize upon opportunities in new markets and end user customer trends, quickly transition their products, including semiconductor products, to increasingly smaller line width geometries, and obtain sufficient foundry capacity and packaging materials, which could harm our business. if we are unable to successfully compete in our target markets, respond to changes in our target markets or introduce new offerings to meet the needs of this competitive environment, including in significant international markets such as china, demand for our products, services and technologies could decrease, which would cause our revenue to decline and cause our results of operations to suffer. in addition, the competitive landscape in our target markets has changed and may continue to evolve due to a trend toward consolidation, which could lead to fewer customers, partners, or suppliers, any of which could negatively affect our financial results.
system security and data protection breaches, as well as cyber-attacks, could disrupt our operations, reduce our expected revenue and increase our expenses, which could adversely affect our stock price and damage our reputation.
security breaches, computer malware and cyber-attacks have become more prevalent and sophisticated in recent years. these threats are constantly evolving, making it increasingly difficult to successfully defend against them or implement adequate preventative measures. these attacks have occurred on our systems in the past and are expected to occur in the future. experienced computer programmers, hackers and employees may penetrate our security controls and misappropriate or compromise our confidential information, or that of our employees or third parties. these attacks may
create system disruptions or cause shutdowns. these hackers may also develop and deploy viruses, worms and other malicious software programs that attack or otherwise exploit security vulnerabilities in our products, including consumer and automotive products, where we utilize over-the-air updates to improve functionality over time. for portions of our it infrastructure, including business management and communication software products, we rely on products and services provided by third parties. these providers may also experience breaches and attacks to their products which may impact our systems. data security breaches may also result from non-technical means, such as actions by an employee with access to our systems. to defend against security threats, both to our internal systems and those of our customers, we must continuously engineer more secure products and enhance security and reliability features, which may result in increased expenses.
actual or perceived breaches of our security measures or the accidental loss, inadvertent disclosure or unapproved dissemination of proprietary information or sensitive or confidential data about us, our partners, our customers or third parties could expose us and the parties affected to a risk of loss or misuse of this information, resulting in litigation and potential liability, paying damages, regulatory inquiries or actions, damage to our brand and reputation or other harm to our business. our efforts to prevent and overcome these challenges could increase our expenses and may not be successful. we may experience interruptions, delays, cessation of service and loss of existing or potential customers. such disruptions could adversely impact our ability to fulfill orders and interrupt other critical functions. delayed sales, lower margins or lost customers as a result of these disruptions could adversely affect our financial results, stock price and reputation.
if our products contain significant defects, we could incur significant expenses to remediate such defects, our reputation could be damaged, and we could lose market share.
our products are complex and may contain defects or security vulnerabilities, or experience failures or unsatisfactory performance due to any number of issues in design, fabrication, packaging, materials and/or use within a system. these risks may increase as our products are introduced into new devices, markets, technologies and applications, including into the automotive market, or as new versions are released. some errors in our products or services may only be discovered after a product or service has been shipped or used by customers or the end users of such product. undiscovered vulnerabilities in our products or services could expose our customers or end users to hackers or other unscrupulous third parties who develop and deploy viruses, worms and other malicious software programs that could attack our products or services. failure of our products to perform to specifications, or other product defects, could lead to substantial damage to the products we sell directly to customers, the end product in which our device has been integrated by oems, odms, aibs and tier 1 automotive suppliers, and to the user of such end product. any such defect may cause us to incur significant warranty, support and repair or replacement costs, write off the value of related inventory, cause us to lose market share, and divert the attention of our engineering personnel from our product development efforts to find and correct the issue. in addition, an error or defect in new products or releases or related software drivers after commencement of commercial shipments could result in failure to achieve market acceptance or loss of design wins, harm our relationships with customers and partners and harm consumers' perceptions of our brand. also, we may be required to reimburse our customers, partners or consumers, including costs to repair or replace products in the field. a product recall, including automotive recalls or a recall due to a bug in our products, or a significant number of product returns could be expensive, damage our reputation, harm our ability to attract new customers, result in the shifting of business to our competitors and result in litigation against us, such as product liability suits. if a product liability claim is brought against us, the cost of defending the claim could be significant and would divert the efforts of our technical and management personnel, and harm our business. further, our business liability insurance may be inadequate or future coverage may be unavailable on acceptable terms, which could adversely impact our financial results.
we depend on third parties and their technology to manufacture, assemble, test and/or package our products, which reduces our control over product quantity and quality, manufacturing yields, development, enhancement and product delivery schedule and could harm our business.
we do not manufacture the silicon wafers used for our gpus and tegra processors and do not own or operate a wafer fabrication facility. instead, we are dependent on industry-leading foundries, such as taiwan semiconductor manufacturing company limited and samsung electronics co. ltd., to manufacture our semiconductor wafers using their fabrication equipment and techniques. similarly, we do not directly assemble, test or package our products, but instead rely on independent subcontractors. we do not have long-term commitment contracts with these foundries or subcontractors. as a result, we face several significant risks which could have an adverse effect on our ability to meet customer demand and/or negatively impact our business operations, gross margin, revenue and/or financial results, including:
•   a lack of guaranteed supply of wafers and other components and potential higher wafer and component prices due to supply constraints;
•   a failure by our foundries to procure raw materials or to provide or allocate adequate or any manufacturing or test capacity for our products;
•   a failure to develop, obtain or successfully implement high quality, leading-edge process technologies, including transitions to smaller geometry process technologies such as advanced process node technologies and memory designs needed to manufacture our products profitably or on a timely basis;
•   loss of a supplier and additional expense and/or production delays as a result of qualifying a new foundry or subcontractor and commencing volume production or testing in the event of a loss of or a decision to add or change a supplier;
•   a lack of direct control over delivery schedules or product quantity and quality; and
•   delays in product shipments, shortages, a decrease in product quality and/or higher expenses in the event our subcontractors or foundries prioritize our competitors' orders over our orders or otherwise.
in addition, low manufacturing yields could have an adverse effect on our ability to meet customer demand, increase manufacturing costs, harm customer or partner relationships, and/or negatively impact our business operations, gross margin, revenue and/or financial results. manufacturing yields for our products are a function of product design, which is developed largely by us, and process technology, which typically is proprietary to the foundry. low yields may result from either product design or process technology failure. we do not know whether a yield problem will exist until our design is actually manufactured by the foundry. as a result, yield problems may not be identified until well into the manufacturing process and require us and the foundry to cooperate to resolve the problem.
we also rely on third-party software development tools to assist us in the design, simulation and verification of new products or product enhancements, and to bring such new products and enhancements to market in a timely manner. in the past, we have experienced delays in the introduction of products and enhancements as a result of the inability of then available software development tools to fully simulate the complex features and functionalities of our products. the design requirements necessary to meet consumer demands for more features and greater functionality from our products may exceed the capabilities of available software development tools. if we miss design cycles or lose design wins due to the unavailability of such software development tools, we could lose market share and our revenues could decline. if we fail to achieve design wins for our products, our business will be harmed.
for our products that we do not sell directly to consumers, achieving design wins is an important success factor. achieving design wins may involve a lengthy process in pursuit of a customer opportunity and depend on our ability to anticipate features and functionality that customers and consumers will demand. failure to obtain a particular design win may prevent us from obtaining design wins in subsequent generations of a particular product. this could result in lost revenue and could weaken our position in future competitive bid selection processes.
unanticipated changes in industry standards could render our products incompatible with products developed by major hardware manufacturers and software developers. further, if our products are not in compliance with prevailing industry standards, including safety standards, our customers may not incorporate our products into their design strategies. winning a product design does not guarantee sales to a customer or that we will realize as much revenue as anticipated, if any.
business disruptions could harm our business, lead to a decline in revenues and increase our costs.
our worldwide operations could be disrupted by earthquakes, telecommunications failures, power or water shortages, outages at cloud service providers, tsunamis, floods, hurricanes, typhoons, fires, extreme weather conditions, cyber-attacks, terrorist attacks, medical epidemics or pandemics and other natural or man-made disasters, catastrophic events or climate change. the occurrence of any of these disruptions could harm our business and result in significant losses, a decline in revenue and an increase in our costs and expenses. any of these business disruptions could require substantial expenditures and recovery time in order to fully resume operations. our corporate headquarters, and a portion of our research and development activities, are located in california, and other critical business operations, finished goods inventory, and some of our suppliers are located in asia, near major earthquake faults known for seismic activity. in addition, a large portion of our current datacenter capacity is located in california, making our operations vulnerable to natural disasters or other business disruptions occurring in these geographical areas. the manufacture of product components, the final assembly of our products and other critical operations are concentrated in certain geographic locations, including taiwan, china, and korea. geopolitical change or changes in government regulations and policies in the united states or abroad also may result in changing regulatory requirements, trade policies, import duties and economic disruptions that could impact our operating strategies, product demand, access to global markets, hiring, and profitability. in particular, revisions to laws or regulations or their interpretation and enforcement could result in increased taxation, trade sanctions, the imposition of import duties or tariffs, restrictions and controls on imports or exports, or other retaliatory actions, which could have an adverse effect on our business plans. for example, regulations to implement the export control reform act of 2018 could have an adverse effect on our business plans. catastrophic events can also have an impact on third-party vendors who provide us critical infrastructure services for it and research and development systems and personnel. our operations
could be harmed if manufacturing, logistics or other operations in these locations are disrupted for any reason, including natural disasters, high heat events or water shortages, information technology system failures, military actions or economic, business, labor, environmental, public health, regulatory or political issues. the ultimate impact on us, our third-party foundries and other suppliers and our general infrastructure of being located near major earthquake faults and being consolidated in certain geographical areas is unknown. in the event a major earthquake or other disaster or catastrophic event affects us or the third-party systems on which we rely, our business could be harmed as a result of declines in revenue, increases in expenses, substantial expenditures and time spent to fully resume operations.
if we fail to estimate customer demand properly, our financial results could be harmed.
we manufacture our gpus and tegra processors based on estimates of customer demand and requirements. we sell many of our products through a channel model, and our channel customers sell to retailers, distributors, and/or end customers. as a result, the decisions made by our channel partners, retailers, and distributors in response to changing market conditions and the changing demand for our products could impact our financial results. in order to have shorter shipment lead times and quicker delivery schedules for our customers, we may build inventories for anticipated periods of growth which do not occur, may build inventory anticipating demand that does not materialize, or may build inventory to serve what we believe is pent-up demand. such decisions may and have resulted in prolonged channel sell-through, as we experienced with our mid-range gaming gpus in fiscal year 2019. in estimating demand, we make multiple assumptions, any of which may prove to be incorrect. situations that may result in excess or obsolete inventory include:
•   changes in business and economic conditions, including downturns in our target markets and/or overall economy;
•   changes in consumer confidence caused by changes in market conditions, including changes in the credit market;
•   a higher incidence of inventory obsolescence because of rapidly changing technology or customer requirements;
•   our introduction of new products resulting in lower demand for older products;
•   increased competition, including competitive pricing actions.
the cancellation or deferral of customer purchase orders could result in our holding excess inventory, which could adversely affect our gross margins. in addition, because we often sell a substantial portion of our products in the last month of each quarter, we may not be able to reduce our inventory purchase commitments in a timely manner in response to customer cancellations or deferrals. we could be required to write-down our inventory to the lower of cost or market or write-off excess inventory, and we could experience a reduction in average selling prices if we incorrectly forecast product demand, any of which could harm our financial results.
conversely, if we underestimate our customers' demand for our products, our foundry partners may not have adequate lead-time or capacity to increase production and we may not be able to obtain sufficient inventory to fill customers' orders on a timely basis. we may also face supply constraints caused by natural disasters or other events. in such cases, even if we are able to increase production levels to meet customer demand, we may not be able to do so in a cost-effective or timely manner. if we fail to fulfill our customers' orders on a timely basis, or at all, our customer relationships could be damaged, we could lose revenue and market share and our reputation could be damaged.
we are subject to risks and uncertainties associated with international operations, which may harm our business.
we conduct our business worldwide and we have offices in various countries outside of the united states. our semiconductor wafers are manufactured, assembled, tested and packaged by third parties located outside of the united states. we also generate a significant portion of our revenue from sales outside the united states. we allocate revenue to individual countries based on the location to which the products are initially billed even if our customers' revenue is attributable to end customers that are located in a different location. revenue from sales outside of the united states accounted for 87% of total revenue for each of fiscal years 2019, 2018, and 2017. revenue from billings to china, including hong kong, was 24% of our revenue for fiscal year 2019, even if our customers' revenue is attributable to end customers that are located in a different location. additionally, as of january 27, 2019, approximately 46% of our employees were located outside of the united states. the global nature of our business subjects us to a number of risks and uncertainties, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations, including:
•   international economic and political conditions, including as a result of the united kingdom's vote to withdraw from the european union, and other political tensions between countries in which we do business;
•   unexpected changes in, or impositions of, legislative or regulatory requirements, including changes in tax laws;
•   differing legal standards with respect to protection of intellectual property and employment practices;
•   local business and cultural factors that differ from our normal standards and practices, including business practices that we are prohibited from engaging in by the foreign corrupt practices act and other anticorruption laws and regulations;
•   disruptions of capital and trading markets and currency fluctuations; and
•   increased costs due to imposition of climate change regulations, such as carbon taxes, fuel or energy taxes, and pollution limits.
if our sales outside of the united states are delayed or cancelled because of any of the above factors, our revenue may be negatively impacted.
if we are unable to attract, retain and motivate our executives and key employees, we may not be able to execute our business strategy effectively.
to be competitive and execute our business strategy successfully, we must attract, retain and motivate our executives and key employees. the market for highly skilled workers and leaders in our industry is extremely competitive. in particular, hiring qualified executives, scientists, engineers, technical staff and research and development personnel is critical to our business. additionally, changes in immigration and work permit laws and regulations or the administration or interpretation of such laws or regulations could impair our ability to attract and retain highly qualified employees. if we are less successful in our recruiting efforts, or if we cannot retain key employees, our ability to develop and deliver successful products and services may be adversely affected. additionally, competition for personnel results in increased costs in the form of cash and stock-based compensation. the interpretation and application of employment related laws to our workforce practices may result in increased operating costs and less flexibility in how we meet our workforce needs. effective succession planning is also important to our long-term success. failure to ensure effective transfer of knowledge and smooth transitions involving key employees could hinder our strategic planning and execution.
we may not be able to realize the potential financial or strategic benefits of business acquisitions or strategic investments and we may not be able to successfully integrate acquisition targets, which could hurt our ability to grow our business, develop new products or sell our products.
we have in the past acquired and invested in, and may continue to acquire and invest in, other businesses that offer products, services and technologies that we believe will help expand or enhance our existing products, strategic objectives and business. the risks associated with past or future acquisitions or investments could impair our ability to grow our business, develop new products or sell our products, and ultimately could have a negative impact on our growth or our financial results. given that our resources are limited, our decision to pursue a transaction has opportunity costs; accordingly, if we pursue a particular transaction, we may need to forgo the prospect of entering into other transactions that could help us achieve our strategic objectives. additional risks related to acquisitions or strategic investments include, but are not limited to:
•   difficulty in combining the technology, products, operations or workforce of the acquired business with our business;
•   diversion of capital and other resources, including management's attention;
•   assumption of liabilities and incurring amortization expenses, impairment charges to goodwill or write-downs of acquired assets;
•   difficulty in realizing a satisfactory return, if at all;
•   failure and costs associated with the failure to consummate a proposed acquisition or other strategic investment;
•   legal proceedings initiated as a result of an acquisition or investment;
•   uncertainties and time needed to realize the benefits of an acquisition or strategic investment, if at all;
•   potential failure of our due diligence processes to identify significant issues with the acquired assets or company; and
•   impairment of relationships with, or loss of our or our target's, employees, vendors and customers, as a result of our acquisition or investment.
risks related to regulatory, legal, our common stock and other matters actions to adequately protect our ip rights could result in substantial costs to us and our ability to compete could be harmed if we are unsuccessful in doing so or if we are prohibited from making or selling our products.
we have in the past, currently are, and may in the future become involved in lawsuits or other legal proceedings alleging patent infringement or other intellectual property rights violations by us, our employees or parties that we have agreed to indemnify for certain claims of infringement. an unfavorable ruling in any such intellectual property related litigation could include significant damages, invalidation of a patent or family of patents, indemnification of customers, payment of lost profits, or, when it has been sought, injunctive relief. claims that our products or processes infringe the ip rights of others, regardless of their merit, could cause us to incur significant costs to respond to, defend, and resolve such claims, and they may also divert the efforts and attention of management and technical personnel.
we may commence litigation or other legal proceedings in order to protect our intellectual property rights. such proceedings may increase our operating expenses, which could negatively impact our operating results. further, we could be subject to countersuits as a result of our initiation of litigation. if infringement claims are made against us or our products are found to infringe a third party's patent or intellectual property, we or one of our indemnitees may have to seek a license to the third party's patent or other intellectual property rights. however, we may not be able to obtain licenses at all or on terms acceptable to us particularly from our competitors. if we or one of our indemnitees is unable to obtain a license from a third party for technology that we use or that is used in one of our products, we could be subject to substantial liabilities or have to suspend or discontinue the manufacture and sale of one or more of our products. we may also have to make royalty or other payments, or cross license our technology. if these arrangements are not concluded on commercially reasonable terms, our business could be negatively impacted. furthermore, the indemnification of a customer or other indemnitee may increase our operating expenses which could negatively impact our operating results.
our success depends in part on protecting our intellectual property. to accomplish this, we rely primarily on a combination of patents, trademarks, trade secrets, employee and third-party nondisclosure agreements, licensing arrangements, and the laws of the countries in which we operate to protect our intellectual property in the united states and internationally. we may be required to spend significant resources to monitor and protect our intellectual property rights, and even with significant expenditures we may not be able to protect our intellectual property rights that are valuable to our business. the laws of certain foreign countries may not protect our products or intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states. this makes the possibility of piracy of our technology and products more likely. in addition, the theft or unauthorized use or publication of our trade secrets and other confidential business information could harm our competitive position and reduce acceptance of our products; as a result, the value of our investment in research and development, product development, and marketing could be reduced. we continuously assess whether and where to seek formal protection for existing and new innovations and technologies, but cannot be certain whether our applications for such protections will be approved, and, if approved, whether we will be able to enforce such protections.
our operating results have in the past fluctuated and may in the future fluctuate, and if our operating results are below the expectations of securities analysts or investors, our stock price could decline.
our operating results have in the past fluctuated and may in the future continue to fluctuate due to numerous factors. therefore, investors should not rely on quarterly comparisons of our results of operations as an indication of our future performance.
factors, other than those described elsewhere in these risk factors, that could affect our results of operations in the future include, but are not limited to:
•   our ability to achieve volume production of our next-generation products;
•   our inability to adjust spending to offset revenue shortfalls due to the multi-year development cycle for some of our products and services;
•   changes in the timing of product orders due to unexpected delays in the introduction of our partners' products;
•   our ability to cover the manufacturing and design costs of our products through competitive pricing;
•   our ability to comply and continue to comply with our customers' contractual obligations;
•   product rates of return in excess of that forecasted or expected due to quality issues;
•   supply constraints for and changes in the cost of the other components incorporated into our products
•   our ability to continue generating revenue from our partner network, including by generating sales within our partner network and ensuring our products are incorporated into our partners product ecosystems, and our partner network's ability to sell products that incorporate our gpus and tegra processors;
•   the inability of certain of our customers to make required payments to us, and our ability to obtain credit insurance over the purchasing credit extended to these customers;
•   customer bad debt write-offs;
•   any unanticipated costs associated with environmental liabilities;
•   unexpected costs related to our ownership of real property;
•   changes in financial accounting standards or interpretations of existing standards; and
•   general macroeconomic or industry events and factors affecting the overall market and our target markets.
any one or more of the factors discussed above could prevent us from achieving our expected future financial results. any such failure to meet our expectations or the expectations of our investors or security analysts could cause our stock price to decline or experience substantial price volatility.
privacy concerns relating to our products and services could damage our reputation, deter current and potential users from using our products and services, result in liability, or result in legal or regulatory proceedings.
our products and services may provide us with access to sensitive, confidential or personal data or information that is subject to privacy and security laws and regulations. concerns about our practices with regard to the collection, use, retention, security or disclosure of personal information or other privacy-related matters, even if unfounded, could damage our reputation and adversely affect our operating results. the theft, loss, or misuse of personal data collected, used, stored, or transferred by us to run our business or by one of our partners could result in significantly increased security costs, damage to our reputation, regulatory proceedings, disruption of our business activities or increased costs related to defending legal claims.
worldwide regulatory authorities are considering and have approved various legislative proposals concerning data protection, which continue to evolve and apply to our business. for example, the european union adopted the general data protection regulation, or gdpr, which requires companies to meet new requirements beginning in may 2018 regarding the handling of personal data, including its use, protection and the ability of persons whose data is stored to correct or delete such data about themselves. failure to meet gdpr requirements could result in penalties of up to 4% of worldwide revenue. in addition, the interpretation and application of consumer and data protection laws in the united states, europe and elsewhere are often uncertain and fluid, and may be interpreted and applied in a manner that is inconsistent with our data practices. if so, we may be ordered to change our data practices and/or be fined. complying with these changing laws has caused, and could continue to cause, us to incur substantial costs, which could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations. further, failure to comply with existing or new rules may result in significant penalties or orders to stop the alleged noncompliant activity.
we may have exposure to additional tax liabilities and our operating results may be adversely impacted by higher than expected tax rates.
as a multinational corporation, we are subject to income taxes as well as non-income based taxes, such as payroll, sales, use, value-added, net worth, property and goods and services taxes, in both the united states and various foreign jurisdictions. our domestic and international tax liabilities are subject to the allocation of revenue and expenses in different jurisdictions. significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities. further, changes in united states federal, and state or international tax laws applicable to multinational corporations or other fundamental law changes may materially impact our tax expense and cash flows, as we experienced in fiscal year 2018 with the passage of the tax cuts and jobs act, or tcja.
our future effective tax rate may be affected by such factors as changes in tax laws, changes in our business or statutory rates, changes in jurisdictions in which our profits are determined to be earned and taxed, changes in available tax credits, the resolution of issues arising from tax audits, changes in united states generally accepted accounting principles, adjustments to income taxes upon finalization of tax returns, increases in expenses not deductible for tax purposes, changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities and in deferred tax valuation allowances, changing interpretation of existing laws or regulations, the impact of accounting for stock-based compensation and the recognition of excess tax benefits and tax deficiencies within the income tax provision in the period in which they occur, the impact of accounting for business combinations, shifts in the amount of earnings in the united states compared with other regions in the world and overall levels of income before tax, changes in our international organization, as well as the expiration of statute of limitations and settlements of audits. any changes in our effective tax rate may reduce our net income.
our business is exposed to the risks associated with litigation, investigations and regulatory proceedings.
we currently and may in the future face legal, administrative and regulatory proceedings, claims, demands and/or investigations involving shareholder, consumer, competition and/or other issues relating to our business on a global basis. for example, multiple securities litigation claims have recently been filed against us and certain of our officers based on the dissemination of allegedly false and misleading statements related to channel inventory and the impact of cryptocurrency mining on gpu demand. in addition, a stockholder, purporting to act on behalf of the company, filed a derivative lawsuit seeking to assert claims on behalf of the company against the members of our board of directors and certain officers based on the dissemination of allegedly false and misleading statements related to channel inventory and the impact of cryptocurrency mining on gpu demand.
litigation and regulatory proceedings are inherently uncertain, and adverse rulings could occur, including monetary damages, or an injunction stopping us from manufacturing or selling certain products, engaging in certain business practices, or requiring other remedies, such as compulsory licensing of patents. an unfavorable outcome or settlement may result in a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations, financial position, and overall trends. in addition, regardless of the outcome, litigation can be costly, time-consuming, and disruptive to our operations.
in addition, the laws and regulations our business is subject to are complex, and change frequently. we may be required to incur significant expense to comply with, or remedy violations of, these regulations.
delaware law and provisions in our certificate of incorporation, our bylaws and our agreement with microsoft corporation could delay or prevent a change in control.
our status as a delaware corporation and the anti-takeover provisions of the delaware general corporation law may discourage, delay, or prevent a change in control by prohibiting us from engaging in a business combination with an interested shareholder for a period of three years after the person becomes an interested shareholder, even if a change of control would be beneficial to our existing shareholders. in addition, our certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire a majority of our outstanding voting stock. these provisions include the following:
•   the ability of our board of directors to create and issue preferred stock without prior shareholder approval;
•   the prohibition of shareholder action by written consent;
•   the ability of our board of directors to increase or decrease the number of directors without shareholder approval;
•   a super-majority voting requirement to amend some provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws;
•   the inability of our shareholders to call special meetings of shareholders; and
•   the ability of our board of directors to make, amend or repeal our bylaws.
on march 5, 2000, we entered into an agreement with microsoft in which we agreed to develop and sell graphics chips and to license certain technology to microsoft and its licensees for use in the xbox. under the agreement, if an individual or corporation makes an offer to purchase shares equal to or greater than 30% of the outstanding shares of our common stock, microsoft may have first and last rights of refusal to purchase the stock. the microsoft provision and the other factors listed above could also delay or prevent a change in control of nvidia. these provisions could also discourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for shareholders to elect directors of their choosing and to cause us to take other corporate actions they desire.
item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with "item 1a. risk factors", "item 6. selected financial data", our consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto, as well as other cautionary statements and risks described elsewhere in this annual report on form 10-k, before deciding to purchase, hold or sell shares of our common stock.

gross margin                          61.2      %   59.9                    %          up 130 bps operating expenses                  $3,367                      $2,612                 up 29%
revenue for fiscal year 2019 increased 21% year over year, reflecting growth in each of our market platforms - gaming, professional visualization, datacenter, and automotive. gpu business revenue was $10.17 billion, up 25% from a year earlier. tegra processor business revenue - which includes automotive, soc modules for gaming platforms, and embedded edge ai platforms - was $1.54 billion, up slightly from a year ago.
gaming revenue was $6.25 billion, up 13% from a year ago driven by growth in gaming gpus. gaming gpu growth was fueled by turing-based gpus for desktops and by gaming notebooks based on our max-q technology. we experienced significant volatility in our gaming revenue during fiscal year 2019. we believe demand for our desktop gaming gpu products used by end users for cryptocurrency mining and its after-effects have distorted trends in gaming revenue. we also believe that deteriorating macroeconomic conditions, particularly in china have impacted consumer demand for our geforce gaming gpu products. in addition, sales of certain high-end geforce gaming gpus using our new turing architecture that we released during fiscal year 2019 were lower than we expected for the launch of a new architecture. as a result, during a portion of fiscal year 2019, we shipped a higher amount of desktop gaming gpu products relative to where end user demand turned out to be and subsequently compensated by shipping a lower amount of desktop gaming gpu products relative to end user demand to allow the channel to work down that inventory. for fiscal year 2020, we expect our gaming revenue to be slightly down compared to fiscal year 2019, with expected growth from sales of turing-based gpu products and notebook gpu products partially offsetting decreases that we believe were caused by the previously-noted factors.
professional visualization revenue was $1.13 billion, up 21% from a year earlier driven by strength across both desktop and mobile workstation products.
datacenter revenue was $2.93 billion, up 52% from a year ago, led by strong sales of our volta architecture-based products, including nvidia tesla v100 and dgx systems. toward the end of fiscal year 2019, we believe that customers across broad-based vertical markets and geographies became increasingly cautious due to economic uncertainty, and a number of
datacenter deals did not close. while we believe the pause is temporary, our visibility remains relatively low and we do not expect a meaningful recovery in the datacenter market until later in fiscal year 2020.
automotive revenue of $641 million was up 15% from a year earlier, driven by infotainment modules, production drive platforms, and development agreements with automotive companies.
oem and ip revenue was $767 million, down 1% from a year ago, driven by the absence of intel licensing revenue, which concluded in the first quarter of fiscal year 2018. revenue from cryptocurrency-specific products in fiscal years 2019 and 2018 was $306 million and $273 million, respectively. we expect revenue from cryptocurrency-specific products to be negligible going forward.
gross margin for fiscal year 2019 was 61.2%, compared with 59.9% a year earlier, which reflects our continued shift toward higher-value platforms, which more than offset the impact of approximately $128 million in charges for excess dram and other components we recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2019 and a charge of $57 million we recorded during the third quarter of fiscal year 2019 related to prior architecture components and chips.
operating expenses for fiscal year 2019 were $3.37 billion, up 29% from a year earlier, reflecting primarily employee additions and increases in employee compensation and other related costs, including infrastructure costs.
income from operations for fiscal year 2019 was $3.80 billion, up 19% from a year earlier. net income and net income per diluted share for fiscal year 2019 were $4.14 billion and $6.63, respectively, up 36% and 38%, respectively, from a year earlier, fueled primarily by revenue growth and improved gross margin, as well as the impact of the u.s. tax reform benefit.
during fiscal year 2019, we returned $1.95 billion to shareholders through a combination of $1.58 billion in share repurchases and $371 million in quarterly cash dividends. we intend to return $3.00 billion to shareholders by the end of fiscal year 2020, including $700 million of share repurchases we made in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2019.
cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities were $7.42 billion as of january 27, 2019, compared with $7.11 billion as of january 28, 2018. the increase was primarily related to the increase in net income, partially offset by changes in working capital and the increases in stock repurchases, dividends and taxes paid related to restricted stock units.
gpu business during fiscal year 2019, for gaming, we announced nvidia rtx - a computer graphics technology using our turing architecture that produces movie-quality images in real time using ray tracing and ai. during the year, we released many new geforce rtx desktop gaming gpu products, including rtx 2080ti, 2080, 2070 and 2060, as well as many new max-q geforce gaming notebook gpu products - the most recent of which are powered by rtx gpus.
for our professional visualization platform, we announced the quadro gv100 gpu with rtx technology, making real-time ray tracing possible on professional design and content creation applications. we also unveiled the quadro rtx series, which is designed to revolutionize the workflow of designers and artists on the desktop, and announced the nvidia cuda-accelerated redcode raw decode sdk, enabling developers and studios to edit 8k video.
for our datacenter platform, we unveiled many advances to our deep learning computing platform - including nvidia tesla v100 gpus with 32gb memory, nvidia nvswitch gpu interconnect fabric, the nvidia dgx-2 and hgx-2 for ai and hpc, the nvidia rtx server, and tensorrt 4 ai inference accelerator software. in addition, we introduced rapids, an open-source gpu-acceleration platform for data science and machine learning, launched the nvidia t4 cloud gpu and nvidia tensorrt hyperscale inference platform for advanced acceleration in hyperscale datacenters, announced gpu acceleration for kubernetes to facilitate enterprise inference deployment on multi-cloud gpu clusters, and announced that five of the world's seven fastest supercomputers are powered by nvidia gpus.
tegra processor business during fiscal year 2019, for the automotive market, we introduced the nvidia drive autopilot level 2+ automated driving system, announced nvidia drive agx design wins with toyota, volvo cars and isuzu motors, and announced that daimler and bosch have selected nvidia's drive platform to bring automated and driverless vehicles to city streets. we also began production of our xavier single-chip autopilot soc, started shipping the nvidia drive agx xavier developer kit, and introduced the nvidia drive constellation server with drive sim software to safely test drive autonomous vehicles over billions of miles in virtual reality by leveraging nvidia gpus and nvidia drive pegasus.
in addition, we launched the nvidia jetson agx xavier module to help build the next-generation of autonomous machines and announced that yamaha motor co. will use nvidia to power its upcoming lineup of autonomous machines.
critical accounting policies and estimates management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states, or u.s. gaap. the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, cost of revenue, expenses and related disclosure of contingencies. on an on-going basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related to revenue recognition, inventories, income taxes, goodwill, cash equivalents and marketable securities, stock-based compensation, and litigation, investigation and settlement costs and other contingencies. we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities.
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. our management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting policies and estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors. the audit committee has reviewed our disclosures relating to our critical accounting policies and estimates in this annual report on form 10-k.
revenue recognition we derive our revenue from product sales, including hardware and systems, license and development arrangements, and software licensing. we determine revenue recognition through the following steps: (1) identification of the contract with a customer; (2) identification of the performance obligations in the contract; (3) determination of the transaction price; (4) allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and (5) recognition of revenue when, or as, we satisfy a performance obligation.
product sales revenue revenue from product sales is recognized upon transfer of control of promised products to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to receive in exchange for those products. revenue is recognized net of allowances for returns, customer programs and any taxes collected from customers.
for products sold with a right of return, we record a reduction to revenue by establishing a sales return allowance for estimated product returns at the time revenue is recognized, based primarily on historical return rates. however, if product returns for a fiscal period are anticipated to exceed historical return rates, we may determine that additional sales return allowances are required to properly reflect our estimated exposure for product returns.
our customer programs involve rebates, which are designed to serve as sales incentives to resellers of our products in various target markets, and marketing development funds, or mdfs, which represent monies paid to our partners that are earmarked for market segment development and are designed to support our partners' activities while also promoting nvidia products. we account for customer programs as a reduction to revenue and accrue for potential rebates and mdfs based on the amount we expect to be claimed by customers.
license and development arrangements our license and development arrangements with customers typically require significant customization of our intellectual property components. as a result, we recognize the revenue from the license and the revenue from the development services as a single performance obligation over the period in which the development services are performed. we measure progress to completion based on actual cost incurred to date as a percentage of the estimated total cost required to complete each project. if a loss on an arrangement becomes probable during a period, we record a provision for such loss in that period.
software licensing our software licenses provide our customers with a right to use the software when it is made available to the customer. customers may purchase either perpetual licenses or subscriptions to licenses, which differ mainly in the duration over which the customer benefits from the software. software licenses are frequently sold along with post-contract customer support, or pcs. for such arrangements, we allocate revenue to the software license and pcs on a relative standalone selling price basis by maximizing the use of observable inputs to determine the standalone selling price for each performance obligation. revenue from software licenses is recognized up front when the software is made available to the customer. pcs revenue is recognized ratably over the service period, or as services are performed.
refer to note 1 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements in part iv, item 15 of this annual report on form 10-k for additional information.
inventories inventory cost is computed on an adjusted standard basis, which approximates actual cost on an average or first-in, first-out basis. we charge cost of sales for inventory provisions to write down our inventory to the lower of cost or net realizable value or to completely write off obsolete or excess inventory. most of our inventory provisions relate to the write-off of excess quantities of products, based on our inventory levels and future product purchase commitments compared to assumptions about future demand and market conditions.
situations that may result in excess or obsolete inventory include changes in business and economic conditions, changes in market conditions, sudden and significant decreases in demand for our products, inventory obsolescence because of changing technology and customer requirements, failure to estimate customer demand properly, or unexpected competitive pricing actions by our competition. in addition, cancellation or deferral of customer purchase orders could result in our holding excess inventory.
the overall net effect on our gross margin from inventory provisions and sales of items previously written down was an unfavorable impact of 2.0% in fiscal year 2019 and insignificant in fiscal years 2018 and 2017. the higher amount of charges we took to cost of sales for inventory provisions during fiscal year 2019 were primarily related to excess dram, other components, and prior architecture components and chips, whereas the charges we took during fiscal years 2018 and 2017 were primarily related to the write-off of excess quantities of gpu and tegra products whose inventory levels were higher than our updated forecasts of future demand for those products. as a fabless semiconductor company, we must make commitments to purchase inventory based on forecasts of future customer demand. in doing so, we must account for our third-party manufacturers' lead times and constraints. we also adjust to other market factors, such as product offerings and pricing actions by our competitors, new product transitions, and macroeconomic conditions - all of which may impact demand for our products.
refer to the gross profit and gross margin discussion below in this management's discussion and analysis for further discussion.
income taxes we recognize federal, state and foreign current tax liabilities or assets based on our estimate of taxes payable or refundable in the current fiscal year by tax jurisdiction. we recognize federal, state and foreign deferred tax assets or liabilities, as appropriate, for our estimate of future tax effects attributable to temporary differences and carryforwards; and we record a valuation allowance to reduce any deferred tax assets by the amount of any tax benefits that, based on available evidence and judgment, are not expected to be realized.
our calculation of deferred tax assets and liabilities is based on certain estimates and judgments and involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws. our estimates of deferred tax assets and liabilities may change based, in part, on added certainty or finality to an anticipated outcome, changes in accounting standards or tax laws in the united states, or foreign jurisdictions where we operate, or changes in other facts or circumstances. in addition, we recognize liabilities for potential united states and foreign income tax contingencies based on our estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes may be due. if we determine that payment of these amounts is unnecessary or if the recorded tax liability is less than our current assessment, we may be required to recognize an income tax benefit or additional income tax expense in our financial statements accordingly.
as of january 27, 2019, we had a valuation allowance of $562 million related to state and certain foreign deferred tax assets that management determined are not likely to be realized due to projections of future taxable income and potential utilization limitations of tax attributes acquired as a result of stock ownership changes. to the extent realization of the deferred tax assets becomes more-likely-than-not, we would recognize such deferred tax asset as an income tax benefit during the period.
we recognize the benefit from a tax position only if it is more-likely-than-not that the position would be sustained upon audit based solely on the technical merits of the tax position. our policy is to include interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of income tax expense.
the tcja, which was enacted in december 2017, significantly changed u.s. tax law, including a reduction of the u.s. federal corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%, a requirement for companies to pay a one-time transition tax on the earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries that were previously tax deferred, and the creation of new taxes (global intangible low-taxed income, or gilti) on certain foreign-source earnings. as a fiscal year-end taxpayer, certain provisions of the tcja began to impact us in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2018, while other provisions impacted us beginning in fiscal year 2019. the sec had provided guidance in staff accounting bulletin no. 118, income tax accounting implications of the tax cuts and jobs act (sab 118), which allowed companies to record provisional amounts during a measurement period up to one year
from the enactment date. as of january 27, 2019, we completed our accounting for all of the enactment-date income tax effects of the tcja and elected to account for gilti in deferred taxes. refer to note 13 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements in part iv, item 15 of this annual report on form 10-k for additional information specific to accounting for income taxes and the impacts from the enactment of the tcja.
goodwill goodwill is subject to our annual impairment test during the fourth quarter of our fiscal year, or earlier, if indicators of potential impairment exist, using either a qualitative or a quantitative assessment. our impairment review process compares the fair value of the reporting unit in which the goodwill resides to its carrying value. we have identified two reporting units, gpu and tegra processor, for the purposes of completing our goodwill analysis. goodwill assigned to the gpu and tegra processor reporting units as of january 27, 2019 was $210 million and $408 million, respectively. determining the fair value of a reporting unit requires us to make judgments and involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions. we also make judgments and assumptions in allocating assets and liabilities to each of our reporting units. we base our fair value estimates on assumptions we believe to be reasonable but that are unpredictable and inherently uncertain.
during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2019, we used the qualitative assessment to test goodwill for impairment for each reporting unit and concluded there was no impairment.
refer to note 5 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements in part iv, item 15 of this annual report on form 10-k for additional information.
cash equivalents and marketable securities cash equivalents consist of financial instruments which are readily convertible into cash and have original maturities of three months or less at the time of acquisition. marketable securities consist of highly liquid debt investments with maturities greater than three months when purchased. we measure our cash equivalents and marketable securities at fair value. the fair values of our financial assets are determined using quoted market prices of identical assets or quoted market prices of similar assets from active markets. all of our available-for-sale debt investments are subject to a periodic impairment review. we record a charge to earnings when a decline in fair value is significantly below cost basis and judged to be other-than-temporary, or have other indicators of impairments.
we performed an impairment review of our debt investment portfolio as of january 27, 2019. we concluded that our debt investments were appropriately valued and that no other-than-temporary impairment charges were necessary on our portfolio of available-for-sale debt investments as of january 27, 2019.
refer to notes 7 and 8 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements in part iv, item 15 of this annual report on form 10-k for additional information.
stock-based compensation our stock-based compensation expense is associated with restricted stock units, or rsus, performance stock units that are based on our corporate financial performance targets, or psus, performance stock units that are based on market conditions, or market-based psus, and our employee stock purchase plan. the number of psus and market-based psus that will ultimately be awarded is contingent on the company's level of achievement compared with the corporate financial performance target established by our compensation committee in the beginning of each fiscal year.
refer to notes 1 and 3 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements in part iv, item 15 of this annual report on form 10-k for additional information.
litigation, investigation and settlement costs from time to time, we are involved in legal actions and/or investigations by regulatory bodies. we are aggressively defending our current litigation matters. however, there are many uncertainties associated with any litigation or investigations, and we cannot be certain that these actions or other third-party claims against us will be resolved without costly litigation, fines and/or substantial settlement payments. if that occurs, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. if information becomes available that causes us to determine that a loss in any of our pending litigation, investigations or settlements is probable, and we can reasonably estimate the loss associated with such events, we will record the loss in accordance with u.s. gaap. however, the actual liability in any such litigation or investigation may be materially different from our estimates, which could require us to record additional costs.

gpu business. gpu business revenue increased by 25% in fiscal year 2019 compared to fiscal year 2018. this increase was due primarily to 18% growth in sales of geforce gpu products for gaming, driven by initial sales of turing-based gpus for desktops and by high-performance notebooks based on our max-q technology. datacenter revenue, including tesla, grid and dgx, increased 52%, reflecting strong sales of our volta architecture products, including nvidia tesla v100 and dgx systems. revenue from quadro gpus for professional visualization increased 21% due primarily to higher sales across desktop and mobile workstation products. our pc oem revenue decreased by 1% driven by the absence of intel licensing revenue in fiscal year 2019. revenue from cryptocurrency-specific products in fiscal years 2019 and 2018 was $306 million and $273 million, respectively. we expect cryptocurrency-related revenue to be negligible going forward.
gpu business revenue increased by 40% in fiscal year 2018 compared to fiscal year 2017 led by growth in gaming, datacenter and professional visualization. revenue from sales of geforce gpu products for gaming increased over 20%, reflecting continued strong demand for our pascal-based gpu products. datacenter revenue, including tesla, grid and dgx, increased 133%, reflecting strong demand from hyperscale and cloud customers for deep learning training and accelerated gpu computing as well as demand for hpc, dgx ai supercomputing and grid virtualization platforms. revenue from quadro gpus for professional visualization increased by 12% due primarily to higher sales in both high-end desktop and mobile
tegra processor business.  tegra processor business revenue was up slightly in fiscal year 2019 compared to fiscal year 2018. this was driven by an increase of over 15% in automotive revenue, primarily from infotainment modules, production drive px platforms, and development agreements with automotive companies, offset by a decline of approximately 15% in soc modules for gaming platforms and related development services.
tegra processor business revenue increased by 86% in fiscal year 2018 compared to fiscal year 2017. this was driven by an increase of over 300% in revenue from soc modules for gaming platforms and development services, and an increase of 15% in automotive revenue, primarily from infotainment modules, drive px platforms and development agreements for self-driving cars.
all other. our patent license agreement with intel concluded in the first quarter of fiscal year 2018. for fiscal year 2018, we recognized related revenue of $43 million, down from $264 million for fiscal year 2017.
concentration of revenue revenue from sales to customers outside of the united states accounted for 87% of total revenue for each of fiscal years 2019, 2018, and 2017. revenue by geographic region is allocated to individual countries based on the location to which the products are initially billed even if the revenue is attributable to end customers in a different location.
no single customer represented more than 10% of total revenue for fiscal years 2019 and 2018. in fiscal year 2017, we had one customer that represented 12% of our total revenue.
gross profit and gross margin gross profit consists of total revenue, net of allowances, less cost of revenue. cost of revenue consists primarily of the cost of semiconductors purchased from subcontractors, including wafer fabrication, assembly, testing and packaging, board and device costs, manufacturing support costs, including labor and overhead associated with such purchases, final test yield fallout, inventory and warranty provisions, memory and component costs, and shipping costs. cost of revenue also includes development costs for license and service arrangements and stock-based compensation related to personnel associated with manufacturing.
our overall gross margin was 61.2%, 59.9%, and 58.8% for fiscal years 2019, 2018, and 2017, respectively. the increase in fiscal year 2019 reflects our continued shift toward higher-value platforms, which more than offset the impact of approximately $128 million in charges for excess dram and other components we recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2019 and a charge of $57 million we recorded during the third quarter of fiscal year 2019 related to prior architecture components and chips. the increase in fiscal year 2018 was driven primarily by a favorable shift in mix, the growth of our geforce gaming gpu revenue, and the growth of our datacenter revenue for cloud, deep learning, ai, and graphics virtualization. the increase in fiscal year 2018 was partially offset by the conclusion of our patent license agreement with intel in the first quarter of fiscal year 2018.
inventory provisions totaled $270 million, $48 million, and $62 million for fiscal years 2019, 2018, and 2017, respectively. sales of inventory that was previously written-off or written-down totaled $41 million, $35 million, and $51 million for fiscal years 2019, 2018, and 2017, respectively. as a result, the overall net effect on our gross margin was an unfavorable impact of 2.0% in fiscal year 2019 and insignificant in fiscal years 2018 and 2017.
a discussion of our gross margin results for each of our reportable segments is as follows:
gpu business. the gross margin of our gpu business increased during fiscal year 2019 when compared to fiscal year 2018, primarily due to strong sales of high-end geforce gaming gpus and revenue growth in datacenter, including tesla, grid and dgx, for cloud, deep learning, ai, and graphics virtualization. the gross margin of our gpu business increased during fiscal year 2018 when compared to fiscal year 2017 primarily due to strong sales of our geforce gaming gpu products and revenue growth in datacenter, including tesla, grid and dgx, for cloud, deep learning, ai, and graphics virtualization.
tegra processor business. the gross margin of our tegra processor business increased during fiscal year 2019 when compared to fiscal year 2018, primarily due to a favorable mix shift. the gross margin of our tegra processor business increased during fiscal year 2018 when compared to fiscal year 2017, primarily due to revenue growth in gaming development platforms and automotive.

research and development research and development expenses increased by 32% in fiscal year 2019 compared to fiscal year 2018 and increased by 23% in fiscal year 2018 compared to fiscal year 2017, driven primarily by employee additions and increases in employee compensation and other related costs, including infrastructure costs and stock-based compensation expense.
interest income and interest expense interest income consists of interest earned on cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. interest income was $136 million, $69 million, and $54 million in fiscal years 2019, 2018, and 2017, respectively. the increase in interest income was primarily due to higher average invested balances and higher rates from our floating rate securities and the purchase of new securities.
interest expense is primarily comprised of coupon interest and debt discount amortization related to the 2.20% notes due 2021 and 3.20% notes due 2026 issued in september 2016, and the convertible notes issued in december 2013. interest expense was $58 million, $61 million, and $58 million in fiscal years 2019, 2018, and 2017, respectively.
other, net other, net, consists primarily of realized or unrealized gains and losses from non-affiliated investments, losses on early debt conversions of the convertible notes, and the impact of changes in foreign currency rates. other, net, was $14 million of income during fiscal year 2019, consisting primarily of $12 million unrealized gains from non-affiliated investments. other, net, was $22 million and $25 million of expense in fiscal years 2018 and 2017, respectively, consisting primarily of $19 million and $21 million of losses recognized from early conversions of the convertible notes during fiscal years 2018 and 2017, respectively.
income taxes the tcja, which was enacted in december 2017, significantly changed u.s. tax law, including a reduction of the u.s. federal corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%, a requirement for companies to pay a one-time transition tax on the earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries that were previously tax deferred and the creation of new taxes (gilti) on certain foreign-source earnings. as a fiscal year-end taxpayer, certain provisions of the tcja began to impact us in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2018, while other provisions impacted us beginning in fiscal year 2019.
we recognized income tax benefit of $245 million for fiscal year 2019, and income tax expense of $149 million and $239 million for fiscal years 2018, and 2017, respectively. our annual effective tax rate was (6.3)%, 4.7%, and 12.5% for fiscal years 2019, 2018, and 2017, respectively. the decrease in our effective tax rate in fiscal year 2019 as compared to fiscal years 2018 and 2017 was primarily due to a decrease in the u.s. statutory tax rate from 33.9% to 21%, the finalization of the enactment-date income tax effects of the tcja, higher u.s federal research tax credits and excess tax benefits related to stock-based compensation in fiscal year 2019.
the decrease in our effective tax rate in fiscal year 2018 as compared to fiscal year 2017 was primarily due to the provisional impact of the tax law changes and recognition of excess tax benefits related to stock-based compensation.
our effective tax rate for fiscal year 2019 was lower than the u.s. federal statutory rate of 21% due primarily to income earned in jurisdictions, including british virgin islands, hong kong, china, taiwan and united kingdom, where the tax rate was lower than the u.s. federal statutory tax rates, the finalization of the enactment-date income tax effects of the tcja, favorable recognition of u.s. federal research tax credits, and excess tax benefits related to stock-based compensation.
our effective tax rate for fiscal years 2018 and 2017 was lower than the blended u.s. federal statutory rate of 33.9% for fiscal year 2018 and 35% for fiscal year 2017 due primarily to income earned in jurisdictions, including british virgin islands, hong kong, china, taiwan and united kingdom, where the tax rate was lower than the u.s. federal statutory tax rates, favorable recognition of u.s. federal research tax credits, the provisional impact of the tax law changes in 2018, and excess tax benefits related to stock-based compensation.
in fiscal year 2018 and the first nine months of fiscal year 2019, we recorded provisional amounts for certain enactment-date effects of the tcja by applying the sec guidance in sab 118 because we had not yet completed our accounting for these effects. furthermore, under u.s. gaap, we can make an accounting policy election to either treat taxes due on the gilti as a current period expense or factor such amounts into our measurement of deferred taxes. because we were still evaluating the gilti provisions as of january 28, 2018, we recorded no gilti-related deferred balances. after further evaluation, we elected to account for gilti deferred taxes. as of january 27, 2019, we completed our accounting for all of the enactment-date income tax effects of the tcja and recognized a reduction of $368 million to the provisional amount recorded at january 28, 2018, primarily relating to the effects of electing to account for gilti in deferred taxes.

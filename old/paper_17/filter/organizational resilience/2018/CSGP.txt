risk factors our revenues and financial position will be adversely affected if we are not able to attract and retain clients. our success and revenues depend on attracting and retaining subscribers to our information, analytics and online marketplaces. our subscription-based information, analytics and online marketplaces generate the largest portion of our revenues. however, we may be unable to attract new clients, and our existing clients may decide not to add, not to renew or to cancel subscription services. in addition, in order to increase our revenue, we must continue to attract new customers, continue to keep our cancellation rate low and continue to sell new services to our existing customers. we may not be able to continue to grow our customer base, keep the cancellation rate for customers and services low or sell new services to existing customers as a result of several factors, including without limitation: economic pressures; the business failure of a current client or clients; a decision that customers have no need for our services; a decision to use alternative services; customers' and potential customers' pricing and budgetary constraints; consolidation in the real estate and/or financial services industries; data quality; technical problems; or competitive pressures. we compete against many other commercial real estate information, analytics, and marketing service providers for business, including competitors that offer their services through rapidly changing methods of delivering real estate information. if clients cancel services or decide not to renew their subscription agreements, and we do not sell new services to our existing clients or attract new clients, then our renewal rate, net new sales and revenues may decline or fail to meet expectations.
we may not be able to successfully introduce new or upgraded information, analytics and online marketplace services or combine or shift focus from services with less demand, which could decrease our revenues and our profitability. our future business and financial success will depend on our ability to continue to anticipate the needs of customers and potential customers, and to successfully introduce new and upgraded services into the marketplace. to be successful, we must adapt to changes in the industry, as well as rapid technological changes by continually enhancing our information, analytics and online marketplace services. developing new services and upgrades to services, as well as integrating and coordinating current services, imposes heavy burdens on our systems department, product development team, management and researchers. the processes are costly, and our efforts to develop, integrate and enhance our services may not be successful. as we continue to combine our operations with those that we have acquired, we must continue to assess the purposes for which various services may be used alone or together, and how we can best address those uses through stand-alone services or combinations of coordinating applications. in addition, successfully launching and selling a new or upgraded service puts additional strain on our sales and marketing resources. if we are unsuccessful in obtaining greater market share, we may not be able to offset the expenses associated with the launch and marketing of the new or upgraded service, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial results. for example, to generate brand awareness and site traffic for our apartments.com network of rental websites, we utilize a multi-channel marketing campaign. if the marketing campaign does not continue to increase brand awareness, site traffic and/or revenues, it could have an adverse effect on our financial results.
if we are unable to develop new or upgraded services or decide to combine, shift focus from, or phase out a service, then our customers may choose a competitive service over ours and our revenues may decline and our profitability may be reduced. if we incur significant costs in developing new or upgraded services or combining and coordinating existing services, if we are not successful in marketing and selling these new services or upgrades, or if our customers fail to accept these new or combined and coordinating services, then there could be a material adverse effect on our results of operations due to a decrease of our revenues and a reduction of our profitability. in addition, as we integrate acquired businesses, we continue to assess which services we believe will best meet the needs of our customers. if we eliminate or phase out a service and are not able to offer and successfully market and sell an alternative service, our revenue may decrease, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.
a downturn or consolidation in the commercial real estate industry may decrease customer demand for our services. the commercial real estate market may be adversely impacted by many different factors, including lower than expected job growth or job losses resulting in reduced real estate demand; rising interest rates and slowing transaction volumes that negatively impact investment returns; excessive speculative new construction in localized markets resulting in increased vacancy rates and diminished rent growth; and unanticipated disasters and other adverse events such as slowing of the growth in the working age population resulting in reduced demand for all types of real estate. a reversal of improvements in the commercial real estate industry's leasing activity and absorption rates or a downturn in the commercial real estate market may affect our ability to generate revenues and may lead to more cancellations by our current or future customers, either of which could cause our revenues or our revenue growth rate to decline and reduce our profitability. a depressed commercial real estate market has a negative impact on our core customer base, which could decrease demand for our information, analytics and online marketplaces. also, companies in this industry may consolidate, often in order to reduce expenses. consolidation, or other cost-cutting measures by our customers, may lead to
cancellations of our information, analytics and online marketplace services by our customers, reduce the number of our existing clients, reduce the size of our target market or increase our clients' bargaining power, all of which could cause our revenues to decline and reduce our profitability. if cancellations, reductions of services, and failures to pay increase, and we are unable to offset the resulting decrease in revenues by increasing sales to new or existing customers, our revenues may decline or grow at lower rates.
negative general economic conditions could increase our expenses and reduce our revenues. our business and the commercial real estate industry are particularly affected by negative trends in the general economy. the success of our business depends on a number of factors relating to general global, national, regional and local economic conditions, including perceived and actual economic conditions, recessions, inflation, deflation, exchange rates, interest rates, taxation policies, availability of credit, employment levels, and wage and salary levels. negative general economic conditions could adversely affect our business by reducing our revenues and profitability. if we experience greater cancellations or reductions of services and failures to timely pay, and we do not acquire new clients or sell new services to our existing clients, our revenues may decline and our financial position would be adversely affected.  adverse national and global economic events, as well as any significant terrorist attack, are likely to have a dampening effect on the economy in general, which could negatively affect our financial performance and our stock price. further actions or inactions of the u.s. or other major national governments, including "brexit", may also impact economic conditions, which could result in financial market disruptions or an economic downtown. market disruptions may also contribute to extreme price and volume fluctuations in the stock market that may affect our stock price for reasons unrelated to our operating performance. in addition, a significant increase in inflation could increase our expenses more rapidly than expected, the effect of which may not be offset by corresponding increases in revenue. conversely, deflation resulting in a decline of prices could reduce our revenues. in the current economic environment, it is difficult to predict whether we will experience significant inflation or deflation in the near future. a significant increase in either could have an adverse effect on our results of operations. see the risk factor below titled "the economic effects of "brexit" may affect relationships with existing and future customers and could have an adverse impact on our business and operating results" for further discussion of risks related to brexit.
if we are unable to hire qualified persons for, or retain and continue to develop, our sales force, or if our sales force is unproductive, our revenues could be adversely affected. in order to support revenues and future revenue growth, we need to continue to develop, train and retain our sales force. our ability to build and develop a strong sales force may be affected by a number of factors, including: our ability to attract, integrate and motivate sales personnel; our ability to effectively train our sales force; the ability of our sales force to sell an increased number and different types of services; our ability to manage effectively an outbound telesales group; the length of time it takes new sales personnel to become productive; the competition we face from other companies in hiring and retaining sales personnel; our ability to effectively structure our sales force; and our ability to effectively manage a multi-location sales organization, including field sales personnel. if we are unable to hire qualified sales personnel and develop and retain the members of our sales force, including sales force management, or if our sales force is unproductive, our revenues or growth rate could decline and our expenses could increase.
we may not be able to compete successfully against existing or future competitors in attracting advertisers, which could harm our business, results of operations and financial condition. we compete to attract advertisers. our competition for advertisers may have significant brand recognition as well as greater numbers of direct sales personnel than we have and may generate more web traffic than we do, which may provide a competitive advantage. to compete successfully for advertisers against future and existing competitors, we must continue to invest resources in developing our advertising platform and proving the effectiveness and relevance of our advertising services. pressure from competitors seeking to acquire a greater share of our advertisers' overall marketing budget could adversely affect our pricing and margins, lower our revenue, and increase our research and development and marketing expenses. if we are unable to compete successfully against our existing or future competitors, our business, results of operations or financial condition could be adversely affected.
we may be unable to increase awareness of our brands, including costar, loopnet, apartments.com, bizbuysell and landsofamerica, which could adversely affect our business. we rely heavily on our brands, which we believe are key assets of our company. awareness and differentiation of our brands are important for attracting and expanding the number of users of, and subscribers to, our online marketplaces, such as loopnet, the apartments.com network of rental websites, costar showcase, and the land.com network of rural lands for sale. we expect to continue to invest in sales and marketing as we seek to grow the numbers of subscribers to, and advertisers on, our marketplaces. our methods of advertising may not be successful in increasing brand awareness or, ultimately, be cost-effective. if we are unable to maintain or enhance user and advertiser awareness of our brands, or if we are unable to recover our marketing and advertising costs through increased usage of our services and increased advertising on our websites, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected.
we rely on internet search engines to drive traffic to our websites. if search results do not feature our websites prominently, traffic to our websites would decrease and our business could be adversely affected. google, bing, yahoo! and other internet search websites drive traffic to our websites, including costar.com, the apartments.com network of rental websites, loopnet.com,
bizbuysell.com and the land.com network of land for sale websites. for example, when a user types an apartment building address into an internet search engine, organic search ranking of our apartments.com webpages will determine how prominently such webpages are displayed in the search results. however, our ability to maintain high organic search result rankings is not entirely within our control. our competitors' search engine optimization, or seo, efforts may result in their websites receiving a higher search result page ranking than the rankings our websites receive, or internet search engines could revise their methodologies in a way that would adversely affect our search result rankings, each of which could slow the growth of our user base. further, search engine providers could align with our competitors, which could adversely affect traffic to our websites. our websites have experienced fluctuations in search result rankings in the past, and we anticipate similar fluctuations in the future. if we experience a material reduction in the number of users directed to our websites through internet search engines, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected.
if we are unable to maintain or increase traffic to our marketplaces, our business and operating results could be adversely affected. our ability to generate revenues from our marketplace businesses depends, in part, on our ability to attract users to our websites. if we fail to maintain or increase traffic to our marketplaces, our ability to acquire additional subscribers or advertisers and deliver leads to and retain existing subscribers and advertisers could be adversely affected. our marketing expenses may increase in connection with our efforts to maintain or increase traffic to our websites. our efforts to maintain or generate additional traffic to our marketplaces may not be successful. even if we are able to attract additional users, increases in our operating expenses could negatively impact our operating results if we are unable to generate more revenues through increased sales of subscriptions to our marketplace products. we face competition to attract users to our marketplace websites. our existing and potential competitors include companies that could devote greater technical and other resources than we have available to provide services that users might view as superior to our offerings. any of our future or existing competitors may introduce different solutions that attract users away from our services or provide solutions similar to our own that have the advantage of better branding or marketing resources. if we are unable to increase traffic to our marketplaces, or if we are unable to generate enough additional revenues to offset increases in expenses related to increasing traffic to our marketplaces, our business and operating results could be adversely affected.
if real estate professionals or other advertisers reduce or cancel their advertising spending with us and we are unable to attract new advertisers, our operating results would be harmed. our marketplace businesses, including loopnet, the apartments.com network of rental websites, costar showcase, and the land.com network of rural lands for sale, depend on advertising revenues generated primarily through sales to persons in the real estate industry, including property managers and owners and other advertisers. our ability to attract and retain advertisers, and ultimately to generate advertising revenue, depends on a number of factors, including:
•   increasing the number of unique visitors to, and users of, our websites and mobile applications;
•   the quantity and quality of the leads that we provide to our advertisers;
•   the success of any marketing and product development efforts directed at attracting additional users and advertisers to our marketplaces;
•   keeping pace with changes in technology and with our competitors; and
•   offering an attractive return on investment to our advertisers for their advertising dollars spent with us.
further, with respect to the apartments.com network of rental websites, our ability to attract and retain advertisers also depends on the current apartment rental market and apartment vacancy rates. if vacancy rates are too high or too low, advertisers may not need to utilize our marketplace services.
many of the advertisers who advertise on our marketplaces do not have long-term contracts. these advertisers could choose to modify or discontinue their relationships with us with little or no advance notice. in addition, as existing subscriptions for advertising expire, we may not be successful in renewing these subscriptions or securing new subscriptions. we may not succeed in retaining existing advertisers' spending or capturing a greater share of such spending if we are unable to convince advertisers of the effectiveness of our services as compared to alternatives. in addition, future changes to our pricing methodology for advertising services may cause advertisers to reduce or discontinue their advertising with us. if current advertisers reduce or end their advertising spending with us and we are unable to attract new advertisers, our advertising revenues and business, results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected.
if we do not invest in product development and provide services that are attractive to our users and to our advertisers, our business could be adversely affected.  our success depends on our continued improvements to provide services that make our marketplaces useful for users and attractive to our advertisers. as a result, we must continually invest resources in research and development to improve the appeal and comprehensiveness of our services and effectively incorporate new technologies. if we are unable to provide services that users want to use, then users may become dissatisfied and use competitors' websites. if we are
unable to continue offering innovative services, we may be unable to attract additional users and advertisers or retain our current users and advertisers, which could harm our business, results of operations and financial condition.
if we are not able to successfully identify, finance, integrate and/or manage costs related to acquisitions, our business operations and financial position could be adversely affected. we have expanded our markets and services in part through acquisitions of complementary businesses, services, databases and technologies, and expect to continue to do so in the future. our strategy to acquire complementary companies or assets depends on our ability to identify, and the availability of, suitable acquisition candidates. we may incur costs in connection with an acquisition, but may ultimately be unable or unwilling to consummate the proposed transaction for various reasons. in addition, acquisitions involve numerous risks, including the ability to realize or capitalize on synergies created through combinations; managing the integration of personnel and products or services; managing the integration of acquired infrastructure and controls; potential increases in operating costs; managing geographically remote operations; the diversion of management's attention from other business concerns and potential disruptions in ongoing operations during integration; the inherent risks in entering markets and sectors in which we have either limited or no direct experience; and the potential loss of key employees, clients or vendors and other business partners of the acquired companies. we may not successfully integrate acquired businesses or assets and may not achieve anticipated benefits of an acquisition, including expected synergies. for example, we may be unable to fully integrate cozy technology into the apartments.com platform when and as expected or fully utilize and realize the benefits of realla's expertise in capturing listings data to facilitate our expansion strategy in other european markets.
we have incurred severance costs and expect to incur additional costs to integrate prior acquisitions, such as it integration expenses and costs related to the renegotiation of redundant vendor agreements. costs in connection with acquisitions and integrations may be higher than expected, and we may also incur unanticipated acquisition-related costs. these costs could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operation or prospects of the combined business.
external factors, such as compliance with laws and regulations, and shifting market preferences, may also impact the successful integration of an acquired business. an acquired business could strain our system of internal controls and diminish its effectiveness. acquisitions could result in dilutive issuances of equity securities, the incurrence of debt, one-time write-offs of goodwill and substantial amortization expenses of other intangible assets. we may be unable to obtain financing on favorable terms, or at all, if necessary to finance future acquisitions, making it impossible or more costly to complete future acquisitions. if we are able to obtain financing, the terms may be onerous and restrict our operations. further, certain acquisitions may be subject to regulatory approval, which can be time consuming and costly to obtain or may be denied, and if obtained, the terms of such regulatory approvals may impose limitations on our ongoing operations or require us to divest assets or lines of business.
our actual or perceived failure to comply with privacy laws and standards could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. we depend on information technology networks and systems to process, transmit and store electronic information and to communicate between our locations around the world and with our clients and vendors. we collect, use and disclose personally identifiable information, including among other things names, addresses, phone numbers and email addresses. we collect, store and use biometric data and sensitive or confidential transaction and account information. in addition, we collect personal information from tenants and landlords, including social security numbers, state or federal issued identification numbers, dates of birth, financial information and documents, employment information, background checks and credit scores, to facilitate the apartment rental application process between a renter and property manager. as a result, we are subject to a variety of state, national, and international laws and regulations that apply to the collection, use, retention, protection, disclosure, transfer and other processing of personal data, including the fair credit reporting act. laws and regulations related to privacy and data protection are evolving, with new or modified laws and regulations proposed and implemented frequently and existing laws and regulations subject to new or different interpretations. for example, in 2016, the eu formally adopted the general data protection regulation, or gdpr, which was implemented in all eu member states effective may 25, 2018 and replaced the eu data protection directive. the gdpr introduced new data protection requirements in the eu and imposes substantial fines for breaches of the data protection rules. the gdpr increased our responsibility and liability in relation to personal data that we process. we continue to assess our compliance with gdpr in light of guidance from data protection authorities, evolving best practices and evolving regulations and we may need to put in place additional mechanisms to ensure compliance with the new eu data protection rules. any failure to comply with the rules arising from the eu data protection directive, the gdpr, and related national laws of eu member states, could lead to government enforcement actions and significant penalties against us, and could adversely affect our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations. compliance with any of the foregoing laws and regulations can be costly and can delay or impede the development of new products. we may incur substantial fines if we violate any laws or regulations relating to the collection or use of personal information.
increase our operating costs, subject us to claims or other remedies and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
because the interpretation and application of many privacy and data protection laws are uncertain, it is possible that these laws may be interpreted and applied in a manner that is inconsistent with our existing data management practices or the features of our products. if so, in addition to the possibility of fines, lawsuits and other claims and penalties, we could be required to fundamentally change our business activities and practices or modify our products, which could harm our business.
we expect that there will continue to be new proposed laws, regulations and industry standards concerning privacy, data protection and information security in the united states and other jurisdictions, and we cannot determine the impact such future laws, regulations and standards may have on our business. our policies concerning the collection, use and disclosure of personally identifiable information are described on our websites. while we believe that our policies are appropriate and that we are in compliance with our policies, we could be subject to legal claims, government action, harm to our reputation or incur significant remediation costs if we experience a security breach or our practices fail, or are seen as failing, to comply with our policies or with applicable laws concerning personally identifiable information.
concern regarding our use of the personal information collected on our websites or collected when performing our services could keep prospective customers from subscribing to our services. industry-wide incidents or incidents with respect to our websites, including misappropriation of third-party information, security breaches or changes in industry standards, regulations or laws, could deter people from using the internet or our websites to conduct transactions that involve the transmission of confidential information, which could harm our business.
cyberattacks and security vulnerabilities could result in serious harm to our reputation, business, and financial condition. as stated above, our business involves the collection, storage, processing and transmission of customers' personal data. we also collect, store and process employee personal data. an increasing number of organizations, including large merchants, businesses, technology companies and financial institutions, as well as government institutions, have disclosed breaches of their information security systems, some of which have involved sophisticated and highly targeted attacks, including on their websites, mobile applications, and infrastructure.
the techniques used to obtain unauthorized, improper or illegal access to a target's systems, data or customers' data, disable or degrade services, or sabotage systems are constantly evolving and have become increasingly complex and sophisticated, may be difficult to detect quickly and often are not recognized or detected until after they have been launched against a target. we expect that unauthorized parties will continue to attempt to gain access to our systems or facilities through various means, including hacking into our systems or facilities or those of our customers or vendors, or attempting to fraudulently induce (for example, through spear phishing attacks or social engineering) our employees, customers, vendors or other users of our systems into disclosing user names, passwords, or other sensitive information, which may in turn be used to access our information technology systems. numerous and evolving cybersecurity threats, including advanced and persisting cyberattacks, phishing and social engineering schemes, could compromise the confidentiality, availability, and integrity of the data in our systems. our cybersecurity programs and efforts to protect our systems and data, and to prevent, detect and respond to data security incidents, may not prevent these threats or provide security. further, the security measures and procedures our customers, vendors and other users of our systems have in place to protect sensitive consumer data and other information may not be successful or sufficient to counter all data breaches, cyberattacks or system failures.
our information technology and infrastructure may be vulnerable to cyberattacks or security breaches, and third parties may be able to access our customers' or employees' personal or proprietary information that is stored on or accessible through those systems. we have experienced from time to time, and may experience in the future, breaches of our security measures due to human error, malfeasance, system errors or vulnerabilities or other irregularities. actual or perceived breaches of our security could, among other things:
•result in our systems or services being unavailable,
•result in improper disclosures of data,
•result in significant regulatory scrutiny and legal and financial exposure,
•lead to loss of customer confidence in, or decreased use of, our products and services,
•divert the attention of management from the operation of our business,
•result in significant contractual penalties or other payments as a result of third party losses or claims, and
•adversely affect our business and result of operations.
in addition, any cyberattacks or data security breaches affecting companies that we acquire or our customers or vendors (including data center and cloud computing providers) could have similar negative effects on our business. the coverage under our insurance policies may not be adequate to reimburse us for losses caused by security breaches.
we are subject to a number of risks related to acceptance of credit cards and debit cards for customer payments. we accept payments for our services through credit and debit card transactions. for credit and debit card payments, we pay interchange and other fees, which may increase over time. an increase in those fees may require us to increase the prices we charge and would increase our cost of revenues, either of which could harm our business, financial condition or results of operations.
we depend on processing vendors to complete credit and debit card transactions. if we or our processing vendors fail to maintain adequate systems for the authorization and processing of credit card transactions, it could cause one or more of the major credit card companies to disallow our continued use of their payment products. we could lose customers if we are not able to continue to use payment products of the major credit card companies. in addition, if the systems for the authorization and processing of credit card transactions fail to work properly and, as a result, we do not charge our customers' credit cards on a timely basis or at all, our business, revenue, results of operations and financial condition could be harmed.
we are also subject to payment card association operating rules, certification requirements and rules governing electronic funds transfers, which could change or be reinterpreted in ways that make it more difficult for us to comply. we are required to comply with payment card industry security standards. failing to comply with those standards may violate payment card association operating rules, federal and state laws and regulations, and the terms of our contracts with payment processors. any failure to comply also may subject us to fines, penalties, damages and civil liability, and may result in the loss of our ability to accept credit and debit card payments. further, there is no guarantee that such compliance will prevent illegal or improper use of our payment systems or the theft, loss, or misuse of data pertaining to credit and debit cards, cardholders and transactions. if we fail to adequately control fraudulent credit card transactions, we may face civil liability, diminished public perception of our security measures and significantly higher credit card-related costs, each of which could harm our business, results of operations and financial condition.
if we are unable to maintain our chargeback rate or refund rates at acceptable levels, our processing vendors may increase our transaction fees or terminate their relationships with us. any increases in our credit and debit card fees could harm our results of operations, particularly if we elect not to raise our rates for our services to offset the increase. the termination of our ability to process payments on any major credit or debit card would significantly impair our ability to operate our business.
technical problems or disruptions that affect either our customers' ability to access our services, or the software, internal applications, database and network systems underlying our services, could damage our reputation and brands and lead to reduced demand for our information, analytics and online marketplace services, lower revenues and increased costs. our business, brands and reputation depend upon the satisfactory performance, reliability and availability of our websites, the internet and our service providers. interruptions in these systems, whether due to system failures, computer viruses, software errors, physical or electronic break-ins, or malicious hacks or attacks on our systems (such as denial of service attacks), could affect the security and availability of our services on our mobile applications and our websites and prevent or inhibit the ability of users to access our services. our operations also depend on our ability to protect our databases, computers and software, telecommunications equipment and facilities against damage from potential dangers such as fire, flood, power loss, security breaches, computer viruses, telecommunications failures, terrorist attacks, acts of war, electronic and physical break-ins, computer viruses, earthquakes and similar events. our users rely on our services when conducting their own businesses. disruptions in, or reductions in ability to access, our services for whatever reason could damage our users' businesses, harm our reputation, result in additional costs or result in reduced demand for our information, analytics and online marketplace services, any of which could harm our business, results of operations and financial condition.
in addition, the software, internal applications and systems underlying our services are complex and may not be error-free. our careful development and testing may not be sufficient to ensure that we will not encounter technical problems when we attempt to enhance our software, internal applications and systems. any inefficiencies, errors or technical problems with our software, internal applications and systems could reduce the quality of our services or interfere with our customers' access to our information, analytics and online marketplaces, which could reduce the demand for our services, lower our revenues and increase our costs.
the majority of the communications, network and computer hardware used to operate our mobile applications and websites are located at facilities in virginia and california. we do not own or control the operation of certain of these facilities. our systems and operations are vulnerable to damage or interruption from fire, flood, power loss, security breaches, computer viruses, telecommunications failure, terrorist attacks, acts of war, electronic and physical break-ins, earthquakes and similar events. these risks may be increased with respect to operations housed at facilities we do not own or control. the occurrence of any of the
foregoing events could result in damage to our systems and hardware or could cause them to fail completely, and our insurance may not cover such events or may be insufficient to compensate us for losses that may occur.
a failure of our systems at any site could result in reduced functionality for our users, and a total failure of our systems could cause our mobile applications or websites to be inaccessible. problems faced or caused by our information technology service providers, including content distribution service providers, private network providers, internet providers and third-party web-hosting providers, or with the systems by which they allocate capacity among their customers (as applicable), could adversely affect the experience of our users. any financial difficulties, such as bankruptcy reorganization, faced by these third-party service providers or any of the service providers with whom they contract may have negative effects on our business, the nature and extent of which are difficult to predict. if our third-party service providers are unable to keep up with our growing needs for capacity, our business could be harmed. in addition, if distribution channels for our mobile applications experience disruptions, such disruptions could adversely affect the ability of users and potential users to access or update our mobile applications, which could harm our business.
our business interruption insurance may not cover certain events or may be insufficient to compensate us for the potentially significant losses, including the potential harm to the future growth of our business, which may result from interruptions in our service as a result of system failures or malicious attacks. any errors, defects, disruptions or other performance problems with our services could harm our reputation, business, results of operations and financial condition.
if we are not able to obtain and maintain accurate, comprehensive or reliable data, we could experience reduced demand for our information, analytics and online marketplace services. our success depends on our clients' confidence in the comprehensiveness, accuracy and reliability of the data and analysis we provide. the task of establishing and maintaining accurate and reliable data and analysis is challenging. if our data, including the data we obtain from third parties or directly from brokers through the listing manager feature on costar, or analysis is not current, accurate, comprehensive or reliable, we could experience reduced demand for our services or legal claims by our customers, which could result in lower revenues and higher expenses.
market volatility may have an adverse effect on our stock price. the trading price of our common stock has fluctuated widely in the past, and we expect that it will continue to fluctuate in the future. the price could fluctuate widely based on numerous factors, including: economic factors or conditions; quarter-to-quarter variations in our operating results; changes in analysts' estimates of our earnings; announcements by us or our competitors of technological innovations, new services, or other significant or strategic information; general conditions in the commercial real estate industry; general conditions of local, national or global economies; developments or disputes concerning copyrights or proprietary rights or other legal proceedings; and regulatory developments. in addition, the stock market in general, and the shares of internet-related and other technology companies in particular, have historically experienced extreme price fluctuations. this volatility has had a substantial effect on the market prices of securities issued by many companies for reasons unrelated to the operating performance of the specific companies and may have the same effect on the market price of our common stock.
competition could render our services uncompetitive and reduce our profitability. the markets for information systems and services and for online marketplaces in general is highly competitive and rapidly changing. competition in these markets may increase further if economic conditions or other circumstances cause customer bases and customer spending to decrease and service providers to compete for fewer customer resources. our existing competitors, or future competitors, may have greater name recognition, larger customer bases, better technology or data, lower prices, easier access to data, greater user traffic or greater financial, technical or marketing resources than we have. our competitors may be able to undertake more effective marketing campaigns, obtain more data, adopt more aggressive pricing policies, make more attractive offers to potential employees, subscribers, advertisers, distribution partners and content providers or may be able to respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies or changes in user requirements. if we are unable to retain customers or obtain new customers, our revenues could decline. increased competition could result in lower revenues and higher expenses, which would reduce our profitability.
our focus on internal and external investments may place downward pressure on our operating margins. we continue to invest in our business, including internal investments in product development to expand the breadth and depth of services we provide to our customers and investments in sales and marketing to generate brand awareness. our investment strategy is intended to increase our revenue growth in the future. our operating margins may experience downward pressure in the short term as a result of investments. furthermore, our investments may not have their intended effect or produce the expected results. in addition, our external investments may lose value and we may incur impairment charges with respect to such investments. such impairment charges may negatively impact our profitability. if we are unable to successfully execute our investment strategy or if we fail to adequately anticipate and address potential problems, we may experience decreases in our revenues and operating margins.
if we are unable to enforce or defend our ownership and use of intellectual property, our business, brands, competitive position and operating results could be harmed. the success of our business depends in large part on our intellectual property, including
intellectual property involved in our methodologies, database, services and software. we rely on a combination of trademark, trade secret, patent, copyright and other laws, nondisclosure and noncompetition provisions, license agreements and other contractual provisions and technical measures to protect our intellectual property rights. however, current law may not provide for adequate protection of our databases and the actual data. in addition, legal standards relating to the validity, enforceability and scope of protection of proprietary rights in internet-related businesses are uncertain and evolving, and changes in these standards may adversely impact the viability or value of our proprietary rights. if we are not successful in protecting our intellectual property, including our content, our brands and our business, results of operations and financial condition could be harmed. the same would be true if a court found that our services infringe other persons' intellectual property rights. any intellectual property lawsuits or threatened lawsuits in which we are involved, either as a plaintiff or as a defendant, could cost us a significant amount of time and money and distract management's attention from operating our business. in addition, if we do not prevail on an intellectual property claim, this could result in a change to our methodology or information, analytics and online marketplace services and could reduce our profitability.
effective trademark, trade secret, patent, and copyright protection may not be available in every country in which our services may be provided. the laws of certain countries do not protect proprietary rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states and, therefore, in certain jurisdictions, we may be unable to protect our intellectual property and our proprietary technology adequately against unauthorized third-party copying or use, which could harm our competitive position.
we seek to enforce our rights against people and entities that infringe our intellectual property, including through legal action. taking such action may be costly, and we cannot ensure that such actions will be successful. any increase in the unauthorized use of our intellectual property could make it more expensive for us to do business and harm our results of operations or financial condition.
we may not be able to successfully halt the operation of websites that aggregate our data, as well as data from other companies, such as copycat websites that may misappropriate our data. third parties may misappropriate our data through website scraping, robots or other means and aggregate this data on their websites with data from other companies. in addition, "copycat" websites may misappropriate data on our website and attempt to imitate our brands or the functionality of our website. we may not be able to detect all such websites in a timely manner and, even if we could, technological and legal measures may be insufficient to stop their operations. in some cases, particularly in the case of websites operating outside of the u.s., our available remedies may not be adequate to protect us against the misappropriation of our data. regardless of whether we can successfully enforce our rights against the operators of these websites, any measures that we may take could require us to expend significant financial or other resources.
third party claims, litigation or government investigations to which we are subject or in which we become involved may significantly increase our expenses and adversely affect our stock price. currently and from time to time, we are a party to various third party claims, lawsuits, or government investigations. any lawsuits, threatened lawsuits or government investigations in which we are involved, whether as plaintiff or defendant, could cost us a significant amount of time and money, could distract management's attention away from operating our business, could result in negative publicity and could adversely affect our stock price. in addition, if any claims are determined against us or if a settlement requires us to pay a large monetary amount or take other action that materially restricts or impedes our operations, our profitability could be significantly reduced and our financial position could be adversely affected. our insurance may not be sufficient to cover any losses we incur in connection with litigation claims.
we may be subject to legal liability for collecting, displaying or distributing information. because the content in our database is collected from various sources and distributed to others, we may be subject to claims for breach of contract, defamation, negligence, unfair competition or copyright or trademark infringement or claims based on other theories. we could also be subject to claims based upon the content that is accessible from our website through links to other websites or information on our website supplied by third parties. we could also be subject to claims that the collection or provision of certain information breached laws and regulations relating to privacy and data protection. even if these claims do not result in liability to us, we could incur significant costs in investigating and defending against any claims and we could be subject to public notice requirements that may affect our reputation in the marketplace. our potential liability for information distributed by us to others could require us to implement measures to reduce our exposure to such liability, which may require us to expend substantial resources and limit the attractiveness of our information, analytics and online marketplaces to users.
our business depends on retaining and attracting highly capable management and operating personnel. our success depends in large part on our ability to retain and attract management and operating personnel, including our president and chief executive officer, andrew florance, and our other officers and key employees. our business requires highly skilled technical, sales, management, web product and development, marketing and research personnel, who are in high demand and are often subject to competing offers. to retain and attract key personnel, we use various measures, including employment agreements, awards under
a stock incentive plan and incentive bonuses for key employees. these measures may not be enough to retain and attract the personnel we need or to offset the impact on our business of the loss of the services of mr. florance or other key officers or employees.
an impairment in the carrying value of goodwill could negatively impact our consolidated results of operations and net worth. goodwill and identifiable intangible assets not subject to amortization are tested annually by each reporting unit on october 1 of each year for impairment and are tested for impairment more frequently based upon the existence of one or more indicators. we assess the impairment of long-lived assets, identifiable intangibles and goodwill whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. judgments made by management relate to the expected useful lives of long-lived assets and our ability to realize undiscounted cash flows of the carrying amounts of such assets. the accuracy of these judgments may be adversely affected by several factors, including the factors listed below:
•   significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results;
•   significant changes in the manner of our use of acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business;
•   significant negative industry or economic trends; or
•   significant decline in our market capitalization relative to net book value for a sustained period.
these types of events or indicators and the resulting impairment analysis could result in goodwill impairment charges in the future, which would reduce our profitability. impairment charges could negatively affect our financial results in the periods of such charges, which may reduce our profitability. as of december 31, 2018, we had approximately $1.6 billion of goodwill, including $1.6 billion in our north america operating segment and $38 million in our international operating segment.
if we are unable to obtain or retain listings from commercial real estate brokers, agents, property owners and apartment property managers, our commercial real estate ("cre") marketplace services, including but not limited to loopnet, the apartments.com network of rental websites, costar showcase, landandfarm.com and landsofamerica.com, could be less attractive to current or potential customers, which could reduce our revenues. the value of our cre marketplace services to our customers depends on our ability to increase the number of property listings provided and searches conducted. the success of our cre marketplace services depends substantially on the number of property listings submitted by brokers, agents, property owners and, in the case of apartment rentals, property managers. this is because an increase in the number of listings increases the utility of the online service and of its associated search, listing and marketing services. if agents marketing large numbers of property listings, such as large brokers in key real estate markets, choose not to continue their listings with us, or choose to list them with a competitor, our cre marketplace services could be less attractive to other real estate industry transaction participants, resulting in reduced revenue. similarly, the value and utility of our other marketplaces, including bizbuysell and bizquest, are also dependent on attracting and retaining listings.
if we are unable to convince commercial real estate professionals that our cre marketplace services are superior to traditional methods of listing, searching and marketing commercial real estate, they could choose not to use those services, which could reduce our revenues or increase our expenses. the primary source of new customers for our cre marketplace services is participants in the commercial real estate community. many commercial real estate professionals are accustomed to listing, searching and marketing real estate in traditional and off-line ways, such as by distributing print brochures, sharing written lists, placing signs on properties, word-of-mouth and newspaper advertisements. commercial real estate and investment professionals may prefer to continue to use traditional methods or may be slow to adopt and accept our online products and services. if we are not able to persuade commercial real estate participants of the efficacy of our online products and services, they may choose not to use our cre marketplace services, which could negatively impact our business. similarly, if we are unable to convince the business and investment community to utilize our online business for sale marketplaces rather than traditional methods of listing and marketing businesses for sale, our revenues could be negatively affected.
if we are unable to increase our revenues or our operating costs are higher than expected, our profitability may decline and our operating results may fluctuate significantly. we may not be able to accurately forecast our revenues or future revenue growth rate. many of our expenses, particularly personnel costs and occupancy costs, are relatively fixed. as a result, we may not be able to adjust spending quickly enough to offset any unexpected increase in expenses or revenue shortfall. we may experience higher than expected operating costs, including increased personnel costs, occupancy costs, selling and marketing costs, investments in geographic expansion, acquisition costs, communications costs, travel costs, software development costs, professional fees and other costs. if operating costs exceed our expectations and cannot be adjusted accordingly, our profitability may be reduced and our results of operations and financial position will be adversely affected. additionally, we may not be able to sustain our revenue growth rates, and our percentage revenue growth rates may decline. our ability to increase our revenues and operating profit will depend on increased demand for our services. our sales are affected by, among other things, general economic and commercial real estate conditions. reduced demand, whether due to changes in customer preference, a weakening of the u.s. or global economy, competition or other reasons, may result in decreased revenues and growth, adversely affecting our operating results.
our current or future geographic expansion plans may not result in increased revenues, which may negatively impact our business, results of operations and financial position. expanding into new markets and investing resources towards increasing the depth of our coverage within existing markets imposes additional burdens on our research, systems development, sales, marketing and general managerial resources. if we are unable to manage our expansion efforts effectively, if our expansion efforts take longer than planned or if our costs for these efforts exceed our expectations, our financial position could be adversely affected. in addition, if we incur significant costs to improve data quality within existing markets, or are not successful in marketing and selling our services in these markets or in new markets, our expansion may have a material adverse effect on our financial position by increasing our expenses without increasing our revenues, adversely affecting our profitability.
international operations expose us to additional business risks, which may reduce our profitability. our international operations and expansion subject us to additional business risks, including: currency exchange rate fluctuations; adapting to the differing business practices and laws in foreign countries; including differing laws regarding privacy and data protection; difficulties in managing foreign operations; limited protection for intellectual property rights in some countries; difficulty in collecting accounts receivable and longer collection periods; costs of enforcing contractual obligations; impact of recessions in economies outside the u.s.; and potentially adverse tax consequences. in addition, international expansion imposes additional burdens on our executive and administrative personnel, systems development, research and sales departments, and general managerial resources. if we are not able to manage our international operations successfully, we may incur higher expenses and our profitability may be reduced. finally, the investment required for additional international expansion could exceed the profit generated from such expansion, which would reduce our profitability and adversely affect our financial position.
fluctuating foreign currencies may negatively impact our business, results of operations and financial position. due to our acquisitions of costar u.k. limited (formerly focus information limited), property and portfolio research ltd., grecam s.a.s., realla ltd., the assets of belbex corporate, s.l., thomas daily, as well as our expansion into canada, a portion of our business is denominated in the british pound, euro and canadian dollar. as a result, fluctuations in foreign currencies may have an impact on our business, results of operations and financial position. foreign currency exchange rates have fluctuated and may continue to fluctuate. significant foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations may negatively impact our international revenue, which in turn affects our consolidated revenue. currencies may be affected by internal factors, general economic conditions and external developments in other countries, all of which can have an adverse impact on a country's currency. currently, we are not party to any hedging transactions intended to reduce our exposure to exchange rate fluctuations. we may seek to enter into hedging transactions in the future, but we may be unable to enter into these transactions successfully, on acceptable terms or at all. we cannot predict whether we will incur foreign exchange losses in the future. further, significant foreign exchange fluctuations resulting in a decline in the respective local currency may decrease the value of our foreign assets, as well as decrease our revenues and earnings from our foreign subsidiaries, which would reduce our profitability and adversely affect our financial position.
the economic effects of "brexit" may affect relationships with existing and future customers and could have an adverse impact on our business and operating results. on june 23, 2016, the u.k. held a referendum in which british citizens approved an exit from the european union ("e.u."), commonly referred to as "brexit." on march 29, 2017, the united kingdom provided its official notice to the european council that it intends to leave the european union, commencing a period of up to two years for the u.k. and the other e.u. member states to negotiate the terms of the withdrawal. uncertainty over the terms of the u.k.'s withdrawal from the e.u. could cause political and economic uncertainty in the u.k. and the rest of europe, which could harm our business and financial results. in particular, brexit could result in significant volatility in global equity markets, currency exchange rates and other asset prices, including those related to real property. the impact to us from brexit will depend, in part, on the outcome of tariff, trade, regulatory and other negotiations, the results of which are currently uncertain. this impact may affect not only our u.k. operations but operations in other parts of the e.u. any transitional or permanent agreements resulting from such negotiations could potentially disrupt the markets we serve and the tax jurisdictions in which we operate.
a potential devaluation of the local currencies of our international customers relative to the u.s. dollar may impair the purchasing power of our international customers and could cause international customers to decrease or cancel orders, or terminate or fail to renew subscriptions for our services.
we translate sales and other results denominated in foreign currency into u.s. dollars for our financial statements. during periods of a strengthening u.s. dollar, our reported international sales and earnings could be reduced because foreign currencies may translate into fewer u.s. dollars. resulting asset price volatility that could follow the withdrawal of the u.k. from the e.u. may create global economic uncertainty, which may cause our customers to closely monitor their costs and reduce their spending budgets on our products and services. in addition, brexit could lead to legal uncertainty and potentially divergent national laws and regulations as the u.k determines which e.u. laws to replace or replicate, and those laws and regulations may be cumbersome, difficult or costly in terms of compliance. further, brexit may lead other e.u. member countries to consider referendums regarding
their e.u. membership. any of these effects of brexit, among others, could adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows.
changes in laws, regulations or fiscal and tax policies or the manner of their interpretation or enforcement could adversely impact our financial performance. new laws or regulations, or changes in existing laws or regulations, or the manner of their interpretation or enforcement, could increase our cost of doing business. in particular, there may be significant changes in u.s. laws and regulations by the current u.s. presidential administration that could affect a wide variety of industries and businesses, including our business. the current u.s. presidential administration has called for substantial change to fiscal and tax policies, and recently adopted tax reform legislation. if the current u.s. presidential administration materially modifies u.s. laws and regulations or fiscal and other tax policies, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected.
in december 2017, the united states enacted the tax cuts and jobs act (the "tax act"), and various provisions of the new law may adversely affect us. certain aspects of tax reform are unclear and may not be clarified for some time. during 2018, the department of the treasury issued certain guidance in the form of notices and proposed regulations with respect to several provisions of the new legislation. we expect that additional regulations or other guidance may be issued with respect to the tax act in 2019 and subsequent years. we continue to examine the impact this tax reform legislation may have on our business. in addition, if federal, state, local or foreign tax authorities change applicable tax laws or issue new guidance, including in response to the tax act, our overall taxes could increase, and our business, financial condition or results of operations may be adversely impacted.
our indebtedness could adversely affect us, including by decreasing our business flexibility and increasing our costs. the 2017 credit agreement provides for a $750 million revolving credit facility with a term of five years from a syndicate of financial institutions as lenders and issuing banks. the 2017 credit agreement contains customary restrictive covenants imposing operating and financial restrictions on us, including restrictions that may limit our ability to engage in acts that we believe may be in our long-term best interests. these covenants restrict our ability and the ability of our subsidiaries to, among other things, (i) incur additional indebtedness, (ii) create, incur, assume or permit to exist any liens, (iii) enter into mergers, consolidations or similar transactions, (iv) make investments and acquisitions, (v) make certain dispositions of assets, (vi) make dividends, distributions and prepayments of certain indebtedness and (vii) enter into certain transactions with affiliates.
the operating restrictions and financial covenants in the 2017 credit agreement and any future financing agreements may limit our ability to finance future operations or capital needs, to engage in other business activities or to respond to changes in market conditions. our ability to comply with any financial covenants could be affected materially by events beyond our control, and we may be unable to satisfy any such requirements. if we fail to comply with these covenants, we may need to seek waivers or amendments of such covenants, seek alternative or additional sources of financing or reduce our expenditures. we may be unable to obtain such waivers, amendments or alternative or additional financing on a timely basis or at all, or on favorable terms.
we are required to make periodic principal and interest payments pursuant to the terms of the 2017 credit agreement. if an event of default occurs, the interest rate on overdue amounts will increase and the lenders under the 2017 credit agreement may declare all outstanding borrowings, together with accrued interest and other fees, to be immediately due and payable and may exercise remedies in respect of the collateral. we may not be able to repay all amounts due under the 2017 credit agreement in the event these amounts are declared due upon an event of default.
negative conditions in the global credit markets may affect the liquidity of a portion of our long-term investments.  currently, our long-term investments include mostly aaa-rated auction rate securities ("ars"), which are primarily student loan securities supported by guarantees from the federal family education loan program ("ffelp") of the u.s. department of education. continuing negative conditions in the global credit markets have prevented some investors from liquidating their holdings of auction rate securities because the amount of securities submitted for sale has exceeded the amount of purchase orders for such securities. as of december 31, 2018, we held $11 million par value of ars, all of which failed to settle at auctions. when an auction fails for ars in which we have invested, we may be unable to liquidate some or all of these securities at par. in the event we need or desire to immediately access these funds, we will not be able to do so until a future auction on these investments is successful, a buyer is found outside the auction process or an alternative action is determined. if a buyer is found but is unwilling to purchase the investments at par, we may incur a loss, which would reduce our profitability and adversely affect our financial position.
our operating results and revenues are subject to fluctuations and our quarterly financial results may be subject to seasonality and market cyclicality, each of which could cause our stock price to be negatively affected. the commercial real estate market may be influenced by general economic conditions, economic cycles, annual seasonality factors and many other factors, which in turn may impact our financial results. the market is large and fragmented. the different sectors of the industry, such as office, industrial, retail, multifamily, and others, are influenced differently by different factors, and have historically moved through economic cycles with different timing. as such, it is difficult to estimate the potential impact of economic cycles and conditions
or seasonality from year-to-year on our overall operating results. in addition, our results may be impacted by seasonality. the timing of widely observed holidays and vacation periods, particularly slowdowns during the end-of-year holiday period, and availability of real estate agents and related service providers during these periods, could significantly affect our quarterly operating results during that period. if we are unable to adequately respond to economic, seasonal or cyclical conditions, our revenues, expenses and operating results may fluctuate from quarter to quarter. our operating results, revenues and expenses may fluctuate for many reasons, including those described below and elsewhere in this annual report on form 10-k:
•   rates of subscriber adoption and retention;
•   timing of our sales conference or significant marketing events;
•   a slow-down during the end-of-year holiday period;
•   changes in our pricing strategy and timing of changes;
•   the timing and success of new service introductions and enhancements;
•   the shift of focus from, or phase out of services that overlap or are redundant with other services we offer;
•   the amount and timing of our operating expenses and capital expenditures;
•   the amount and timing of non-cash stock-based charges;
•   costs related to acquisitions of businesses or technologies or impairment charges associated with such investments and acquisitions;
•   changes or consolidation in the real estate industry;
•   our investments in geographic expansion and to increase coverage in existing markets;
•   successful execution of our expansion and integration plans;
•   the development of our sales force;
•   foreign currency and exchange rate fluctuations;
•   changes in client budgets.
these fluctuations or seasonality effects could negatively affect our results of operations during the period in question and/or future periods or cause our stock price to decline. in addition, changes in accounting policies or practices may affect our level of net income. fluctuations in our financial results, revenues and expenses may cause the market price of our common stock to decline.
the consent order approved by the federal trade commission in connection with the loopnet merger imposes conditions that could have an adverse effect on us and our business, and failure to comply with the terms of the consent order may result in adverse consequences for the combined company. on april 26, 2012, the ftc accepted the consent order in connection with the loopnet merger that was previously agreed to among the ftc staff, costar, and loopnet on april 17, 2012. the consent order was subject to a 30-day public comment period, and on august 29, 2012, the ftc issued its final acceptance of the consent order.
the consent order, which is publicly available on the ftc's website at http://www.ftc.gov/, requires us to maintain certain business practices that the ftc believes are pro-competitive.  for example, the consent order requires us to license our products to customers who have bought its competitors' products on a non-discriminatory basis. in addition, we are required to provide the ftc with advance written notification of certain acquisitions for which notification would not otherwise be required under the hart-scott-rodino premerger notification act. this provision of the consent order requiring costar to provide the ftc with advance written notification of certain acquisitions could prevent us from closing certain acquisitions or add significant time and cost to these potential acquisitions, ultimately making an acquisition prohibitive or preventing us from realizing anticipated benefits of an acquisition. in the event that we fail or are unable to comply with the terms of the consent order, we could be subject to an enforcement proceeding that could result in substantial fines and/or injunctive relief.
changes in accounting and reporting policies or practices may affect our financial results or presentation of results, which may affect our stock price. changes in accounting and reporting policies or practices could reduce our net income, which reductions may be independent of changes in our operations. these reductions in reported net income could cause our stock price to decline.
item 7.   management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations contains "forward-looking statements," including statements about our beliefs and expectations. there are many risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those discussed in the forward-looking statements. potential factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those discussed in any forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, those stated above in item 1a. under the headings "risk factors - cautionary statement concerning forward-looking statements" and "risk factors," as well as those described from time to time in our filings with the securities and exchange commission.
all forward-looking statements are based on information available to us on the date of this filing and we assume no obligation to update such statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. the following discussion should be read in conjunction with our quarterly reports on form 10-q, current reports on form 8-k and other filings with the securities and exchange commission and the consolidated financial statements and related notes included in this annual report on form 10-k.
overview we are the number one provider of information, analytics and online marketplaces to the commercial real estate industry in the u.s. and the u.k. based on the fact that we offer the most comprehensive commercial real estate database available; have the largest research department in the industry; own and operate leading online marketplaces for commercial real estate and apartment listings in the u.s. based on the numbers of unique visitors and site visits per month; provide more information, analytics and marketing services than any of our competitors. we created and compiled our standardized platform of information, analytics and online marketplace services where industry professionals and consumers of commercial real estate, including apartments, and the related business communities, can continuously interact and facilitate transactions by efficiently accessing and exchanging accurate and standardized real estate-related information.
our subscription-based services consist primarily of information, analytics and online marketplace services offered over the internet to commercial real estate industry and related professionals. our services are typically distributed to our clients under subscription-based license agreements that renew automatically, a majority of which have a term of one year. upon renewal, subscription contract rates may change in accordance with contract provisions or as a result of contract renegotiations. to encourage clients to use our services regularly, we generally charge a fixed monthly amount for our subscription-based services rather than charging fees based on actual system usage or number of paid clicks. our service offerings span all commercial property types, including office, retail, industrial, multifamily, commercial land, mixed-use and hospitality. depending on the type of service, contract rates are generally based on the number of sites, number of users, organization size, the client's business focus, geography, the number and types of services to which a client subscribes, the number of properties a client advertises and the prominence and placement of a client's advertised properties in the search results, as applicable. our subscription clients generally pay contract fees in advance on a monthly basis, but in some cases may pay us in advance on a quarterly or annual basis.
we also provide market research, portfolio and debt analysis, management and reporting capabilities, and real estate and lease management solutions, including lease administration and abstraction services, to commercial customers, real estate investors and lenders via our other service offerings.
our principal information, analytics and online marketplace services are described in the following paragraphs by type of service:

online marketplaces multifamily. apartments.comtm is part of our network of apartment marketing sites, which also includes apartmentfinder.comtm, forrent.com®, apartmenthomeliving.comtm, westsiderentals.com®, after55.com®, corporatehousing.comtm, forrentuniversity.com® and apartamentos.comtm, our apartment-listing site offered exclusively in spanish. our apartment marketing network of subscription-based services offers renters a searchable database of apartment listings and provides professional property management companies and landlords with an advertising destination. on february 21, 2018, we completed the acquisition of forrent, a division of dominion enterprises, including the forrent.com, after55.com, corporatehousing.com and forrentuniversity.com apartment marketing sites. we continue to integrate, develop and cross-sell the services offered by forrent. on november 8, 2018, we acquired cozy services, ltd. ("cozy"), a leading provider of online rental solutions that provides a broad spectrum of services to both landlords and tenants, including property listings, rent estimates, rental applications, tenant screening, online rent payments and expense tracking. see note 4 to the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in part iv of this annual report on form 10-k for further discussion of the acquisition of cozy.
commercial property and land. our loopnet subscription-based, online marketplace services enable commercial property owners, landlords and real estate agents working on their behalf to list properties for sale or for lease and to submit detailed information about property listings. commercial real estate agents, buyers and tenants use loopnet's online marketplace services to search for available property listings that meet their criteria. on october 12, 2018, we acquired all of the issued share capital of realla ltd. ("realla"), the operator of a commercial property listings and data management platform in the u.k., including a free-to-list search engine for commercial property listings. see note 4 to the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in part iv of this annual report on form 10-k for further discussion of the acquisition of realla. our bizbuysell services, which include bizquest®, provide an online marketplace for businesses for sale. our land.com network of sites, which provide online marketplaces for rural lands for sale, includes landsofamerica, landandfarm and landwatch®
as of december 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016 our annualized net bookings of subscription-based services on all contracts were approximately $50 million, $43 million and $29 million, respectively, calculated based on the annualized amount of change in our sales resulting from all new subscription-based contracts or upsales on all existing subscription-based contracts, less write downs and cancellations, for the period reported. we recognize subscription revenues on a straight-line basis over the life of the contract. net bookings is considered a key indicator of future subscription revenue growth and is also used as a metric of salesforce productivity by management and investors.
for the years ended december 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, our contract renewal rate for existing costar subscription-based services on annual contracts was approximately 90%, 91% and 90% respectively, and, therefore, our cancellation rate for those services was approximately 10%, 9%, and 10%, respectively. our contract renewal rate is a quantitative measurement that is typically closely correlated with our revenue results. as a result, management also believes that the rate may be a reliable indicator of short-term and long-term performance. our trailing twelve-month contract renewal rate may decline if, among other reasons, negative economic conditions lead to greater business failures and/or consolidations among our clients, reductions in customer spending, or decreases in our customer base.
development, investments and expansion we are committed to supporting, improving and enhancing our information, news, analytics and online marketplace solutions, including expanding and improving our offerings for property managers and renters. we expect to continue our software development efforts to improve existing services, introduce new services, integrate and cross-sell services, and expand and develop supporting technologies for our research, sales and marketing organizations. we have been, and plan to continue, integrating, further developing and cross-selling our services. to generate brand awareness and site traffic for our listing sites, we utilize a multi-channel marketing campaign, including television and radio advertising, online/digital advertising, social media and out-of-home ads, and search engine marketing. we expect to continue to invest in sales and marketing, consistent with historical levels, to promote our sites in 2019. as we continue to assess the success and effectiveness of our marketing campaign, we will continue to work to determine the optimal level of marketing investment for our services for future periods.
•   continuing to develop new, and improve existing, online rental property service offerings for the apartments industry. we plan to utilize acquired platforms, including cozy, along with our previously developed and newly developed technologies, to create a complete digital rental experience that enables renters to apply for leases, for landlords to run tenant credit and background checks and for landlords and tenants to generate and enter into leases and to make and process payments, all online through a single platform.
•   continuing to develop and enhance costar suite by making additional investments in analytical capabilities and developing products offerings with new capabilities focused on owners and lenders of commercial real estate. we also plan to invest in integrating the technology and infrastructure from other existing products into the costar suite platform, including costar real estate manager, in order to leverage data across our platforms and provide customers with additional functionality. we plan to invest further in our daily newsletter for u.s. subscribers, including providing curated content to our largest markets, and more personalized information.
•   continuing to invest in the loopnet marketplace by enhancing the content on the site, including high-quality imagery, seeking targeted advertisements and adding more content for premium listings, to better meet the needs of a broader cross section of the commercial real estate industry. continuing to invest in our research operations to support continued growth of our information and analytics offerings. in furtherance of both of these priorities, we plan to continue to generate awareness and promote usage of listing manager, an online tool that allows customers with costar or loopnet listings to update and manage their listings directly online. loopnet users can also monitor listing performance, access lead and prospect reports, and upgrade exposure of their listings. we expect the use of this tool to result in more updates made directly by brokers and owners entering data directly into the self-service tool, which we believe will result in significant long-term cost savings and better quality data.
•   continuing to invest in the growth of our international business. we plan to integrate realla with our costar u.k. operations, including development of a single point of data entry to allow our clients to simultaneously arrange to display their commercial real estate listings through the costar suite service offering and to also make them visible to prospective tenants and investors through realla's marketing portal.
we intend to continue to assess the need for additional investments in our business, in addition to the investments discussed above, in order to develop and distribute new services and functionality within our current platform or expand the reach of our current service offerings. any future product development or expansion of services, combination and coordination of services or elimination of services or corporate expansion, development or restructuring efforts could reduce our profitability and increase our capital expenditures. any new investments, changes to our service offerings or other unforeseen events could cause us to experience reduced revenues or generate losses and negative cash flow from operations in the future. any development efforts must comply with our credit facility, which contains restrictive covenants that restrict our operations and use of our cash flow and may prevent us from taking certain actions that we believe could increase our profitability or otherwise enhance our business.

non-gaap financial measures we prepare and publicly release quarterly unaudited financial statements prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles ("gaap"). we also disclose and discuss certain non-gaap financial measures in our public releases, investor conference calls and filings with the securities and exchange commission. the non-gaap financial measures that we may disclose include net income before interest and other income (expense), loss on debt extinguishment, income taxes, depreciation and amortization ("ebitda"), adjusted ebitda, adjusted ebitda margin, non-gaap net income and non-gaap net income per diluted share (also referred to as "non-gaap eps"). ebitda is our net income before interest and other income (expense), loss on debt extinguishment, income taxes, depreciation and amortization. we typically disclose ebitda on a consolidated and an operating segment basis in our earnings releases, investor conference calls and filings with the securities and exchange commission. adjusted ebitda is different from ebitda because we further adjust ebitda for stock-based compensation expense, acquisition- and integration-related costs, restructuring costs and settlements and impairments incurred outside our ordinary course of business. non-gaap net income and non-gaap net income per diluted share are similarly adjusted for stock-based compensation expense, acquisition- and integration-related costs, restructuring costs, settlement and impairment costs incurred outside our ordinary course of business and loss on debt extinguishment as well as amortization of acquired intangible assets and other related costs. from this figure, we then subtract an assumed provision for income taxes to arrive at non-gaap net income. we may disclose adjusted ebitda, adjusted ebitda margin, non-gaap net income and non-gaap net income per diluted share on a consolidated basis in our earnings releases, investor conference calls and filings with the securities and exchange commission. the non-gaap financial measures that we use may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. also, in the future, we may disclose different non-gaap financial measures in order to help our investors meaningfully evaluate and compare our results of operations to our previously reported results of operations or to those of other companies in our industry.
we view ebitda, adjusted ebitda, non-gaap net income and non-gaap net income per diluted share as operating performance measures and as such we believe that the most directly comparable gaap financial measure is net income. in calculating ebitda, adjusted ebitda, non-gaap net income and non-gaap net income per diluted share, we exclude from net income the financial items that we believe should be separately identified to provide additional analysis of the financial components of the day-to-day operation of our business. we have outlined below the type and scope of these exclusions and the material limitations on the use of these non-gaap financial measures as a result of these exclusions. ebitda, adjusted ebitda, non-gaap net income and non-gaap net income per diluted share are not measurements of financial performance under gaap and should not be considered as a measure of liquidity, as an alternative to net income or as an indicator of any other measure of performance derived in accordance with gaap. investors and potential investors in our securities should not rely on ebitda, adjusted ebitda, non-gaap net income and non-gaap net income per diluted share as a substitute for any gaap financial measure, including net income. in addition, we urge investors and potential investors in our securities to carefully review the gaap financial information included as part of our annual reports on form 10-k and quarterly reports on form 10-q that are filed with the securities and exchange commission, as well as our quarterly earnings releases, and compare the gaap financial information with our ebitda, adjusted ebitda, non-gaap net income and non-gaap net income per diluted share.
ebitda, adjusted ebitda, adjusted ebitda margin, non-gaap net income and non-gaap net income per diluted share may be used by management to internally measure our operating and management performance and may be used by investors as supplemental financial measures to evaluate the performance of our business. we believe that these non-gaap measures, when viewed with our gaap results and accompanying reconciliations, provide additional information that is useful to understand the factors and trends affecting our business. we have spent more than 30 years building our database of commercial real estate information and expanding our markets and services partially through acquisitions of complementary businesses. due to the expansion of our information, analytics and online marketplace services, which has included acquisitions, our net income has included significant charges for amortization of acquired intangible assets, depreciation and other amortization, acquisition- and integration-related costs, restructuring costs, and loss on debt extinguishment. adjusted ebitda, non-gaap net income and non-gaap net income per diluted share exclude these charges and provide meaningful information about the operating performance of our business, apart from charges for amortization of acquired intangible assets, depreciation and other amortization, acquisition- and integration-related costs, restructuring costs; settlement and impairment costs incurred outside our ordinary course of business. we believe the disclosure of non-gaap measures can help investors meaningfully evaluate and compare our performance from quarter to quarter and from year to year. we also believe the non-gaap measures we disclose are measures of our ongoing operating performance because the isolation of non-cash charges, such as amortization and depreciation, and other items, such as interest, income taxes, stock-based compensation expenses, acquisition- and integration-related costs, restructuring costs; loss on debt extinguishment and settlement and impairment costs incurred outside our ordinary course of business, provides additional information about our cost structure, and, over time, helps track our operating progress. in addition, investors, securities analysts and others have regularly relied on ebitda and may rely on adjusted ebitda, adjusted ebitda margin, non-gaap net income or non-gaap net income per diluted share to provide a financial measure by which to compare our operating performance against that of other companies in our industry.
set forth below are descriptions of financial items that have been excluded from net income to calculate ebitda and the material limitations associated with using this non-gaap financial measure as compared to net income:
•   amortization of acquired intangible assets in cost of revenues may be useful for investors to consider because it represents the diminishing value of any acquired trade names and other intangible assets and the use of our acquired technology, which is one of the sources of information for our database of commercial real estate information. we do not believe these charges necessarily reflect the current and ongoing cash charges related to our operating cost structure.
•   amortization of acquired intangible assets in operating expenses may be useful for investors to consider because it represents the estimated attrition of our acquired customer base. we do not believe these charges necessarily reflect the current and ongoing cash charges related to our operating cost structure.
•   depreciation and other amortization may be useful for investors to consider because they generally represent the wear and tear on our property and equipment used in our operations. we do not believe these charges necessarily reflect the current and ongoing cash charges related to our operating cost structure.
•   the amount of interest and other income and expense we generate may be useful for investors to consider and may result in current cash inflows. however, we do not consider the amount of interest and other income and expense to be a representative component of the day-to-day operating performance of our business.
•   the amount of loss on our debt extinguishment may be useful for investors to consider because it generally represents losses from the early extinguishment of debt. however, we do not consider the amount of the loss on debt extinguishment to be a representative component of the day-to-day operating performance of our business.
•   income tax expense may be useful for investors to consider because it generally represents the taxes which may be payable for the period and the change in deferred income taxes during the period and may reduce the amount of funds otherwise available for use in our business. however, we do not consider the amount of income tax expense to be a representative component of the day-to-day operating performance of our business.
set forth below are descriptions of additional financial items that have been excluded from ebitda to calculate adjusted ebitda and the material limitations associated with using this non-gaap financial measure as compared to net income:
•   stock-based compensation expense may be useful for investors to consider because it represents a portion of the compensation of our employees and executives. determining the fair value of the stock-based instruments involves a high degree of judgment and estimation and the expenses recorded may bear little resemblance to the actual value realized upon the future exercise or termination of the related stock-based awards. therefore, we believe it is useful to exclude stock-based compensation in order to better understand the long-term performance of our core business.
•   the amount of acquisition- and integration- related costs incurred may be useful for investors to consider because they generally represent professional service fees and direct expenses related to acquisitions. because we do not acquire businesses on a predictable cycle we do not consider the amount of acquisition- and integration- related costs to be a representative component of the day-to-day operating performance of our business.
•   the amount of settlement and impairment costs incurred outside of our ordinary course of business may be useful for investors to consider because they generally represent gains or losses from the settlement of litigation matters or impairments on acquired intangible assets. we do not believe these charges necessarily reflect the current and ongoing cash charges related to our operating cost structure.
•   the amount of restructuring costs incurred may be useful for investors to consider because they generally represent costs incurred in connection with a change in a contract or a change in the makeup of our properties or personnel. we do not consider the amount of restructuring related costs to be a representative component of the day-to-day operating performance of our business.
the financial items that have been excluded from our net income to calculate non-gaap net income and non-gaap net income per diluted share are amortization of acquired intangible assets and other related costs, stock-based compensation, acquisition- and integration- related costs, restructuring and related costs and settlement and impairment costs incurred outside our ordinary course of business. these items are discussed above with respect to the calculation of adjusted ebitda together with the material limitations associated with using this non-gaap financial measure as compared to net income. we subtract an assumed provision for income taxes to calculate non-gaap net income. in 2017 and 2016, we assumed a 38% tax rate, which approximated our historical long-term statutory corporate tax rate, excluding the impact of discrete items. in 2018 we assumed a 25% tax rate which reflects our full year 2018 statutory tax rate. the decrease in our tax rate in 2018 is mainly due to the tax act which reduced the u.s. federal corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21% effective january 1, 2018.
non-gaap net income per diluted share is a non-gaap financial measure that represents non-gaap net income divided by the number of diluted shares outstanding for the period used in the calculation of gaap net income per diluted share.
management compensates for the above-described limitations of using non-gaap measures by using a non-gaap measure only to supplement our gaap results and to provide additional information that is useful to understand the factors and trends affecting our business.

nm - not meaningful revenues. revenues increased to $1,192 million in 2018, from $965 million in 2017. the $227 million increase was primarily attributable to increased revenues of approximately $82 million or 18% from continued organic growth of costar suite, as well as, conversion of our loopnet customers to our costar platform as a result of integration of the loopnet and costar databases. information services revenue decreased $5 million or 7% primarily due to the continued wind down of loopnet information services, including premium searcher, resulting in a loss of $29 million of revenues, partially offset by a $22 million increase in revenues from the continued growth of our costar real estate manager offering. multifamily revenue increased $126 million or 45%, driven by incremental revenues related to the acquisition of forrent. commercial property and land revenue increased $24 million or 16%, due to growth in our loopnet online marketplace services of $12 million, as well as, growth in our land and businesses for sale services of $12 million.
gross profit. gross profit increased to $922 million in 2018, from $745 million in 2017. the gross margin percentage remained relatively consistent as a percentage of revenues at 77% for both 2018 and 2017. investment in research to further support our products and services led to an increase in cost of revenues of $50 million. the increase was primarily due to additional research personnel costs of $32 million, an increase of $7 million in direct costs partially due to the forrent and cozy acquisitions and our westside rentals services, an increase in software licensing expense of $3 million and $2 million in occupancy related costs in connection with our research office in richmond, virginia.
selling and marketing expenses. selling and marketing expenses increased to $360 million in 2018, from $318 million in 2017, and decreased as a percentage of revenues to 30%, compared to 33% in 2017. the increase in the amount of selling and marketing expenses was due to a $14 million increase in sales personnel costs, partially related to the acquisition of forrent, which included additional salaries and retention costs. in addition, marketing related expenses increased $21 million, primarily
due to increased search engine marketing costs due to the acquisition of forrent. sales conference and travel related costs also increased $4 million.
software development expenses. software development expenses increased to $101 million in 2018, from $89 million in 2017, and decreased as a percentage of revenues to 8% in 2018, compared to 9% in 2017. the increase in the amount of software development expense was primarily due to a $16 million increase in personnel costs, of which $6 million was due to the acquisition of forrent. these increases were partially offset by a $4 million decrease in professional services and recruiting costs in 2018.
general and administrative expenses. general and administrative expenses increased to $157 million in 2018, from $146 million in 2017, and decreased as a percentage of revenues to 13% in 2018, compared to 15% 2017. the increase in the amount of general and administrative expenses was primarily due to an increase in administrative personnel costs of $9 million to support the ongoing growth of the business and a $6 million increase in software licensing costs, partially offset by a $6 million decrease in professional services, primarily due to a reduction in legal costs of $9 million.
customer base amortization expense. customer base amortization expense increased to $31 million in 2018, from $18 million in 2017, and increased as a percentage of revenues to 3% in 2018, compared to 2% in 2017. the increase was primarily due to the forrent acquisition, partially offset by lower amortization of existing customer base intangible assets acquired in prior years due to applying an accelerated amortization methodology for a majority of those assets.
interest and other expense. interest and other expense decreased to $3 million in 2018, from $9 million in 2017. the decrease was primarily due to the repayment of outstanding debt in connection with entering into the amended and restated credit agreement (the ''2017 credit agreement'') in october 2017.
loss on extinguishment. the loss on extinguishment recognized in 2017 was due to entering into the 2017 credit agreement, which amended and restated in its entirety the existing credit agreement dated april 1, 2014, and resulted in a loss on debt extinguishment of approximately $4 million.
income tax expense. income tax expense increased to $46 million in 2018, from $42 million in 2017. the effective tax rate was 16% in 2018 compared to 26% in 2017. this decrease was primarily due to the tax act, which reduced the federal corporate income tax rate effective january 1, 2018, from 35% to 21% and excess tax benefits on share payments and state research and development tax credits.
comparison of business segment results for year ended december 31, 2018 and year ended december 31, 2017
we manage our business geographically in two operating segments, with the primary areas of measurement and decision-making being north america, which includes the u.s. and canada, and international, which includes the u.k., spain, germany and france. management relies on an internal management reporting process that provides revenue and operating segment net income before interest and other income (expense), loss on debt extinguishment, income taxes, depreciation and amortization ("ebitda"). management believes that operating segment ebitda is an appropriate measure for evaluating the operational performance of our operating segments. ebitda is used by management to internally measure operating and management performance and to evaluate the performance of the business. however, this measure should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for or superior to, income from operations or other measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with gaap.
segment revenues. north america revenues increased to $1,157 million for the year ended december 31, 2018, from $934 million for the year ended december 31, 2017. the increase in north america revenues was primarily due to a $126 million increase in multifamily revenues driven by incremental revenues related to the acquisition of forrent, continued organic growth in costar suite revenues of $79 million and an increase of $24 million in commercial property and land revenue due to growth in our loopnet online marketplace services of $12 million, as well as, growth in our land and businesses for sale services of $12 million. international revenues increased to $35 million for the year ended december 31, 2018, from $31 million for the year ended december 31, 2017. the increase in international revenues was primarily due to an increase in revenues from the further penetration of our subscription-based services, and to a lesser extent, a positive impact from foreign currency fluctuations in 2018.
segment ebitda. north america ebitda increased to $358 million for the year ended december 31, 2018, from $237 million for the year ended december 31, 2017. the increase in north america ebitda was due primarily to an increase in revenues, partially offset by increases in personnel related costs due to the forrent acquisition and ongoing support of the business.
international ebitda decreased to a loss of $7 million for the year ended december 31, 2018, from $1 million profit for the year ended december 31, 2017. the decrease in international ebitda was primarily due to the continued investment in our international research operations in the u.k., along with higher occupancy related costs, additional travel and professional services costs.

total operating expenses                                           571,011               518,911                  52,100                          10
nm - not meaningful revenues. revenues increased to $965 million in 2017, from $838 million in 2016. the $127 million increase was primarily attributable to increased revenues of approximately $55 million or 13% from continued organic growth in costar suite as well as a movement of our loopnet customers onto our costar platform as a result of the loopnet integration. information services decreased $5 million or 6% primarily due to continued wind down of loopnet information products including premium searcher partially offset by increases in our costar real estate manager offering. multifamily year over year increases of $55 million or 24% was primarily attributable to organic growth as well as some smaller increases for several acquisitions. commercial property and land revenue increased $22 million or 18% over 2016 primarily due to organic growth as well as an increase due to the landwatch acquisition.
gross profit. gross profit increased to $745 million in 2017, from $664 million in 2016. the gross margin percentage decreased to 77% in 2017, from 79% in 2016. revenue growth led to an increase in costs of revenues of $38 million for additional research personnel costs, $5 million in occupancy related costs from our new research office in richmond, partially offset by a decrease in the amortization of intangible assets of $4 million. gross margins are impacted by the amortization of certain intangible assets acquired through acquisitions.
selling and marketing expenses. selling and marketing expenses increased to $318 million in 2017, from $296 million in 2016, and decreased as a percentage of revenues to 33% from 35%. the increase in the amount of selling and marketing expenses was primarily due to a $25 million increase in sales personnel costs related to increased commission expense from higher sales in 2017, partially offset by a $2 million decrease in digital marketing costs.
software development expenses. software development expenses increased to $89 million in 2017, from $76 million in 2016, and remained relatively consistent as a percentage of revenues at 9% for both 2017 and 2016. the increase in the amount of software development expense was primarily due to a $14 million increase in personnel costs to support enhancements and upgrades to our services and integration of the backend systems of the loopnet and costar databases.
general and administrative expenses. general and administrative expenses increased 19% to $146 million in 2017, from $123 million in 2016, and remained relatively consistent as a percentage of revenues at 15% in 2017 and 2016. the increase in the amount of general and administrative expenses was primarily due to legal costs related to litigation of approximately $13 million, an increase in administrative personnel costs of $5 million to support the ongoing growth of the business, and a $3 million increase in charitable donations.
customer base amortization expense. customer base amortization expense decreased to approximately $18 million in 2017, from $23 million in 2016, and decreased as a percentage of revenues to 2% in 2017, compared to 3% in 2016. the decrease in the amount and percentage of customer base amortization expense was primarily due to the accelerated amortization of acquired customer bases in 2016 as compared to 2017.
interest and other income. interest and other income increased to approximately $4 million in 2017, compared to approximately $2 million in 2016. the increase was primarily due to increased short term investments on a larger cash balance in 2017 than in 2016 mainly due to net proceeds of $834 million from the equity offering in october 2017.
interest and other expense. interest and other expense remained relatively consistent at $9 million in 2017 compared to $10 million in 2016. the decrease was primarily due to the repayment of outstanding debt in october 2017 in connection with the 2017 credit agreement, partially offset by higher interest rates on outstanding debt in 2017 compared to 2016.
loss on extinguishment. the loss on extinguishment was due to the restatement and amendment of the 2014 credit agreement as the 2017 credit agreement, which resulted in a loss on debt extinguishment of approximately $4 million.
income tax expense. income tax expense decreased to $42 million in 2017 compared to $52 million in 2016. without the effect of discrete items, income tax expense would have increased by approximately $12 million. discrete items resulted in a reduction in tax expense of approximately $22 million including the revaluation of the deferred tax liability at the lower federal statutory tax rate resulting in a $7 million benefit. we also recognized approximately $8 million benefit in net research and development tax benefits related to the periods 2013-2017. finally, we recognized $7 million benefit from the impact of the accounting rule change in asu 2016-09 that provided for recognizing excess tax benefits in income tax expense as compared to additional paid in capital, which was the treatment prior to 2017.
comparison of business segment results for year ended december 31, 2017 and year ended december 31, 2016
we manage our business geographically in two operating segments, with the primary areas of measurement and decision-making being north america, which includes the u.s. and canada, and international, which includes the u.k., spain, germany and france. management relies on an internal management reporting process that provides revenue and operating segment ebitda. management believes that operating segment ebitda is an appropriate measure for evaluating the operational performance of our operating segments. ebitda is used by management to internally measure operating and management performance and to evaluate the performance of the business. however, this measure should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for or superior to, income from operations or other measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with gaap.
segment revenues. north america revenues increased to $934 million for the year ended december 31, 2017, compared to $809 million for the year ended december 31, 2016. this increase in north america revenues was primarily due to increased revenues of approximately $55 million from our multifamily products, and an increase of $55 million in costar suite from the continued growth of our subscription-based services due to successful cross-selling of our services to our customers in existing markets, combined with continued high renewal rates. international revenues increased to $31 million for the year ended december 31, 2017, compared to $28 million for the year ended december 31, 2016. this increase was primarily due to continued growth of our subscription-based information services resulting from sales of costar suite.
segment ebitda. north america ebitda increased to $237 million for the year ended december 31, 2017, compared to $211 million for the year ended december 31, 2016. the increase in north america ebitda was due primarily to an increase in revenues of $125 million primarily offset by increased personnel costs from additional investments in our research operations and the opening of our richmond research headquarters, as well as increased legal costs. international ebitda decreased to $1 million for the year ended december 31, 2017, compared to $4 million for the year ended december 31, 2016. this decrease in international
ebitda was primarily due to an increase in personnel costs from the relocation of our european research headquarters from glasgow, scotland to london, england and as a result of increased headcount from investments in our international research operations in madrid, spain and the u.k.
consolidated quarterly results of operations the following tables present our unaudited consolidated results of operations on a quarterly basis for the indicated periods (in thousands, except per share amounts, and as a percentage of total revenues). these tables should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes included in this annual report on form 10-k. the quarterly results of historical periods are not necessarily indicative of quarterly results for any future period.
cost of revenues                      62,477                67,136                72,072                68,248                 51,346                 55,273                 55,483                58,301

liquidity and capital resources our principal sources of liquidity are cash and cash equivalents, cash from operations and the availability of funds from our revolving credit facility. total cash and cash equivalents decreased to $1.1 billion at december 31, 2018 compared to cash and cash equivalents of $1.2 billion at december 31, 2017. the decrease in cash and cash equivalents for the year ended december 31, 2018 was primarily due to the cash paid, net of cash acquired in connection with the acquisitions of forrent, cozy and realla of an aggregate of $418 million, as well as cash paid for purchases of property and equipment of $30 million and repurchases of restricted stock to satisfy employee tax withholding obligations upon vesting of restricted stock awards valued at approximately $24 million. these decreases were partially offset by proceeds from the exercise of employee stock options of approximately $27 million and cash generated from operations of $335 million.
net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended december 31, 2018 was $335 million compared to $235 million for the year ended december 31, 2017 and $201 million for the year ended december 31, 2016. the $100 million and $34 million
increases from december 31, 2017 to december 31, 2018 and from december 31, 2016 to december 31, 2017, respectively, are primarily due to higher income from operations in both periods. income from operations was partially offset by fluctuations in working capital.
net cash used in investing activities for the year ended december 31, 2018 was $448 million compared to $72 million for the year ended december 31, 2017. the $376 million increase in investing activities in 2018 compared to 2017 was primarily due to approximately $418 million cash paid, net of cash acquired, to acquire forrent, cozy and realla during 2018, compared to $48 million cash paid to acquire westside rentals, landwatch and the screening pros during 2017. during 2018, we incurred capital expenditures of approximately $30 million compared to approximately $24 million during 2017.
net cash used in investing activities for the year ended december 31, 2017 was $72 million compared to $23 million for the year ended december 31, 2016. the $49 million increase in investing activities in 2017 compared to 2016 was primarily due to $48 million cash paid to acquire westside rentals, landwatch and the screening pros during 2017. during 2017, we incurred capital expenditures of approximately $24 million primarily related to computer equipment and leasehold improvements for build out of sales office space.
net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended december 31, 2018 was $3 million compared to net cash provided by financing activities of $480 million for the year ended december 31, 2017 and $31 million in december 31, 2016. this $477 million decrease in financing activities in 2018 compared to 2017 and $449 million increase in financing activities in 2017 compared to 2016 was primarily due to $834 million in net proceeds from our equity offering, partially offset by an increase in debt repayments of $325 million in 2017.
our future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including, among others, our operating results, expansion and integration efforts, and our level of acquisition activity or other strategic transactions. to date, we have grown in part by acquiring other companies, and we expect to continue to make acquisitions. any future acquisitions may vary in size and could be material to our current operations. we may use cash, stock, debt or other means of funding to make any future acquisitions.
based on current plans, we believe that our available cash combined with positive cash flow provided by operating activities should be sufficient to fund our operations for at least the next 12 months.
contractual obligations. the following table summarizes our principal contractual obligations at december 31, 2018 and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods (in thousands):
total                2019         2020-2021            2022-2023   thereafter operating leases                                  $169,078             $30,485         $56,676              $50,149         $31,768
(1)amounts do not include (i) contracts with terms of twelve months or less, (ii) multi-year contracts that may be terminated by a third-party or us, or (iii) employment agreements. amounts do not include income taxes payable of $17 million due to uncertainty regarding the timing of future cash payments.
critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with u.s. generally accepted accounting principles ("gaap") requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and revenues and expenses during the period reported. the following accounting policies involve a "critical accounting estimate" because they are particularly dependent on estimates and assumptions made by management about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the accounting estimates are made. in addition, while we have used our best estimates based on facts and circumstances available to us at the time, different acceptable assumptions would yield different results. changes in the accounting estimates are reasonably likely to occur from period to period, which may have a material impact on the presentation of our financial condition and results of operations. we review these estimates and assumptions periodically and reflect the effects of revisions in the period that they are determined to be necessary. we consider policies relating to the following matters to be critical accounting policies:
•   revenue recognition
•   business combinations with respect to our accounting policy for long-lived assets, intangible assets and goodwill, we further supplement in note 2 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10-k with the following:
we assess the impairment of long-lived assets, identifiable intangibles and goodwill whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. judgments made by management relate to the expected useful lives of long-lived assets and our ability to recover the carrying value of such assets. the accuracy of these judgments may be adversely affected by several factors, including the factors listed below:
•   significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results;
•   significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business;
•   significant negative industry or economic trends; or
•   significant decline in our market capitalization relative to net book value for a sustained period.
when we determine that the carrying value of long-lived and identifiable intangible assets may not be recovered based upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators, we test for impairment.
goodwill and identifiable intangible assets that are not subject to amortization are tested annually for impairment by each reporting unit on october 1 of each year and are also tested for impairment more frequently based upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators.
goodwill represents the excess of costs over the fair value of assets of acquired businesses. goodwill is not amortized, but instead tested for impairment at least annually by each reporting unit. the company may first assess qualitative factors to evaluate whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount or elect to bypass such assessment. if it is determined that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value, or the company elects to bypass such assessment, the company then determines the fair value of each reporting unit. we estimate the fair value of each reporting unit based on a projected discounted cash flow model that includes significant assumptions and estimates including our discount rate, growth rate and future financial performance. assumptions about the discount rate are based on a weighted average cost of capital for comparable companies. assumptions about the growth rate and future financial performance of a reporting unit are based on our forecasts, business plans, economic projections and anticipated future cash flows. these assumptions are subject to change from period to period and could be adversely impacted by the uncertainty surrounding global market conditions, commercial real estate conditions and the competitive environment in which we operate. changes in these or other factors could negatively affect our reporting units' fair value and potentially result in impairment charges. such impairment charges could have an adverse effect on our results of operations.
the fair value of each reporting unit is compared to the carrying amount of the reporting unit. if the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds the fair value, then an impairment loss is recognized for the difference. we estimate the fair value of our reporting units based on a projected discounted cash flow method using a discount rate determined by our management to be commensurate with the risk in our current business model. as of october 1, 2017, the date of our most recent impairment analysis, the estimated fair value of each of our reporting units substantially exceeded the carrying value of our reporting units. there have been no events or changes in circumstances as a result of our qualitative impairment analysis on october 1, 2018, that would indicate that the carrying value of each reporting unit may not be recoverable.

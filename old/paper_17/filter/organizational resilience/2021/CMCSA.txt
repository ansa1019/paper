item 1a: risk factors risks related to our business, industry and operations the covid-19 pandemic has had, and may continue to have, a material adverse effect on our businesses and results of operations.
the impacts of covid-19 and measures to prevent its spread across the globe have impacted our businesses in a number of ways. in particular, covid-19 has had material negative impacts on nbcuniversal and sky results of operations. for example, as a result of covid-19, we have at times temporarily closed our theme parks or operated them with capacity restrictions. the creation and availability of our film and television programming globally also have been disrupted as a result of covid-19, such as postponements or cancellations of sporting events, theatrical closures and suspensions of entertainment content production.
the impact of covid-19 on our businesses also generally depends on the extent of restrictive governmental measures taken that affect day-to-day life, travel protocols and the length of time that such measures remain in place, global economic conditions, current and new variants and vaccination rates and efficacy. it is difficult to predict the extent and duration and the degree to which our results of operations will continue to be affected.
covid-19 may also have the effect of heightening many of the other risks set forth below.
our businesses operate in highly competitive and dynamic industries, and our businesses and results of operations could be adversely affected if we do not compete effectively.
all of our businesses operate in intensely competitive, consumer-driven, rapidly changing environments and compete with a growing number of companies that provide a broad range of communications products and services as well as entertainment, sports, news and information content to consumers. there can be no assurance that we will be able to compete effectively against our competitors or that competition will not have an adverse effect on our businesses.
comcast 2021 annual report on form 10-k below is a summary of the most significant sources of competition; for a more detailed description of the competition facing our businesses, see item 1: business and refer to the "competition" discussion within that section.
•cable communications' and sky's broadband services compete primarily against wireline telecommunications companies, including many that are increasing deployment of fiber-based networks, wireless telecommunications companies offering internet services (such as 4g and 5g wireless broadband services), certain electric cooperatives and municipalities in the united states that own and operate their own broadband networks and dbs and newer satellite broadband providers. broadband-deployment funding initiatives at the federal and state level, including as part of covid-19 relief efforts as well as federal infrastructure legislation enacted in 2021, may result in other service providers deploying new subsidized internet access networks within our footprint. competition for cable communications' video services consists primarily of dtc streaming and other ott service providers, dbs providers and telecommunications companies with fiber-based networks. sky faces competition for its video services from cable and telecommunications providers in its european markets. our voice and wireless services primarily compete with wireless and wireline telecommunications providers. many of our competitors offer customers bundled products and services with favorable pricing, which has increased competition.
•nbcuniversal and sky face substantial and increasing competition from providers of similar types of entertainment, sports, news and information content, as well as from other forms of entertainment and recreational activities. nbcuniversal and sky must compete to obtain talent, popular content (including sports programming) and other resources required to successfully operate their businesses. this competition has intensified as dtc streaming and other ott service providers seek to develop high-quality programming and acquire live sports programming to attract viewers.
consolidation of, or cooperation between, our competitors, including suppliers and distributors of content, may increase competition in all of these areas, as may the emergence of additional competitors with significant resources, greater efficiencies of scale, fewer regulatory burdens and more competitive pricing and packaging, who are competing with our businesses in all forms of content distribution and production. for example, such consolidation or cooperation may allow competitors to offer free or lower cost streaming services, potentially on an exclusive basis, through unlimited data-usage plans for internet or wireless phone services.
the ability of our businesses to compete effectively also depends on our perceived image and reputation among our various constituencies, including our customers, consumers, advertisers, business partners, employees, investors and government authorities. in addition, our ability to compete will be negatively affected if we do not provide our customers with a satisfactory customer experience.
changes in consumer behavior continue to adversely affect our businesses and challenge existing business models.
distribution platforms for viewing and purchasing content over the internet have been, and will likely continue to be, developed that further increase the number of competitors that all our businesses face and challenge existing business models. as consumers increasingly turn to dtc streaming and other ott services, the number of cable communications' video customers and amount of subscriber fees paid to nbcuniversal's television networks decrease, even as cable communications' broadband services have become more important to consumers. dtc streaming and other ott services have driven, and will continue to drive, changes in consumer behavior as consumers seek more control over when, where and how they consume content and access communications services, and how much they pay for such content.
for example, cable communications continues to experience net video customer losses. in europe, more of sky's new video customers have recently subscribed, and may continue to subscribe, to now, sky's dtc streaming service, instead of its traditional dth video service. although we have attempted to adapt our video service offerings and enhance our broadband services for changing consumer behaviors, for example, by deploying the x1 and sky q platforms, flex, developing new smart televisions using our global technology platform at sky and cable communications, and by offering peacock, the continuing trend of content owners delivering their content directly to consumers rather than through, or in addition to, traditional video distribution channels continues to disrupt traditional distribution business models.
the increase in dtc streaming and other ott service providers also has significantly increased the number of entertainment choices available to consumers, which has intensified audience fragmentation and disaggregated the way that content traditionally has been distributed and viewed by consumers. the use of dtc streaming and other ott services reduce traditional television viewership, and coupled with time-shifting technologies, such as dvr and on demand services, have caused and likely will continue to cause audience ratings declines for our television programming channels. in addition, as more programming providers offer their content directly to consumers through their own apps or platforms, they may reduce the quantity and quality of the programming they license to nbcuniversal or sky's television channels or to peacock.
comcast 2021 annual report on form 10-k our failure to effectively anticipate or adapt to emerging competitors or changes in consumer behavior, including among younger consumers, and shifting business models could have an adverse effect on our competitive position, businesses and results of operations.
a decline in advertisers' expenditures or changes in advertising markets could negatively impact our businesses.
cable communications, nbcuniversal and sky compete for the sale of advertising time with digital media distributors, websites and search engines, other television networks and stations, as well as with all other advertising platforms, such as radio and print. we derive substantial revenue from the sale of advertising, and a decline in expenditures by advertisers, including through traditional linear television distribution models, could negatively impact our results of operations. declines can be caused by the economic prospects of specific advertisers or industries, increased competition for the leisure time of viewers, such as from social media and video games, audience fragmentation, increased viewing of content through dtc streaming and other ott service providers, regulatory intervention regarding where and when advertising may be placed, or economic conditions generally. in addition, advertisers have shifted a portion of their total expenditures to digital media, which can deliver targeted advertising. their willingness to purchase advertising from us may be adversely affected by lower audience ratings and reduced viewership, which many of nbcuniversal's networks and some of sky's television channels have experienced and likely will continue to experience, or from the level of popularity or perceived acceptance of peacock. advertising sales and rates also are dependent on the methodology used for audience measurement and could be negatively affected if methodologies do not accurately reflect actual viewership levels.
programming expenses for our video services are increasing, which could adversely affect cable communications' video businesses.
we expect programming expenses for our video services to continue to be the largest single expense item for our cable communications segment and to continue to increase on a per subscriber basis. part of cable communications' programming expenses include payments to certain local broadcast television stations in exchange for their required consent for the retransmission of broadcast network programming to video services customers; we expect to continue to be subject to increasing demands for payment and other concessions from local broadcast television stations. these market factors may be exacerbated by increased consolidation in the media industry, which may further increase our programming expenses. if we are unable to raise our customers' rates or otherwise offset programming cost increases through the sale of additional services, cost management or other initiatives, the increasing cost of programming could have an adverse effect on our cable communications segment's results of operations.
moreover, as our contracts with content providers expire, there can be no assurance that they will be renewed on acceptable terms, or at all, in which case we may be unable to provide such content as part of cable communications' video services, and our businesses and results of operations could be adversely affected.
nbcuniversal's and sky's success depends on consumer acceptance of their content, and their businesses may be adversely affected if their content fails to achieve sufficient consumer acceptance or the costs to create or acquire content increase.
nbcuniversal and sky create and acquire media and entertainment content, the success of which depends substantially on consumer tastes and preferences that often change in unpredictable ways. the success of these businesses depends on our ability to consistently create, acquire, market and distribute television programming, filmed entertainment, theme park attractions and other content that meet the changing preferences of the broad domestic and international consumer markets. we have invested, and will continue to invest, substantial amounts in our content, including in the production of original content for nbcuniversal, including peacock, and sky, in our films and for new theme parks and theme park attractions, before learning the extent to which they will earn consumer acceptance. in addition, there can be no assurance that peacock will continue to grow or sustain its revenue or user base or successfully compete as a standalone dtc streaming service.
nbcuniversal and sky also obtain a significant portion of their content from third parties, such as movie studios, television production companies, sports organizations and other suppliers, sometimes on an exclusive basis. competition for popular content, particularly for sports programming, is intense, and at times, we may increase the price we are willing to pay or be outbid by our competitors for popular content. we also may be unable to license popular third-party content for nbcuniversal's and sky's television programming channels if media companies determine that licensing the content to us is not in their strategic best interests. for example, content creators have launched and may continue to launch their own dtc streaming or other ott services, forgoing license fees from us to provide their content directly to consumers, or they may license their content to our competitors on an exclusive basis.
entering into or renewing contracts for such programming rights or acquiring additional rights has in the past and in the future may result in significantly increased costs. particularly with respect to long-term contracts for sports programming rights for nbcuniversal and sky, our results of operations and cash flows over the term of a contract depend on a number of factors, comcast 2021 annual report on form 10-k including the strength of the advertising market, audience size, the timing and amount of rights payments, and the ability to secure distribution from, impose surcharges on, or obtain carriage on multichannel video providers. there can be no assurance that revenue from these contracts will exceed our costs for the rights, as well as the other costs of producing and distributing the programming. if our content does not achieve sufficient consumer acceptance, or if we cannot obtain or retain rights to popular content on acceptable terms, or at all, nbcuniversal's and sky's businesses may be adversely affected.
the loss of programming distribution and licensing agreements, or the renewal of these agreements on less favorable terms, could adversely affect our businesses.
nbcuniversal's cable television networks depend on their ability to secure and maintain distribution agreements with traditional and virtual multichannel video providers. the number of subscribers to nbcuniversal's cable television networks has been, and likely will continue to be, reduced as a result of fewer subscribers to multichannel video providers. in addition, nbcuniversal's broadcast television networks depend on their ability to secure and maintain network affiliation agreements with third-party local broadcast television stations in the markets where we do not own the affiliated local broadcast television station. our owned local broadcast television stations must elect, with respect to retransmission by certain multichannel video providers, either "must-carry" status, in which we require the provider to carry the station without generating any compensation to us, or "retransmission consent," in which we give up our right to mandatory carriage and instead seek to negotiate the terms and conditions of carriage, including the amount of compensation, if any, paid to us by such provider. sky also depends on its ability to secure and maintain wholesale distribution agreements for its television channels with multichannel video providers.
increasingly, nbcuniversal and sky license their prior season and library content on third-party distribution platforms, including to dtc streaming and other ott service providers. if this programming does not attract sufficient viewers, these providers may not distribute nbcuniversal's or sky's programming. in addition, at times we have opted to, and expect that we may in the future, not license certain popular owned content to third parties so we may offer it exclusively through peacock, which would result in foregone licensing revenue.
for all of these types of arrangements, nbcuniversal's and sky's ability to renew agreements on favorable terms may be affected by industry consolidation and new participants entering the market for distribution of content on digital platforms. there can be no assurance that any of these agreements will be entered into or renewed in the future on acceptable terms. the inability to enter into or renew these agreements could reduce our revenues and the reach of our programming, which could adversely affect nbcuniversal's and sky's businesses.
less favorable european telecommunications access regulations, the loss of sky's transmission access agreements with satellite or telecommunications providers or the renewal of these agreements on less favorable terms could adversely affect sky's businesses.
sky relies on various third-party telecommunications providers to deliver its video, broadband, voice and wireless phone services to its customers. for example, sky relies on satellite transponder capacity leased from third parties to provide most of its video services. in addition, under the current regulatory regimes in the united kingdom, ireland and italy, sky accesses networks owned by third-party telecommunications providers to offer its broadband and phone services, in many cases, on regulated terms, including price. if there is a change in regulation in these markets, the regulated terms could become less favorable. moreover, while sky receives wholesale fiber access on fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory terms, specific pricing terms are not regulated. as a result, if sky is only able to enter into or renew its transmission agreements with satellite or telecommunications operators on less favorable terms, it would adversely affect sky's ability to compete, and if it is ultimately unable to do so on commercially viable terms or if these operators were to terminate their agreements, sky may be unable to deliver certain of its services to customers in one or more of the markets in which it operates, which would adversely affect sky's businesses and results of operations.
comcast 2021 annual report on form 10-k our businesses depend on using and protecting certain intellectual property rights and on not infringing the intellectual property rights of others.
we rely on our intellectual property, such as patents, copyrights, trademarks and trade secrets, as well as licenses and other agreements with our vendors and other third parties, to use various technologies, conduct our business operations and sell our products and services. legal challenges to our intellectual property rights and claims of intellectual property infringement by third parties could require that we enter into royalty or licensing agreements on unfavorable terms, incur substantial monetary liability, or be enjoined preliminarily or permanently from further use of the intellectual property in question, from importing into the united states or other jurisdictions in which we operate hardware or software that uses such intellectual property or from the continuation of our businesses as currently conducted. we may need to change our business practices if any of these events occur, which may limit our ability to compete effectively and could have an adverse effect on our results of operations. even if we believe any such challenges or claims are without merit, they can be time-consuming, costly to defend and may divert management's attention and resources away from our businesses. moreover, if we are unable to obtain or continue to obtain licenses from our vendors and other third parties on reasonable terms, our businesses could be adversely affected.
in addition, intellectual property constitutes a significant part of the value of nbcuniversal's and sky's businesses, and their success is highly dependent on protecting the intellectual property rights of the content they create or acquire against third-party misappropriation, reproduction or infringement. the unauthorized reproduction, distribution or display of copyrighted material negatively affects our ability to generate revenue from the legitimate sale of our content, as well as from the sale of advertising in connection with our content, and increases our costs due to our active enforcement of our intellectual property rights.
piracy and other unauthorized uses of content are made easier, and the enforcement of intellectual property rights more challenging, by technological advances that allow the conversion of programming, films and other content into digital formats, which facilitates the creation, transmission and sharing of high-quality unauthorized copies. in particular, piracy of programming and films through unauthorized distribution platforms continues to present challenges for nbcuniversal's businesses, and certain entities may stream our broadcast television content illegally online without our consent and without paying us any compensation. it also presents similar challenges for sky's businesses, including as a result of illegal retransmission of sports events. while piracy is a challenge in the united states, it is particularly prevalent in many parts of the world that lack developed copyright laws, effective enforcement of copyright laws and technical protective measures like those in effect in the united states. if any u.s. or international laws intended to combat piracy and protect intellectual property rights are repealed or weakened or are not adequately enforced, or if the legal system fails to adapt to new technologies that facilitate piracy, we may be unable to effectively protect our rights, the value of our intellectual property may be negatively impacted and our costs of enforcing our rights may increase.
we may be unable to obtain necessary hardware, software and operational support.
we depend on third-party vendors to supply us with a significant amount of the hardware, software and operational support necessary to provide certain of our products and services. some of these vendors represent our primary source of supply or grant us the right to incorporate their intellectual property into some of our hardware and software products. while we monitor the operations and financial condition of key vendors in an attempt to detect any potential difficulties, there can be no assurance that we would timely identify any operating or financial difficulties associated with these vendors or that we could effectively mitigate our risks with respect to any such difficulties. for example, global supply chains in general have been, and may continue to be, disrupted as a result of covid-19. if any of these vendors experience operating or financial difficulties or any other supply chain compliance-related issues, if our demand exceeds their capacity or if they breach or terminate their agreements with us or are otherwise unable to meet our specifications or provide the equipment, products or services we need in a timely manner (or at all), or at reasonable prices, our ability to provide some products or services may be adversely affected and we may incur additional costs.
our businesses depend on keeping pace with technological developments.
our success is, to a large extent, dependent on our ability to acquire, develop, adopt and leverage new and existing technologies, and our competitors' use of certain types of technology and equipment may provide them with a competitive advantage. new technologies can materially impact our businesses in a number of ways, including affecting the demand for our products, the distribution methods of our products and content to our customers, the ways in which our customers can purchase and view our content and the growth of distribution platforms available to advertisers. for example, current and new wireless internet technologies such as 4g and 5g wireless broadband services continue to evolve rapidly and may allow for greater speed and reliability for those services as compared with prior technologies. in addition, some companies and u.s. municipalities are building advanced fiber-based networks that provide very fast internet access speeds. we expect advances in communications technology to continue to occur in the future. if we choose technology or equipment that is not as effective or attractive to consumers as that employed by our competitors, if we fail to employ technologies desired by consumers before our competitors do so, or if we fail to execute effectively on our technology initiatives, our businesses and results of operations comcast 2021 annual report on form 10-k could be adversely affected. we also will continue to incur additional costs as we execute our technology initiatives, such as the deployment of flex and sky q set-top boxes, wireless gateways, developing smart televisions using our technology platform, and the operation of peacock. there can be no assurance that we can execute on these and other initiatives in a manner sufficient to grow or maintain our revenue or to successfully compete in the future. we also may generate less revenue or incur increased costs if changes in our competitors' product offerings require that we offer certain services or enhancements at a lower or no cost to our customers or that we increase our research and development expenditures.
a cyber attack, information or security breach, or technology disruption or failure may negatively impact our ability to conduct our business or result in the misuse of confidential information, all of which could adversely affect our business, reputation and results of operations.
network and information systems and other technologies, including those that are related to our network management, customer service operations and programming delivery and are embedded in our products and services, are critical to our business activities. in the ordinary course of our business, there are constant attempts by third parties to cause systems-related events and security incidents and to identify and exploit vulnerabilities in security architecture and system design. these incidents include computer hackings, cyber attacks, computer viruses, worms or other destructive or disruptive software, denial of service attacks, phishing attacks, malicious social engineering, and other malicious activities. incidents also may be caused inadvertently by us or our third-party vendors, such as process breakdowns and vulnerabilities in security architecture or system design.
cyber threats and attacks are constantly evolving and are growing in sophistication and frequency, which increases the difficulty of detecting and successfully defending against them. some cyber attacks have had, and in the future can have, cascading impacts that unfold with increasing speed across networks, information systems and other technologies across the world and create latent vulnerabilities in our and third-party vendors' systems and other technologies. moreover, as we also obtain certain confidential, proprietary and personal information about our customers, personnel and vendors, and in some cases provide this information to third party vendors who agree to protect it, we face the risk that this information may become compromised through a cyber attack or data breach, misappropriation, misuse, leakage, falsification or accidental release or loss of information. due to the nature of our businesses, we may be at a disproportionately heightened risk of these types of incidents occurring because we maintain certain information necessary to conduct our business in digital form. we also incorporate third-party software (including extensive open-source software), applications, and data hosting and cloud-based services into many aspects of our products, services and operations, all of which expose us to cyber attacks on such third-party suppliers and service providers.
while we develop and maintain systems, and operate extensive programs that seek to prevent security incidents from occurring, these efforts are costly and must be constantly monitored and updated in the face of sophisticated and rapidly evolving attempts to overcome our security measures and protections. the occurrence of both intentional and unintentional incidents have in the past, and could in the future, cause a variety of potential adverse business impacts. these include degradation or disruption of our network, products and services, excessive call volume to call centers, theft or misuse of our intellectual property or other assets, disruption of the security of our internal systems, products, services or satellite transmission signals, power outages, and the compromise of confidential or technical business information or damage to our or our customers' or vendors' data, equipment and reputation. moreover, the amount and scope of insurance we maintain against losses resulting from any of the foregoing events likely would not be sufficient to fully cover our losses or otherwise adequately compensate us for disruptions to our business that may result. in addition, any such events could lead to litigation or cause regulators in the united states and internationally to impose significant fines or other remedial measures, including with respect to relevant customer privacy rules, or otherwise have an adverse effect on our company. despite our efforts, we expect that we will continue to experience such incidents in the future, and there can be no assurance that any such incident will not have an adverse effect on our business, reputation or results of operations.
weak economic conditions may have a negative impact on our businesses.
a substantial portion of our revenue comes from customers whose spending patterns may be affected by prevailing economic conditions. weak economic conditions in the united states or globally could adversely affect demand for any of our products and services and have a negative impact on our results of operations. for example, weak economic conditions will likely impact our customers' discretionary spending and as a result, they may reduce the level of services to which they subscribe or may discontinue subscribing to one or more of cable communications' or sky's services altogether. this risk may be increased by the expanded availability of free or lower cost competitive services, such as certain dtc streaming and other ott services, or substitute services for broadband and voice services, such as wireless and public wi-fi networks. weak economic conditions also negatively impact our advertising revenue, the performance of our films and home entertainment releases, and attendance and spending in our theme parks. in particular, the success of our theme parks and theatrical releases largely depends on consumer demand for out-of-home entertainment experiences, which may be limited by weakened economic conditions (as well as natural disasters, infectious disease outbreaks (such as covid-19), terrorist attacks or other similar events).
comcast 2021 annual report on form 10-k weak economic conditions and disruptions in the global financial markets may impact our ability to obtain financing or to refinance existing debt on acceptable terms, if at all, could increase the cost of our borrowings and may increase our exposure to currency fluctuations in countries where we operate. further, inflationary pressures in the united states and globally may also have negative impacts on our cost structure and pricing models and may impact the ability of third parties (including advertisers, customers, suppliers, wholesale distributors, retailers and content creators, among others) to satisfy their obligations to us.
acquisitions and other strategic initiatives present many risks, and we may not realize the financial and strategic goals that we had contemplated.
from time to time, we make acquisitions and investments and may pursue other strategic initiatives, such as peacock. in connection with such acquisitions and strategic initiatives, we may incur significant or unanticipated expenses, fail to realize anticipated benefits and synergies, have difficulty incorporating an acquired or new line of business, disrupt relationships with current and new employees, customers and vendors, incur significant debt, divert the attention of management from our current operations, or have to delay or not proceed with announced transactions or initiatives. additionally, federal regulatory agencies such as the fcc or doj or international regulators may impose restrictions on the operation of our businesses as a result of our seeking regulatory approvals for any significant acquisitions and strategic initiatives or may dissuade us from pursuing certain transactions. the occurrence of any of these events could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations.
we face risks relating to doing business internationally that could adversely affect our businesses.
we operate our businesses worldwide. there are risks inherent in doing business internationally, including global financial market turmoil; economic volatility and global economic slowdown; currency exchange rate fluctuations and inflationary pressures; political risks; the requirements of local laws and customs relating to the publication and distribution of content and the display and sale of advertising; import or export restrictions, tariffs, sanctions and trade regulations; difficulties in developing, staffing and managing foreign operations; issues related to occupational safety and adherence to diverse local labor laws and regulations; and potentially adverse tax developments. additionally, although we employ foreign currency derivative instruments to hedge certain exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risks, including the british pound, euro and japanese yen, the use of such derivative instruments may not be sufficient to mitigate exchange rate fluctuations. sky's businesses in particular are also subject to risks relating to uncertainties and effects of the united kingdom's recent withdrawal from the european union (referred to as "brexit"), including financial, legal, tax and trade implications. in addition, doing business internationally subjects us to risks relating to political or social unrest, as well as corruption and government regulation, including u.s. laws such as the foreign corrupt practices act and the u.k. bribery act, that impose stringent requirements on how we conduct our foreign operations. moreover, foreign enforcement of laws and contractual rights in certain countries where we do business can be inconsistent and unpredictable, which may affect our ability to enforce our rights or make investments that we believe otherwise make strategic sense. if any of these events occur or our conduct does not comply with such laws and regulations, our businesses may be adversely affected.
natural disasters, severe weather and other uncontrollable events could adversely affect our business, reputation and results of operations.
our services, products and properties are vulnerable to damage from the occurrence of certain events, including natural disasters, severe weather events such as hurricanes and wild fires, and a range of other unforeseeable events such as infectious disease outbreaks, terrorist attacks or other similar events. such events have in the past caused, and could in the future cause, a variety of adverse business impacts including degradation or disruption of our network, products and services, excessive call volume to call centers, a reduction in demand for our products, services and theme parks, disruption of our internal systems, products, services or satellite transmission signals, power outages, and damage to our or our customers' or vendors' equipment and properties. these events also may result in lost revenue and large expenditures to repair or replace damaged properties, products and services and could lead to litigation and fines, including if we inadvertently contributed to damages suffered by others. the amount and scope of insurance we maintain against losses resulting from these types of events likely would not be sufficient to fully cover our losses or otherwise adequately compensate us for disruptions to our business that may result. we expect that we will continue to experience some or all of these events in the future, and there can be no assurance that any such event will not have an adverse effect on our business, reputation or results of operations.
the loss of key management personnel or popular on-air and creative talent could have an adverse effect on our businesses.
we rely on certain key management personnel in the operation of our businesses. while we maintain long-term and emergency transition plans for key management personnel and believe we could either identify internal candidates or attract outside comcast 2021 annual report on form 10-k candidates to fill any vacancy created by the loss of any key management personnel, the loss of one or more of our key management personnel could have a negative impact on our businesses.
in addition, nbcuniversal and sky depend on the abilities and expertise of on-air and creative talent. if we fail to attract or retain on-air or creative talent, if the costs to attract or retain such talent increase materially, or if these individuals cause negative publicity or lose their current appeal, our businesses could be adversely affected.
risks related to legal, regulatory and governance matters we are subject to regulation by federal, state, local and foreign authorities, which impose additional costs and restrictions on our businesses.
while all of our businesses are subject to various federal, state and local laws and regulations, compliance with certain laws and regulations is most material with respect to our cable communications and broadcast television businesses in the united states. in addition, our international businesses are subject to various laws and regulations in the jurisdiction of the foreign regulatory authorities where they operate.
legislators and regulators at all levels of government frequently consider changing, and sometimes do change, existing statutes, rules or regulations, or interpretations of existing statutes, rules or regulations, or prescribe new ones, any of which may significantly affect our businesses and ability to effectively compete. these legislators and regulators have been active in considering legislation and rulemakings, at times looking to adopt regulatory approaches from different countries that may be more burdensome, and they, along with some state attorneys general and foreign governmental authorities, have also been active in conducting inquiries and reviews regarding our services. state legislative and regulatory initiatives can create a patchwork of different and/or conflicting state requirements, such as with respect to privacy and open internet/net neutrality regulations, that can affect our business operations and further constrain our ability to compete.
legislative and regulatory activity is increasing under the biden administration, particularly with respect to broadband networks. for example, congress has approved tens of billions of dollars in new funding for broadband deployment and adoption initiatives, and may consider other proposals that address communications issues, including whether it should rewrite the entire communications act to account for changes in the communications marketplace and whether it should enact new, permanent open internet/net neutrality requirements. federal agencies likewise may consider adopting new regulations for communications services, including broadband. states and localities are also increasingly proposing new regulations impacting communications services, including broader regulation of broadband networks. any of these regulations could significantly affect our business and compliance costs. in addition, united states and foreign regulators and courts could adopt new interpretations of existing competition laws or enact new competition laws or regulatory tools that could negatively impact our businesses. any future legislative, judicial, regulatory or administrative actions may increase our costs or impose additional restrictions on our businesses, some of which may be significant. we are unable to predict the outcome or effects of any of these potential actions or any other legislative or regulatory proposals on our businesses.
failure to comply with the laws and regulations applicable to our businesses could result in administrative enforcement actions, fines, and civil and criminal liability. any changes to the legal and regulatory framework applicable to any of our services or businesses could have an adverse impact on our businesses and results of operations. for a more extensive discussion of the significant risks associated with the regulation of our businesses, see item 1: business and refer to the "legislation and regulation" discussion within that section.
unfavorable litigation or governmental investigation results could require us to pay significant amounts or lead to onerous operating procedures.
we are subject from time to time to a number of lawsuits both in the united states and in foreign countries, including claims relating to competition, intellectual property rights (including patents), employment and labor matters, personal injury and property damage, free speech, customer privacy, regulatory requirements, advertising, marketing and selling practices, and credit and collection issues. greater constraints on the use of arbitration to resolve certain of these disputes could adversely affect our business. we also spend substantial resources complying with various regulatory and government standards, including any related investigations and litigation. we may incur significant expenses defending any such suit or government charge and may be required to pay amounts or otherwise change our operations in ways that could adversely impact our businesses, results of operations or financial condition.
labor disputes, whether involving employees or sports organizations, may disrupt our operations and adversely affect our businesses.
many of nbcuniversal's writers, directors, actors, technical and production personnel, as well as some of our on-air and creative talent employees, are covered by collective bargaining agreements or works councils. most of nbcuniversal's comcast 2021 annual report on form 10-k collective bargaining agreements are industry-wide agreements, and we may lack practical control over the negotiations and terms of the agreements. if we are unable to reach agreement with a labor union before the expiration of a collective bargaining agreement, our employees who were covered by that agreement may have a right to strike or take other actions that could adversely affect us, which could disrupt our operations and reduce our revenue, and the resolution of any disputes may increase our costs. there can be no assurance that we will renew our collective bargaining agreements as they expire or that we can renew them on favorable terms or without any work stoppages.
in addition, nbcuniversal's media segment and sky have programming rights agreements of varying scope and duration with various sports organizations to broadcast and produce sporting events. labor disputes in these and other sports organizations could have an adverse effect on our businesses.
our class b common stock has substantial voting rights and separate approval rights over several potentially material transactions, and our chairman and ceo has considerable influence over our company through his beneficial ownership of our class b common stock.
our class b common stock has a non-dilutable 33 1/3% of the combined voting power of our class a and class b common stock. this non-dilutable voting power is subject to proportional decrease to the extent the number of shares of class b common stock is reduced below 9,444,375, which was the number of shares of class b common stock outstanding on the date of our 2002 acquisition of at&t corp.'s cable business, subject to adjustment in specified situations. stock dividends payable on the class b common stock in the form of class b or class a common stock do not decrease the non-dilutable voting power of the class b common stock. the class b common stock also has separate approval rights over several potentially material transactions, even if they are approved by our board of directors or by our other shareholders and even if they might be in the best interests of our other shareholders. these potentially material transactions include mergers or consolidations involving us, transactions (such as a sale of all or substantially all of our assets) or issuances of securities that require shareholder approval, transactions that result in any person or group owning shares representing more than 10% of the combined voting power of the resulting or surviving corporation, issuances of class b common stock or securities exercisable or convertible into class b common stock, and amendments to our articles of incorporation or by-laws that would limit the rights of holders of our class b common stock. brian l. roberts, our chairman and ceo, beneficially owns all of the outstanding shares of our class b common stock and, accordingly, has considerable influence over our company and the potential ability to transfer effective control by selling the class b common stock, which could be at a premium.

2021 developments the following are the more significant developments in our businesses during 2021:

•total customer relationships increased by 1.1 million, total broadband customers increased by 1.3 million, total wireless lines increased by 1.2 million and total video customers decreased by 1.7 million.

impacts of covid-19
covid-19 and measures taken to prevent its spread across the globe have impacted our businesses in a number of ways, with the most significant effects in 2020, affecting the comparability of periods included in this report. covid-19 has had material negative impacts on nbcuniversal and sky results of operations primarily due to the temporary restrictions and closures at our theme parks and the impacts of professional sports, respectively. we expect the effects of the covid-19 pandemic will continue to adversely impact our consolidated results of operations over the near to medium term, although the extent of such comcast 2021 annual report on form 10-k impact will depend on restrictive governmental measures, u.s. and global economic conditions, expanded availability and acceptance of vaccines and consumer behavior in response to covid-19. the following summary provides a discussion of current and potential future effects of the pandemic with direct impacts to our businesses.
•our theme parks in orlando and hollywood operated without capacity restrictions, following periods with capacity restrictions in place in the second quarter of 2021. our theme park in hollywood began requiring proof of vaccination or a negative covid-19 test result for park entry in accordance with local requirements in the fourth quarter of 2021. our theme park in japan began operating without capacity restrictions in the fourth quarter of 2021, following periods with capacity restrictions in place. our newest theme park, universal beijing resort, opened in september 2021 with capacity restrictions. the capacity restrictions and temporary closures of our theme parks had a significant impact on our revenue and adjusted ebitda on a consolidated basis. the results of operations at our theme parks may continue to be negatively impacted and we cannot predict if our parks will remain open or be subject to capacity restrictions, or the level of attendance at our reopened parks. the development of the epic universe theme park in orlando resumed in 2021 after having been paused in 2020.
•delays to the start of seasons for certain professional sports leagues, including the 2020-21 nhl and nba seasons, resulted in the shift of additional events into the first half of 2021 compared to a normal year. the delays impacted the timing of revenue and expense recognition, because both advertising revenue and costs associated with broadcasting these programs are recognized when events are broadcast. the timing of sports seasons generally returned to a normal calendar beginning in the third quarter of 2021. in addition, the tokyo olympics were postponed from the third quarter of 2020 to the third quarter of 2021, resulting in a corresponding delay of the associated revenue and costs.
•our studio production operations have generally returned to full capacity. we delayed or altered the theatrical distribution strategy for certain of our films, both domestically and internationally as a result of the temporary closures and limited capacity operations of many movie theaters worldwide caused by covid-19. delays in theatrical releases affect both current and future periods as a result of corresponding delays in subsequent content licensing windows. results of operations in our studios segment may be negatively impacted over the near to medium term as a result of covid-19.
•direct-to-consumer revenue has been negatively impacted, and future periods may be negatively impacted, as a result of lower sports subscription revenue due to the closures and extent of reopening of our commercial customers' locations. in addition, delays to the start of the 2020-21 seasons for certain sports, including european football, resulted in the shift of additional events and the significant costs associated with broadcasting these programs into the first and second quarters of 2021 compared to a normal year. the timing of sports seasons generally returned to a normal calendar beginning in the third quarter of 2021.

•an increase in sky segment expenses primarily due to increases in direct network costs and other expenses, partially offset by decreases in programming and production costs, as well as the impacts of foreign currency translation.
•a decrease in corporate and other expenses primarily due to severance charges related to our businesses in the prior year period.
•consolidated costs and expenses for 2020 also includes an adjustment of $177 million related to a legal settlement that was excluded from adjusted ebitda and our segment operating results.
operating costs and expenses for our segments and our corporate operations, business development initiatives and other businesses are discussed separately below under the heading "segment operating results."

amortization expense from acquisition-related intangible assets totaled $2.4 billion, $2.3 billion and $2.0 billion for 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. amounts primarily relate to customer relationship intangible assets recorded in connection with the sky transaction in the fourth quarter of 2018 and the nbcuniversal transaction in 2011.
consolidated interest expense interest expense decreased in 2021 compared to 2020 primarily due to $360 million of charges recorded in 2020 related to the early redemption of senior notes compared to $204 million of charges related to early redemptions in 2021, as well as a decrease in average debt outstanding and lower weighted-average interest rates.
equity in net income (losses) of investees, net                            $2,006          $(113)          $(505)
the change in investment and other income (loss), net in 2021 compared to 2020 was primarily due to equity in net income (losses) of investees, net related to our investment in atairos and realized and unrealized gains (losses) on equity securities, net. the income (losses) at atairos were driven by fair value adjustments on its underlying investments with income (loss) of $1.8 billion, $286 million and $(64) million 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. realized and unrealized gains (losses) on equity securities, net in 2021 primarily included gains related to nonmarketable equity securities and losses on certain marketable securities, compared to the prior year period which primarily included gains on nonmarketable securities.
consolidated income tax (expense) benefit our effective income tax rate in 2021 and 2020 was 27.5% and 23.9%, respectively.
in 2021, the effective income tax rate included $498 million of expense relating to the impact of tax law changes enacted in the united kingdom in the second quarter of 2021, which, among other provisions, will increase the corporate tax rate to 25% from 19% effective april 1, 2023. the rate change resulted in an increase in our net deferred tax liabilities and a corresponding increase in income tax expense. our income tax expense will reflect the new rate in the united kingdom in 2023.
in 2020, the effective income tax rate included $145 million of expense relating to the impact of tax law changes in the third quarter of 2020.
consolidated net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests and redeemable subsidiary preferred stock the changes in net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests and redeemable subsidiary preferred stock in 2021 compared to 2020 was primarily due to losses at universal beijing resort, which increased due to pre-opening costs prior to its opening in september 2021 (see note 7).

average monthly total revenue per customer relationship is impacted by rate adjustments and changes in the types and levels of services received by our residential and business services customers, as well as changes in advertising revenue. while revenue from our residential broadband, video and voice services is also impacted by changes in the allocation of revenue among services sold in a bundle, the allocation does not impact average monthly total revenue per customer relationship. each of our services has a different contribution to operating margin. we use average monthly adjusted ebitda per customer relationship to evaluate the profitability of our customer base across our service offerings. we believe both metrics are useful to understand the trends in our business, and average monthly adjusted ebitda per customer relationship is useful particularly as we continue to focus on growing our higher-margin businesses.
comcast 2021 annual report on form 10-k cable communications segment - revenue we are a leading provider of broadband, video, voice, wireless, and other services to residential customers in the united states under the xfinity brand; we also provide these and other services to business customers and sell advertising. our residential and business customers are marketed individually and as bundled services at a discounted rate.
residential revenue from our residential customers includes amounts earned for providing our broadband, video, voice and wireless services, including equipment and installation services. broadband revenue also includes revenue earned related to our customers' use of flex and streaming services, and wireless revenue also includes the sale of devices. revenue from each of our residential services is impacted by changes in the allocation of revenue among services sold in a bundle. franchise and regulatory fees billed to our customers are included with the relevant service, which primarily relate to video and voice services.
broadband revenue increased in 2021 primarily due to an increase in the number of residential broadband customers. the remaining increase in revenue was due to an increase in average rates. average rates in 2020 were negatively impacted by waived fees due to covid-19 and the impacts of customer adjustments. refer to "video" below for additional information.
we believe our customer base will continue to grow as consumers choose our broadband service and seek higher-speed offerings.
video revenue was flat in 2021 primarily due to a decline in the number of residential video customers, offset by an increase in average rates. average rates in 2020 were negatively impacted by customer adjustments accrued as a result of provisions in our programming distribution agreements with regional sports networks related to canceled sporting events. for customers receiving bundled services, the revenue reduction was allocated across each of the services in the bundle.
we expect that the number of residential video customers will continue to decline, negatively impacting video revenue as a result of the competitive environment and shifting video consumption patterns.

customer metrics are presented based on actual amounts. customer relationships represent the number of residential customers that subscribe to at least one of sky's four primary services of video, broadband, voice and wireless phone service. sky reports business customers, including hotels, bars, workplaces and restaurants, generally based on the number of locations receiving our services. in the first quarter of 2021, we implemented conforming changes to our methodology for counting commercial customers in italy and germany, which are counted as described above, consistent with the methodology for customers in the united kingdom. previously, customers were counted based on a residential equivalent unit in italy or the number of active venues or rooms in germany. this change resulted in a reduction in sky's total customer relationships of 714,000 as of december 31, 2020. the impact of the change in methodology to customer relationship net additions for any period was not material. for comparative purposes, we have updated sky's historical total customer relationships and average monthly direct-to-consumer revenue per customer relationship to reflect this adjustment.

sky segment - revenue direct-to-consumer revenue primarily relates to video services provided to both residential and business customers, as well as broadband, voice and wireless services. video service revenue includes both dth video services and our now streaming service. revenue from our wireless customers also includes the sale of devices.
revenue increased in 2021 compared to 2020. excluding the impact of foreign currency, revenue increased primarily due to an increase in average revenue per customer relationship. this increase reflected the impacts of the postponement of sporting events in the prior year period as a result of covid-19, an increase in the sale of wireless handsets and rate increases in the united kingdom, which were partially offset by declines in average rates in italy. customer relationships remained relatively consistent with the prior year period as decreases in italy were offset by increases in the united kingdom and germany. the declines in customer relationships and average revenue per customer relationship in italy primarily resulted from reduced broadcast rights for serie a, which we had held through the end of the 2020-21 season. beginning with the 2021-22 season in the third quarter of 2021 and through the 2023-24 season, we have nonexclusive broadcast rights to fewer matches, which has resulted and we expect will continue to result in declines in revenue and customer relationships in italy.
content revenue relates to the distribution of our owned television channels on third-party platforms and the licensing of owned and licensed content.
revenue decreased in 2021 compared to 2020. excluding the impact of foreign currency, revenue decreased primarily due to lower sports programming licensing revenue driven by changes in licensing agreements in italy and germany, partially offset by higher revenue from the distribution of sky's sports programming on third-party platforms due to the impacts of covid-19 in the prior year period.
comcast 2021 annual report on form 10-k advertising revenue consists of the sale of advertising on linear television and digital platforms, including where we represent the sales efforts of third-party channels, as well revenue from various technology, tools and solutions relating to our advertising business.
revenue increased in 2021 compared to 2020. excluding the impact of foreign currency, revenue increased primarily reflecting an overall market recovery compared to the prior year period.
sky segment - operating costs and expenses programming and production costs expenses primarily relate to content broadcast on our channels. these costs include the amortization of owned and licensed programming, including sports rights, direct production costs, production overhead and on-air talent costs. these expenses also include the fees associated with programming distribution agreements for channels owned by third parties.
expenses increased in 2021 compared to 2020. excluding the impact of foreign currency, expenses decreased primarily due to lower costs associated with serie a and entertainment programming in the current year period, partially offset by an increase in the number of sporting events in the current year period due to covid-19, which delayed the starts of the 2020-21 european football seasons.
direct network costs expenses primarily include costs directly related to the supply of broadband and voice services, including wireless services for wireless handsets and tablets, to our customers. this includes call costs, monthly wholesale access fees and other variable costs associated with our network. in addition, it includes the cost of wireless handsets sold to customers.
expenses increased in 2021 compared to 2020. excluding the impact of foreign currency, expenses increased primarily due to an increase in costs associated with sky's wireless phone and broadband services as a result of increases in the sale of wireless handsets and the number of customers receiving these services.
other expenses expenses include costs related to marketing, fees paid to third-party channels for which sky represents the advertising sales efforts, subscriber management, supply chain, transmission, technology, fixed networks and general administrative costs.
expenses increased in 2021 compared to 2020. excluding the impact of foreign currency, expenses increased primarily due to higher fees paid to third-party channels related to advertising sales, partially offset by lower personnel costs.

corporate and other primarily includes overhead and personnel costs, the results of other business initiatives and comcast spectacor, which owns the philadelphia flyers and the wells fargo center arena in philadelphia, pennsylvania. other business initiatives include costs associated with the launch of sky glass and the related hardware sales, as well as costs associated with the launch of xclass tv.
revenue increased in 2021 primarily due to increases at comcast spectacor as a result of the impacts of covid-19 in the prior year period and sales of sky glass televisions.
expenses decreased in 2021 primarily due to costs incurred in the prior year periods in response to covid-19, including severance charges related to our businesses, partially offset by costs related to sky glass and xclass tv. in 2020, our businesses implemented separate cost savings initiatives, with the most significant relating to severance at nbcuniversal in connection with the realignment of the operating structure in our television businesses as well as overall reductions in the cost base. the costs of these initiatives were presented in corporate and other. payments related to nbcuniversal employee severance were substantially complete in 2021 and the substantial majority of the related costs savings were being realized in operating costs and expenses as of the end of 2021. a portion of these cost savings may be reallocated to investments in content and other strategic initiatives. we expect to incur increased costs in 2022 related to the launch of sky glass and xclass tv.

non-gaap financial measures consolidated adjusted ebitda adjusted ebitda is a non-gaap financial measure and is the primary basis used to measure the operational strength and performance of our businesses as well as to assist in the evaluation of underlying trends in our businesses. this measure eliminates the significant level of noncash depreciation and amortization expense that results from the capital-intensive nature of certain of our businesses and from intangible assets recognized in business combinations. it is also unaffected by our capital and tax structures, and by our investment activities, including the results of entities that we do not consolidate, as our management excludes these results when evaluating our operating performance. our management and board of directors use this financial measure to evaluate our consolidated operating performance and the operating performance of our operating segments and to allocate resources and capital to our operating segments. it is also a significant performance measure in our annual incentive compensation programs. additionally, we believe that adjusted ebitda is useful to investors because it is one of the bases for comparing our operating performance with that of other companies in our industries, although our measure of adjusted ebitda may not be directly comparable to similar measures used by other companies.
we define adjusted ebitda as net income attributable to comcast corporation before net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests and redeemable subsidiary preferred stock, income tax expense, investment and other income (loss), net, interest expense, depreciation and amortization expense, and other operating gains and losses (such as impairment charges related to fixed and intangible assets and gains or losses on the sale of long-lived assets), if any. from time to time we may exclude from adjusted ebitda the impact of certain events, gains, losses or other charges (such as significant legal settlements) that affect the period-to-period comparability of our operating performance.
we reconcile consolidated adjusted ebitda to net income attributable to comcast corporation. this measure should not be considered a substitute for operating income (loss), net income (loss), net income (loss) attributable to comcast corporation, or net cash provided by operating activities that we have reported in accordance with gaap.

comcast 2021 annual report on form 10-k constant currency constant currency and constant currency growth rates are non-gaap financial measures that present our results of operations excluding the estimated effects of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. certain of our businesses, including sky, have operations outside the united states that are conducted in local currencies. as a result, the comparability of the financial results reported in u.s. dollars is affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates. in our sky segment, we use constant currency and constant currency growth rates to evaluate the underlying performance of the business, and we believe it is helpful for investors to present operating results on a comparable basis year over year to evaluate its underlying performance.
constant currency and constant currency growth rates are calculated by comparing the prior year results adjusted to reflect the average exchange rates from the current year rather than the actual exchange rates that were in effect during the respective prior year.

our businesses generate significant cash flows from operating activities. we believe that we will be able to continue to meet our current and long-term liquidity and capital requirements, including fixed charges, through our cash flows from operating activities; existing cash, cash equivalents and investments; available borrowings under our existing credit facility; and our ability to obtain future external financing. refer to "contractual obligations" discussion below for additional information regarding our cash requirements. we anticipate that we will continue to use a substantial portion of our cash flows from operating activities in repaying our debt obligations, funding our capital expenditures and cash paid for intangible assets, investing in business opportunities, and returning capital to shareholders.
we maintain significant availability under our revolving credit facility and our commercial paper program to meet our short-term liquidity requirements. our commercial paper program provides a lower-cost source of borrowing to fund our short-term working capital requirements. as of december 31, 2021, amounts available under our revolving credit facility, net of amounts outstanding under our commercial paper program and outstanding letters of credit and bank guarantees, totaled $11.0 billion. we entered into a new revolving credit facility in march 2021 (see note 6).
comcast 2021 annual report on form 10-k we are subject to customary covenants and restrictions set forth in agreements related to debt issued at comcast and certain of our subsidiaries, including the indentures governing our public debt securities and the credit agreement governing the comcast revolving credit facility. our credit facility contains a financial covenant pertaining to leverage, which is the ratio of debt to ebitda, as defined in the credit facility. compliance with this financial covenant is tested on a quarterly basis under the terms of the credit facility. as of december 31, 2021, we met this financial covenant by a significant margin and we expect to remain in compliance with this financial covenant and other covenants related to our debt. the covenants and restrictions in our revolving credit facility do not apply to certain entities, including sky and our international theme parks.

the decrease resulting from changes in operating assets and liabilities in 2021 compared to 2020 was primarily related to the timing of amortization and related payments for our film and television costs, including increased production spending, offset by an increased number of sporting events in 2021, as well as increases in accounts receivable and decreases in deferred revenue, which included the impacts of our broadcast of the tokyo olympics. these decreases were partially offset by increases related to the operations of our theme parks.
the decrease in income tax payments in 2021 was primarily due to the tax deductions resulting from our senior notes exchange (refer to "financing activities" below for additional information), which reduced tax payments by $1.3 billion in the current year period and more than offset the higher taxable income from operations in 2021.
investing activities our most significant recurring investing activity has been capital expenditures, which are discussed further below. the increase in cash used in investing activities in 2021 compared to 2020 was primarily due to proceeds received from the sale of our investment in airtouch in 2020, the acquisition of masergy in 2021 and increased cash paid for intangible assets related to software development, partially offset by decreases in purchases of investments, decreases in costs related to the construction of universal beijing resort and the purchase of spectrum in the prior year period.
capital expenditures capital expenditures were flat in 2021 primarily due to reduced spending in our theme parks segment as a result of covid-19, offset by increases in spending in our cable communications segment. the costs associated with the construction of universal beijing resort are presented separately in our consolidated statement of cash flows. see note 7.
our most significant capital expenditures are in our cable communications segment, and we expect that this will continue in the future. cable communications' capital expenditures increased primarily due to increased spending on scalable infrastructure and line extensions, partially offset by decreased spending on customer premise equipment and support capital. the table below summarizes the capital expenditures we incurred in our cable communications segment in 2021, 2020 and 2019.
customer premise equipment                      $2,203          $2,333          $2,659
support capital                                    503             589             858
we expect our capital expenditures for 2022 will be focused on the increased investment in scalable infrastructure to increase network capacity and in line extensions for the expansion of both business services and residential in our cable comcast 2021 annual report on form 10-k communications segment; and the continued deployment of wireless gateways, x1 and sky q. in addition, we expect to continue investment in existing and new attractions at our universal theme parks in the future, including the development of our additional theme park in orlando, florida, which resumed in 2021. capital expenditures for subsequent years will depend on numerous factors, including competition, changes in technology, regulatory changes, the timing and rate of deployment of new services, the capacity required for existing services, the timing of new attractions at our theme parks and potential acquisitions.
financing activities net cash used in financing activities in 2021 consisted primarily of repayments of debt and the related early redemption payments presented in other financing activities, repurchases of common stock under our share repurchase program and employee plans, dividend payments, and payments related to the redemption of nbcuniversal enterprise redeemable subsidiary preferred stock presented in other financing activities, partially offset by proceeds from borrowings. net cash used in financing activities in 2020 consisted primarily of repayments of debt and the related early redemption payments presented in other financing activities, dividend payments, and payments related to the redemption and repayment of subsidiary preferred shares in the second quarter of 2020 presented in other financing activities, partially offset by proceeds from borrowings and proceeds from the settlement of cross-currency swaps related to our debt presented in other financing activities.
in august 2021, we completed a debt exchange transaction. we issued $15.0 billion aggregate principal amount of new senior notes, which have maturities ranging from 2051 to 2063 and a weighted-average interest rate of 2.93%, and made cash payments of $0.5 billion in exchange for $11.2 billion aggregate principal amount of certain series of outstanding senior notes with maturities ranging from 2033 to 2058 and a weighted-average interest rate of 5.04%. the debt exchange resulted in an overall reduction in the weighted-average interest rate for our total outstanding debt of 0.27% and extended the overall weighted-average maturity by 2 years. the debt exchange transaction was accounted for as a debt modification, and therefore following the exchange, the book value of the new senior notes is equal to the book value of the exchanged senior notes reduced by the amount of the cash payments, and the difference between the principal and carrying amounts of the new senior notes will accrue through interest expense over the period to maturity of the new senior notes.
in 2021, we made debt repayments of $11.5 billion, including $4.9 billion of optional repayments of term loans due 2022 to 2023 and the early redemption of $3.3 billion of senior notes maturing in 2024 and 2025, as well as amounts due at maturity and the cash payments in the debt exchange transaction.
in 2021, we issued €1.75 billion ($2.1 billion using exchange rates on the date of issuance) aggregate principal amount of fixed-rate euro senior notes maturing in 2026 and 2029. in 2021, we had borrowings of $0.6 billion under the universal beijing resort term loan.
we have made, and may from time to time in the future make, optional repayments on our debt obligations, which may include repurchases or exchanges of our outstanding public notes and debentures, depending on various factors, such as market conditions. any such repurchases may be effected through privately negotiated transactions, market transactions, tender offers, redemptions or otherwise. see notes 6 and 7 for additional information on our financing activities.
share repurchases and dividends in the second quarter of 2021, we restarted our share repurchase program, which had been paused since the beginning of 2019. effective may 25, 2021, our board of directors increased our share repurchase program authorization to $10 billion. during 2021, we repurchased a total of 73.2 million shares of our class a common stock for $4.0 billion. in january 2022, our board of directors increased our share repurchase program authorization from the $6 billion remaining as of december 31, 2021 to $10 billion. under the authorization, which does not have an expiration date, we expect to repurchase additional shares, which may be in the open market or in private transactions.
our board of directors declared quarterly dividends totaling $4.6 billion in 2021. we paid dividends of $4.5 billion in 2021. in january 2022, our board of directors approved an 8% increase in our dividend to $1.08 per share on an annualized basis. we expect to continue to pay quarterly dividends, although each dividend is subject to approval by our board of directors.
the chart below summarizes our share repurchases under our publicly announced share repurchase program authorization and dividends paid in 2021, 2020 and 2019. in addition, we paid $674 million and $534 million in 2021 and 2020, respectively, related to employee taxes associated with the administration of our share-based compensation plans.

contractual obligations the following table summarizes our most significant contractual obligations as of december 31, 2021:
as of december 31, 2021 (in billions)                total        within the next 12 months        beyond the next 12 months debt obligations(a)                             $100.8                      $2.1                            $98.7
(a) amounts represent the face value of debt and exclude interest payments and a collateralized obligation (see note 8).
our largest contractual obligations relate to our outstanding debt. as of december 31, 2021, our debt has a weighted-average time to maturity of approximately 18 years and a weighted-average interest rate based on the stated coupons and including the effects of our derivative financial instruments of 3.44%. we typically fund and expect to continue to be able to fund debt maturities and interest payments with cash flows generated in our operations; existing cash, cash equivalents and investments; or proceeds from additional external financing. see note 6 for additional information on our debt.
we also have significant contractual obligations associated with our programming and production expenses. nbcuniversal and sky have multiyear agreements for broadcast rights of sporting events, such as the olympics, the nfl and european football leagues, which represent the substantial majority of our programming and production obligations. cable communications' programming expenses related to the distribution of third-party programmed channels are generally acquired under multiyear distribution agreements, with fees typically based on the number of customers that receive the programming and the extent of distribution. as a result, the amounts included in the table above under fixed or minimum guaranteed commitments for these distribution agreements are not material and we expect the total fees to be paid under these arrangements to be significantly higher than the amounts included above. we have funded and expect to continue to be able to fund our programming and production obligations with the cash generated from our operations. as of december 31, 2021, approximately 40% of cash payments related to our programming and production obligations are due after five years, primarily related to multiyear sports rights agreements. see note 4 for additional information on programming and production costs.
our other contractual obligations relate primarily to operating leases (see note 15) and other arrangements recorded in our balance sheet and/or disclosed in the notes to our financial statements, including benefit plan obligations (see note 11), liabilities for uncertain tax positions (see note 5), our remaining unfunded capital commitment to atairos (see note 8) and a contractual obligation related to an interest held by a third party in the revenue of certain theme parks (see note 15).
guarantee structure our debt is primarily issued at comcast, although we also have debt at certain of our subsidiaries as a result of acquisitions and other issuances. a substantial amount of this debt is subject to guarantees by comcast and by certain subsidiaries that we have put in place to simplify our capital structure. we believe this guarantee structure provides liquidity benefits to debt investors and helps to simplify credit analysis with respect to relative value considerations of guaranteed subsidiary debt.

(a)nbcuniversal, comcast cable and comcast holdings (included within other debt subject to one-way guarantees) are each consolidated subsidiaries subject to the periodic reporting requirements of the sec. the guarantee structures and related disclosures in this section, together with exhibit 22, satisfy these reporting obligations.
(b)universal beijing resort debt financing is secured by the assets of universal beijing resort and the equity interests of the investors. see note 7 for additional information.
cross-guarantees comcast, nbcuniversal and comcast cable (the "guarantors") fully and unconditionally, jointly and severally, guarantee each other's debt securities. nbcuniversal and comcast cable also guarantee other borrowings of comcast, including its revolving credit facility. these guarantees rank equally with all other general unsecured and unsubordinated obligations of the respective guarantors. however, the obligations of the guarantors under the guarantees are structurally subordinated to the indebtedness and other liabilities of their respective non-guarantor subsidiaries. the obligations of each guarantor are limited to the maximum amount that would not render such guarantor's obligations subject to avoidance under applicable fraudulent conveyance provisions of u.s. and non-u.s. law. each guarantor's obligations will remain in effect until all amounts payable with respect to the guaranteed securities have been paid in full. however, a guarantee by nbcuniversal or comcast cable of comcast's debt securities, or by nbcuniversal of comcast cable's debt securities, will terminate upon a disposition of such guarantor entity or all or substantially all of its assets.
the guarantors are each holding companies that principally hold investments in, borrow from and lend to non-guarantor subsidiary operating companies; issue and service third-party debt obligations; repurchase shares and pay dividends; and engage in certain corporate and headquarters activities. the guarantors are generally dependent on non-guarantor subsidiary operating companies to fund these activities.
as of december 31, 2021 and 2020, the combined guarantors have noncurrent notes payable to non-guarantor subsidiaries of $126 billion and $124 billion, respectively, and noncurrent notes receivable from non-guarantor subsidiaries of $30 billion and $26 billion, respectively. this financial information is that of the guarantors presented on a combined basis with intercompany balances between the guarantors eliminated. the combined financial information excludes financial information of non-guarantor subsidiaries. the underlying net assets of the non-guarantor subsidiaries are significantly in excess of the guarantor obligations. excluding investments in non-guarantor subsidiaries, external debt and the noncurrent notes payable and receivable with non-guarantor subsidiaries, the guarantors do not have material assets, liabilities or results of operations.
one-way guarantees comcast provides full and unconditional guarantees of certain debt issued by sky and other consolidated subsidiaries not subject to the periodic reporting requirements of the sec.
comcast 2021 annual report on form 10-k comcast also provides a full and unconditional guarantee of $138 million principal amount of subordinated debt issued by comcast holdings. comcast's obligations under this guarantee are subordinated and subject, in right of payment, to the prior payment in full of all of comcast's senior indebtedness, including debt guaranteed by comcast on a senior basis; and are structurally subordinated to the indebtedness and other liabilities of its non-guarantor subsidiaries (for purposes of this comcast holdings discussion, comcast cable and nbcuniversal are included within the non-guarantor subsidiary group). comcast's obligations as guarantor will remain in effect until all amounts payable with respect to the guaranteed debt have been paid in full. however, the guarantee will terminate upon a disposition of comcast holdings or all or substantially all of its assets. comcast holdings is a consolidated subsidiary holding company that directly or indirectly holds 100% and approximately 37% of our equity interests in comcast cable and nbcuniversal, respectively.
as of december 31, 2021 and 2020, comcast and comcast holdings, the combined issuer and guarantor of the guaranteed subordinated debt, have noncurrent senior notes payable to non-guarantor subsidiaries of $96 billion and $94 billion, respectively, and noncurrent notes receivable from non-guarantor subsidiaries of $29 billion and $23 billion, respectively. this financial information is that of comcast and comcast holdings presented on a combined basis with intercompany balances between comcast and comcast holdings eliminated. the combined financial information excludes financial information of non-guarantor subsidiaries of comcast and comcast holdings. the underlying net assets of the non-guarantor subsidiaries of comcast and comcast holdings are significantly in excess of the obligations of comcast and comcast holdings. excluding investments in non-guarantor subsidiaries, external debt and the noncurrent notes payable and receivable with non-guarantor subsidiaries, comcast and comcast holdings do not have material assets, liabilities or results of operations.
critical accounting judgments and estimates the preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, and the related disclosure of contingent assets and contingent liabilities. we base our judgments on our historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making estimates about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.
we believe our judgments and related estimates associated with the valuation and impairment testing of goodwill and cable franchise rights and the accounting for film and television costs are critical in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting judgments and estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors, and the audit committee has reviewed the related disclosures below. see also notes 4 and 10.
valuation and impairment testing of goodwill and cable franchise rights we assess the recoverability of our goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, including cable franchise rights, annually as of july 1, or more frequently whenever events or substantive changes in circumstances indicate that the assets might be impaired. the assessment of recoverability may first consider qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit or an indefinite-lived intangible asset is less than its carrying amount. a quantitative assessment is performed if the qualitative assessment results in a more-likely-than-not determination or if a qualitative assessment is not performed.
goodwill goodwill results from business combinations and represents the excess amount of the consideration paid over the identifiable assets and liabilities recorded in the acquisition. we test goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level and have concluded that our reporting units are generally the same as our reportable segments. we evaluate the determination of our reporting units periodically or whenever events or substantive changes in circumstances occur. when performing a quantitative assessment, we estimate the fair values of our reporting units primarily based on a discounted cash flow analysis that involves significant judgment, including market participant estimates of future cash flows expected to be generated by the business and the selection of discount rates. when analyzing the fair values indicated under discounted cash flow models, we also consider multiples of adjusted ebitda generated by the underlying assets, current market transactions and profitability information.
we performed qualitative assessments in 2021 for goodwill in our cable communications and nbcuniversal segments. the qualitative assessments considered that the estimated fair values of these reporting units substantially exceeded their carrying values at the time of our previous quantitative assessments in 2018; changes in projected future cash flows; recent market transactions and overall macroeconomic conditions, including the effects of covid-19; discount rates; and changes in our market capitalization. based on these assessments, we concluded that it was more likely than not that the estimated fair values of our reporting units were higher than their carrying values and that the performance of a quantitative impairment test was not comcast 2021 annual report on form 10-k required. we performed a quantitative assessment in 2021 for goodwill in our sky segment and the estimated fair value of the reporting unit was higher than the carrying value. assets and liabilities resulting from a business combination are initially recorded at fair value and the risk of goodwill impairment is reduced as the value of the businesses in a reporting unit increases and as the carrying value of the reporting unit decreases due to the amortization of the historical cost of acquired long-lived assets over time. given that the goodwill in our sky segment resulted from our acquisition of sky in the fourth quarter of 2018, the fair value is in close proximity to the carrying value of the sky reporting unit.
changes in market conditions, laws and regulations, and key assumptions made in future quantitative assessments, including expected cash flows, competitive factors and discount rates, could negatively impact the results of future impairment testing and could result in the recognition of an impairment charge.
cable franchise rights our cable franchise rights assets result from agreements we have with state and local governments that allow us to construct and operate a cable business within a specified geographic area. the value of a franchise is derived from the economic benefits we receive from the right to solicit new customers and to market additional services in a particular service area. the amounts we record for cable franchise rights are primarily a result of cable system acquisitions. typically when we acquire a cable system, the most significant asset we record is the value of the cable franchise rights. often these cable system acquisitions include multiple franchise areas. we currently serve approximately 6,500 franchise areas in the united states.
we have concluded that our cable franchise rights have an indefinite useful life since there are no legal, regulatory, contractual, competitive, economic or other factors that limit the period over which these rights will contribute to our cash flows. accordingly, we do not amortize our cable franchise rights.
for purposes of impairment testing, we have grouped the recorded values of our various cable franchise rights into our three cable communications divisions or units of account. we evaluate the unit of account periodically to ensure our impairment testing is performed at an appropriate level.
when performing a quantitative assessment, we estimate the fair values of our cable franchise rights primarily based on a discounted cash flow analysis that involves significant judgment, including the estimate of future cash flows and the selection of discount rates. when analyzing the fair values indicated under the discounted cash flow models, we also consider multiples of adjusted ebitda generated by the underlying assets, current market transactions and profitability information.
in 2021, we performed a qualitative assessment of our cable franchise rights. at the time of our previous quantitative assessment in 2018, the estimated fair values of our franchise rights substantially exceeded their carrying values. we also considered various factors that would affect the estimated fair values of our cable franchise rights in our qualitative assessment, including changes in our projected future cash flows associated with our cable communications segment; recent market transactions and overall macroeconomic conditions, including the effects of covid-19; discount rates; and changes in our market capitalization. based on this assessment, we concluded that it was more likely than not that the estimated fair values of our cable franchise rights were higher than the carrying values and that the performance of a quantitative impairment test was not required.
changes in market conditions, laws and regulations and key assumptions made in future quantitative assessments, including expected cash flows, competitive factors and discount rates, could negatively impact the results of future impairment testing and could result in the recognition of an impairment charge.
film and television content we capitalize costs for owned film and television content, including direct costs, production overhead, print costs, development costs and interest, as well as acquired libraries. we have determined that the predominant monetization strategy for the substantial majority of our content is on an individual basis. amortization for owned content predominantly monetized on an individual basis and accrued costs associated with participations and residuals payments are recorded using the individual film forecast computation method, which recognizes the costs in the same ratio as the associated ultimate revenue.
our estimates of ultimate revenue for films generally include revenue from all sources that are expected to be earned within 10 years from the date of a film's initial release. these estimates are based on the distribution strategy and historical performance of similar content, as well as factors unique to the content itself. the most sensitive factor affecting our estimate of ultimate revenue for a film intended for theatrical release is the film's theatrical performance, as subsequent revenue from the licensing and sale of a film has historically exhibited a high correlation to its theatrical performance. upon a film's release, our estimates of revenue from succeeding markets, including from content licensing across multiple platforms and home entertainment sales, are revised based on historical relationships and an analysis of current market trends.
with respect to television series or other owned television programming, the most sensitive factor affecting our estimate of comcast 2021 annual report on form 10-k ultimate revenue is whether the series can be successfully licensed beyond its initial license window. initial estimates of ultimate revenue are limited to the amount of revenue attributed to the initial license window. once it is determined that a television series or other owned television programming can be licensed beyond the initial license window, revenue estimates for these additional windows or platforms, such as u.s. and international syndication, home entertainment, and other distribution platforms, are included in ultimate revenue. revenue estimates for produced episodes include revenue expected to be earned within 10 years of delivery of the initial episode or, if still in production, 5 years from the delivery of the most recent episode, if later.
we capitalize the costs of licensed content when the license period begins, the content is made available for use and the costs of the licenses are known. licensed content is amortized as the associated programs are broadcast. we recognize the costs of multiyear, live-event sports rights as the rights are utilized over the contract term based on estimated relative value. estimated relative value is generally based on terms of the contract and the nature of and potential revenue generation of the deliverables within the contract.
capitalized film and television costs are subject to impairment testing when certain triggering events are identified. the substantial majority of our owned content is evaluated for impairment on an individual title basis. licensed content that is not part of a film group is tested for impairment primarily on a channel, network or platform basis, with the exception of our broadcast networks and owned local broadcast television stations, which are tested on a daypart basis. sports rights are accounted for as executory contracts and are not subject to impairment. when performing an impairment assessment, we estimate fair value primarily based on a discounted cash flow analysis that involves significant judgment, including market participant estimates of future cash flows, which are supported by internal forecasts. adjustments to capitalized film and television costs were not material in any of the periods presented.

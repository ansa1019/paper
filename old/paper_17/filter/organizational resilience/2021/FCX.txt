in addition, with respect to our tailings facilities, as part of our commitment to implementing the tailings standard (discussed in items 1. and 2. "business and properties" herein), we will be required to consider uncertainties due to climate change, incorporate that assessment into the relevant knowledge base for our tailings facilities, use this knowledge base to enhance the resilience of our approach to the impacts of climate change using an adaptive management approach, incorporate that knowledge into facility operations, and take measures to mitigate both environmental impact and potential failure risks at our tailings facilities, including those arising from climate change. these obligations likely will require future changes at our tailings facilities, which could increase our operational expenses or require further capital investments.
the climate report details the work underway across our global business to reduce greenhouse gas (ghg) emissions, improve energy efficiency, advance the use of renewable energy and enhance our resilience to future climate-related risks. the updated climate report includes our ghg emissions reduction targets and aspirations and reflects our continued progress towards alignment with the current recommendations of the task force on climate-related financial disclosures. refer to item 1a. "risk factors" contained in part i of our annual report on form 10-k for the year ended december 31, 2021, for further discussion of climate-related risks.

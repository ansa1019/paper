management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations net income attributable to honeywell
earnings per share of common stock-assuming dilution increased due to the following:
•higher segment profit,
•prior year non-cash charges associated with the reduction in value of reimbursement receivables due from garrett,
•gain on sale of the retail footwear business, and
•favorable impact of lower share count,
•partially offset by higher income taxes, an expense related to uop matters, and higher foreign exchange expense.
review of business segments we globally manage our business operations through four segments: aerospace, honeywell building technologies, performance materials and technologies, and safety and productivity solutions.

risk factors our business, operating results, cash flows and financial condition are subject to the material risks and uncertainties set forth below, any one of which could cause our actual results to vary materially from recent results or from our anticipated future results.
macroeconomic and industry risks each of our businesses is subject to unique industry and economic conditions that may adversely affect the markets and operating conditions of our customers, which in turn can affect demand for our products and services and our results of operations.
•aerospace-our aerospace business is impacted by customer buying patterns of aftermarket parts, supplier stability, factory transitions, and global supply chain capacity constraints that may lead to shortages of crucial components. operating results may be adversely affected by downturns in the global demand for air travel, which may impact new aircraft production or result in the delay or cancellation of new aircraft orders, delays in launch schedules for new aircraft, the retirement of aircraft and reductions in global flying hours, which impacts air transport and regional, business, and general aviation aircraft utilization rates. operating results may also be adversely affected by any decrease in air travel demand due to regional restrictions or suspension of service for public health, safety, or environmental events, such as the effects of the covid-19 pandemic, which impacted our operating results. operating results could also be impacted by changes in overall trends related to end market demand for the product portfolio, as well as new entrants and non-traditional players entering the market. operating results in our defense and space business unit may be affected by the mix of u.s. and foreign government appropriations for defense and space programs and by compliance risks. results may also be impacted by the potential introduction of counterfeit parts into our global supply chain.
•honeywell building technologies-operating results may be adversely impacted by downturns in the level of global commercial construction activity (including retrofits and upgrades), lower capital spending and operating expenditures on building projects, changes in the competitive landscape including new market entrants and new technologies, and fluctuations in inventory levels in distribution channels.
•performance materials and technologies-operating results may be adversely impacted by downturns in capacity utilization for chemical, industrial, refining, petrochemical, and semiconductor plants, our customers' availability of capital for refinery construction and expansion, raw material demand and supply, product commoditization, continued illegal imports of hydrofluorocarbons into europe, and our ability to maximize our facilities' production capacity and minimize downtime. periods of increased volatility in oil and natural gas prices may result in less investment by our customers and therefore, lower demand for our products and services.
•safety and productivity solutions-operating results may be adversely impacted by reduced investments in process automation, safety monitoring, and plant capacity utilization initiatives, fluctuations in retail markets, a slowdown in demand for safety products, changes in the competitive landscape, including new market entrants and technology that may lead to product commoditization, and adverse industry economic conditions, all of which could result in lower market share, reduced selling prices and lower margins.
the global covid-19 pandemic and related impacts have adversely affected and may continue to adversely affect, our business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flow.
the continued global spread of covid-19 creates significant volatility, uncertainty and economic disruption that have impacted our business, operations, and financial results and may continue to do so. the extent to which the covid-19 pandemic will continue to impact our business, operations and financial results will depend on numerous evolving factors that we may not be able to accurately predict, including: the duration, scope and severity of the pandemic, including emergence and impact of new variants; some of which have been, and may be in the future, more virulent or transmissible than the initial strain, and any continued increase in cases globally and across the united states in particular, including breakthrough infections among the fully vaccinated population, as well as the timing, availability, and acceptance of effective medical treatments and vaccines; the pace of vaccine deployment; the impact of vaccine mandates, governmental, business and individual decisions and actions; the impact of the pandemic on economic activity; and the extent to which we or our employees, customers, suppliers, service providers or other business partners may be prevented from conducting normal business activities, including due to shutdowns or other restrictive measures that may be requested or mandated by governmental authorities. these factors could, among other things, continue to disrupt (i) the purchasing, contracting and payment behaviors of our customers and their end-users; (ii) our operations, including our manufacturing activities, the shipment of our products, and the performance of our suppliers and service providers; and (iii) our liquidity and cash flow.
risk factors risks arising from the covid-19 pandemic impacting our business and that may continue to impact our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects include, among other things:
•customer risk-existing and potential customers and their end-users may continue to take actions to reduce or suspend operations, reduce or delay spending, cancel contracts, or cut costs in a manner that reduces demand for our products and services. in particular, lower demand for air travel may continue to cause our customers to delay or suspend spending in connection with the manufacturing, repair, overhaul or servicing of aircraft, and there may be long-term deterioration in demand for air travel that could impact our business beyond the current covid-19 health crisis. customers may also continue to attempt to renegotiate contracts and obtain concessions, face financial constraints on their ability to make payments to us on a timely basis or at all, or enter into bankruptcy or discontinue their business operations, and we may continue to be required to discount the pricing of our products. in addition, unfavorable customer site conditions, such as closure of or access restrictions to customer facilities, and disruptions to our customers' third-party logistics, warehousing, inventory management, and distribution services may continue to limit our ability to sell products, meet billing milestones, or provide services.
•operations risk-the closure of our facilities, restrictions inhibiting our employees' ability to access those facilities, materials and labor shortages, and disruptions to the ability of our suppliers or service providers to deliver goods or services to us (including as a result of supplier facility closures or access restrictions, disruptions to their supply chains, and supplier liquidity or bankruptcy risk) could further disrupt our ability to provide our services and solutions and result in, among other things, higher costs which may not be recoverable under customer contracts, claims for liquidated damages in the event of delays, terminations of customer contracts and losses of revenue. because the covid-19 pandemic could adversely affect our near-term and long-term revenues, earnings, liquidity, and cash flows, we have taken and may be required to redeploy significant cost actions, including but not limited to reducing discretionary expenses (such as non-essential travel, contractors, and consultants), reducing hiring, canceling annual merit increases, reducing executive and board of director pay, reducing work schedules across the enterprise, shortening or staggering work schedules to match production with demand, and reducing staffing levels, as well as increasing supplier-based productivity and enhancing spending-limit controls. however, the extent to which our mitigation efforts are successful, if at all, is not currently ascertainable; also, our costs may not decrease at the same pace as revenue declines as many of our costs are less variable in nature, and we may not be able to or may not choose to significantly reduce them in an effort to remain focused on long-term outlook and growth opportunities. further, our management of the impact of covid-19 will continue to require significant investment of time from our management and employees, as well as resources across our global enterprise. the focus on managing and mitigating the impacts of covid-19 on our business may cause us to divert or delay the application of our resources toward new initiatives or investments, which may adversely impact our future results of operations. issues relating to the covid-19 pandemic may also result in legal claims or litigation against us. in addition, remote work has increased the frequency of cybersecurity attacks, including phishing, and malware attempts that utilize covid-19-related strategies, increasing the risk of a material cybersecurity incident that could result in the loss of proprietary or personal data, render us more vulnerable to future cybersecurity attacks, disrupt our operations, or otherwise cause us reputational or financial harm.
•liquidity and cash flow risk-because of the customer and operations risks described above, our business may not continue to generate sufficient cash flow from operations in the future to service our debt and make necessary capital expenditures. if we are unable to generate such cash flow, we may need to use existing cash balances to service our debt, and if such balances are insufficient, then we may be required to engage in one or more alternatives, such as selling assets, restructuring of existing debt, issuing new debt, or obtaining additional equity capital on terms that may be onerous or highly dilutive. our ability to refinance our indebtedness will depend on the capital markets and our financial condition at such time.
due to the changing landscape of the covid-19 pandemic and the responses to curb its spread, we cannot predict the ultimate impact the covid-19 pandemic will have on our business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flow. any recovery from the covid-19 pandemic and related economic impact may be slowed or reversed by a variety of factors. in addition, even after the covid-19 pandemic has subsided, we may continue to experience adverse impacts to our business as a result of its global economic impact, including any recession that may occur in the future. further, many of the factors disclosed under risk factors in this form 10-k are, and we anticipate will continue to be further, heightened or exacerbated by the impact of the covid-19 pandemic.
a significant percentage of our sales and operations is in non-u.s. jurisdictions and is subject to the economic, political, regulatory, foreign exchange, and other risks of international operations.
our international operations, including u.s. exports, represent more than half of the company's sales. risks related to international operations include exchange control regulations, wage and price controls, antitrust regulations, employment regulations, foreign investment laws, import, export and other trade restrictions (such as sanctions and embargoes), differing levels of protection of intellectual property, acts of industrial espionage, violations by our employees of anti-corruption laws (despite our efforts to mitigate such risk), changes in regulations regarding transactions with state-owned enterprises, nationalization of private enterprises, acts of terrorism, acts of war, civil strife, and our ability to hire and maintain qualified staff and maintain the safety of our employees in these regions. instability and uncertainties arising from the global geopolitical environment and the evolving international and domestic political, regulatory, and economic landscape, including the potential for changes in global trade policies, including sanctions and trade barriers, and trends such as populism, economic nationalism and negative sentiment toward multinational companies, as well as the cost of compliance with increasingly complex and often conflicting regulations worldwide, can impair our flexibility in modifying product, marketing, pricing or other strategies for growing our businesses, as well as our ability to improve productivity and maintain acceptable operating margins.
risk factors existing free trade laws and regulations provide certain beneficial duties and tariffs for qualifying imports and exports. changes in laws or policies governing the terms of foreign trade, and in particular increased trade restrictions, tariffs or taxes on imports from countries where we manufacture products or from where we import products or raw materials, either directly or through our suppliers, could have an impact on our competitive position and financial results.
the united states continues to implement certain trade actions, including imposing tariffs on certain goods imported from china and other countries, which has resulted in retaliatory tariffs by china and other countries. additional tariffs, export controls and sanctions laws imposed by the united states on a broader range of imports, or further retaliatory trade measures taken by china or other countries in response, could increase the cost of our products. the united states and other countries may implement actions, including trade actions, tariffs, export controls, and sanctions, against other countries or localities, including potentially against certain russian government, government-related, or other entities or individuals related to actions in ukraine, which along with any retaliatory measures could increase costs, adversely affect our operations, or adversely affect our ability to meet contractual and financial obligations.
operating outside of the united states also exposes us to foreign exchange risk, which we monitor and seek to reduce through hedging activities. however, foreign exchange hedging activities bear a financial cost and may not always be available to us or be successful in eliminating such volatility. finally, we generate significant amounts of cash outside of the united states that is invested with financial and non-financial counterparties. while we employ comprehensive controls regarding global cash management to guard against cash or investment loss and to ensure our ability to fund our operations and commitments, a material disruption to the counterparties with whom we transact business could expose honeywell to financial loss.
operating outside the united states also exposes us to additional intellectual property risk. the laws and enforcement practices of certain jurisdictions in which we operate may not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as in the united states and may impose joint venture, technology transfer, local service or other foreign investment requirements, and restrictions that potentially compromise control over our technology and proprietary information. failure of foreign jurisdictions to protect our intellectual property rights, an inability to effectively enforce such rights in foreign jurisdictions, or the imposition of foreign jurisdiction investment or sourcing restrictions or requirements could result in loss of valuable proprietary information and could impact our competitive position and financial results.
risks related to our defined benefit pension plans may adversely impact our results of operations and cash flow.
significant changes in actual investment return on pension assets, discount rates, and other factors could adversely affect our results of operations and require cash pension contributions in future periods. changes in discount rates and actual asset returns different than our anticipated asset returns can result in significant non-cash actuarial gains or losses, which we record in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year, and, if applicable, in any quarter in which an interim re-measurement is triggered. with regard to cash pension contributions, funding requirements for our pension plans are largely dependent upon interest rates, actual investment returns on pension assets and the impact of legislative or regulatory changes related to pension funding obligations.
operational risks raw material price fluctuations, inflation, the ability of key suppliers to meet quality and delivery requirements, or catastrophic events can increase the cost of our products and services, impact our ability to meet commitments to customers and cause us to incur significant liabilities.
the cost of raw materials is a key element in the cost of our products, particularly in performance materials and technologies (copper, fluorspar, tungsten salts, ethylene, aluminum, and molybdenum) and in aerospace (nickel, steel, titanium and other metals). as of december 31, 2021, aerospace and performance materials and technologies had 80% and 63%, respectively, of raw materials supply base under contract. due to supply chain constraints and labor shortages, including as a result of the ongoing covid-19 pandemic, there have been recent inflationary trends in the cost of raw materials, including increases in labor and freight costs, for the transportation of raw materials. our inability to offset material price or labor inflation through increased prices to customers, formula-driven or long-term fixed price contracts with suppliers, productivity actions or commodity hedges could adversely affect our results of operations.
many major components, product equipment items, and raw materials, particularly in aerospace, are procured or subcontracted on a single or sole-source basis. although we maintain a qualification and performance surveillance process and we believe that sources of supply for raw materials and components are generally adequate, it is difficult to predict what effects shortages or price increases, in addition to other supply chain disruptions, may have in the future. our ability to manage inventory and meet delivery requirements may be constrained by our suppliers' inability to scale production and adjust delivery of long-lead time products during times of volatile demand. in addition, current or future global economic uncertainty, including the ongoing covid-19 pandemic, may affect the financial stability of our key suppliers or their access to financing, which may in turn affect their ability to perform their obligations to us. if one or more of our suppliers experiences financial difficulties, delivery delays or other performance problems, our resulting inability to fill our supply needs would jeopardize our ability to fulfill obligations under commercial and government contracts, which could, in turn, result in reduced sales and profits, contract penalties or terminations, and damage to customer relationships.
risk factors
risk factors we may be unable to successfully execute or effectively integrate acquisitions, and divestitures may not occur as planned.
we regularly review our portfolio of businesses and pursue growth through acquisitions and seek to divest non-core businesses. we may not be able to complete transactions on favorable terms, on a timely basis, or at all. in addition, our results of operations and cash flows may be adversely impacted by (i) the failure of acquired businesses to meet or exceed expected returns, including risk of impairment; (ii) the failure to integrate multiple acquired businesses into honeywell simultaneously and on schedule and/or to achieve expected synergies; (iii) the inability to dispose of non-core assets and businesses on satisfactory terms and conditions; and (iv) the discovery of unanticipated liabilities, labor relations difficulties, cybersecurity concerns, compliance issues, or other problems in acquired businesses for which we lack contractual protections, insurance or indemnities, or, with regard to divested businesses, claims by purchasers to whom we have provided contractual indemnification.
our future growth is largely dependent upon our ability to develop new technologies and introduce new products that achieve market acceptance in increasingly competitive markets with acceptable margins.
our future growth rate depends upon a number of factors, including our ability to (i) identify and evolve with emerging technological and broader industry trends in our target end-markets; (ii) develop and maintain competitive products; (iii) defend our market share against an ever-expanding number of competitors, including many new and non-traditional competitors; (iv) enhance our products by adding innovative features that differentiate our products from those of our competitors and prevent commoditization of our products; (v) develop, manufacture, and bring compelling new products to market quickly and cost-effectively; (vi) monitor disruptive technologies and business models; (vii) achieve sufficient return on investment for new products introduced based on capital expenditures and research and development spending; (viii) respond to changes in overall trends related to end-market demand; and (ix) attract, develop, and retain individuals with the requisite technical expertise and understanding of customers' needs to develop new technologies and introduce new products. competitors may also develop after-market services and parts for our products which attract customers and adversely affect our return on investment for new products. the failure of our technologies or products to gain market acceptance due to more attractive offerings by our competitors or the failure to address any of the above factors could significantly reduce our revenues and adversely affect our competitive standing and prospects.
failure to increase productivity through sustainable operational improvements, as well as an inability to successfully execute repositioning projects or to effectively manage our workforce, may reduce our profitability or adversely impact our businesses.
our profitability and margin growth are dependent upon our ability to drive sustainable improvements. we seek productivity and cost savings benefits through repositioning actions and projects, such as consolidation of manufacturing facilities, transitions to cost-competitive regions, and product line rationalizations. risks associated with these actions include delays in execution, additional unexpected costs, realization of fewer than estimated productivity improvements, and adverse effects on employee morale. we may not realize the full operational or financial benefits we expect, the recognition of these benefits may be delayed, and these actions may potentially disrupt our operations. in addition, organizational changes, increased attrition, failure to create and implement a succession plan for key company positions, not retaining key talent, inability to attract new employees with unique skills, trends in rising labor costs and labor availability, labor relations difficulties, or workforce stoppage could have a material adverse effect on our business, reputation, financial position and results of operations.
as a supplier to the u.s. government, we are subject to unique risks, such as the right of the u.s. government to terminate contracts for convenience and to conduct audits and investigations of our operations and performance.
u.s. government contracts are subject to termination by the government, either for the convenience of the government or for our failure to perform consistent with the terms of the applicable contract. our contracts with the u.s. government are also subject to government audits that may recommend downward price adjustments and other changes. when appropriate and prudent, we made adjustments and paid voluntary refunds in the past and may do so in the future.
we are also subject to government investigations of business practices and compliance with government procurement and security regulations. if, as a result of any such investigation or other government investigations (including investigation of violations of certain environmental, employment or export laws), honeywell or one of its businesses were found to have violated applicable law, then it could be suspended from bidding on or receiving awards of new government contracts, suspended from contract performance pending the completion of legal proceedings and/or have its export privileges suspended.
risk factors our operations and the prior operations of predecessor companies expose us to the risk of material environmental liabilities.
mainly because of past operations and operations of predecessor companies, we are subject to potentially material liabilities related to the remediation of environmental hazards and to claims of personal injuries or property damages that may be caused by hazardous substance releases and exposures. we continue to incur remedial response and voluntary clean-up costs for site contamination and are a party to lawsuits and claims associated with environmental and safety matters, including past production of products containing hazardous substances. additional lawsuits, claims and costs involving environmental matters are likely to continue to arise in the future. various federal, state, local and foreign governments regulate the use of certain materials, the discharge of materials into the environment, and/or communications respecting certain materials in our products, and can impose substantial fines and criminal sanctions for violations, and require injunctive relief measures, including installation of costly equipment, implementation of operational changes to limit emissions and/or decrease the likelihood of accidental hazardous substance releases, or limiting access of our products to markets, among others. in addition, changes in laws, regulations and enforcement of policies, the discovery of previously unknown contamination or new technology or information related to individual sites, the establishment of stricter toxicity standards with respect to certain contaminants, or the imposition of new clean-up requirements or remedial techniques could require us to incur additional costs in the future that would have a negative effect on our financial condition or results of operations.
cybersecurity incidents could disrupt business operations, result in the loss of critical and confidential information, and adversely impact our reputation and results of operations.
global cybersecurity threats and incidents can range from uncoordinated individual attempts to gain unauthorized access to information technology (it) systems to sophisticated and targeted measures known as advanced persistent threats, directed at the company, its products, its customers and/or its third party service providers, including cloud providers. our customers, including the u.s. government, are increasingly requiring cybersecurity protections and mandating cybersecurity standards in our products, and we may incur additional costs to comply with such demands. while we have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, these types of threats and incidents, none of them to date have been material to the company. we seek to deploy comprehensive measures to deter, prevent, detect, respond to and mitigate these threats, including identity and access controls, data protection, vulnerability assessments, continuous monitoring of our it networks and systems and maintenance of backup and protective systems. despite these efforts, cybersecurity incidents (against us or parties with whom we contract), depending on their nature and scope, could potentially result in the misappropriation, destruction, corruption or unavailability of critical data and confidential or proprietary information (our own or that of third parties) and the disruption of business operations. the potential consequences of a material cybersecurity incident and its effects include financial loss, reputational damage, litigation with third parties, theft of intellectual property, fines levied by the federal trade commission or other government agencies, diminution in the value of our investment in research, development and engineering, and increased cybersecurity protection and remediation costs due to the increasing sophistication and proliferation of threats, which in turn could adversely affect our competitiveness and results of operations. in addition, cybersecurity laws and regulations continue to evolve, and are increasingly demanding, both in the u.s. and globally, which adds compliance complexity and may increase our costs of compliance and expose us to reputational damage or litigation, monetary damages, regulatory enforcement actions or fines in one or more jurisdictions. while we carry cyber insurance, we cannot be certain that our coverage will be adequate for liabilities actually incurred, that insurance will continue to be available to us on economically reasonable terms, or at all, or that any insurer will not deny coverage as to any future claim.
the development of technology products and services presents security and safety risks.
an increasing number of our products, services, and technologies are delivered with internet of things (iot) capabilities and the accompanying interconnected device networks, which include sensors, data and advanced computing capabilities. we have developed product software designs that we believe are less susceptible to cyber-attacks, but despite these efforts, if our products and services that include iot solutions do not work as intended or are compromised, the possible consequences include financial loss, reputational damage, exposure to legal claims or enforcement actions, theft of intellectual property, and diminution in the value of our investment in research, development and engineering, which in turn could adversely affect our competitiveness and results of operations.
risk factors data privacy, data protection, and information security may require significant resources and present certain risks.
we collect, store, have access to and otherwise process certain confidential or sensitive data, including proprietary business information, personal data or other information that is subject to privacy and security laws, regulations and/or customer-imposed controls. despite our efforts to protect such data, we may be vulnerable to material security breaches, theft, misplaced or lost data, programming errors, or employee errors that could potentially lead to the compromising of such data, improper use of our systems, software solutions or networks, unauthorized access, use, disclosure, modification or destruction of information, defective products, production downtimes and operational disruptions. in addition, we operate in an environment in which there are different and potentially conflicting data privacy laws in effect in the various u.s. states and foreign jurisdictions in which we operate and we must understand and comply with each law and standard in each of these jurisdictions while ensuring the data is secure. for example, european laws require us to have an approved legal mechanism to transfer personal data out of europe; the european union general data protection regulation, which became enforceable in may 2018, superseded prior european union data protection legislation and imposes more stringent requirements in how we collect and process personal data and provides for significantly greater penalties for noncompliance; and several other states and countries have passed or are considering laws that require personal data relating to their residents or citizens to be maintained on local servers and impose additional data transfer restrictions. government enforcement actions can be costly and interrupt the regular operation of our business, and violations of data privacy laws can result in fines, reputational damage and civil lawsuits, any of which may adversely affect our business, reputation and financial statements.
a material disruption of our operations, particularly at our manufacturing facilities or within our information technology infrastructure, could adversely affect our business.
our facilities, supply chains, distribution systems, and information technology systems are subject to catastrophic loss due to natural disasters or other disruptions, including hurricanes and floods, power outages, fires, explosions, terrorism, equipment failures, sabotage, cyber incidents, any potential effects of climate change and adverse weather conditions, labor disputes, critical supply failure, inaccurate downtime forecast, political disruption, public health crises, like a regional or global pandemic, and other reasons, which can result in undesirable consequences, including financial losses and damaged relationships with customers. the ongoing covid-19 pandemic has disrupted and may continue to disrupt our supply chain, distribution channels, production facilities, operations and customer demand, which has negatively impacted our operations and adversely affected our business and could continue to do so. we employ information technology systems and networks to support the business and rely on them to process, transmit and store electronic information, and to manage or support a variety of business processes and activities. disruptions to our information technology infrastructure from system failures, shutdowns, power outages, telecommunication or utility failures, cybersecurity incidents, and other events, including disruptions at our cloud computing, server, systems and other third party it service providers, could interfere with our operations, interrupt production and shipments, damage customer and business partner relationships, and negatively impact our reputation.
concentrations of credit, counterparty and market risk may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.
we maintain long-term contractual relationships with many of our customers, suppliers, and other counterparties. while we monitor the financial health of these counterparties, we are exposed to credit and market risks of such counterparties, including those concentrated in the same or similar industries and geographic regions. changes in economic conditions, including the impact of the covid-19 pandemic, could also lead to concerns about the creditworthiness of counterparties in the same or similar industry or geography, impacting our ability to renew our long-term contractual arrangements or collect amounts due under these arrangements. among other factors, changes in economic conditions could also result in the credit deterioration or insolvency of a significant counterparty.
risk factors we are impacted by increasing stakeholder interest in public company performance, disclosure, and goal-setting with respect to environmental, social, and governance (esg) matters.
in response to growing customer, investor, employee, governmental, and other stakeholder interest in our esg practices, including our procedures, standards, performance metrics, and goals, we have increased reporting of our esg programs and performance and have established and announced goals and other objectives related to esg matters. these goal statements reflect our current plans and aspirations and are not guarantees that we will be able to achieve them. our ability to achieve any goal or objective, including with respect to esg initiatives, is subject to numerous risks, many of which are outside of our control. examples of such risks include: (1) the availability and cost of low- or non-carbon-based energy sources and technologies, (2) evolving regulatory requirements affecting esg standards or disclosures, (3) the availability of suppliers that can meet our sustainability, diversity and other standards, (4) our ability to recruit, develop, and retain diverse talent in our labor markets, and (5) the impact of our organic growth and acquisitions or dispositions of businesses or operations. in addition, standards for tracking and reporting on esg matters have not been harmonized and continue to evolve. our processes and controls for reporting of esg matters may not always comply with evolving and disparate standards for identifying, measuring, and reporting esg metrics, our interpretation of reporting standards may differ from those of others, and such standards may change over time, any of which could result in significant revisions to our performance metrics, goals or reported progress in achieving such goals. in addition, certain of our products and services, including offerings in our defense and space business unit, are unattractive to certain investors and may cause us to be increasingly subject to esg-driven investment practices that preclude investment in our debt and equity.
if our esg practices or business portfolio do not meet evolving investor or other stakeholder expectations and standards, then our reputation, our ability to attract or retain employees and our attractiveness as an investment, supplier, business partner, or acquiror could be negatively impacted. in addition, our failure or perceived failure to pursue or fulfill our goals, targets, and objectives or to satisfy various reporting standards within the timelines we announce, or at all, could have similar negative impacts and expose us to government enforcement actions and private litigation.
legal and regulatory risks our u.s. and non-u.s. tax liabilities are dependent, in part, upon the distribution of income among various jurisdictions in which we operate.
our future results of operations could be adversely affected by changes in the effective tax rate as a result of a change in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in tax laws (e.g., potential tax law changes in the united states to increase the u.s. corporate tax rate), regulations and judicial rulings (or changes in the interpretation thereof), potential taxation of digital services, changes in generally accepted accounting principles, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, changes in the amount of earnings permanently reinvested offshore, the results of audits and examinations of previously filed tax returns and continuing assessments of our tax exposures, and various other governmental enforcement initiatives. our tax expense includes estimates of tax reserves and reflects other estimates and assumptions, including assessments of future earnings of the company, which could impact the valuation of our deferred tax assets.
changes in legislation or government regulations or policies can have a significant impact on our results of operations.
the sales and margins of each of our segments are directly impacted by government regulations, including environmental, safety, performance, and product certification regulations. within aerospace, the operating results of commercial original equipment and commercial aftermarket may be impacted by, among other things, mandates of the federal aviation administration and other similar international regulatory bodies requiring the installation of equipment on aircraft. our defense and space business unit may be affected by changes in government procurement regulations. within honeywell building technologies and safety and productivity solutions, the demand for and cost of providing products, services and solutions can be impacted by fire, security, safety, health care, environmental, and energy efficiency standards and regulations. performance materials and technologies' results of operations can be impacted by environmental standards, regulations, and judicial determinations. growth in all our businesses within emerging markets may be adversely impacted by the inability to acquire and retain qualified employees where local employment law mandates may be restrictive. changes in such regulations and government policies could negatively impact us; for instance, noncompliance with legislation and regulations can result in fines and penalties, and compliance with any new regulations or policies may be burdensome and/or require significant expenditures.
increased public awareness and concern regarding global climate change and other esg matters may result in more international, regional and/or federal regulatory or other stakeholder requirements or expectations that could mandate more restrictive or expansive standards, such as stricter limits on greenhouse gas emissions or more prescriptive reporting of environmental, social, and governance metrics, practices and targets, than the voluntary commitments that the company has adopted or require such changes on a more accelerated time frame. there continues to be a lack of consistent climate legislation, which creates economic and regulatory uncertainty; however, there has been an increasing amount of legislative and regulatory activity, particularly in the european union, united kingdom, and u.s. if environmental laws or regulations are either changed or adopted and impose significant operational restrictions and compliance requirements upon the company or its products, they could negatively impact the company's business, capital expenditures, results of operations, financial condition and competitive position.
risk factors we cannot predict with certainty the outcome of litigation matters, government proceedings and other contingencies and uncertainties.
we are subject to a number of lawsuits, investigations, and disputes (some of which involve substantial amounts claimed) arising out of the conduct of our business, including matters relating to commercial transactions, government contracts, product liability (including asbestos), prior acquisitions and divestitures, employment, employee benefits plans, intellectual property, antitrust, anti-corruption, accounting, import and export, and environmental, health and safety matters. our potential liabilities are subject to change over time due to new developments, changes in settlement strategy or the impact of evidentiary requirements, and we may become subject to or be required to pay damage awards or settlements that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. while we maintain insurance for certain risks, the amount of our insurance coverage may not be adequate to cover the total amount of all insured claims and liabilities. the incurrence of significant liabilities for which there is no or insufficient insurance coverage could adversely affect our results of operations, cash flows, liquidity and financial condition.
vaccine mandates applicable to us, including the u.s. presidential executive order concerning mandatory covid-19 vaccination of u.s.-based employees of companies that work on or in support of federal contracts could have a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations.
on september 9, 2021, president biden issued an executive order for u.s. government contractors to mandate vaccination against covid-19. the executive order covers u.s.-based employees at work locations that directly work on or in support of contracts with the u.s. government. on december 7, 2021, the u.s. district court for the southern district of georgia imposed a nationwide injunction of the executive order, temporarily staying all requirements in the executive order. the district court's order was appealed to the eleventh circuit court of appeals, which declined to lift the injunction. it is expected that the u.s. government will appeal the stay to the united states supreme court. we implemented a vaccine mandate requiring all u.s.-based employees at work locations that work on or in support of contracts with the u.s. government to receive their first vaccine dose, or a medical or religious exemption, by january 4, 2022. employees who did not satisfy these requirements, which represented less than 1% of eligible employees, were placed on unpaid leave effective january 10, 2022, and were terminated if they had not taken steps to comply by january 28, 2022. the company has adopted a vaccine mandate for all u.s.-based prospective and future employees.
in addition, on september 9, 2021, president biden announced that he directed the osha to develop an ets mandating either the full vaccination or weekly testing of employees for employers with 100 or more employees. the osha ets was published in the federal register on november 5, 2021, and mandates that employees of employers with 100 or more employees either become fully vaccinated by receiving the final dose of an approved covid-19 vaccine on or before january 4, 2022, or undergo weekly testing. on january 13, 2022, the u.s. supreme court re-imposed a stay of the ets and returned the case to the sixth circuit court of appeals. the majority of the supreme court held that the challengers to the ets were likely to prevail on the merits because osha exceeded its statutory authority. while the supreme court's ruling enjoined osha from imposing its mandate, the ruling has no impact on the ability of private employers to impose their own vaccine mandate. on january 25, 2022, osha announced it was withdrawing the ets as a result of the u.s. supreme court ruling. however, honeywell has implemented a vaccine mandate for its u.s. employees who were not subject to the executive order described in the above paragraph.
additional vaccine mandates, or the requirement for employees to receive vaccine booster doses, may be announced in other jurisdictions in which our businesses operate. our implementation of existing or additional vaccine mandates may result in attrition, including attrition of critically skilled labor, and difficulty securing future labor needs, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risks information relating to market risks is included within liquidity and capital resources of our form 10-k under the caption "financial instruments".
liquidity and capital resources
we continue to manage our businesses to maximize operating cash flows as the primary source of liquidity. each of our businesses is focused on increasing operating cash flows through revenue growth, margin expansion, and improved working capital turnover. additional sources of liquidity include committed credit lines, short-term debt from the commercial paper market, long-term borrowings, access to the public debt and equity markets, u.s. cash balances, and the ability to access non-u.s. cash balances.
cash we monitor the third-party depository institutions that hold our cash and cash equivalents on a daily basis. our emphasis is primarily safety of principal and secondarily maximizing yield of those funds. we diversify our cash and cash equivalents among counterparties to minimize exposure to any one of these entities. as of december 31, 2021 and 2020, we held $11.5 billion and $15.2 billion, respectively, of cash and cash equivalents, including our short-term investments.
borrowings consolidated total borrowings were $19.6 billion and $22.4 billion as of december 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.
a source of liquidity is our ability to access the commercial paper market. commercial paper notes are sold at a discount or premium and have a maturity of not more than 365 days from date of issuance. borrowings under the commercial paper program are available for general corporate purposes as well as for financing acquisitions. the weighted average interest rate on commercial paper and other short-term borrowings outstanding were 0.07% and 0.27% as of december 31, 2021 and 2020.
•a $1.5 billion 364-day credit agreement (the 364-day credit agreement) with a syndicate of banks, dated march 31, 2021, and amended on november 18, 2021. this 364-day credit agreement is maintained for general corporate purposes. the 364-day credit agreement replaced the 364-day credit agreement dated as of april 10, 2020, which was terminated on march 31, 2021. as of december 31, 2021, there were no outstanding borrowings under our 364-day credit agreement.
•a $4.0 billion five year credit agreement (the 5-year credit agreement) with a syndicate of banks, dated march 31, 2021, and amended on november 18, 2021. this 5-year credit agreement is maintained for general corporate purposes. commitments under the 5-year credit agreement can be increased pursuant to the terms of the 5-year credit agreement to an aggregate amount not to exceed $4.5 billion. the 5-year credit agreement amended and restated the previously reported $4.0 billion amended and restated five-year credit agreement dated as of april 26, 2019. as of december 31, 2021, there were no outstanding borrowings under our 5-year credit agreement.
we also have a current shelf registration statement filed with the sec under which we may issue additional debt securities, common stock, and preferred stock that may be offered in one or more offerings on terms to be determined at the time of the offering. we anticipate that net proceeds of any offering would be used for general corporate purposes, including repayment of existing indebtedness, share repurchases, capital expenditures and acquisitions.
liquidity and capital resources credit ratings our ability to access the global debt capital markets and the related cost of these borrowings, is affected by the strength of our credit rating and market conditions. our credit ratings are periodically reviewed by the major independent debt-rating agencies. as of december 31, 2021, s&p global inc. (s&p), fitch ratings inc. (fitch), and moody's investor service (moody's) have ratings on our debt set forth in the table below:
cash flow summary our cash flows from operating, investing, and financing activities, as reflected in the consolidated statement of cash flows, are summarized as follows:
operating activities                                                         $6,038                      $6,208                      $6,897
effect of exchange rate changes on cash                                        (39)                          68                          16
cash provided by operating activities decreased primarily due to an unfavorable impact to working capital, partially offset by the increase in net income attributable to honeywell during 2021, which excludes the 2020 non-cash charges associated with the reduction in value of the reimbursement receivables due from garrett motion inc. (garrett).
cash used for investing activities increased by $74 million primarily due to a $1,065 million increase in cash paid for acquisitions, net of cash acquired, and $120 million net increase in investments, partially offset by $586 million cash receipts from garrett, $341 million increase in cash receipts from settlements of derivative contracts, and $203 million in proceeds from the sale of the retail footwear business.
cash used for financing activities increased by $8,173 million primarily due to a $7,608 million decrease in proceeds from the issuance of long-term debt and a $609 million increase in repayments of long-term debt, partially offset by a decrease in repurchases of common stock of $334 million.
liquidity and capital resources cash requirements and assessment of current liquidity in addition to our normal operating cash requirements, our principal future cash requirements will be to fund capital expenditures, share repurchases, dividends, strategic acquisitions, and debt repayments. specifically, we expect our primary cash requirements in 2022 to be as follows:
•capital expenditures-we expect to spend approximately $1.2 billion for capital expenditures in 2022 primarily for growth, production and capacity expansion, implementation of cost reduction measures, maintenance, and replacement.
•share repurchases-under our share repurchase program, $7.1 billion was available as of december 31, 2021 for additional share repurchases. we expect to repurchase outstanding shares from time to time to offset the dilutive impact of employee stock-based compensation plans, including option exercises, restricted unit vesting and matching contributions under our savings plans. additionally, we will seek to reduce share count via share repurchases as and when attractive opportunities arise. the amount and timing of future repurchases may vary depending on market conditions and our level of operating, financing and other investing activities.
•dividends-we increased our quarterly dividend rate by 5% to $0.98 per share of common stock effective with the fourth quarter 2021 dividend. we intend to continue to pay quarterly dividends in 2022.
we continue to identify opportunities to improve our liquidity and working capital efficiency, which includes the extension of payment terms with our suppliers. in addition, multiple third-party financial institutions offer a voluntary supply chain financing (scf) program which enables our suppliers, at their sole discretion, to sell their receivables from the company to these financial institutions on terms that are negotiated between the supplier and the respective financial institution. we agree on commercial terms for the goods and services we procure from our suppliers, including prices, quantities and payment terms, regardless of whether the supplier elects to participate in the scf program. our suppliers' voluntary participation in the scf program has no bearing on our payment terms and we have no economic interest in a supplier's decision to participate in the scf program.
amounts due to our suppliers that elected to participate in the scf programs are included in accounts payable on the consolidated balance sheet. at december 31, 2021, accounts payable included approximately $700 million payable to suppliers who have elected to participate in the scf program. amounts settled with third-party financial institutions through the scf program increased approximately $300 million for the year ended december 31, 2021. the increase for the year ended december 31, 2021, reflects a combination of an extension of payment terms with suppliers and increased utilization of our scf program. all activity related to amounts due to suppliers that elected to participate in the scf program is reflected in cash flows from operating activities in our consolidated statement of cash flows. while access to scf could decrease if our credit ratings are downgraded, we do not believe that changes in the availability of scf will have a significant impact on our liquidity. the impact of this program is not material to our overall liquidity.
we sell trade receivables to unaffiliated financial institutions without recourse. transfers of the receivables are accounted for as sales and, accordingly, receivables sold are excluded from accounts receivable-net on the consolidated balance sheet and are reflected in cash flows from operating activities on the consolidated statement of cash flows. the difference between the carrying amount of the trade receivables sold and the cash received is recorded in cost of products and services sold on the consolidated statement of operations.
finally, we continue to assess the relative strength of each business in our portfolio as to strategic fit, market position, profit and cash flow contribution in order to identify target investment and acquisition opportunities in order to upgrade our combined portfolio. we identify acquisition candidates that will further our strategic plan and strengthen our existing core businesses. we also identify businesses that do not fit into our long-term strategic plan based on their market position, relative profitability or growth potential. these businesses are considered for potential divestiture, restructuring, or other repositioning actions, subject to regulatory constraints.
based on past performance and current expectations, we believe that our operating cash flows will be sufficient to meet our future operating cash needs. our available cash, committed credit lines and access to the public debt and equity markets provide additional sources of short-term and long-term liquidity to fund current operations, debt maturities, and future investment opportunities.

asbestos matters payments, net of insurance recoveries, related to known asbestos matters were $240 million, $229 million and $163 million for the years ended december 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively, and are estimated to be approximately $220 million in 2022. we expect to make payment associated with these asbestos matters from operating cash flows. the timing of these payments depends on several factors, including the timing of litigation and settlements of liability claims.
environmental matters accruals during the year for environmental matters deemed probable and reasonably estimable were $168 million, $173 million and $213 million for the years ended december 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. in addition, for the years ended december 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, we incurred operating costs for ongoing businesses of approximately $88 million, $88 million and $99 million, respectively, relating to compliance with environmental regulations.
payments related to known environmental matters were $210 million, $216 million and $256 million for the years ended december 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively, and are estimated to be approximately $225 million in 2022. we expect to make payment associated with these environmental matters from operating cash flows. the timing of these payments depends on several factors, including the timing of litigation and settlements of remediation liability, personal injury and property damage claims, regulatory approval of cleanup projects, execution timeframe of projects, remedial techniques to be utilized and agreement with other parties.
reimbursements from resideo for payments related to environmental matters at certain sites, as defined in the indemnification and reimbursement agreement, were $140 million in 2021 and are expected to be $140 million in 2022.

critical accounting estimates the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles is based on the selection and application of accounting policies that require us to make significant estimates and assumptions about the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain. many estimates and assumptions involved in the application of accounting principles have a material impact on reported financial condition and operating performance and on the comparability of such reported information over different reporting periods. critical accounting estimates or assumptions are those where the nature of the estimates or assumptions is material due to the levels of subjectivity and judgment necessary to account for highly uncertain matters or the susceptibility of such matters to change, and the impact of the estimates and assumptions on financial condition or operating performance is material. we consider the estimates and assumptions discussed below to be critical to the understanding of our financial statements. actual results could differ from our estimates and assumptions, and any such differences could be material to our consolidated financial statements.
sales recognition on long-term contracts-we recognize sales for long-term contracts with performance obligations satisfied over time using either an input or output method. we recognize revenue over time as we perform on these contracts based on the continuous transfer of control to the customer. with control transferring over time, revenue is recognized based on the extent of progress towards completion of the performance obligation. we generally use the cost-to-cost input method of progress for our contracts because it best depicts the transfer of control to the customer that occurs as we incur costs. under the cost-to-cost input method, the extent of progress towards completion is measured based on the proportion of costs incurred to date to the total estimated costs at completion of the performance obligation. due to the nature of the work required to be performed on many of our performance obligations, the estimation of total revenue and cost at completion requires judgment. contract revenues are largely determined by negotiated contract prices and quantities, modified by our assumptions regarding contract options, change orders, incentive and award provisions associated with technical performance and price adjustment clauses (such as inflation or index-based clauses). cost estimates are largely based on negotiated or estimated purchase contract terms, historical performance trends and other economic projections. significant factors that influence these estimates include inflationary trends, technical and schedule risk, internal and subcontractor performance trends, business volume assumptions, asset utilization, and anticipated labor agreements. revenue and cost estimates are regularly monitored and revised based on changes in circumstances. impacts from changes in estimates of net sales and cost of sales are recognized on a cumulative catch-up basis, which recognizes in the current period the cumulative effect of the changes on current and prior periods based on a performance obligation's percentage of completion. anticipated losses on long-term contracts are recognized when such losses become evident. we maintain financial controls over the customer qualification, contract pricing and estimation processes to reduce the risk of contract losses.
income taxes-on a recurring basis, we assess the need for a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets by considering all available positive and negative evidence, such as past operating results, projections of future taxable income, enacted tax law changes and the feasibility and impact of tax planning initiatives. our projections of future taxable income include a number of estimates and assumptions regarding our volume, pricing and costs, as well as the timing and amount of reversals of taxable temporary differences.
we recognize tax benefits from uncertain tax positions only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, including resolution of any related appeals and litigation. we assess our income tax positions based upon our evaluation of the facts, circumstances and information available at the reporting date. the tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such positions are then measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information. for those income tax positions where it is not more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained, no tax benefit has been recognized in the financial statements.
for further discussion of additional income tax policies, see note 1 summary of significant accounting policies of notes to consolidated financial statements.
critical accounting estimates goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets impairment testing-goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives are not amortized, but are subject to annual, or more frequent if necessary, impairment testing. in testing goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, the fair value is estimated utilizing a discounted cash flow approach utilizing cash flow forecasts, including strategic and annual operating plans, adjusted for terminal value assumptions. these impairment tests involve the use of accounting estimates and assumptions, changes in which could materially impact our financial condition or operating performance if actual results differ from such estimates and assumptions. to address this uncertainty, we perform sensitivity analyses on key estimates and assumptions. once the fair value is determined, if the carrying amount exceeds the fair value, it is impaired. any impairment is measured as the difference between the carrying amount and its fair value.
finite-lived intangible assets-the determination of useful lives (for depreciation/amortization purposes) and whether or not intangible assets are impaired involves the use of accounting estimates and assumptions, changes in which could materially impact our financial condition or operating performance if actual results differ from such estimates and assumptions. we evaluate the recoverability of the carrying amount of our finite-lived intangible assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of a finite-lived intangible asset group may not be fully recoverable. the principal factors in considering when to perform an impairment review are as follows:
•significant under-performance (i.e., declines in sales, earnings or cash flows) of a business or product line in relation to expectations;
•annual operating plans or strategic plan outlook that indicate an unfavorable trend in operating performance of a business or product line;
•significant negative industry or economic trends; or
•significant changes or planned changes in our use of the assets.
once it is determined that an impairment review is necessary, recoverability of assets is measured by comparing the carrying amount of the asset grouping to the estimated future undiscounted cash flows. if the carrying amount exceeds the estimated future undiscounted cash flows, the asset grouping is considered to be impaired. the impairment is then measured as the difference between the carrying amount of the asset grouping and its fair value. we endeavor to utilize the best information available to measure fair value, which is usually either market prices (if available), level 1 or level 2 of the fair value hierarchy, or an estimate of the future discounted cash flow, level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. the key estimates in our discounted cash flow analysis include assumptions as to expected industry and business growth rates, sales volume, selling prices and costs, cash flows, and the discount rate selected. these estimates are subject to changes in the economic environment, including market interest rates and expected volatility. management believes the estimates of future cash flows and fair values are reasonable; however, changes in estimates due to variance from assumptions could materially affect the valuations.
defined benefit pension plans-we sponsor both funded and unfunded u.s. and non-u.s. defined benefit pension plans. for financial reporting purposes, net periodic pension (income) expense is calculated annually based upon various actuarial assumptions, including a discount rate for plan obligations and an expected long-term rate of return on plan assets. changes in the discount rate and expected long-term rate of return on plan assets could materially affect the annual pension (income) expense amount. annual pension (income) expense is comprised of service and interest cost, assumed return on plan assets, prior service amortization (pension ongoing (income) expense) and a potential mark-to-market adjustment (mtm adjustment).
projected benefit obligation                                                2.50   %                3.22   %                4.35   %

actual rate of return                                                       6.84   %               13.81   %               21.20   %

the mtm adjustment represents the recognition of net actuarial gains or losses in excess of 10% of the greater of the fair value of plan assets or the plans' projected benefit obligation (the corridor). net actuarial gains and losses occur when the actual experience differs from any of the various assumptions used to value our pension plans or when assumptions change. the primary factors contributing to actuarial gains and losses are changes in the discount rate used to value pension obligations as of the measurement date each year and the difference between expected and actual returns on plan assets. the mark-to-market accounting method results in the potential for volatile and difficult to forecast mtm adjustments. mtm adjustments were expenses of $40 million, $44 million and $123 million for the years ended december 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.
critical accounting estimates we determine the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets utilizing historical plan asset returns over varying long-term periods combined with our expectations of future market conditions and asset mix considerations (see note 20 pension and other postretirement benefits of notes to consolidated financial statements for details on the actual various asset classes and targeted asset allocation percentages for our pension plans). we plan to use an expected rate of return on plan assets of 6.40% for 2022, which is an increase in the assumption used for 2021.
the discount rate reflects the market rate on december 31 (measurement date) for high-quality fixed-income investments with maturities corresponding to our benefit obligations and is subject to change each year. the discount rate can be volatile from year to year as it is determined based upon prevailing interest rates as of the measurement date. we used a 2.87% discount rate to determine benefit obligations as of december 31, 2021, reflecting an increase in the market interest rate environment since the prior year-end.
in addition to the potential for mtm adjustments, changes in our expected rate of return on plan assets and discount rate resulting from economic events also affects future pension ongoing (income) expense. the following table highlights the sensitivity of our u.s. pension obligations and ongoing (income) expense to changes in these assumptions, assuming all other assumptions remain constant. these estimates exclude any potential mtm adjustment:

0.25 percentage point decrease in expected rate of return on assets                              increase $50 million                      -
0.25 percentage point increase in expected rate of return on assets                              decrease $50 million                      -
pension ongoing income for our world-wide pension plans is expected to be approximately $1,008 million in 2022 compared with pension ongoing income of $1,083 million in 2021. the expected decrease in pension income is primarily due to lower expected return on plan assets caused by a change in allocation of uk plan assets and higher interest costs caused by increased discount rates in our u.s. and uk plans. also, if required, a mtm adjustment will be recorded in the fourth quarter of 2022 in accordance with our pension accounting method as previously described. it is difficult to reliably forecast or predict whether there will be a mtm adjustment in 2022, and if one is required, what the magnitude of such adjustment will be. mtm adjustments are primarily driven by events and circumstances beyond the control of the company such as changes in interest rates and the performance of the financial markets.
asbestos related liabilities and insurance recoveries-in connection with the recognition of liabilities for asbestos related matters, we record asbestos related insurance recoveries that are deemed probable. in assessing the probability of insurance recovery, we make judgments concerning insurance coverage that we believe are reasonable and consistent with our historical dealings and our knowledge of any pertinent solvency issues surrounding insurers. while the substantial majority of our insurance carriers are solvent, some of our individual carriers are insolvent, which has been considered in our analysis of probable recoveries. projecting future events is subject to various uncertainties that could cause the insurance recovery on asbestos related liabilities to be higher or lower than that projected and recorded. given the inherent uncertainty in making future projections, we reevaluate our projections concerning our probable insurance recoveries considering any changes to the projected liability, our recovery experience or other relevant factors that may impact future insurance recoveries.
our involvement in asbestos related personal injury actions relates to two predecessor companies. regarding north american refractories company (narco) asbestos related claims, we estimate our narco asbestos liability for the resolution of asserted narco-related asbestos claims which qualify for payment under the narco trust distribution procedures (annual contribution claims) and for amounts owed pursuant to settlement agreements reached during the pendency of the narco bankruptcy proceedings that provide for the right to submit claims to the narco trust subject to qualification under the terms of the settlement agreements and trust distribution procedures (pre-established unliquidated claims) using average payment values for the relevant historical period. we estimate our narco asbestos liability for unasserted claims based on historic and anticipated claims filing experience and payment rates, disease classifications and type of claim, and average payment values by the narco trust for the relevant historical period. our estimate also includes all years of epidemiological disease projection through 2059. regarding bendix friction materials (bendix) asbestos related claims, we accrued for the estimated value of pending claims using average resolution values for the previous five years. we also accrued for the estimated value of future claims related to bendix over the full term of epidemiological disease projection through 2059 based on historic and anticipated claims filing experience and dismissal rates, disease classifications, and average resolution values in the tort system for the previous five years. we update our assumptions on average payment values and average resolution values in the fourth quarter of each year.
see note 19 commitments and contingencies of notes to consolidated financial statements for a discussion of management's judgments applied in the recognition and measurement of our asbestos related liabilities and related insurance recoveries.
critical accounting estimates contingent liabilities-we are subject to a number of lawsuits, investigations and claims (some of which involve substantial dollar amounts) that arise out of the conduct of our global business operations or those of previously owned entities, including matters relating to commercial transactions, government contracts, product liability (including asbestos), prior acquisitions and divestitures, employee benefit plans, intellectual property, legal and environmental, health and safety matters. we continually assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to our contingencies, as well as potential amounts or ranges of probable losses, and recognize a liability, if any, for these contingencies based on a thorough analysis of each matter with the assistance of outside legal counsel and, if applicable, other experts. such analysis includes making judgments concerning matters such as the costs associated with environmental matters, the outcome of negotiations, the number and cost of pending and future asbestos claims, and the impact of evidentiary requirements. because most contingencies are resolved over long periods of time, liabilities may change in the future due to new developments (including new discovery of facts, changes in legislation and outcomes of similar cases through the judicial system), changes in assumptions or changes in our settlement strategy. see note 19 commitments and contingencies of notes to consolidated financial statements for a discussion of management's judgment applied in the recognition and measurement of our environmental and asbestos liabilities which represent our most significant contingencies.

we purchased 4,256,144 shares of our common stock, par value $1 per share, in the quarter ended december 31, 2021. on february 12, 2021, the board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to a total of $10 billion of honeywell common stock, which included amounts remaining under, and replaced, the previously approved share repurchase program. as of december 31, 2021, $7.1 billion remained available for additional share repurchases. we expect to repurchase outstanding shares from time to time to generally offset the dilutive impact of employee stock-based compensation plans, including option exercises, restricted unit vesting and matching contributions under our savings plans. additionally, we seek to reduce share count via share repurchases as and when attractive opportunities arise. the amount and timing of future repurchases may vary depending on market conditions and the level of our operating, financing and other investing activities.
the following table summarizes our purchases of honeywell's common stock for the three months ended december 31, 2021:

market for registrant's common equity, related stockholder matters and issuer purchases of equity securities performance graph the following graph compares the five-year cumulative total return on our common stock to the total returns on the s&p 500 stock index, composite of s&p's industrial conglomerates and aerospace and defense indices, on a 55%/45% weighted basis (the composite index) and nasdaq industrial select sector (xli index). the weighting of the components of the composite index are based on our segments' relative contribution to total segment profit. the selection of the industrial conglomerates component of the composite index reflects the diverse and distinct range of non-aerospace businesses conducted by honeywell. the annual changes for the five-year period shown in the graph are based on the assumption that $100 was invested in honeywell stock and each index on december 31, 2016 and that all dividends were reinvested.

notes to consolidated financial statements
note 1 . summary of significant accounting policies accounting principles the financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america. the following is a description of honeywell's significant accounting policies.
principles of consolidation the consolidated financial statements include the accounts of honeywell international inc. and all of its subsidiaries and entities in which a controlling interest is maintained. the company's consolidation policy requires equity investments that the company exercises significant influence over but do not control the investee and are not the primary beneficiary of the investee's activities to be accounted for using the equity method. investments through which the company is not able to exercise significant influence over the investee and which the company does not have readily determinable fair values are accounted for under the cost method. all intercompany transactions and balances are eliminated in consolidation.
recent accounting pronouncements the company considers the applicability and impact of all accounting standards updates (asus) issued by the financial accounting standards board (fasb). asus not listed below were assessed and determined to be either not applicable or are expected to have minimal impact on the company's consolidated statement of operations, balance sheet and cash flows (consolidated financial statements).
in december 2019, the fasb issued asu 2019-12, simplifying the accounting for income taxes. the standard's amendments include changes in various subtopics of accounting for income taxes including, but not limited to, accounting for "hybrid" tax regimes, tax basis step-up in goodwill obtained in a transaction that is not a business combination, intraperiod tax allocation exception to incremental approach, ownership changes in investments, interim-period accounting for enacted changes in tax law, and year-to-date loss limitation in interim-period tax accounting. effective january 1, 2021, the company adopted this standard. the adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on the company's consolidated financial statements.
in march 2020, the fasb issued asu 2020-04, reference rate reform (topic 848): facilitation of the effects of reference rate reform on financial reporting, which provides optional expedients and exceptions for applying generally accepted accounted principles to contracts, hedging relationships, and other transactions affected by the transition away from reference rates expected to be discontinued to alternative reference rates. in january 2021, the fasb issued asu 2021-01, reference rate reform (topic 848): scope, to expand the scope of this guidance to include derivatives. the guidance was effective upon issuance and may be applied prospectively to contract modifications made and hedging relationships entered into on or before december 31, 2022. the company will apply the guidance to impacted transactions during the transition period. the company does not expect the adoption of this standard to have a material impact on the company's consolidated financial statements.
in october 2021, the fasb issued asu 2021-08, business combinations (topic 805) - accounting for contract assets and contract liabilities from contracts with customers, which requires contract assets and contract liabilities acquired in a business combination to be recognized and measured by the acquirer on the acquisition date in accordance with asc 606, revenue from contracts with customers. this asu should be applied prospectively to acquisitions occurring on or after the effective date of december 15, 2022, and early adoption is permitted. the company is currently evaluating the impacts of this guidance on the company's consolidated financial statements. the company does not expect the adoption of this standard to have a material impact on the company's consolidated financial statements.

research and development research and development costs for projects are expensed as incurred, unless these costs relate to contracts with customers where the company receives reimbursements. amounts expensed as incurred for company-sponsored research and development projects are included in cost of products and services sold and were $1,333 million, $1,334 million and $1,556 million for the years ended december 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. costs related to contracts with customers for customer-sponsored research and development projects are included as a contract cost and included in cost of products and services sold when revenue from such contracts is recognized, consistent with the company's sales recognition policies. this revenue was $1,284 million, $1,200 million and $1,079 million for the years ended december 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.
cash and cash equivalents cash and cash equivalents include cash on hand and highly liquid investments having an original maturity of three months or less.
inventories inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value, with cost determined on a first-in, first-out (fifo) basis. carrying value adjustments for inventory obsolescence is equal to the difference between the cost and net realizable value. net realizable value is the estimate selling price in the ordinary course of business, less reasonably predictable costs of completion, disposal, and transportation.
property, plant and equipment property, plant and equipment are recorded at cost, including any asset retirement obligations, less accumulated depreciation. for financial reporting, the straight-line method of depreciation is used over the estimated useful lives of 10 to 50 years for buildings and improvements and 3 to 16 years for machinery and equipment. recognition of the fair value of obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long-lived assets is required when there is a legal obligation to incur such costs. upon initial recognition of a liability, the cost is capitalized as part of the related long-lived asset and depreciated over the corresponding asset's useful life.
goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are subject to impairment testing annually as of march 31, or if a triggering event occurs or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be fully recoverable. this testing compares carrying values to fair values and, when appropriate, the carrying value of these assets is reduced to fair value. the company completed its annual goodwill impairment test as of march 31, 2021, and determined that there was no impairment as of that date. the company is not aware of any additional triggering events.
finite-lived intangible assets other intangible assets with determinable lives consist of customer lists, technology, patents and trademarks and other intangibles and are amortized over their estimated useful lives, ranging from 2 to 22 years.
foreign currency translation assets and liabilities of subsidiaries operating outside the united states with a functional currency other than u.s. dollars are translated into u.s. dollars using year-end exchange rates. sales, costs and expenses are translated at the average exchange rates in effect during the year. foreign currency translation gains and losses are included as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). for subsidiaries operating in highly inflationary environments, inventories and property, plant and equipment, including related expenses, are remeasured at the exchange rate in effect on the date the assets were acquired, while monetary assets and liabilities are remeasured at year-end exchange rates. remeasurement adjustments for these subsidiaries are included in earnings.

derivative financial instruments all derivative financial instruments are recorded on the balance sheet as assets or liabilities and measured at fair value. for derivatives designated as hedges of the fair value of assets or liabilities, the changes in fair values of both the derivatives and the hedged items are recorded in current earnings. for derivatives designated as cash flow hedges, the changes in fair value of the derivatives are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) and subsequently recognized in earnings when the hedged items impact earnings.
derivative financial instruments designated as hedges must be designated and effective as a hedge of the identified risk exposure at the inception of the contract. changes in fair value of the derivative contract must be highly correlated with changes in fair value of the underlying hedged item at inception and over the life of the hedge contract. cash flows of such derivative financial instruments are classified consistent with the underlying hedged item. the company elected to exclude the time value of the derivatives (i.e., the forward points) from the assessment of hedge effectiveness and recognize the initial value of the excluded component in earnings using the amortization approach. for derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as a net investment hedge, the gain or loss is reported as a component of other comprehensive income (loss) and recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). the gain or loss will be subsequently reclassified into net earnings when the hedged net investment is either sold or substantially liquidated.
leases at the inception of a contract, the company assesses whether the contract is, or contains, a lease. the assessment is based on (1) whether the contract involves the use of a distinct identified asset, (2) whether the company obtains the right to substantially all the economic benefit from the use of the asset throughout the period, and (3) whether the company has the right to direct the use of the asset.
all significant lease arrangements are generally recognized at lease commencement. operating lease right-of-use (rou) assets and lease liabilities are recognized at commencement. an rou asset and corresponding lease liability are not recorded for leases with an initial term of 12 months or less (short-term leases), and we recognize lease expense for these leases as incurred over the lease term.
rou assets represent the company's right to use an underlying asset during the reasonably certain lease term, and lease liabilities represent the obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. the company's lease terms may include options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that the company will exercise that option.
operating lease rou assets and liabilities are recognized at commencement date based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. lease payments may be fixed or variable, however, only fixed payments or in-substance fixed payments are included in determining the lease liability. variable lease payments are recognized in operating expenses in the period in which the obligation for those payments are incurred. the operating lease rou asset also includes any lease payments related to initial direct cost and prepayments and excludes lease incentives. lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. the company has lease agreements with lease and non-lease components, which are generally accounted for separately.
the company primarily uses its incremental borrowing rate, which is based on the information available at the lease commencement date, in determining the present value of the lease payments. in determining the borrowing rate, the company considers the lease term, secured incremental borrowing rate, and for leases denominated in a currency different than u.s. dollar, the collateralized borrowing rate in the foreign currency using the u.s. dollar and foreign currency swap spread, when available.
pension benefits the company presents net periodic pensions costs by disaggregating the service cost component of such costs and reports those costs in the same line item or items in the consolidated statement of operations as other compensation costs arising from services rendered by the pertinent employees during the period. the other non-service components of such costs are required to be presented separately from the service cost component.
the company records the service cost component of pension ongoing (income) expense in costs of products and services sold and selling, general and administrative expenses. the remaining components of costs within pension ongoing (income) expense, primarily interest costs and assumed return on plan assets, are recorded in other (income) expense. the company recognizes net actuarial gains or losses in excess of 10% of the greater of the fair value of plan assets or the plan's projected benefit obligation (the corridor) annually in the fourth quarter each year (mtm adjustment). the mtm adjustment is also reported in other (income) expense. see note 22 segment financial data for a definition of pension ongoing (income) expense.

sales recognition product and service sales are recognized when or as the company transfers control of the promised products or services to its customers. revenue is measured as the amount of consideration the company expects to receive in exchange for transferring goods or providing services. service sales, principally representing repair, maintenance and engineering activities, are recognized over the contractual period or as services are rendered. sales under long-term contracts with performance obligations satisfied over time are recognized using either an input or output method. the company recognizes revenue over time as the company performs on these contracts because of the continuous transfer of control to the customer. with control transferring over time, revenue is recognized based on the extent of progress towards completion of the performance obligation. the company generally uses the cost-to-cost input method of progress for contracts because it best depicts the transfer of control to the customer that occurs as the company incurs costs. under the cost-to-cost input method, the extent of progress towards completion is measured based on the proportion of costs incurred to date to the total estimated costs at completion of the performance obligation. the company reviews its cost estimates on significant contracts on a periodic basis, or when circumstances change and warrant a modification to a previous estimate. cost estimates are largely based on negotiated or estimated purchase contract terms, historical performance trends and other economic projections. significant factors that influence these estimates include inflationary trends, technical and schedule risk, internal and subcontractor performance trends, business volume assumptions, asset utilization, and anticipated labor agreements. provisions for anticipated losses on long-term contracts are recorded in full when such losses become evident, to the extent required.
the customer funding for costs incurred for nonrecurring engineering and development activities of the company's products under agreements with commercial customers is deferred and subsequently recognized as revenue as products are delivered to the customers. additionally, expenses incurred, up to the customer agreed funded amount, are deferred as an asset and recognized as cost of sales when products are delivered to the customer. the deferred customer funding and costs result in recognition of deferred costs (asset) and deferred revenue (liability) on the company's consolidated balance sheet. capitalized contract fulfillment costs were approximately $1.3 billion as of december 31, 2021 and 2020. the amounts recognized as cost of products and services sold were approximately $0.1 billion for the years ended december 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019.
revenues for the company's mechanical service programs are recognized as performance obligations that are satisfied over time, with recognition reflecting a series of distinct services using the output method.
the terms of a contract or the historical business practice can give rise to variable consideration due to, but not limited to, cash-based incentives, rebates, performance awards, or credits. the company estimates variable consideration at the most likely amount the company will receive from customers. the company includes estimated amounts in the transaction price to the extent it is probable that a significant reversal of cumulative revenue recognized for such transaction will not occur, or when the uncertainty associated with the variable consideration is resolved. the company's estimates of variable consideration and determination of whether to include estimated amounts in the transaction price are based largely on an assessment of the company's anticipated performance and all information (historical, current and forecasted) that is reasonably available to the company.
stock-based compensation plans the principal awards issued under the company's stock-based compensation plans, which are described in note 15 stock-based compensation plans, are non-qualified stock options and restricted stock units. the cost for such awards is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award. the value of the portion of the award that is ultimately expected to vest is recognized as expense over the requisite service periods (generally the vesting period of the equity award) and is included in selling, general and administrative expenses. forfeitures are estimated at the time of grant to recognize expense for those awards that are expected to vest and are based on the company's historical forfeiture rates.

income taxes significant judgment is required in evaluating tax positions. the company establishes reserves for income taxes when, despite the belief that tax positions are fully supportable, there remain certain positions that do not meet the minimum recognition threshold. the approach for evaluating certain and uncertain tax positions is defined by the authoritative guidance which determines when a tax position is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by the applicable taxing authority. in the normal course of business, the company and its subsidiaries are examined by various federal, state and foreign tax authorities. the company regularly assesses the potential outcomes of these examinations and any future examinations for the current or prior years in determining the adequacy of the company's provision for income taxes. the company continually assesses the likelihood and amount of potential adjustments and adjust the income tax provision, the current tax liability and deferred taxes in the period in which the facts that give rise to a change in estimate become known. for additional information, see note 5 income taxes.
earnings per share basic earnings per share is based on the weighted average number of common shares outstanding. diluted earnings per share is based on the weighted average number of common shares outstanding and all dilutive potential common shares outstanding.
environmental the company accrues costs related to environmental matters when it is probable that it has incurred a liability related to a contaminated site and the amount can be reasonably estimated. for additional information, see note 19 commitments and contingencies.
asbestos related liabilities and insurance recoveries the company recognizes a liability for any asbestos related contingency that is probable of occurrence and reasonably estimable. in connection with the recognition of liabilities for asbestos related matters, the company records asbestos related insurance recoveries that are deemed probable. for additional information, see note 19 commitments and contingencies.
reimbursement receivables in conjunction with the resideo technologies, inc. (resideo) spin-off, the company entered into a reimbursement agreement under which honeywell receives cash payments as reimbursement primarily related to net spending for environmental matters at certain sites as defined in the reimbursement agreement. accordingly, the company recorded receivables based on estimates of the underlying reimbursable honeywell environmental spend, and the company monitors the recoverability of such receivables, which are subject to the terms of applicable credit agreements and general ability to pay.

for a summary by disaggregated product and services sales for each segment, refer to note 22 segment financial data.
the company recognizes revenue arising from performance obligations outlined in contracts with its customers that are satisfied at a point in time and over time. the disaggregation of the company's revenue based off timing of recognition is as follows:
services, transferred point in time                       8                       8                       9
services, transferred over time                          17                      16                      16

contract balances the company records progress on satisfying performance obligations under contracts with customers and the related billings and cash collections are recorded on the consolidated balance sheet in accounts receivable-net and other assets (unbilled receivables (contract assets) and billed receivables) and accrued liabilities and other liabilities (customer advances and deposits (contract liabilities)). unbilled receivables (contract assets) arise when the timing of cash collected from customers differs from the timing of revenue recognition, such as when contract provisions require specific milestones to be met before a customer can be billed. contract assets are recognized when the revenue associated with the contract is recognized prior to billing and derecognized when billed in accordance with the terms of the contract. contract liabilities are recorded when customers remit contractual cash payments in advance of us satisfying performance obligations under contractual arrangements, including those with performance obligations to be satisfied over a period of time. contract liabilities are derecognized when revenue is recorded, either when a milestone is met triggering the contractual right to bill or when the performance obligation is satisfied.

contract balances are classified as assets or liabilities on a contract-by-contract basis at the end of each reporting period.
change in contract assets-increase (decrease)                            $442                       $16
change in contract liabilities-(increase) decrease                     $(257)                    $(532)

the net change in 2021 and 2020 was primarily driven by the receipt of advance payments from customers exceeding recognition of revenue as performance obligations were satisfied prior to billing. for the years ended december 31, 2021 and 2020, the company recognized revenue of $1,925 million and $1,709 million, respectively, that was previously included in the beginning balance of contract liabilities.
contract assets include $2,035 million and $1,589 million of unbilled balances under long-term contracts as of december 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. these amounts are billed in accordance with the terms of customer contracts to which they relate.
when contracts are modified to account for changes in contract specifications and requirements, the company considers whether the modification either creates new or changes the existing enforceable rights and obligations. contract modifications for goods or services and not distinct from the existing contract, due to the significant integration with the original good or service provided, are accounted for as if they were part of that existing contract. the effect of a contract modification on the transaction price and the company's measure of progress for the performance obligation to which it relates, is recognized as an adjustment to revenue (either as an increase in or a reduction of revenue) on a cumulative catch-up basis. when the modifications include additional performance obligations that are distinct and at relative stand-alone selling price, they are accounted for as a new contract and performance obligation, which are recognized prospectively.
performance obligations a performance obligation is a promise in a contract to transfer a distinct good or service to the customer, and is defined as the unit of account. a contract's transaction price is allocated to each distinct performance obligation and recognized as revenue when, or as, the performance obligation is satisfied. when the company's contracts with customers require highly complex integration or manufacturing services that are not separately identifiable from other promises in the contracts and, therefore, not distinct, then the entire contract is accounted for as a single performance obligation. in situations when the company's contracts includes distinct goods or services that are substantially the same and have the same pattern of transfer to the customer over time, they are recognized as a series of distinct goods or services. for any contracts with multiple performance obligations, the company allocates the contract's transaction price to each performance obligation based on the estimated relative standalone selling price of each distinct good or service in the contract. for product sales, each product sold to a customer typically represents a distinct performance obligation. in such cases, the observable standalone sales are used to determine the stand alone selling price.
performance obligations are satisfied as of a point in time or over time. performance obligations are supported by contracts with customers, providing a framework for the nature of the distinct goods, services or bundle of goods and services. the timing of satisfying the performance obligation is typically indicated by the terms of the contract.
the following table outlines the company's remaining performance obligations disaggregated by segment:
performance materials and technologies                          7,243
safety and productivity solutions                               4,143

performance obligations recognized as of december 31, 2021 will be satisfied over the course of future periods. the company's disclosure of the timing for satisfying the performance obligation is based on the requirements of contracts with customers. however, from time to time, these contracts may be subject to modifications, impacting the timing of satisfying the performance obligations. performance obligations expected to be satisfied within one year and greater than one year are 59% and 41%, respectively.
the timing of satisfaction of the company's performance obligations does not significantly vary from the typical timing of payment. typical payment terms of the company's fixed-price over time contracts include progress payments based on specified events or milestones, or based on project progress. for some contracts the company may be entitled to receive an advance payment.
the company has applied the practical expedient for certain revenue streams to exclude the value of remaining performance obligations for (i) contracts with an original expected term of one year or less or (ii) contracts for which the company recognizes revenue in proportion to the amount the company has the right to invoice for services performed.

in 2021, the company recognized repositioning charges totaling $331 million, including severance costs of $80 million related to workforce reductions of 6,432 manufacturing and administrative positions mainly in the company's safety and productivity solutions and aerospace segments. the workforce reductions were primarily related to the re-alignment of a product line in the company's safety and productivity solutions segment, site transitions, mainly in aerospace, to more cost-effective locations, and the company's productivity and ongoing functional transformation initiatives. the repositioning charge included asset impairments of $117 million primarily related to the write-down of certain manufacturing and other equipment. the repositioning charge included exit costs of $134 million primarily for current period exit costs incurred for previously approved repositioning projects, closure obligations associated with site transitions, and lease obligations for equipment. also, $13 million of previously established reserves, primarily for severance, were returned to income due to adjustments to the scope of previously announced repositioning actions.
in 2021, other charges include $105 million of incremental long-term contract labor cost inefficiencies due to severe supply chain disruptions (attributable to the covid-19 pandemic) relating to the warehouse automation business within the safety and productivity solutions segment. certain of these costs incurred include amounts and provisions for anticipated losses recognized during the fourth quarter when total estimated costs at completion for certain of the business' long-term contracts exceeded total estimated revenue. these costs represent unproductive labor costs due to unexpected supply delays and the resulting downstream installation issues, demobilization and remobilization of contract workers, and resolution of contractor disputes. these costs do not include normal operational inefficiencies experienced during a challenging operating environment in 2021.
in 2020, the company recognized repositioning charges totaling $565 million, including severance costs of $475 million related to workforce reductions of 14,159 manufacturing and administrative positions across the company's segments, with a majority of the workforce reductions in aerospace and performance materials and technologies. the workforce reductions primarily related to the company aligning its cost structure with the slowdown in demand for many of its products and services due to the global recession, the company's productivity and ongoing functional transformation initiatives, and to site consolidations and hub strategies. the repositioning charge included exit costs of $69 million primarily related to current period exit costs incurred for previously approved repositioning projects. also, $47 million of previously established reserves, primarily for severance, were returned to income mainly as a result of higher attrition than anticipated in prior severance actions resulting in lower payments.
in 2019, the company recognized repositioning charges totaling $438 million, including severance costs of $260 million related to workforce reductions of 5,336 manufacturing and administrative positions across the company's segments. the workforce reductions related to the company's productivity and ongoing functional transformation initiatives and to site transitions, mainly in honeywell building technologies, as the company transitions manufacturing to more cost-effective locations. the repositioning charge included asset impairments of $95 million largely related to a write down in connection with assets held for sale. the repositioning charge included exit costs of $83 million primarily related to current period exit costs incurred for previously approved repositioning projects, termination fees associated with the early cancellation of supply agreements for certain raw materials in performance materials and technologies and honeywell building technologies and for closure obligations associated with site transitions.

the effective tax rate increased by 3.4 percentage points in 2021 compared to 2020. the increase was primarily due to the establishment of a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets not expected to be realized, incremental tax reserves, a lower tax benefit from restructuring and the absence of prior year items including tax benefits realized as a result of the favorable resolution of a foreign tax matter related to the spin-off transactions, tax law changes in india and the resolution of certain u.s. tax matters offset by a non-cash charge related to the reduction of the aggregate carrying value of certain receivables with no corresponding tax benefit. the company's non-u.s. effective tax rate was 26.0%, an increase of approximately 14.1 percentage points compared to 2020. the increase in the foreign effective tax rate was primarily attributable to incremental tax reserves, the tax impact of restructuring and the absence of prior year items including the favorable resolution of a foreign tax matter related to the previously completed spin-off transactions and tax law changes in india.
the effective tax rate increased by 1.5 percentage points in 2020 compared to 2019. the increase was primarily attributable to accrued withholding taxes related to unremitted foreign earnings and non-cash charges related to the reduction of the aggregate carrying value of certain receivables with no corresponding tax benefit, offset by the favorable resolution of a foreign tax matter related to the previously completed spin-off transactions, tax impact of restructuring, tax law changes in india, and the resolution of certain u.s. tax matters. the company's non-u.s. effective tax rate was 11.9%, a decrease of approximately 14.2 percentage points compared to 2019. the decrease in the foreign effective tax rate was primarily attributable to the favorable resolution of a foreign tax matter related to the previously completed spin-off transactions, tax impact of restructuring, and tax law changes in india offset by accrued withholding taxes related to unremitted foreign earnings.

the company's gross deferred tax assets include $901 million related to non-u.s. operations comprised principally of net operating losses, capital loss and tax credit carryforwards, primarily in canada, france, germany, luxembourg, and the united kingdom, and deductible temporary differences. the company maintains a valuation allowance of $703 million against a portion of the non-u.s. gross deferred tax assets. additionally, a valuation allowance of $150 million was established against the u.s. gross deferred tax asset for capital losses generated from restructuring transactions during the year. the change in the valuation allowance resulted in an increase of $124 million, increase of $105 million, and a decrease of $23 million to income tax expense in 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. in the event the company determines that it will not be able to realize its net deferred tax assets in the future, the company will reduce such amounts through an increase to income tax expense in the period such determination is made. conversely, if the company determines that it will be able to realize net deferred tax assets in excess of the carrying amounts, the company will decrease the recorded valuation allowance through a reduction to income tax expense in the period that such determination is made.
as of december 31, 2021, the company recorded a $426 million deferred tax liability on all unremitted foreign earnings based on estimated earnings and profits of approximately $17.1 billion as of the balance sheet date.
as of december 31, 2021, the company's net operating loss, capital loss and tax credit carryforwards were as follows:

many jurisdictions impose limitations on the timing and utilization of net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. in those instances, whereby there is an expected permanent limitation on the utilization of the net operating loss or tax credit carryforward, the deferred tax asset and amount of the carryforward have been reduced.

the following table summarizes tax years that remain subject to examination by major tax jurisdictions as of december 31, 2021:
based on the outcome of these examinations, or as a result of the expiration of statute of limitations for specific jurisdictions, it is reasonably possible that certain unrecognized tax benefits for tax positions taken on previously filed tax returns will materially change from those recorded as liabilities in the company's financial statements. in addition, the outcome of these examinations may impact the valuation of certain deferred tax assets (such as net operating losses) in future periods.
unrecognized tax benefits for examinations in progress were $592 million, $556 million, and $413 million, as of december 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. estimated interest and penalties related to the underpayment of income taxes are classified as a component of tax expense in the consolidated statement of operations and totaled $79 million, $80 million, and $73 million for the years ended december 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. accrued interest and penalties were $580 million, $507 million, and $487 million, as of december 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.

note 11. derivative instruments and hedging transactions derivatives and hedging activities the company uses derivative financial instruments to manage its risks related to interest rates and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. derivative financial instruments are not used for trading or other speculative purposes. to qualify as a hedge, derivative financial instruments must be evaluated for hedge effectiveness at the inception of the contract and designated as a hedge. changes in fair value of the derivative contract must be highly correlated with changes in fair value of the underlying hedged item at inception and over the life of the hedge contract.
foreign currency risk management the company operates a global business in a wide variety of foreign currencies. the company's exposure to market risk for changes in foreign currency exchange rates arises from international financing activities between subsidiaries, foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities, and transactions arising from international trade. the company's objective is to preserve the u.s. dollar value of foreign currency denominated cash flows and earnings. the company monitors its collective foreign currency exposure and enters into foreign currency exchange forward and option contracts (foreign currency exchange contracts) with third parties, when necessary, to minimize the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates.
the company has monetary assets and liabilities denominated in non-functional currencies. prior to conversion into u.s. dollars, these assets and liabilities are remeasured at spot exchange rates in effect on the balance sheet date. the effects of changes in spot rates are recognized in earnings and included in other (income) expense. the company uses foreign currency exchange contracts to hedge its foreign currency exposure. these contracts are marked-to-market with the resulting gains and losses recognized in earnings offsetting the gains and losses on the non-functional currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities being hedged. the company uses foreign currency contracts to hedge forecasted sales and purchases, which are denominated in non-functional currencies. changes in the forecasted non-functional currency cash flows due to movements in exchange rates are substantially offset by changes in the fair value of these foreign currency exchange contracts designated as hedges. market value gains and losses on these contracts are recognized in earnings when the hedged transaction is recognized. as of december 31, 2021, and 2020, the company held contracts with notional amounts of $12,671 million and $16,123 million to exchange foreign currencies, principally the u.s. dollar, euro, canadian dollar, british pound, mexican peso, chinese renminbi, and indian rupee.
the company also designates certain foreign currency debt and derivative contracts as hedges against portions of its net investment in foreign operations. gains or losses of the foreign currency debt and derivative contracts designated as net investment hedges are recorded in the same manner as foreign currency translation adjustments.
interest rate risk management financial instruments, including derivatives, expose the company to market risk related to changes in interest rates. the company uses a combination of financial instruments, including long-term, medium-term, and short-term financing, variable-rate commercial paper, and interest rate swaps to convert the interest rate mix of the company's total debt portfolio and related overall cost of borrowing.
credit risk management the company continues to monitor the creditworthiness of its counterparties to mitigate the risk of nonperformance. financial instruments, including derivatives, expose the company to counterparty credit risk. in addition, the company grants credit terms to its customers in the normal course of business. the terms and conditions of the company's credit sales are designed to mitigate or eliminate concentrations of credit risk with any single customer. the company's sales are not materially dependent on a single customer or a small group of customers.

note 15. stock-based compensation plans the 2016 stock incentive plan of honeywell international inc. and its affiliates (2016 plan) and 2016 stock plan for non-employee directors of honeywell international inc. (2016 directors plan) were both approved by the shareowners at the annual meeting of shareowners effective on april 25, 2016. at december 31, 2021, there were 32,337,638, and 815,299 shares of honeywell common stock available for future grants under terms of the 2016 plan and 2016 directors plan, respectively.
stock options the exercise price, term and other conditions applicable to each option granted under the company's stock plans are generally determined by the management development and compensation committee of the board of directors. the exercise price of stock options is set on the grant date and may not be less than the fair market value per share of the company's stock on that date. the fair value is recognized as an expense over the employee's requisite service period (generally the vesting period of the award). options generally vest over a four-year period and expire after ten years.
the fair value of each option award is estimated on the date of grant using the black-scholes option-pricing model. expected volatility is based on implied volatilities from traded options on our common stock and historical volatility of the company's common stock. the company used a monte carlo simulation model to derive an expected term which represents an estimate of the time options are expected to remain outstanding. such model uses historical data to estimate option exercise activity and post-vest termination behavior. the risk-free rate for periods within the contractual life of the option is based on the u.s. treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant.
the following table summarizes the impact to the consolidated statement of operations from stock options:

note 19. commitments and contingencies environmental matters the company is subject to various federal, state, local and foreign government requirements relating to the protection of the environment. the company believes that, as a general matter, the company's policies, practices, and procedures are properly designed to prevent unreasonable risk of environmental damage and personal injury and that the handling, manufacture, use, and disposal of hazardous substances are in accordance with environmental and safety laws and regulations. however, mainly because of past operations and operations of predecessor companies, the company, like other companies engaged in similar businesses, have incurred remedial response and voluntary cleanup costs for site contamination and are a party to lawsuits and claims associated with environmental and safety matters, including past production of products containing hazardous substances. additional lawsuits, claims, and costs involving environmental matters are likely to continue to arise in the future.
with respect to environmental matters involving site contamination, the company continually conducts studies, individually or jointly with other potentially responsible parties, to determine the feasibility of various remedial techniques. it is the company's policy to record appropriate liabilities for environmental matters when remedial efforts or damage claim payments are probable and the costs can be reasonably estimated. such liabilities are based on our best estimate of the undiscounted future costs required to complete the remedial work. the recorded liabilities are adjusted periodically as remediation efforts progress or as additional technical, regulatory, or legal information becomes available. given the uncertainties regarding the status of laws, regulations, enforcement policies, the impact of other potentially responsible parties, technology, and information related to individual sites, the company does not believe it is possible to develop an estimate of the range of reasonably possible environmental loss in excess of the company's recorded liabilities. the company expects to fund expenditures for these matters from operating cash flow. the timing of cash expenditures depends on a number of factors, including the timing of remedial investigations and feasibility studies, the timing of litigation and settlements of remediation liability, personal injury and property damage claims, regulatory approval of cleanup projects, remedial techniques to be utilized, and agreements with other parties.
the following table summarizes information concerning our recorded liabilities for environmental costs:
beginning of year                                                                                  $660                      $709                      $755

environmental liabilities are included in the following balance sheet accounts:
the company does not currently possess sufficient information to reasonably estimate the amounts of environmental liabilities to be recorded upon future completion of studies, litigation or settlements, and neither the timing nor the amount of the ultimate costs associated with environmental matters can be determined, although they could be material to the company's consolidated results of operations and operating cash flows in the periods recognized or paid. however, considering the company's past experience and existing reserves, the company does not expect that environmental matters will have a material adverse effect on its consolidated financial position.
in conjunction with the resideo spin-off, the company entered into an indemnification and reimbursement agreement with a resideo subsidiary, pursuant to which resideo's subsidiary has an ongoing obligation to make cash payments to honeywell in amounts equal to 90% of honeywell's annual net spending for environmental matters at certain sites as defined in the agreement. the amount payable to honeywell in any given year is subject to a cap of $140 million, and the obligation will continue until the earlier of december 31, 2043, or december 31 of the third consecutive year during which the annual payment obligation is less than $25 million.

reimbursements associated with this agreement are collected from resideo quarterly and were $140 million in both 2021 and 2020 and offset operating cash outflows incurred by the company. as the company incurs costs for environmental matters deemed probable and reasonably estimable related to the sites covered by the indemnification and reimbursement agreement, a corresponding receivable from resideo for 90% of such costs is also recorded. this receivable amount recorded in 2021 and 2020 was $146 million and $146 million, respectively. as of december 31, 2021, other current assets and other assets included $140 million and $457 million, respectively, for the short-term and long-term portion of the receivable amount due from resideo under the indemnification and reimbursement agreement. as of december 31, 2020, other current assets and other assets included $140 million and $451 million, respectively, for the short-term and long-term portion of the receivable amount due from resideo under the indemnification and reimbursement agreement.

narco products - narco manufactured high-grade, heat-resistant, refractory products for various industries. honeywell's predecessor, allied corporation, owned narco from 1979 to 1986. allied corporation sold the narco business in 1986 and entered into a cross-indemnity agreement which included an obligation to indemnify the purchaser for asbestos claims, arising primarily from alleged occupational exposure to asbestos-containing refractory brick and mortar for high-temperature applications. narco ceased manufacturing these products in 1980 and filed for bankruptcy in january 2002, at which point in time all then current and future narco asbestos claims were stayed against both narco and honeywell pending the reorganization of narco. the company established its initial liability for narco asbestos claims in 2002.
narco emerged from bankruptcy in april 2013, at which time a federally authorized 524(g) trust was established to evaluate and resolve all existing narco asbestos claims (the trust). both honeywell and narco are protected by a permanent channeling injunction barring all present and future individual actions in state or federal courts and requiring all asbestos-related claims based on exposure to narco asbestos-containing products to be made against the trust. the narco trust agreement (ta) and the narco trust distribution procedures (tdp) set forth the structure and operating rules of the trust, and established honeywell's evergreen funding obligations.
in accordance with the ta, the trust is eligible to receive cash dividends from harbison-walker international inc. (hwi), the reorganized and renamed entity that emerged from the narco bankruptcy. hwi cash dividends are required to be used to pay asbestos-related claims which qualify for payment under the tdp (annual contribution claims) until those funds are exhausted, at which point honeywell's funding obligation, subject to an annual cap of $145 million, is triggered. the trust received dividend payments from hwi in 2021. the company is also required to fund amounts owed pursuant to settlement agreements reached during the pendency of the narco bankruptcy proceedings that provide for the right to submit claims to the trust subject to qualification under the terms of the settlement agreements and tdp (pre-established unliquidated claims), as well as fund the annual operating costs of the trust. there is no annual funding cap relative to pre-established unliquidated claims.
the operating rules per the tdp define criteria claimants must meet for a claim to be considered valid and paid, which include adequate medical evidence of the claimant's asbestos-related condition and credible evidence of exposure to a specific narco asbestos-containing product. the tdp allows honeywell to audit claim support documents against these criteria. once operational in 2014, the trust began to receive, process and pay claims. the company identified several issues with the way the trust was adhering to the tdp in audits subsequent to the trust becoming operational. the company consistently raised with the trust concern that the trust adopted an improper practice of paying claimants who have not demonstrated the requisite exposure. the trust refused to alter its practices for payment of claims, and in september 2021, honeywell filed suit against the trust in the united states bankruptcy court for the western district of pennsylvania (bankruptcy court) alleging that the trust has breached its duties in managing the trust, including breaches of certain provisions of the ta and tdp. honeywell's lawsuit seeks appropriate relief preventing the trust from continuing these practices. the trust also filed suit against honeywell, alleging honeywell has breached its obligations under the trust's governing documents. honeywell moved to dismiss the trust's suit, and on december 15, 2021, the bankruptcy court granted honeywell's motion to dismiss subject to granting the trust leave to file an amended complaint. on december 28, 2021, the trust filed an answer with counterclaims in response to honeywell's complaint and in lieu of filing an amended complaint. at this time, the company cannot predict the outcome of these matters, or the potential impact on the asbestos-related liabilities.
due to the bankruptcy filing in 2002, claimants were not permitted to file additional claims until the trust became operative in 2014. as a consequence, there was a large backlog of claims filed with the trust upon it becoming operative in 2014 through december 31, 2017, the date by which these claims had to be filed or else be barred by the expiration of the statute of limitations. therefore, the claims filing rate did not start to normalize until 2018 and thereafter. as a result, between 2002 and 2018, the company lacked a history of sufficiently reliable claims data to derive a reasonable estimate of its narco asbestos-related liability, and the company continued to update its original estimate, as appropriate, using all available information.
beginning in 2020, with three years of sufficiently reliable claims data, the company updated its estimate of the narco asbestos-related liability. the estimate for the resolution of asserted annual contribution claims and pre-established unliquidated claims uses average payment values for the relevant historical period. the estimate for unasserted claims is based on historic and anticipated claims filing experience and payment rates, disease classifications and type of claim, and average payment values by the trust for the relevant historical period. the company utilizes an asbestos liability valuation specialist to support the preparation of the narco asbestos-related liability estimates during the fourth quarter each year. the company's estimates, which involve significant management judgment, and consider multiple scenarios, include all years of epidemiological disease projection through 2059.
the narco asbestos-related liability reflects an estimate for the resolution of annual contribution claims and pre-established unliquidated claims filed with the trust, as well as for unasserted annual contribution claims and pre-established unliquidated claims. the narco asbestos-related liability excludes the annual operating expenses of the trust which are expensed as they are incurred.

the company's narco-related insurance receivable reflects coverage which reimburses honeywell for portions of narco-related claims and defense costs. this coverage is provided by a large number of insurance policies written by dozens of insurance companies in both the domestic insurance market and the london excess market. honeywell's narco-related insurance receivable is an estimate of the probable amount of insurance that is recoverable for asbestos claims. the company's judgments related to the company's insurance carriers and insurance coverages are reasonable and consistent with honeywell's historical dealings and honeywell's knowledge of any pertinent solvency issues surrounding insurers.
bendix products - bendix manufactured automotive brake linings that contained chrysotile asbestos in an encapsulated form. claimants consist largely of individuals who allege exposure to asbestos from brakes from either performing or being in the vicinity of individuals who performed brake replacements. the following tables present information regarding bendix related asbestos claims activity:
claims unresolved at the beginning of year                            6,242                           6,480

honeywell has experienced average resolution values per claim excluding legal costs as follows:
it is not possible to predict whether resolution values for bendix-related asbestos claims will increase, decrease or stabilize in the future.
the consolidated financial statements reflect an estimated liability for resolution of asserted (claims filed as of the financial statement date) and unasserted bendix-related asbestos claims, which exclude the company's ongoing legal fees to defend such asbestos claims which will continue to be expensed as they are incurred.
the company reflects the inclusion of all years of epidemiological disease projection through 2059 when estimating the liability for unasserted bendix-related asbestos claims. such liability for unasserted bendix-related asbestos claims is based on historic and anticipated claims filing experience and dismissal rates, disease classifications, and resolution values in the tort system for the previous five years. the company has valued bendix asserted and unasserted claims using average resolution values for the previous five years. the company updates the resolution values used to estimate the cost of bendix asserted and unasserted claims during the fourth quarter each year.
the company's insurance receivable corresponding to the liability for settlement of asserted and unasserted bendix asbestos claims reflects coverage which is provided by a large number of insurance policies written by dozens of insurance companies in both the domestic insurance market and the london excess market. based on the company's ongoing analysis of the probable insurance recovery, insurance receivables are recorded in the financial statements simultaneous with the recording of the estimated liability for the underlying asbestos claims. this determination is based on the company's analysis of the underlying insurance policies, historical experience with insurers, ongoing review of the solvency of insurers, judicial determinations relevant to insurance programs, and consideration of the impacts of any settlements reached with the company's insurers.

on october 31, 2018, david kanefsky (plaintiff), a honeywell shareholder, filed a putative class action complaint in the u.s. district court for the district of new jersey (the court) alleging violations of the securities exchange act of 1934 and rule 10b-5 related to the prior accounting for bendix asbestos claims. an amended complaint was filed on december 30, 2019, and on february 7, 2020, the company filed a motion to dismiss. on may 18, 2020, the court denied the motion to dismiss. on december 7, 2021, the parties filed a stipulation of settlement (settlement agreement) and plaintiff filed a motion for preliminary approval of the settlement agreement, which includes payment by honeywell of $10 million to settle the claims in dispute. honeywell continues to believe the claims lack merit and denies wrongdoing as well as any liability for the claims made against honeywell in the action. the settlement agreement remains subject to final court approval and other conditions.
garrett litigation and bankruptcy proceedings in conjunction with the garrett spin-off, the company entered into a binding indemnification and reimbursement agreement (garrett indemnity) and a binding tax matters agreement (tax matters agreement) with garrett and a garrett subsidiary. on december 2, 2019, garrett and garrett asasco inc. filed a summons with notice and commenced a lawsuit in the commercial division of the supreme court of the state of new york, county of new york (the state court), seeking to invalidate the garrett indemnity. garrett sought damages and a declaratory judgment based on various claims set forth in the summons with notice. on july 17, 2020, the company received a notice from garrett asserting that the company had caused material breaches of the tax matters agreement and that the tax matters agreement was unenforceable.
on september 20, 2020, garrett and 36 of its affiliates filed voluntary petitions for relief under chapter 11 of the united states bankruptcy code in the united states bankruptcy court for the southern district of new york (the bankruptcy court). on september 24, 2020, garrett moved the existing state court litigation against honeywell to the bankruptcy court. for the year ended december 31, 2020, the company reviewed the aggregate carrying value of the receivable amounts due in connection with the garrett indemnity and tax matters agreement and reduced the aggregate carrying value of the receivable by $509 million to reflect the present value of the amounts owed to the company over the full term of these agreements.
on april 26, 2021, the bankruptcy court confirmed garrett's amended chapter 11 plan of reorganization (the confirmed plan), and on april 30, 2021 (the effective date), garrett emerged from bankruptcy. on the effective date, and in accordance with the confirmed plan, (i) the company received from garrett an initial payment of $375 million and 834.8 million shares of garrett's series b preferred stock in full and final satisfaction of the garrett indemnity and tax matters agreement, (ii) the garrett indemnity and tax matters agreement were terminated, (iii) the company and garrett mutually released each other from the claims asserted in all pending legal actions related to the garrett indemnity and tax matters agreement, and (iv) all pending litigation between the company and garrett in connection with those agreements was resolved.
the original series b preferred stock certificate of designation provides for mandatory redemptions by garrett of $35 million in 2022 and $100 million per year from 2023 to 2030 (inclusive) at the anniversary of the effective date, unless (i) garrett's consolidated ebitda as of the end of the most recently completed fiscal year is less than $425 million, or (ii) garrett does not have sufficient funds available to pay the redemption, at which point the redemption amounts past due will accrue interest. the series b preferred stock certificate of designation also includes rights which allow (a) the company to put the series b preferred stock to garrett if certain ebitda conditions are met, and (b) garrett to call the series b preferred stock in whole or in part if certain ebitda conditions are met.
on september 30, 2021, garrett filed an amended and restated series b preferred stock certificate of designation (amendment) with the secretary of state of delaware. the amendment required garrett to partially redeem a portion of the series b preferred stock on or before march 31, 2022, such that the present value of remaining outstanding shares of the series b preferred stock would be $400 million (first partial redemption), subject to applicable law, including that garrett had funds legally available for the partial redemption. the first partial redemption would be applied to the latest scheduled redemption dates, beginning with the shares to be redeemed in 2030. the amendment also provides that the company cannot exercise its right to put the series b preferred stock to garrett until after december 31, 2022, subject to the ebitda conditions described in the above section, unless the partial redemption does not occur on or before march 31, 2022. all other material terms and conditions in the amendment were unchanged from the original series b preferred stock certificate of designation.
on december 16, 2021, garrett filed a second amended and restated series b preferred stock certificate of designation (second amendment) with the secretary of state of delaware. the second amendment accelerates the first partial redemption from march 31, 2022, to december 30, 2021, and allows garrett to partially redeem an additional portion of the series b preferred stock on or before march 31, 2022, such that the present value of remaining outstanding shares of the series b preferred stock will be $207 million (second partial redemption). the second partial redemption is subject to similar terms as the first partial redemption, including that garrett has funds legally available for the partial redemption. however, the second partial redemption is also contingent upon garrett completing the first partial redemption and either (i) increasing their revolving credit facility, or (ii) the garrett board of directors determining that garrett otherwise has sufficient liquidity to effect the second partial redemption. the second partial redemption would be applied to the earliest scheduled redemptions beginning with the shares to be redeemed on april 30, 2022.

on december 17, 2021, garrett announced their intention to effect the first partial redemption on december 28, 2021, in the amount of $211 million, and plan to effect the second partial redemption during the first quarter of 2022 for a corresponding payment of $200 million. on december 28, 2021, garrett paid $211 million for the amount due as the first partial redemption.
the company recorded the series b preferred stock at fair value at the effective date. the company believes the present value of the mandatory redemptions is an appropriate basis for determining the fair value of the series b preferred stock. the company's present value reflects amortized cost determined by the present value of the mandatory redemptions discounted at 7.25%, which is the rate reflected in the series b preferred stock certificate of designation. the discount amount will accrete into interest income over the mandatory redemption period. in addition to the series b preferred stock, the company subscribed for 4.2 million shares of garrett's series a preferred stock, which are convertible into garrett's common stock if certain conditions are met. prior to and following garrett's emergence from bankruptcy, the company also held 2.9 million shares of garrett's common stock. as of december 31, 2021, short-term investments included $34 million and investments and long-term receivables included $423 million for the company's investments in garrett's series b preferred stock, series a preferred stock and common stock.
other matters the company is subject to a number of other lawsuits, investigations and disputes (some of which involve substantial amounts claimed) arising out of the conduct of the company's business, including matters relating to commercial transactions, government contracts, product liability, prior acquisitions and divestitures, employee benefit plans, intellectual property, and environmental, health and safety matters (including the matter described below). the company recognizes liabilities for any contingency that is probable of occurrence and reasonably estimable. the company continually assesses the likelihood of adverse judgments or outcomes in such matters, as well as potential ranges of possible losses (taking into consideration any insurance recoveries), based on a careful analysis of each matter with the assistance of outside legal counsel and, if applicable, other experts.
•petrobras and unaoil - the company continues to cooperate with investigations by the u.s. department of justice (doj), the securities and exchange commission (sec) and the brazilian authorities relating to the company's use of third parties who previously worked for the company's uop business in brazil in relation to petróleo brasileiro s.a. (petrobras) in connection with a project awarded in 2010. the investigations focus on compliance with the u.s. foreign corrupt practices act and similar brazilian laws (the uop matters), and involve, among other things, document production and interviews with former and current management and employees. the doj and the sec are also examining a matter involving a foreign subsidiary's prior contract with unaoil s.a.m. in algeria executed in 2011. the company continues to be engaged in discussions with the authorities with respect to a potential comprehensive resolution of these matters.
as the discussions are both ongoing and at different stages with regards to each respective authority, there can be no assurance as to whether the company will reach a resolution with such authorities or as to the potential timing, terms, or collateral consequences of any such resolution. as a result, the company cannot predict the ultimate outcome of these uop matters or the potential impact on the company. based on available information to date, the company estimates that a potential comprehensive resolution of these uop matters would result in a probable loss of at least $160 million, and the company has recorded a charge in this amount in the company's consolidated statement of operations, and accrued a corresponding liability on the consolidated balance sheet. amounts payable to authorities pursuant to any potential final comprehensive resolution could differ from the amount recorded in the company's consolidated financial statements. based on available information to date, the company does not expect that any such difference would be material with respect to the company's consolidated financial position.
given the uncertainty inherent in litigation and investigations, the company does not believe it is possible to develop estimates of reasonably possible losses (or a range of possible losses) in excess of current accruals for such matters. considering the company's past experience and existing accruals, the company does not expect the outcome of such matters, either individually or in the aggregate, to have a material adverse effect on the company's consolidated financial position. because most contingencies are resolved over long periods of time, potential liabilities are subject to change due to new developments, changes in settlement strategy or the impact of evidentiary requirements, which could cause us to pay damage awards or settlements (or become subject to equitable remedies) that could have a material adverse effect on the company's consolidated results of operations or operating cash flows in the periods recognized or paid.

note 20. pension and other postretirement benefits the company sponsors a number of both funded and unfunded u.s. and non-u.s. defined benefit pension plans. pension benefits for many of the company's u.s. employees are provided through non-contributory, qualified and non-qualified defined benefit plans. all non-union hourly and salaried employees joining honeywell for the first time after december 31, 2012, are not eligible to participate in honeywell's u.s. defined benefit pension plans. the company also sponsors defined benefit pension plans which cover non-u.s. employees who are not u.s. citizens, in certain jurisdictions, principally the uk, netherlands, germany, and canada. other pension plans outside of the u.s. are not material to the company either individually or in the aggregate.
the company also sponsors postretirement benefit plans that provide health care benefits and life insurance coverage mainly to u.s. eligible retirees. none of honeywell's u.s. employees are eligible for a retiree medical subsidy from the company. in addition, the vast majority of honeywell's u.s. retirees either have no company subsidy or have a fixed-dollar subsidy amount. this significantly limits the company's exposure to the impact of future health care cost increases. the retiree medical and life insurance plans are not funded. claims and expenses are paid from the company's cash flows from operations.

(1)the actuarial losses incurred in 2021 related to the company's u.s. plans are primarily the result of changes in demographic experience and demographic assumptions, partially offset by actuarial gains due to an increase in the discount rate assumptions used to estimate the benefit obligations as of december 31, 2021 compared to december 31, 2020. actuarial gains incurred in 2021 related to the company's non-u.s. plans are primarily the result of an increase in the discount rate assumption used to estimate the benefit obligations as of december 31, 2021 compared to december 31, 2020. actuarial losses incurred in 2020 related to the company's u.s. and non-u.s. plans are primarily the result of a decrease in the discount rate assumptions used to estimate the benefit obligations as of december 31, 2020 compared to december 31, 2019.

actuarial assumptions used to determine benefit obligations as of december 31:
actuarial assumptions used to determine net periodic benefit cost for years ended december 31:
(1)discount rate was 3.03% for january 1, 2020 through september 30, 2020. the rate was changed to 2.36% for the remainder of 2020 due to a plan remeasurement as of october 1, 2020.
the discount rate for the company's u.s. pension and other postretirement benefits plans reflects the current rate at which the associated liabilities could be settled at the measurement date of december 31. to determine discount rates for the company's u.s. pension and other postretirement benefit plans, the company uses a modeling process that involves matching the expected cash outflows of the company's benefit plans to a yield curve constructed from a portfolio of high quality, fixed-income debt instruments. the company uses the single weighted-average yield of this hypothetical portfolio as a discount rate benchmark. the company utilizes a full yield curve approach in the estimation of the service and interest cost components of net periodic pension benefit (income) for the company's significant pension plans. this approach applies the specific spot rates along the yield curve used in the determination of the pension benefit obligation to their underlying projected cash flows and provides a more precise measurement of service and interest costs by improving the correlation between projected cash flows and their corresponding spot rates. for the company's u.s. pension plans, the single weighted average spot rates used to determine service and interest costs for 2022 are 2.97% and 2.26%. the discount rate used to determine the other postretirement benefit obligation is lower principally due to a shorter expected duration of other postretirement plan obligations as compared to pension plan obligations.
the company plans to use an expected rate of return on u.s. plan assets of 6.40% for 2022, which represents an increase from the 6.15% assumption used for 2021. the company's asset return assumption is based on historical plan asset returns over varying long-term periods combined with current market conditions and broad asset mix considerations with a focus on long-term trends rather than short-term market conditions. the company reviews the expected rate of return on an annual basis and revise it as appropriate.
for non-u.s. benefit plans actuarial assumptions reflect economic and market factors relevant to each country.

the accumulated benefit obligation for the company's u.s. defined benefit pension plans was $17.3 billion and $17.9 billion and for the company's non-u.s. defined benefit pension plans was $6.9 billion and $7.6 billion at december 31, 2021 and 2020.
the company's asset investment strategy for its u.s. pension plans focuses on maintaining a diversified portfolio using various asset classes in order to achieve the company's long-term investment objectives on a risk adjusted basis. the company's long-term target allocations are as follows: 55%-70% fixed income securities and cash, 25%-40% equity securities, 5%-10% real estate investments, and 10%-20% other types of investments. equity securities include publicly-traded stock of companies located inside the united states. fixed income securities include corporate bonds of companies from diversified industries, mortgage-backed securities, and u.s. treasuries. real estate investments include direct investments in commercial properties and investments in real estate funds. other types of investments include investments in private equity that follow several different strategies. the company reviews its assets on a regular basis to ensure that the company is within the targeted asset allocation ranges and, if necessary, asset balances are adjusted back within target allocations.
the company's non-u.s. pension assets are typically managed by decentralized fiduciary committees with the honeywell corporate investments group providing funding and investment guidance. the company's non-u.s. investment policies are different for each country as local regulations, funding requirements, and financial and tax considerations are part of the funding and investment allocation process in each country.
in accordance with asu 2015-07, "fair value measurement (topic 820)", certain investments that are measured at fair value using the net asset value (nav) per share (or its equivalent) practical expedient have not been classified in the fair value hierarchy. the fair value amounts presented in the following tables are intended to permit reconciliation of the fair value hierarchy to the amounts presented for the total pension benefits plan assets.

the company enters into futures contracts to gain exposure to certain markets. sufficient cash or cash equivalents are held by the company's pension plans to cover the notional value of the futures contracts. at december 31, 2021 and 2020, the company's u.s. plans had contracts with notional amounts of $4,415 million and $3,673 million. at december 31, 2021 and 2020, the company's non-u.s. plans had contracts with notional amounts of $311 million and $564 million, respectively. in both the company's u.s. and non-u.s. pension plans, the notional derivative exposure is related to outstanding equity and fixed income futures contracts.
common stocks, preferred stocks, real estate investment trusts, and short-term investments are valued at the closing price reported in the active market in which the individual securities are traded. corporate bonds, mortgages/asset-backed securities, and government securities are valued either by using pricing models, bids provided by brokers or dealers, quoted prices of securities with similar characteristics or discounted cash flows and as such include adjustments for certain risks that may not be observable such as credit and liquidity risks. certain securities are held in collective trust funds which are valued using net asset values provided by the administrators of the funds. investments in private equity, debt, real estate and hedge funds and direct private investments are valued at estimated fair value based on quarterly financial information received from the investment advisor and/or general partner. investments in real estate properties are valued on a quarterly basis using the income approach. valuation estimates are periodically supplemented by third party appraisals. the insurance buy-in contracts represent policies held by the honeywell uk pension scheme, whereby the cost of providing pension benefits to plan participants is funded by the policies. the cash flows from the policies are intended to match the pension benefits. the fair value of these policies is based on an estimate of the policies' exit price.
the company's funding policy for qualified defined benefit pension plans is to contribute amounts at least sufficient to satisfy regulatory funding standards. in 2021, 2020, and 2019, the company was not required to make contributions to the u.s. pension plans and no contributions were made. the company is not required to make any contributions to the u.s. pension plans in 2022. in 2021, contributions of $94 million were made to the non-u.s. pension plans to satisfy regulatory funding requirements. in 2022, the company expects to make contributions of cash and/or marketable securities of approximately $11 million to the non-u.s. pension plans to satisfy regulatory funding standards. contributions for both the u.s. and non-u.s. pension plans do not reflect benefits paid directly from company assets.

report of independent registered public accounting firm to the shareowners and the board of directors of honeywell international inc.
opinions on the financial statements and internal control over financial reporting we have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of honeywell international inc. and subsidiaries (the "company" or "honeywell") as of december 31, 2021 and 2020, and the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, shareowners' equity, and cash flows, for each of the three years in the period ended december 31, 2021, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the "financial statements"). we also have audited the company's internal control over financial reporting as of december 31, 2021, based on criteria established in internal control - integrated framework (2013) issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission (coso).
in our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the company as of december 31, 2021 and 2020, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended december 31, 2021, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america ("generally accepted accounting principles"). also, in our opinion, the company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of december 31, 2021, based on criteria established in internal control - integrated framework (2013) issued by coso.
basis for opinions the company's management is responsible for these financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying management's report on internal control over financial reporting. our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and an opinion on the company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. we are a public accounting firm registered with the public company accounting oversight board (united states) (pcaob) and are required to be independent with respect to the company in accordance with the u.s. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the securities and exchange commission and the pcaob.
we conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the pcaob. those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.
our audits of the financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures to respond to those risks. such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. we believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.
definition and limitations of internal control over financial reporting a company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. a company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
report of independent registered public accounting firm critical audit matters the critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. the communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.
asbestos related liabilities - north american refractories company (narco) asbestos liability - refer to note 19 to the financial statements critical audit matter description the company records an estimated liability for asbestos related personal injury claims related to a predecessor company, narco. such claims arise primarily from alleged occupational exposure to asbestos-containing refractory brick and mortar.
the company's narco asbestos-related liability reflects an estimated liability for the resolution of asserted and unasserted narco-related asbestos claims that are probable of occurrence and reasonably estimable. the company records an estimated liability for the resolution of asserted annual contribution claims and pre-established unliquidated claims filed with the narco trust using average payment values for the relevant historical period. the company also records an estimated liability for unasserted annual contribution claims and pre-established unliquidated claims based on historic and anticipated claims filing experience and payment rates, disease classifications and type of claim, and average payment values by the narco trust for the relevant historical period. beginning in 2020, with three years of sufficiently reliable claims data, the company updated its estimate of the narco asbestos-related liability.
accounting for the narco asbestos-related liability is an inherently subjective exercise as it requires management to make significant assumptions and judgments. given the subjectivity related to estimating the narco asbestos-related liability and the assessment of the sufficiency and reliability of the claims data, auditing the narco asbestos-related liability involved especially subjective judgment.
•we tested the effectiveness of internal controls over the estimate of the narco asbestos-related liability including management's controls over the estimate for asserted and unasserted annual contribution claims and pre-established unliquidated claims.
•we evaluated the methods and assumptions used by management to estimate the narco asbestos-related liability by:
◦reading the company's analysis and third-party assessment to evaluate the company's methodology used in the analysis.
◦confirming the claims data with the narco trust to evaluate the appropriateness of the underlying data used in the analysis.
◦making inquiries of the company's third-party specialist to identify the significant assumptions used to develop the analysis.
◦making inquiries of internal and external legal counsel regarding the regulatory and litigation environments related to the narco asbestos-related liability.
•with the assistance of our internal actuarial specialists, we developed a range of independent estimates and compared those to the company's recorded narco asbestos-related liability.
revenue recognition and contracts with customers - long-term contracts - refer to note 1 and note 3 to the financial statements critical audit matter description the company has several businesses which enter into long-term contracts whereby revenue is recognized over the contract term ("over time") as the work progresses and control of the goods and services are continuously transferred to the customer. revenue for these contracts is recognized based on the extent of progress towards completion, generally measured by using a cost-to-cost input method.
accounting for long-term contracts requires management's judgment in estimating total contract costs. contract costs, which can be incurred over several years, are largely determined based on negotiated or estimated purchase contract terms and consider factors such as historical performance trends, inflationary trends, technical and schedule risk, internal and subcontractor performance trends, business volume assumptions, asset utilization and anticipated labor agreements.
given the significance of the judgments necessary to estimate costs associated with these long-term contracts (which varies upon the length of the contract), auditing long-term contracts requires a high degree of auditor judgment.
report of independent registered public accounting firm how the critical audit matter was addressed in the audit our audit procedures related to long-term contracts included the following, among others:
•we tested the effectiveness of internal controls over the recognition of revenue and the determination of estimated contract costs including controls over the review of management's assumptions and key inputs used to recognize revenue and costs on long-term contracts using the cost-to-cost input method.
•we evaluated the appropriateness and consistency of management's methods and assumptions used to recognize revenue and costs on long-term contracts using the cost-to-cost input method to recognize revenue over time.
•we tested recorded revenue using a combination of analytical procedures and detailed contract testing.
•we profiled the population of long-term contracts with longer duration and evaluated a selection of loss contracts or contracts with significant gross margin changes against historical performance to assess management's ability to achieve estimates and to identify potential bias in the recognition of revenue over time.

(1)equity compensation plans approved by shareowners which are included in column (a) of the table are the 2016 stock incentive plan and the 2011 stock incentive plan (including 15,657,151 shares of common stock to be issued upon exercise of outstanding options; 2,886,193 rsus subject to continued employment; 197,586 rsus at target level and subject to company performance metrics and continued employment; and 415,773 deferred rsus); and the 2016 stock plan for non-employee directors and the 2006 stock plan for non-employee directors (including 175,104 shares of common stock to be issued upon exercise of outstanding options; and 8,235 rsus subject to continued services). rsus included in column (a) of the table represent the full number of rsus awarded and outstanding whereas the number of shares of common stock to be issued upon vesting will be lower than what is reflected on the table because the value of shares required to meet employee tax withholding requirements are not issued.because the number of future shares that may be distributed to employees participating in the honeywell global stock plan is unknown, no shares attributable to that plan are included in column (a) of the table above.
(2)column (b) relates to stock options and does not include any exercise price for rsus because an rsu's value is dependent upon attainment of certain performance goals and/or continued employment or service and they are settled for shares of common stock on a one-for-one basis.
(3)the number of shares that may be issued under the 2016 stock incentive plan as of december 31, 2021 is 32,337,638, which includes the following additional shares that may again be available for issuance: shares that are settled for cash, expire, are canceled, or under similar prior plans, are tendered as option exercise price or tax withholding obligations, are reacquired with cash option exercise price or with monies attributable to any tax deduction to honeywell upon the exercise of an option, or are under any outstanding awards assumed under any equity compensation plan of an entity acquired by honeywell. no securities are available for future issuance under the 2011 stock incentive plan.
the number of shares that may be issued under the honeywell global stock plan as of december 31, 2021 is 1,713,993. this plan is an umbrella plan for three plans described below maintained solely for eligible employees of participating non-u.s. countries.

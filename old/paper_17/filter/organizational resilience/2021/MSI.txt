we manage our business organizationally through two segments: "products and systems integration" and "software and services." within these segments, the company has principal product lines that also follow our three major technologies: lmr communications, video security and access control and command center software. in january 2022 we renamed one of our three major products and services technologies from lmr mission critical communications to lmr communications in an effort to more succinctly brand our lmr technology. this change was to the name of the technology only and no financial information was reclassified from previous periods.

risk factors" in this annual report;
•2019: impairment of exchange registration intangible assets of $31 million at ice futures singapore. this non-cash impairment was a result of the estimated fair value of an acquired intangible asset falling below its carrying value. see note 8 to our consolidated financial statements, included in this annual report.
the tax items in non-gaap adjustments are either the tax impacts of the pre-tax non-gaap adjustments or tax items as described below that are not in the normal course of business and are not indicative of our core business performance. the following tax-related items are included as non-gaap adjustments:
•deferred tax adjustments on acquisition-related intangibles, including the impact of u.k. and u.s. state tax law changes and apportionment updates, as well as other foreign tax law changes which resulted in deferred tax expense/(benefit) of $183 million, $36 million and ($8 million) in 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. the deferred tax adjustments in 2021 relate primarily to the u.k. tax law changes enacted in june 2021, which increased the u.k. corporate income tax rate from 19% to 25% effective april 1, 2023. the deferred tax adjustments in 2020 were due to the tax law changes enacted in july 2020, which increased the u.k. corporate income tax rate from 17% to 19% effective april 1, 2020, as well as impacts of u.s. state apportionment charges.
•other tax adjustments of $3 million in 2019 for audit settlement payments primarily related to pre-acquisition tax matters in connection with our acquisition of nyse in 2013.
for additional information on these items, refer to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report and "- recent developments," "- consolidated operating expenses", "- consolidated non-operating income (expenses)" and "-consolidated income tax provision" above.
off-balance sheet arrangements as described in note 14 to our consolidated financial statements, which are included elsewhere in this annual report, certain clearing house collateral is reported off-balance sheet. we do not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities.
contractual obligations and commercial commitments we intend to fund our contractual obligations and commercial commitments from existing cash and cash flow from operations. as of december 31, 2021, our primary cash requirements include the following contractual and other obligations.
as of december 31, 2021, we had $13.9 billion in outstanding debt, including $1.5 billion of short-term debt. our outstanding debt consists of $12.9 billion of fixed rate senior notes, $1.0 billion under our u.s. dollar commercial paper program, or the commercial paper program and $10 million under credit lines at our ice india subsidiaries.
our operating leases primarily relate to our leased office space and data center facilities, and as of december 31, 2021, we had fixed lease payment obligations of $350 million, with $82 million payable within one-year.
we have other purchase obligations to purchase various goods and services that we believe are enforceable and legally binding.
in addition, we have $150.4 billion in cash and cash equivalent margin deposits and guaranty funds, invested deposits, delivery contracts payable and unsettled variation margin. clearing members of our clearing houses are required to deposit original margin and variation margin and to make deposits to a guaranty fund. the cash and cash equivalent deposits made to these margin accounts and to the guaranty fund are recorded in the consolidated balance sheet as current assets with corresponding current liabilities to the clearing members that deposited them. ice ngx administers the physical delivery of energy trading contracts. it has an equal and offsetting claim to and from its respective participants on opposite sides of the physically-settled contract, each of which is reflected as a delivery contract receivable with an offsetting delivery contract payable. see note 14 to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report for additional information on our clearing houses and the margin deposits, guaranty funds, invested deposits, delivery contracts payable and unsettled variation margin.
we also have unrecognized tax benefits, or utbs. as of december 31, 2021, our cumulative utbs were $229 million, and accrued interest and penalties related to utbs were $49 million. we are under examination by various tax authorities. we are unable to make a reasonable estimate of the periods of cash settlement because it is not possible to reasonably predict the amount of tax, interest and penalties, if any, that might be assessed by a tax authority or the timing of an assessment or payment. it is also not possible to reasonably predict whether or not the applicable statutes of limitations might expire without us being examined by any particular tax authority. see note 13 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information on our utbs.
as of december 31, 2021, we, through nyse, have net obligations of $103 million related to our pension and other benefit programs. the date of payment under these net obligations cannot be determined. see note 16 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information on our pension and other benefit programs.
in addition, the future funding of the implementation and operation of the cat is ultimately expected to be provided by both the sros and broker-dealers. to date, however, funding has been provided solely by the sros, and future funding is expected to be repaid if industry member fees are approved by the sec and subsequently collected by industry members. see "- non-gaap measures" above.
new and recently adopted accounting pronouncements refer to note 2 to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report for information on the new and recently adopted accounting pronouncements that are applicable to us.
critical accounting policies we have identified the policies below as critical to our business operations and the understanding of our results of operations. the impact of, and any associated risks related to, these policies on our business operations is discussed throughout "- management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations." for a detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies, see note 2 to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report.
our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with u.s. gaap. the preparation of financial statements in conformity with these accounting principles requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities, and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities, at the date of our financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
we base our estimates and judgments on our historical experience and other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances when we make these estimates and judgments and re-evaluate them on a periodic basis. based on these factors, we make estimates and judgments about, among other things, the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from market prices or other independent sources and about the recognition and characterization of our revenues and expenses. the values and results based on these estimates and judgments could differ significantly under different assumptions or conditions and could change materially in the future.
we believe that the following critical accounting policies, among others, affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements and could materially increase or decrease our reported results, assets and liabilities.
goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets assets acquired and liabilities assumed in connection with our acquisitions are recorded at their estimated fair values. goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price of an acquired company over the fair value of its identifiable net assets, including identified intangible assets. we recognize specifically identifiable intangibles, such as customer relationships, trademarks, technology, trading products, data, exchange registrations, backlog, trade names and licenses when a specific right or contract is acquired. our determination of the fair value of the intangible assets and whether or not these assets may be impaired following their acquisition requires us to apply significant judgments and make significant estimates and assumptions regarding future cash flows. if we change our strategy or if market conditions shift, our judgments and estimates may change, which may result in adjustments to recorded asset balances. intangible assets with finite useful lives are amortized over their estimated useful lives whereas goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are not.
in performing the allocation of the acquisitions' purchase price to assets and liabilities, we consider, among other factors, the intended use of the acquired assets, analysis of past financial performance and estimates of future performance of the acquired business. at the acquisition date, a preliminary allocation of the purchase price is recorded based upon a preliminary valuation performed with the assistance of a third-party valuation specialist. we continue to review and assess our estimates, assumptions and valuation methodologies during the measurement period provided by gaap, which ends as soon as we receive the information about facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date or we learn that more information is not obtainable, which usually does not exceed one year from the date of acquisition. accordingly, these estimates and assumptions are subject to change, which could have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. estimation uncertainty may exist due to the sensitivity of the respective fair value to underlying assumptions about the future performance of an acquired business in our discounted cash flow models. significant assumptions typically include revenue growth rates and expense synergies that form the basis of the forecasted results and the discount rate.
our goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets are evaluated for impairment annually in our fiscal fourth quarter or more frequently if conditions exist that indicate that the value may be impaired. we test our goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level, and we have identified four reporting units, which were updated in 2020 to reflect our new segment presentation. our reporting units identified for our goodwill testing are the nyse, other exchanges, fixed income and data services, and mortgage technology reporting units. these impairment evaluations are performed by comparing the carrying value of the goodwill or other indefinite-lived intangibles to its estimated fair value.
in accordance with accounting standards update 2017-04, simplifying the test for goodwill impairment, or asu-2017, for both goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible impairment testing, we have the option to first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit or indefinite-lived intangible asset is less than its carrying amount. if the fair value of the goodwill or indefinite-lived intangible asset is less than its carrying value, an impairment loss is recognized in earnings in an amount equal to the difference. alternatively, we may choose to bypass the qualitative option and perform quantitative testing to determine if the fair value is less than the carrying value. for our goodwill impairment testing, we have elected to bypass the qualitative assessment and apply the quantitative approach. for our testing of indefinite-lived intangible assets, we apply qualitative and quantitative approaches.
application of the impairment test requires judgment, including the identification of reporting units, assignment of assets and liabilities to reporting units, assignment of goodwill to reporting units, and determination of the fair value of each reporting unit. we have historically determined the fair value of our reporting units based on various valuation techniques, including discounted cash flow analysis and a multiple of earnings approach. in assessing whether goodwill and other intangible assets are impaired, we must make estimates and assumptions regarding future cash flows, long-term growth rates of our business, operating margins, discount rates, weighted average cost of capital and other factors to determine the fair value of our assets. these estimates and assumptions require management's judgment, and changes to these estimates and assumptions, as a result of changing economic and competitive conditions, could materially affect the determination of fair value and/or impairment. during 2019, we recorded an impairment charge of $31 million on the remaining value of exchange registration intangible assets on ice futures singapore as a result of a decrease in fair value determined during our annual impairment testing. we did not record any impairments in 2021 or 2020 as a result of our goodwill or indefinite-lived impairment testing.
we are also required to evaluate other finite-lived intangible assets for impairment by first determining whether events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of these assets to be held and used may not be recoverable. if impairment indicators are present, then an estimate of undiscounted future cash flows produced by these long-lived assets is compared to the carrying value of those assets to determine if the asset is recoverable. if an asset is not recoverable, the loss is measured as the difference between fair value and carrying value of the impaired asset. fair value of these assets is based on various valuation techniques, including discounted cash flow analysis.
income taxes we are subject to income taxes in the u.s., u.k. and other foreign jurisdictions where we operate. the determination of our provision for income taxes and related accruals, deferred tax assets and liabilities requires the use of significant judgment, estimates, and the interpretation and application of complex tax laws. we recognize a current tax liability or tax asset for the estimated taxes payable or refundable on tax returns for the current year. we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax bases of our assets and liabilities. we establish valuation allowances if we believe that it is more likely than not that some or all of our deferred tax assets will not be realized. deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using current enacted tax rates in effect for the years in which those temporary differences and carryforwards are expected to reverse.
the fasb staff has provided additional guidance to address the accounting for the effects of the provisions related to the taxation of global intangible low-taxed income noting that companies should make an accounting policy election to recognize deferred taxes for temporary basis differences expected to reverse in future years or to include the tax expense in the year it is incurred. we have made a policy election to recognize such taxes as current period expenses when incurred.
we do not recognize a tax benefit unless we conclude that it is more likely than not that the benefit will be sustained on audit by the taxing authority based solely on the technical merits of the associated tax position. if the recognition threshold is met, we recognize a tax benefit measured at the largest amount of the tax benefit that, in our judgment, is greater than 50 percent likely to be realized. we recognize accrued interest and penalties related to uncertain income tax positions as income tax expense in the consolidated statements of income.
we operate within multiple domestic and foreign taxing jurisdictions and are subject to audit in these jurisdictions by domestic and foreign tax authorities. these audits include questions regarding our tax filing positions, including the timing and amount of deductions taken and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions. we record accruals for the estimated outcomes of these audits, and the accruals may change in the future due to new developments in each matter. at any point in time, many tax years are subject to or in the process of being audited by various taxing authorities. to the extent our estimates of settlements change or the final tax outcome of these matters is different from the amounts recorded, such differences will impact the income tax provision in the period in which such determinations are made. our income tax expense includes changes in our estimated liability for exposures associated with our various tax filing positions. determining the income tax expense for these potential assessments requires management to make assumptions that are subject to factors such as proposed assessments by tax authorities, changes in facts and circumstances, issuance of new regulations, and resolution of tax audits.
item 7 (a).     quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk as a result of our operating and financing activities, we are exposed to market risks such as interest rate risk, foreign currency exchange rate risk and credit risk. we have implemented policies and procedures designed to measure, manage, monitor and report risk exposures, which are regularly reviewed by the appropriate management and supervisory bodies.
interest rate risk we have exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relating to our cash and cash equivalents, short-term and long-term restricted cash and cash equivalents, short-term and long-term investments and indebtedness. as of december 31, 2021 and 2020, our cash and cash equivalents and short-term and long-term restricted cash and cash equivalents were $2.0 billion for both periods, of which $276 million and $245 million, respectively, were denominated in pounds sterling, euros or canadian dollars, and the remaining amounts are denominated in u.s. dollars. we do not use our investment portfolio for trading or other speculative purposes. a hypothetical 50% decrease in short-term interest rates would have an immaterial impact on our annual pre-tax earnings as of december 31, 2021, assuming no change in the amount or composition of our cash and cash equivalents and short-term and long-term restricted cash and cash equivalents.
as of december 31, 2021, we had $13.9 billion in outstanding debt, of which $12.9 billion relates to our fixed rate senior notes. the remaining amount outstanding of $1.0 billion relates to $1.0 billion outstanding under our commercial paper program, which bears interest at fluctuating rates, and $10 million under lines of credit at our india subsidiaries. a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in short-term interest rates relating to the amounts under our commercial paper program as of december 31, 2021 would decrease annual pre-tax earnings by $10 million, assuming no change in the volume or composition of our outstanding indebtedness and no hedging activity. see part ii, item 7, "management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations - debt," and note 10 to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report.
the interest rates on our commercial paper program are currently evaluated based upon current maturities and market conditions. the weighted average interest rate on our commercial paper program decreased from 0.40% as of december 31, 2020 to 0.33% as of december 31, 2021. the effective interest rate of commercial paper issuances will continue to fluctuate based on the movement in short-term interest rates along with shifts in supply and demand within the commercial paper market.
foreign currency exchange rate risk as an international business, we are subject to foreign currency exchange rate risk. we may experience gains or losses from foreign currency transactions in the future given that a significant part of our assets and liabilities are recorded in pounds sterling, canadian dollars or euros, and a significant portion of our revenues and expenses are recorded in pounds sterling or euros. certain assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses of foreign subsidiaries are denominated in the local functional currency of such subsidiaries. our exposure to foreign denominated earnings in 2021 and 2020 is presented by primary foreign currency in the following table (dollars in millions, except exchange rates):
pound sterling                                euro                pound sterling                                euro average exchange rate to the u.s. dollar in the current year             $1.3762                              $1.1835                      $1.2832                              $1.1412

(1)    represents the impact of currency fluctuation for the year compared to the same period in the prior year.
we have a significant part of our assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses recorded in pounds sterling or euros. in both 2021 and 2020, 13% of our consolidated revenues, less transaction-based expenses, were denominated in pounds sterling or euros, and in 2021 and 2020, 10% and 11%, respectively, of our consolidated operating expenses were denominated in pounds sterling or euros. as the pound sterling or euro exchange rate changes, the u.s. equivalent of revenues and expenses denominated in foreign currencies changes accordingly.
foreign currency transaction risk related to the settlement of foreign currency denominated assets, liabilities and payables occurs through our operations, which are received in or paid in pounds sterling, canadian dollars, or euros, due to the increase or decrease in the foreign currency exchange rates between periods. we incurred foreign currency transaction losses of $13 million and $5 million in 2021 and 2020, respectively inclusive of the impact of foreign currency hedging transactions. the foreign currency transaction losses were primarily attributable to the fluctuations of the pound sterling and euro relative to the u.s. dollar. a 10% adverse change in the underlying foreign currency exchange rates as of december 31, 2021, assuming no change in the composition of the foreign currency denominated assets, liabilities and payables and assuming no hedging activity, would result in a foreign currency loss of $15 million.
we entered into foreign currency hedging transactions during 2021 and 2020 as economic hedges to help mitigate a portion of our foreign exchange risk exposure and may enter into additional hedging transactions in the future to help mitigate our foreign exchange risk exposure. although we may enter into additional hedging transactions in the future, these hedging arrangements may not be effective, particularly in the event of imprecise forecasts of the levels of our non-u.s. denominated assets and liabilities.
we have foreign currency translation risk equal to our net investment in our foreign subsidiaries. the financial statements of these subsidiaries are translated into u.s. dollars using a current rate of exchange, with gains or losses included in the cumulative translation adjustment account, a component of equity. our exposure to the net investment in foreign currencies is presented by primary foreign currencies in the table below (in millions):

foreign currency translation adjustments are included as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income/(loss) within our balance sheet. see the table below for the portion of equity attributable to foreign currency translation adjustments as well as the activity by year included within our statement of other comprehensive income. the impact of the foreign currency exchange rate differences in the table below were primarily driven by fluctuations of the pound sterling as compared to the u.s. dollar which were 1.3524, 1.3665 and 1.3260 as of december 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively.

the future impact on our business relating to the u.k. leaving the eu and the corresponding regulatory changes are uncertain at this time, including future impacts on currency exchange rates.
credit risk we are exposed to credit risk in our operations in the event of a counterparty default. we limit our exposure to credit risk by rigorously selecting the counterparties with which we make our investments, monitoring them on an ongoing basis and executing agreements to protect our interests.
clearing house cash deposit risks the ice clearing houses hold material amounts of clearing member margin deposits which are held or invested primarily to provide security of capital while minimizing credit, market and liquidity risks. refer to note 14 to our consolidated financial statements for more information on the ice clearing houses' cash and cash equivalent margin deposits and guaranty funds, invested deposits, delivery contracts receivable and unsettled variation margin which were $150.4 billion as of december 31, 2021. while we seek to achieve a reasonable rate of return which may generate interest income for our clearing members, we are primarily concerned with preservation of capital and managing the risks associated with these deposits. as the ice clearing houses may pass on interest revenues (minus costs) to the clearing members, this could include negative or reduced yield due to market conditions. the following is a summary of the risks associated with these deposits and how these risks are mitigated:
•credit risk: when a clearing house has the ability to hold cash collateral at a central bank, the clearing house utilizes its access to the central bank system to minimize credit risk exposures. credit risk is managed by using exposure limits depending on the credit profile of the counterparty as well as the nature and maturity of transactions. our investment objective is to invest in securities that preserve principal while maximizing yields, without significantly increasing risk. we seek to substantially mitigate the credit risk associated with investments by placing them with governments, well-capitalized financial institutions and other creditworthy counterparties.
an ongoing review is performed to evaluate changes in the financial status of counterparties. in addition to the intrinsic creditworthiness of counterparties, our policies require diversification of counterparties (banks, financial institutions, bond issuers and funds) so as to avoid a concentration of risk.
•liquidity risk: liquidity risk is the risk a clearing house may not be able to meet its payment obligations in the right currency, in the right place and at the right time. to mitigate this risk, the clearing houses monitor liquidity requirements closely and maintain funds and assets in a manner which minimizes the risk of loss or delay in the access by the clearing house to such funds and assets. for example, holding funds with a central bank where possible or making only short term investments such as overnight reverse repurchase agreements serves to reduce liquidity risks.
•interest rate risk: interest rate risk is the risk that interest rates rise and cause the value of securities we hold or invest in to decline. if we were required to sell securities prior to maturity, and interest rates had risen, the sale might be made at a loss relative to the carrying value. our clearing houses seek to manage this risk by making short term investments. for example, where possible and in accordance with regulatory requirements, the clearing houses invest cash pursuant to overnight reverse repurchase agreements or term reverse repurchase agreements with short dated maturities. in addition, the clearing house investment guidelines allow for direct purchases of high quality sovereign debt (for example, u.s. treasury securities) and supranational debt instruments (euro cash deposits only) with short dated maturities.
•security issuer risk: security issuer risk is the risk that an issuer of a security defaults on the payment when the security matures or debt is serviced. this risk is mitigated by limiting allowable investments under the reverse repurchase agreements to high quality sovereign or government agency debt and limiting any direct investments to high quality sovereign debt instruments.
•investment counterparty risk: investment counterparty risk is the risk that a reverse repurchase agreement counterparty might become insolvent and, thus, fail to meet its obligations to our clearing houses. we mitigate this risk by only engaging in transactions with high credit quality counterparties and by limiting the acceptable collateral to securities of high quality issuers. when engaging in reverse repurchase agreements, our clearing houses take delivery of the securities underlying the reverse repurchase arrangement in custody accounts under clearing house control. additionally, the securities purchased subject to reverse repurchase have a market value greater than the reverse repurchase amount. the typical haircut for high quality sovereign debt is 2% of the reverse repurchase amount which provides additional excess collateral. thus, in the event that a reverse repurchase counterparty defaults on its obligation to repurchase the underlying reverse repurchase securities, our clearing house will have possession of a security with a value potentially greater than the counterparty's obligation.
the ice clearing houses may use third-party investment advisors who make investments subject to the guidelines provided by each clearing house. such advisors do not hold clearing member cash or cash equivalent deposits or the underlying investments. clearing house property is held in custody accounts under clearing house control with credit worthy custodians. the ice clearing houses employ (or may employ) multiple investment advisors and custodians to ensure that in the event a single advisor or custodian is unable to fulfill its role, additional advisors or custodians are available as alternatives.
•cross-currency margin deposit risk: each of the ice clearing houses may permit posting of cross-currency collateral to satisfy margin requirements (for example, accepting margin deposits denominated in u.s. dollars to secure a euro margin obligation). the ice clearing houses mitigate the risk of a currency value exposure by applying a "haircut" to the currency posted as margin at a level viewed as sufficient to provide financial protection during periods of currency volatility. cross-currency balances are marked-to-market on a daily basis. should the currency posted to satisfy margin requirements decline in value, the clearing member is required to increase its margin deposit on a same-day basis.
impact of inflation we have not been adversely affected by inflation as technological advances and competition have generally caused prices for the hardware and software that we use for our electronic platforms to remain constant. in the event of inflation, we believe that we will be able to pass on any price increases to our participants, as the prices that we charge are not governed by long-term contracts.

our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as such term is defined in rule 13a-15(f) and 15d-a5(f) under the securities exchange act of 1934 ("exchange act"). our internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of the consolidated financial statements. our internal control over financial reporting is supported by a program of internal audits and appropriate reviews by management, written policies and guidelines, careful selection and training of qualified personnel and a written global code of business conduct adopted by our board of directors, applicable to all of our directors and all officers and all of our employees.
because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements and even when determined to be effective, can only provide reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation. also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

report of independent registered public accounting firm on internal control over financial reporting to the stockholders and the board of directors of intercontinental exchange, inc.
opinion on internal control over financial reporting we have audited intercontinental exchange, inc. and subsidiaries' internal control over financial reporting as of december 31, 2021, based on criteria established in internal control-integrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission (2013 framework) (the coso criteria). in our opinion, intercontinental exchange, inc. and subsidiaries (the company) maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of december 31, 2021, based on the coso criteria.
we also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board (united states) (pcaob), the consolidated balance sheets of the company as of december 31, 2021 and 2020, and the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, changes in equity and redeemable non-controlling interest, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended december 31, 2021, and the related notes, and our report dated february 3, 2022 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.
basis for opinion the company's management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying "report of management on internal control over financial reporting". our responsibility is to express an opinion on the company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. we are a public accounting firm registered with the pcaob and are required to be independent with respect to the company in accordance with the u.s. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the securities and exchange commission and the pcaob.
we conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the pcaob. those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.
our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. we believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
definition and limitations of internal control over financial reporting a company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. a company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
report of independent registered public accounting firm on financial statements to the stockholders and the board of directors of intercontinental exchange, inc.
opinion on the financial statements we have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of intercontinental exchange, inc. and subsidiaries (the company) as of december 31, 2021 and 2020, and the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, changes in equity and redeemable non-controlling interest, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended december 31, 2021, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the "consolidated financial statements"). in our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the company at december 31, 2021 and 2020, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended december 31, 2021, in conformity with u.s. generally accepted accounting principles.
we also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board (united states) (pcaob), the company's internal control over financial reporting as of december 31, 2021, based on criteria established in internal control-integrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission (2013 framework), and our report dated february 3, 2022 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.
basis for opinion these financial statements are the responsibility of the company's management. our responsibility is to express an opinion on the company's financial statements based on our audits. we are a public accounting firm registered with the pcaob and are required to be independent with respect to the company in accordance with the u.s. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the securities and exchange commission and the pcaob.
we conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the pcaob. those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. we believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
critical audit matter the critical accounting matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective or complex judgments. the communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.
accounting for income taxes description of the matter 0as discussed in note 13 to the consolidated financial statements, the company operates in the united states and multiple international tax jurisdictions and is therefore subject to various tax treaty arrangements and where applicable, transfer pricing guidelines for intercompany transactions. consolidated income tax expense, including the liability for unrecognized tax benefits, is an estimate based on management's understanding and interpretation of current enacted tax laws and tax rates of each tax jurisdiction. for the year-ended december 31, 2021, the company recognized consolidated income tax expense of $1.629 billion, and as of december 31, 2021, the company accrued liabilities of $229 million for unrecognized tax benefits.
auditing the company's accounting for consolidated income tax expense was complex because management's calculation of consolidated income tax expense involves application and interpretation of complex tax laws. further, the identification and measurement of unrecognized tax benefits requires significant management judgment and estimation. each tax position may involve unique facts and circumstances to be evaluated, and there may be uncertainties around initial recognition and de-recognition of tax positions, including regulatory changes, litigation and examination activity.
how we addressed the matter in our audit we tested the company's controls that address the risks of material misstatement relating to the company's consolidated income tax expense. for example, we tested controls over management's calculation of the federal, state and foreign components of income tax expense including management's controls over the identification and ongoing review of its unrecognized tax benefits.
to test consolidated income tax expense, we performed audit procedures that included, among others, recalculation of consolidated income tax expense and agreeing the data used in the calculations to the company's underlying books and records. we involved our tax professionals to evaluate the application of tax law to management's calculation methodologies and tax positions. we also evaluated assumptions the company used to develop its tax positions and related unrecognized tax benefit amounts by jurisdiction. for example, we compared the estimated liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits to similar positions in prior periods and assessed management's consideration of current tax controversy and litigation and trends in similar positions challenged by tax authorities. we also evaluated the adequacy of the company's disclosures included in note 13 in relation to these tax matters.

2.summary of significant accounting policies basis of presentation the accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared by us in accordance with u.s. generally accepted accounting principles, or u.s. gaap. these statements include the accounts of our wholly-owned and controlled subsidiaries. for consolidated subsidiaries in which our ownership is less than 100% and for which we have control over the assets and liabilities and the management of the entity, the outside stockholders' interests are shown as non-controlling interests.
all intercompany balances and transactions between us and our wholly-owned and controlled subsidiaries have been eliminated in consolidation. the financial results of companies we acquire are included from the acquisition dates and the results of companies we sold are included up to the disposition dates. the accounting policies used to prepare these financial statements are the same as those used to prepare the consolidated financial statements in prior years except as described in these footnotes or for the adoption of new standards as outlined below.
use of estimates preparing financial statements in conformity with u.s. gaap requires us to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying disclosures. actual amounts could differ from those estimates.
comprehensive income other comprehensive income includes foreign currency translation adjustments, comprehensive income from a change in an equity method investment, and amortization of the difference in the projected benefit obligation and the accumulated benefit obligation associated with benefit plan liabilities, net of tax.
segment and geographic information as of december 31, 2021, our business is conducted through three reportable business segments: our exchanges segment, our fixed income and data services segment, and our mortgage technology segment. this presentation is reflective of how our chief operating decision maker reviews and operates our business. the majority of our identifiable assets are located in the u.s and u.k. (note 18).
cash and cash equivalents, short-term and long-term restricted cash and cash equivalents, and cash and cash equivalent margin deposits and guaranty funds cash and cash equivalents we consider all short-term, highly liquid investments with maturities of three months or less at the time of purchase to be cash equivalents.
short-term and long-term restricted cash and cash equivalents we classify all cash and cash equivalents that are not available for immediate or general business use by us as restricted in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets (note 6). this includes amounts set aside due to regulatory requirements, earmarked for specific purposes, or restricted by specific agreements. we also invest a portion of funds in excess of short-term operating needs in term deposits and investment-grade marketable debt securities, including government or government-sponsored agencies and corporate debt securities. these are classified as cash equivalents, are short-term in nature and carrying amount approximates fair value.
original margin, variation margin and guaranty funds received by our clearing houses may be in the form of cash, government obligations, certain agency debt, letters of credit or on rare occasions, gold (note 14). we hold the cash deposits at central banks, highly-rated financial institutions or at times secure the cash through reverse repurchase agreements or direct investments, certain of which are not cash equivalents. see "credit risk and significant customers", below. although not included in short term restricted cash and cash equivalents, cash and cash equivalent margin represent a form of restricted cash. the amount of cash and cash equivalent margin deposits on hand will fluctuate over time as a result of, among other things, the extent of open positions held at any point in time by market participants in contracts and the margin rates then in effect for such contracts, as well as the extent to which we invest in non-cash and cash equivalents.
consolidated statement of cash flows presentation as of december 31, 2021, we revised our consolidated statements of cash flows to include changes in cash and cash equivalent margin within cash flows from financing activities and changes in invested margin deposits within cash flows from investing activities. this immaterial revision did not have an effect on our previously reported consolidated balance sheets, statements of income, statements of comprehensive income, or statements of changes in equity and redeemable non-controlling interest or the related disclosures. cash and cash equivalent margin amounts cannot be used to satisfy the company's operating or other liabilities, as further discussed in note 14. the following table summarizes the immaterial revisions to our historical consolidated statements of cash flows for each of the years presented (in millions):

a reconciliation of the components of cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and cash equivalents, and cash and cash equivalent margin deposits and guaranty funds as presented in the consolidated statements of cash flows to the balance sheet is as follows (in millions):
as of                as of december 31, 2020                as of december 31, 2019                as of december 31, 2018
investments we have made various investments in the equity securities of other companies. we also invest in mutual funds and fixed income securities. we classify all other investments that are not cash equivalents with original maturity dates of less than one year as short-term investments and all investments that we intend to hold for more than one year as long-term investments. short-term and long-term investments are included in other current and other non-current assets, respectively, in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.
equity investments investments in equity securities, or equity investments, are carried at fair value, with changes in fair value, whether realized or unrealized, recognized in net income. for those investments that we do not control and which do not have readily determinable fair market values, such as those which are not publicly-listed companies, we have made a fair value policy election under asu no. 2016-01, financial instruments - overall (subtopic 825-10): recognition and measurement of financial assets and financial liabilities, or asu 2016-01. the election requires us to only adjust the fair value of such investments if and when there is an observable price change in an orderly transaction of a similar or identical investment, with any change in fair value recognized in net income.
equity method investments when we do not have a controlling financial interest in an entity but exercise significant influence over the entity's operating and financial policies, such investments are accounted for using the equity method and included in other non-current assets. we recognize dividends when declared as a reduction in the carrying value of our equity method investments. we evaluate our equity method investments for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that a decline in value has occurred that is other than temporary. if the investment is determined to have a decline in value deemed to be other than temporary it is written down to estimated fair value. we did not identify impairment associated with our equity method investments as of december 31, 2021.
property and equipment property and equipment is recorded at cost, reduced by accumulated depreciation (note 7). depreciation and amortization is computed using the straight-line method based on estimated useful lives of the assets, or in the case of leasehold improvements, the shorter of the initial lease term or the estimated useful life of the improvement. we review the remaining estimated useful lives at each balance sheet date and make adjustments whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the remaining useful lives have changed. gains on disposals are included in other income and losses on disposals are included in depreciation expense. maintenance and repair costs are expensed as incurred.
allowance for doubtful accounts on january 1, 2020, we adopted asu 2016-13, financial instruments - measurement of credit losses on financial instruments, or asu 2016-13. under asu 2016-13, we estimate our allowance for doubtful accounts using an aging method, disaggregated based on major revenue stream categories as well as other unique revenue stream factors. the allowance for doubtful accounts is maintained at a level that we believe to be sufficient to absorb probable losses over the expected life in our accounts receivable portfolio. the allowance is based on several factors, including continuous assessments of risk characteristics, specific customer events that may impact its ability to meet its financial obligations, and other reasonable and supportable economic characteristics. accounts receivable are written-off against the allowance for doubtful accounts when collection efforts cease. see "adoption of asu 2016-13, financial instruments - measurement of credit losses on financial instruments", below, for a reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of allowance for doubtful accounts and other disclosures related to our adoption of asu 2016-13.
software development costs we capitalize costs related to software we develop or obtain for internal use. the costs capitalized include both internal and external direct and incremental costs. general and administrative costs related to developing or obtaining such software are expensed as incurred. development costs incurred during the preliminary or maintenance project stages are expensed as incurred. costs incurred during the application development stage are capitalized and amortized using the straight-line method over the useful life of the software, generally not exceeding three years (except for certain ice data services, ice mortgage technology and nyse platforms, which have seven-year useful lives). amortization begins only when the software becomes ready for its intended use.
accrued employee benefits we have a defined benefit pension plan and other postretirement benefit plans, or collectively the "benefit plans," covering certain of our u.s. operations. the benefit accrual for the pension plan is frozen. we recognize the funded status of the benefit plans in our consolidated balance sheets, measure the fair value of plan assets and benefit obligations as of the date of our fiscal year-end, and provide additional disclosures in the footnotes (note 16).
benefit plan costs and liabilities are dependent on assumptions used in calculating such amounts. these are provided by a third-party specialist and include discount rates, health care cost trend rates, benefits earned, interest cost, expected return on assets, mortality rates and other factors. actual results that differ from the assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods and, therefore, generally affect recognized expense and the recorded obligation in future periods. however, certain of these unrecognized amounts are recognized when triggering events occur, such as when a settlement of pension obligations in excess of total interest and service costs occurs. while we believe that the assumptions used are appropriate, differences in actual experience or changes in assumptions may affect our pension and other post-retirement obligations and future expense recognized.
goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price of our acquisitions over the fair value of identifiable net assets acquired, including other identified intangible assets (note 8). we recognize specifically-identifiable intangibles when a specific right or contract is acquired with the assistance of third-party valuation specialists. goodwill has been allocated to our reporting units for purposes of impairment testing based on the portion of synergy, cost savings and other expected future cash flows expected to benefit the reporting units at the time of the acquisition. our reporting units were updated in 2020 to reflect our new segment presentation. the reporting units identified for our goodwill testing are the nyse, other exchanges, fixed income and data services, and mortgage technology reporting units. goodwill impairment testing is performed annually at the reporting unit level in the fiscal fourth quarter or more frequently if conditions exist that indicate that it may be impaired, or if changes are made to the reporting units. in 2020, we performed a goodwill impairment test prior to and after the change in our reporting units.
we also evaluate indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment annually in our fiscal fourth quarter or more frequently if conditions exist that indicate that an asset may be impaired.
for both goodwill and indefinite-lived impairment testing we have the option to first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit or indefinite lived intangible asset is less than its carrying amount. if the fair value of the goodwill or indefinite-lived intangible asset is less than its carrying value, an impairment loss is recognized in earnings in an amount equal to the difference. alternatively, we may choose to bypass the qualitative option and perform quantitative testing to determine if the fair value is less than carrying value. for our goodwill impairment testing, we have elected to bypass the qualitative assessment and apply the quantitative approach. for our testing of indefinite-lived intangible assets, we apply qualitative and quantitative approaches.
impairment of long-lived assets and finite-lived intangible assets we review our finite-lived intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be fully recoverable. when these indicators exist, we project undiscounted net future cash flows over the remaining life of such assets. if the sum of the projected cash flows is less than the carrying amount, an impairment would exist, measured based upon the difference between the carrying amount and the fair value of the assets. finite-lived intangible assets are generally amortized using the straight-line method or an accelerated method over the lesser of their contractual or estimated useful lives.
derivatives and hedging activity periodically, we may use derivative financial instruments to manage exposure to changes in currency exchange rates. all derivatives are recorded at fair value. we generally do not designate these derivatives as hedges for accounting purposes. accordingly, changes in fair value are recognized in income.
we entered into foreign currency hedging transactions during 2021, 2020 and 2019 as economic hedges to help mitigate a portion of our foreign exchange risk exposure. the gains and losses on these transactions were not material during these years.
intellectual property all costs related to internally developed patents and trademarks are expensed as incurred. all costs related to purchased patents, trademarks and internet domain names are recorded as other intangible assets and are amortized using a straight-line method over their estimated useful lives. all costs related to licensed patents are capitalized and amortized using a straight-line method over the term of the license.
income taxes we recognize income taxes under the liability method. we recognize a current tax liability or tax asset for the estimated taxes payable or refundable on tax returns for the current year. we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax bases of assets and liabilities. we establish valuation allowances if we believe that it is more likely than not that some or all of our deferred tax assets will not be realized. deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using current enacted tax rates in effect. we do not recognize a tax benefit unless we conclude that it is more likely than not that the benefit will be sustained on audit by the taxing authority based solely on the technical merits of the associated tax position. if the recognition threshold is met, we recognize a tax benefit measured at the largest amount of the tax benefit that, in our judgment, is greater than 50 percent likely to be realized. we recognize accrued interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions as a component of income tax expense. we recognize the tax effects related to global intangible low-taxed income in the period it is incurred.
we are subject to tax in numerous domestic and foreign jurisdictions primarily based on our operations in these jurisdictions. significant judgment is required in assessing the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns. fluctuations in the actual outcome of these future tax consequences could have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations.
we use a portfolio approach with respect to pension, postretirement benefits plan obligations and currency translation matters when we determine the timing and extent to which stranded income tax effects from items that were previously recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income are released.
revenue recognition our revenues primarily consist of revenues for transactions executed and/or cleared through our global electronic derivatives trading and clearing exchanges and cash equities trading as well as revenues related to our fixed income, data services, mortgage technology services and listings. we recognize revenue when we transfer promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which we expect to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. we enter into contracts that can include various combinations of products and services, which are generally capable of being distinct and accounted for as separate performance obligations. we also evaluate all contracts in order to determine appropriate gross versus net revenue reporting.
substantially all of our revenues are considered to be revenues from contracts with customers. the related accounts receivable balances are recorded in our balance sheets as customer accounts receivable. we do not have obligations for warranties, returns or refunds to customers, other than rebates, which are settled each period and therefore do not result in variable consideration. we do not have significant revenue recognized from performance obligations that were satisfied in prior periods, and we do not have any transaction price allocated to unsatisfied performance obligations other than in our deferred revenue. certain judgments and estimates are used in the identification and timing of satisfaction of performance obligations and the related allocation of transaction price. we believe that these represent a faithful depiction of the transfer of services to our customers.
deferred revenue represents our contract liabilities related to our annual, original and other listings revenues, certain data services, clearing services, mortgage technology services and other revenues. deferred revenue is our only significant contract asset or liability. see note 9 for our discussion of deferred revenue balances, activity, and expected timing of recognition.
we have elected not to provide disclosures about transaction price allocated to unsatisfied performance obligations if contract durations are less than one year, or if we are not required to estimate the transaction price. for all of our contracts with customers, except for listings and certain data, mortgage and clearing services, our performance obligations are short term in nature and there is no significant variable consideration. in addition, we have elected the practical expedient of excluding sales taxes from transaction prices. we have assessed the costs incurred to obtain or fulfill a contract with a customer and determined them to be immaterial.
activity assessment fees and section 31 fees we pay the securities and exchange commission, or sec, fees pursuant to section 31 of the securities exchange act of 1934 for transactions executed on our u.s. equities and options exchanges. these section 31 fees are designed to recover the costs to the government for supervising and regulating the securities markets and securities professionals. we (or the options clearing corporation, or occ, on our behalf), in turn, collect activity assessment fees, which are included in exchanges revenues in the accompanying consolidated statements of income, from member organizations clearing or settling trades on the u.s. equities and options exchanges and recognize these amounts as revenue when invoiced. fees received are included in cash at the time of receipt and, as required by law, the amount due to the sec is remitted semi-annually and recorded as an accrued liability until paid. the activity assessment fees are designed so that they are equal to the section 31 fees paid by us to the sec. as a result, section 31 fees do not have an impact on our net income.
stock-based compensation we currently sponsor stock option plans, restricted stock plans and our employee stock purchase plan, or espp, to provide additional and incentive-based compensation to our employees and directors (note 11). stock options and restricted stock are granted at the discretion of the compensation committee of the board of directors. we measure and recognize compensation expense for share-based payment awards, including employee stock options, restricted stock and shares purchased under the espp based on estimated fair values on the date of grant. the value of the portion of the award that is ultimately expected to vest is recognized as stock-based compensation expense over the requisite service period.
we use the black-scholes pricing model to value stock option awards as well as shares purchased as part of our espp. the values estimated by the model are affected by the price of our stock as well as subjective variables that include assumed interest rates, our expected dividend yield, our expected share price volatility over the term of the awards and actual and projected employee stock option exercise behavior. under our espp, employees may purchase shares of our common stock at a price equal to 85% of the lesser of the fair market value of the stock on the first or the last trading day of each offering period. we record compensation expenses related to the discount given to our participating employees.
treasury stock we record treasury stock activities under the cost method whereby the cost of the acquired stock is recorded as treasury stock (note 12). in the event it occurs in the future, our accounting policy upon the formal retirement of treasury stock is to deduct the par value from common stock and to reflect any excess of cost over par value as a deduction from additional paid-in capital (to the extent created by previous issuances of the shares) and retained earnings.
credit risk and significant customers our clearing houses are exposed to credit risk as a result of maintaining clearing member cash deposits at various financial institutions (note 14). cash deposit accounts are established at large, highly-rated financial institutions and entered into so that they restrict the rights of offset or imposition of liens by the banks. we also limit our risk of loss by holding the majority of the cash deposits in cash accounts at the federal reserve bank of chicago, high quality short-term sovereign debt reverse repurchase agreements with several different counterparty banks or direct investments in short-term high quality sovereign and supranational debt issues primarily with original maturities of less than three months. while we seek to achieve a reasonable rate of return which may generate interest income for our clearing members, we are primarily concerned with preservation of capital and managing the risks associated with these deposits. as the clearing houses may pass on interest revenues, minus costs, to the members, this could include negative or reduced yield due to market conditions.
when engaging in reverse repurchase agreements, our clearing houses take delivery of the underlying securities in custody accounts under clearing house control. additionally, the securities purchased have a market value greater than the reverse repurchase amount. the typical haircut received for high quality sovereign debt is 2% of the reverse repurchase amount. thus, in the event that a reverse repurchase counterparty defaults on its obligation to repurchase the underlying reverse repurchase securities, our clearing house will have possession of securities with a value potentially greater than the reverse repurchase counterparty's obligation to the clearing house.
ice clear credit, a systemically important financial market utility as designated by the financial stability oversight council, maintains a u.s. dollar account at the federal reserve bank of chicago as of december 31, 2021. ice clear europe maintains a euro-denominated account at the european central bank, or ecb, the central bank of the netherlands, as well as pounds sterling- and euro-denominated accounts at the bank of england, or boe, the central bank of the u.k. these accounts provide the flexibility for ice clear europe to place euro- and pounds sterling-denominated cash margin securely at national banks, in particular during periods when liquidity in the euro and pounds sterling repo markets may temporarily become contracted. such accounts are intended to decrease ice clear credit and ice clear europe's custodial, liquidity and operational risk as compared to alternative custodial and investment arrangements.
our futures businesses have minimal credit risk as the majority of their transaction revenues are currently cleared through our clearing houses. our accounts receivable related to fixed income and data services revenues, cash trading, listing revenues, technology revenues, cds and bilateral otc energy transaction revenues and mortgage technology services subjects us to credit (collection) risk, as we do not require these customers to post collateral. we limit our risk of loss by terminating a customer's ability to remain listed or receive data or terminating other services for entities with delinquent accounts. the concentration of risk on accounts receivable is also mitigated by the large number of entities comprising our customer base.
our accounts receivable are stated at the billed amount. excluding clearing members, there were no individual accounts receivable balances greater than 10% of total consolidated accounts receivable as of december 31, 2021 or december 31, 2020. no single customer accounted for more than 10% of total consolidated revenues, less transaction-based expenses, during 2021, 2020 or 2019.
leases operating lease right-of-use assets and liabilities are recorded at the lease commencement date based on the present value of the lease payments to be made over the lease term using an estimated incremental borrowing rate. we expense rent monthly on a straight-line basis, as a reduction to the right-of-use asset. rent expense is included in rent and occupancy expenses and technology and communication expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements of income (notes 2 and 15). see "recently adopted accounting pronouncements," below, for the lease accounting standard that we adopted on january 1, 2019 and its impact on our financial statements.
acquisition-related transaction and integration costs we incur incremental costs relating to our completed and potential acquisitions and other strategic opportunities. this includes fees for investment banking advisors, lawyers, accountants, tax advisors and public relations firms, as well as costs associated with credit facilities and other external costs directly related to the proposed or closed transactions.
the acquisition-related transaction and integration costs incurred during 2021 are primarily related to our integration of ellie mae and the bakkt transaction (note 3). the acquisition-related transaction and integration costs incurred during 2020 primarily relate to costs incurred for our acquisitions of ellie mae and bridge2 solutions. acquisition-related transaction and integration costs were nominal in 2019.
fair value of financial instruments fair value is the price that would be received from selling an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. our financial instruments consist primarily of certain short-term and long-term assets and liabilities, customer accounts receivable, margin deposits and guaranty funds, equity and equity method investments, and short-term and long-term debt (note 17).
the fair value of our financial instruments is measured based on a three-level hierarchy:
•level 1 inputs - quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets.
•level 2 inputs - observable inputs other than level 1 inputs such as quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets or inputs other than quoted prices that are directly observable.
•level 3 inputs - unobservable inputs supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities.
foreign currency translation adjustments and foreign currency transaction gains and losses our functional and reporting currency is the u.s. dollar. we have exposure to foreign currency translation gains and losses arising from our net investment in certain u.k., continental european, asian and canadian subsidiaries. the revenues, expenses and financial results of these subsidiaries are recorded in the functional currency of the countries that these subsidiaries are located in, which are primarily pounds sterling and euros. the financial statements of these subsidiaries are translated into u.s. dollars using a current rate of exchange, with gains or losses, net of tax as applicable, included in the cumulative translation adjustment account, a component of equity. as of december 31, 2021 and 2020, the portion of our equity attributable to accumulated other comprehensive loss from foreign currency translation adjustments was $150 million and $134 million, respectively.
we have foreign currency transaction gains and losses related to the settlement of foreign currency denominated assets, liabilities and payables that occur through our operations. these transaction gains and losses are due to the increase or decrease in the foreign currency exchange rates between periods. forward contracts on foreign currencies are entered into to manage the foreign currency exchange rate risk. gains and losses from foreign currency transactions are included in other income (expense) in the accompanying consolidated statements of income and resulted in net losses of $13 million, $5 million and $5 million in 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.
earnings per common share basic earnings per common share is calculated using the weighted average common shares outstanding during the year. common equivalent shares from stock options and restricted stock awards, using the treasury stock method, are included in the diluted per share calculations unless the effect of inclusion would be antidilutive (note 19).

asu 2017-04, simplifying the test for goodwill impairment, removes the second step of the goodwill impairment test, which requires a hypothetical purchase price allocation if the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value. goodwill impairment will now be measured using the difference between the carrying value and the fair value of the reporting unit, and any loss recognized should not exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     we adopted on january 1, 2020 on a prospective basis.                                                                                                       we evaluated this guidance to determine the impact on our consolidated financial statements. based on our assessment, we concluded the impact of adoption of this guidance was not material. the fair values of our reporting units have been greater than their corresponding carrying values in recent years. changes in future projections, market conditions, and other factors may cause a change in the excess of fair value of our reporting units over their corresponding carrying values.
asu 2018-15, customer's accounting for implementation costs incurred in a cloud computing arrangement that is a service contract, helps entities evaluate the accounting for fees paid by a customer in a cloud computing arrangement by providing guidance for determining when an arrangement includes a software license and is solely a hosted service. customers will now apply the same criteria for capitalizing implementation costs as they would for a software license arrangement. the guidance also prescribes the balance sheet, income statement, and cash flow classification of the capitalized implementation costs and related amortization expense, and requires additional quantitative and qualitative disclosures.          we adopted on january 1, 2020 and apply the rules prospectively to eligible costs incurred on or after the effective date.                                  we evaluated this guidance to determine the impact on our consolidated financial statements. based on our assessment, we concluded the impact of adoption of this guidance was not material.
asu no. 2019-12, simplifying the accounting for income taxes, eliminates certain exceptions related to the approach for intraperiod tax allocation, the methodology for calculating income taxes in an interim period and the recognition of deferred tax liabilities for outside basis differences. it clarifies that single-member limited liability companies, and other similar disregarded entities that are not subject to income tax, are not required to recognize an allocation of consolidated income tax expense in their separate financial statements. further, it simplifies the accounting for franchise taxes, enacted changes in tax laws or rates and transactions that result in a step-up in the tax basis of goodwill.        effective for fiscal years beginning after december 15, 2020 with early adoption permitted. we elected early adoption and adopted on january 1, 2020.       we evaluated this guidance to determine the impact on our consolidated financial statements. based on our assessment, we concluded the impact of adoption of this guidance was not material.

asu 2018-07, compensation-stock compensation (topic 718) - improvements to nonemployee share-based payment accounting, or asu 2018-07 aligns the accounting for share-based payment awards issued to employees and nonemployees. under this new guidance, the existing employee guidance will now apply to nonemployee share-based transactions.                                          effective for fiscal years beginning after december 15, 2018. adopted on january 1, 2019.                                                                                                                                                 this guidance is applied to all new awards granted after the date of adoption, and adoption did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements or related disclosures.
asu 2018-14, compensation-retirement benefits-defined benefit plans - general (subtopic 715-20): disclosure framework-changes to the disclosure requirements for defined benefit plans, or asu 2018-14 was issued in august 2018 and removes certain disclosures that are not considered cost beneficial, clarifies certain required disclosures and adds additional disclosures.         effective for fiscal years beginning after december 15, 2020 with early adoption permitted. we elected early adoption and adopted on december 31, 2019. the amendments in asu 2018-14 are required to be applied retrospectively.         upon adoption we eliminated certain disclosure requirements related to our defined benefit plans that were previously disclosed in note 16. certain other disclosure requirements described in subtopic 715-20 were not applicable to us.
we do not currently expect that any pending accounting pronouncements will have a material impact on our financial statements.
adoption of asu 2016-02, leases on january 1, 2019, we adopted accounting standards update, or asu, 2016-02, leases, or asu 2016-02. this standard requires recognition of both assets and liabilities arising from finance and operating leases, along with additional qualitative and quantitative disclosures. asu 2016-02 requires lessees to recognize a right-of-use asset representing a right to use the underlying asset over the lease term, and a corresponding lease liability on the balance sheet. our operating leases primarily relate to our leased office space and data center facilities, and we do not have any leases classified as finance leases.
we adopted asu 2016-02 using the modified retrospective transition method and did not restate prior periods. using the modified retrospective approach, we applied the provisions of asu 2016-02 beginning in the period of adoption, and elected the package of practical expedients available to us. there was no impact to the opening balance of retained earnings as a result of a cumulative-effect adjustment on the adoption date.
at lease inception, we review the service arrangement and components of a contract to identify if a lease or embedded lease arrangement exists. an indicator of a contract containing a lease is when we have the right to control and use an identified asset over a period of time in exchange for consideration. operating lease right-of-use assets and liabilities are recognized at the commencement date based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term, using our estimated incremental borrowing rate. we utilize the short-term lease policy election to recognize leases with a term of 12 months or less as lease expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term and do not recognize these short-term leases on our balance sheet. we have elected the practical expedient of not separating lease and non-lease components as our lease arrangements are not highly dependent on other underlying assets. we have also made policy elections related to capitalization thresholds and discount rates. we have elected to use a portfolio approach in consideration of our incremental borrowing rate to our population of lease agreements. our incremental borrowing rate is determined based on indicative new issue pricing estimates reflecting our existing debt issuances and comparable industry debt issuances. certain lease agreements include options to extend, renew or terminate the lease agreement. our lease agreements do not contain any residual value guarantees. as of december 31, 2021, the weighted-average remaining lease term was 5.1 years and the weighted average discount rate was 3.1%. as of december 31, 2020, the weighted-average remaining lease term was 5.8 years and the weighted average discount rate was 3.1%. our lease agreements do not contain any residual value guarantees.
we recognize rent expense monthly on a straight-line basis for each respective operating lease, as a reduction to the right-of-use asset. we recognized $61 million, $46 million and $41 million of rent expense for office space as rent and occupancy expense in 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively, and $24 million, $22 million and $21 million of rent expense for data center facilities as technology and communication expense in 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively, within our consolidated income statement. we do not have any significant variable lease costs related to building and maintenance costs, real estate taxes, or other charges.
details of our lease asset and liability balances are as follows (in millions):
as of december 31, 2021                as of december 31, 2020                            as of january 1, 2019

as of december 31, 2021, we estimate that our operating lease liability will be recognized in the following years (in millions):
total operating lease liability      $324
supplemental cash flow information and non-cash activity related to our operating leases are as follows:
cash paid for amounts included in the measurement of operating lease liability                           $91                                 $72

adoption of asu 2016-13, financial instruments - measurement of credit losses on financial instruments on january 1, 2020, we adopted asu 2016-13. this standard requires the application of a current expected credit loss, or cecl, impairment model to financial assets measured at amortized cost, including accounts receivable and certain off-balance-sheet credit exposures. the standard also amends the impairment model for available-for-sale debt securities requiring entities to record credit losses through an allowance account. the cecl model requires an entity to estimate its lifetime expected credit loss and record an allowance that, when deducted from the amortized cost basis of the financial asset, presents the net amount expected to be collected on the financial asset.
we adopted asu 2016-13 using the modified retrospective approach through a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings on january 1, 2020. asu 2016-13 primarily impacted the calculation of our allowance for doubtful accounts on accounts receivable utilizing the expected credit losses model. we do not currently hold available-for-sale debt securities, off-balance-sheet credit exposures, or other material financial assets impacted by the standard, besides those mentioned below.
we consider our material financial assets within scope, including our cash equivalents, short-term and long-term restricted cash equivalents as well as our clearing members' cash equivalent and reverse repurchase receivables, and determined that such assets have a de minimis risk of credit loss. we invest our cash and clearing members' cash by placing it in highly-rated government securities, primarily u.s. treasury securities and other sovereign debt with original maturities of less than three months which we consider to be cash equivalents, or into reverse repurchase agreements, referred to as reverse repos, with primarily overnight maturities. reverse repos are valued daily and are subject to collateral maintenance provisions whereby the counterparty must provide additional collateral if the value of the underlying securities lose value, in an amount sufficient to maintain collateralization of at least 102%. therefore, as of and for the year ended december 31, 2021 we have not recorded a credit loss for these financial assets.
based on the high turnover and collectability of our accounts receivable, the mitigated default and concentration risks due to the high quality and large number of entities comprising our customer base, and the monthly billing process for the majority of our revenue, we have not experienced a significant increase in the loss provision recognized upon adoption of the cecl model.
we estimate our allowance for doubtful accounts using an aging method, disaggregated based on major revenue stream categories as well as other unique revenue stream factors. at each measurement date we reassess whether our accounts receivable pools continue to exhibit similar risk characteristics. we then determine if assets need to be isolated further as part of their own specific line item reserve due to specific events, such as a customer's inability to meet its financial obligations (i.e. customer disputes, highly unresponsive customers, delinquency of the receivable, or other indicators of credit deterioration of customers). lastly, the cecl standard is forward-looking and requires us to factor reasonable and supportable economic expectations into our allowance estimate for the asset's entire expected life, which is generally less than one year.
a reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of allowance for doubtful accounts is as follows for the years ended december 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019 (in millions):
beginning balance of allowance for doubtful accounts            $27                        $8                      $7

simplifile, lc, or simplifile       june 12, 2019           mortgage technology        simplifile offers an array of mortgage services, primarily serving as an electronic liaison between lenders, settlement agents and county recording offices, streamlining the local recording of residential mortgage transactions and is now part of ice mortgage technology. see below for the simplifile purchase price allocation.
ellie mae acquisition on september 4, 2020, we acquired ellie mae for aggregate consideration of $11.4 billion from private equity firm thoma bravo. the purchase price consisted of $9.5 billion in cash, as adjusted for $335 million of cash and cash equivalents held by ellie mae on the date of acquisition, and approximately $1.9 billion, or approximately 18.4 million shares of our common stock, based on our stock price on the acquisition date. ice funded the cash portion of the purchase price with net proceeds from our offering of new senior notes in august 2020, together with the issuance of commercial paper and borrowings under a new senior unsecured term loan facility (note 10). we have evaluated the impact of this acquisition and related disclosures under asc 805- business combinations.
the purchase price has been allocated to the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets and liabilities based on the respective estimated fair values on the date of acquisition, as determined with the assistance of a third-party valuation specialist. the excess of purchase price over the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets has been recorded as goodwill. goodwill represents potential revenue synergies related to new product development, various expense synergies and opportunities to enter new markets. the purchase price allocation is as follows (in millions):
purchase price allocation cash and cash equivalents                                                  $335
total purchase price allocation                                         $11,428
in performing the purchase price allocation, we considered, among other factors, the intended future use of acquired assets, analysis of historical financial performance and estimates of future performance of the ellie mae business.
the following table sets forth the components of the intangible assets associated with the acquisition as of december 31, 2021 (in millions, except years):

from the acquisition date through december 31, 2020, ellie mae revenues of $351 million, were included in our mortgage technology revenues, and operating expenses of $250 million were recorded in our consolidated income statement.
the financial information in the table below summarizes the combined results of operations of ice and ellie mae, on a pro forma basis, as though the companies had been combined as of the beginning of the period presented. the unaudited pro forma financial information is presented for informational purposes only and is not indicative of the results of operations that would have been achieved if the acquisition had taken place at the beginning of the period presented. such unaudited pro forma financial information is based on the historical financial statements of ice and ellie mae. this unaudited pro forma financial information is based on estimates and assumptions that have been made solely for purposes of developing such unaudited pro forma information, including, without limitation, purchase accounting adjustments, interest expense on debt issued to finance the purchase price, acquisition-related transaction costs, the removal of historical ellie mae intangible asset amortization and the addition of intangible asset amortization related to this acquisition. the unaudited pro forma financial information does not reflect any synergies or operating cost reductions that have been and may be achieved from the combined operations. the unaudited pro forma financial information combines the historical results for us and ellie mae for 2020 in the following table (in millions, except per share amounts).
transaction-based expenses included within revenues, less transaction-based expenses in the table above, were not impacted by pro forma adjustments and agree to the amounts presented historically in our consolidated income statements as they relate solely to ice and not to ellie mae.
bakkt transaction on october 15, 2021, bakkt holdings, llc, or bakkt, completed its merger with vpc impact acquisition holdings, or vih, a special purpose acquisition company sponsored by victory park capital, or vpc. bakkt is an integrated platform that enables customers and consumers to transact in digital assets.
the business combination between bakkt and vih resulted in enterprise value of approximately $2.1 billion, including approximately $479 million of cash on the combined company's balance sheet, reflecting a contribution of up to $123 million of cash held in vih's trust account, and a $325 million concurrent private investment in public equity, or pipe, of class a common stock of the combined company and $31 million of cash held in bakkt accounts. the pipe was priced at $10.00 per share and included a $47 million commitment from us. the newly combined company has been renamed bakkt holdings, inc. and is listed on the new york stock exchange, or nyse.
as part of the transaction, bakkt's existing equity holders and management rolled 100% of their equity into the combined company through a retained variable interest in bakkt and are subject to a six-month lockup period. certain shareholders of vih exercised their redemption rights, and at closing, bakkt equity holders, including ice, owned approximately 81% of the combined company, vih's public shareholders owned approximately 5%, vpc owned 2%, and pipe investors (a group that also includes us) owned approximately 12% of the issued and outstanding equity of the combined company.
following completion of the business combination, we initially held a 68% economic interest, which includes both our variable interest and pipe investment. as a result of limitations on ice from the bakkt voting agreement entered into in connection with the transaction, we hold a minority voting interest in the combined company. prior to the closing, bakkt revenues and operating expenses were reported within our consolidated revenues and operating expenses. following the closing, as a consequence of our inability to meet the power criterion through our variable interest and because of holding a minority voting interest in the combined company, during the fourth quarter of 2021 we deconsolidated bakkt upon loss of control and prospectively treat it as an equity method investment within our financial statements. we recorded a pre-tax gain on the transaction of $1.4 billion during the fourth quarter of 2021, which is included in other non-operating income within our consolidated income statement. the pre-tax gain is a result of recording an equity method investment value of $1.7 billion plus the removal of our redeemable non-controlling interest liability of $107 million, partially offset by the deconsolidation of bakkt net assets of $295 million and our additional pipe contribution of $47 million.
the merger of bakkt and vih triggered a market condition event on the bakkt equity incentive awards. as a result, during 2021, we incurred a $31 million non-cash compensation expense related to these awards which we recorded as an acquisition-related cost prior to deconsolidating bakkt (note 11).
additional bridge2 solutions acquisition considerations to fund the acquisition of bridge2 solutions, and prior to the bakkt merger with vih discussed above, bakkt completed a capital call for $300 million in funding by ice and the minority investors. this acquisition-related capital call triggered a market condition of certain bakkt equity incentive awards, and as a result, we incurred a $10 million non-cash compensation expense in 2020 related to these awards which was recorded as an acquisition-related cost (note 11).
acquisition purchase prices and allocation the following summarizes our purchase price allocation for bridge2 solutions and simplifile to the respective net tangible and identifiable intangible assets and liabilities based on their respective estimated fair values on the date of acquisition. for each acquisition, the excess of the purchase price over the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets has been recorded as goodwill. cash consideration was gross of $12 million cash held by simplifile on the date of its acquisition. for these acquisitions, revenues and expenses were not material to the periods presented.

non-controlling interest during 2020, we received a contribution from a group of minority investors for a non-controlling interest in ice futures abu dhabi.
minority investors hold a net profit sharing interest in our cds clearing subsidiaries of 26.7% ownership interest as of december 31, 2021.
in december 2018, bakkt was capitalized with $183 million in initial funding with ice as the majority owner, along with a group of other minority investors, and in march 2020, an additional $300 million in funding occurred with ice maintaining its majority ownership. we held a call option over these interests subject to certain terms. similarly, the non-ice partners in bakkt held a put option to require us to repurchase their interests subject to certain terms. these minority interests were reflected as redeemable non-controlling interests in temporary equity within our consolidated balance sheet. following the october 2021 bakkt merger discussed above, we no longer consolidate bakkt and therefore do not record a redeemable non-controlling interest in bakkt as of december 31, 2021.
our equity investments, including our investment in euroclear plc, or euroclear, among others, are subject to valuation under asu 2016-01, financial instruments- overall (subtopic 825-10): recognition and measurement of financial assets and financial liabilities, or asu 2016-01. see note 17 for a discussion of our determination of fair value of our financial instruments.
investment in coinbase on december 1, 2014, we acquired preferred stock of coinbase global, inc., or coinbase, which operates a cryptocurrency exchange platform, for $10 million, representing a 1.4% ownership share on a fully-diluted, as-converted basis. on april 14, 2021, coinbase completed an initial public offering, or ipo. on april 15, 2021, we completed the sale of our investment in coinbase for $1.24 billion and recorded a gain of $1.23 billion, or $892 million net of tax, as other income in our consolidated statement of income.
investment in euroclear we own a 9.8% stake in euroclear as of december 31, 2021 that we originally purchased for $631 million, and we participate on the euroclear board of directors. euroclear is a provider of post-trade services, including settlement, central securities depositories and related services for cross-border transactions across asset classes. we classify our investment in euroclear as an equity investment.
in september 2021, we became aware of an observable price change in orderly transactions of similar euroclear investments by a third party. the transactions resulted in a fair value adjustment of our euroclear investment, and we recorded a gain of $34 million in other income, which includes the impact of foreign currency translation. following the adjustment and as of december 31, 2021, the adjusted fair value of our euroclear investment is $701 million. we are not aware of the occurrence of any observable price changes in orderly transactions of similar euroclear investments since september 2021.
on october 18, 2021, we announced that we had reached an agreement to sell our entire 9.8% stake in euroclear for €709 million. the sale is subject to customary closing conditions and regulatory approval. as a result of our expectation to sell our euroclear investment, we include this investment in other current assets as of december 31, 2021.
additionally, we recognized dividend income of $60 million and $19 million in 2021 and 2019, respectively, from euroclear, included in other income. as a result of a 2020 european regulation limiting dividend payments, we did not receive a euroclear dividend in 2020, but we received two dividend payments during 2021.
equity method investments we recognized ($42 million), $71 million and $62 million as other income/(expense) during 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively, related to our equity method investments in occ, bondlink, inc., or bondlink and bakkt, discussed below. bondlink and bakkt became our equity method investments during 2021, and prior to that, as of december 31, 2020, occ was our only equity method investment. our equity method investments are included in other non-current assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. under the equity method of accounting, each reporting period we adjust the carrying value of our equity method investments on our balance sheet by recognizing our pro-rata share of the earnings or losses of each investment, with a corresponding adjustment in our statement of income to other income, after eliminating any intra-entity income or expenses. in addition, if and when our equity method investments issue cash dividends to us, we deduct the amount of these dividends from the carrying amount of that investment.
investment in occ we own a 40% interest in occ through a direct investment by the nyse and which is regulated by the sec and the commodity futures trading commission, or cftc, that we treat as an equity method investment. occ serves as a clearing house for securities options, security futures, commodity futures and options on futures traded on various independent exchanges. occ clears securities options traded on nyse arca and nyse amex options, along with other non-affiliated exchanges, and is regulated by the sec as a registered clearing agency and by the cftc as a derivatives clearing organization.
we recognized $51 million, $71 million and $62 million during 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively, of equity earnings as our share of the occ's estimated profits, which is included in other income.
on may 12, 2021, we made a 35.0% strategic investment in bondlink, a financial technology company that provides cloud-based debt management software solutions to governments financing infrastructure in the municipal bond market. the series b investment is designed to accelerate bondlink's growth and product development, including by providing a variety of our market-leading data sets to municipalities as they prepare to issue bonds. we treat bondlink as an equity method investment which is included in other non-current assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet, and we record equity earnings of our share of bondlink's estimated profits, which we include in other income.
investment in bakkt following bakkt's october 15, 2021 merger with vih, we initially held a 68% economic interest and we show our share of bakkt's profits and losses in other income (note 3). for the three months ended december 31, 2021, we recorded estimated equity losses of ($92 million) related to our investment in bakkt, and as of december 31, 2021 our carrying value of our bakkt investment is $1.6 billion.
5.revenue recognition our primary revenue contract classifications are described below. these categories best represent those with similar economic characteristics of the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of our revenues and cash flows.
exchanges revenues
•futures and options: revenues in our futures and options trading businesses primarily represent fees charged for the performance obligations of derivatives trading and clearing. in our derivatives markets, we earn transaction and clearing revenues from both counterparties to each contract that is traded and/or cleared.
our transaction and clearing revenues are primarily included in our exchanges segment with the exception of our cds transaction and clearing revenues which are discussed below and are included in our fixed income and data services segment. derivatives trading and clearing fees contain two performance obligations: (1) trade execution/clearing novation and (2) risk management of open interest. while we allocate the transaction price between these two performance obligations, since they generally are satisfied almost simultaneously, there is no significant deferral of revenue. our exchanges segment futures and options transaction and clearing revenues are reported net of rebates. rebates were $982 million, $933 million and $843 million in 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. transaction and clearing fees can be variable based on trade volume discounts used in the determination of rebates, however virtually all volume discounts are calculated and recorded on a monthly basis. transaction and clearing fees, as well as any volume discounts rebated to our customers, are calculated and billed monthly in accordance with our published fee schedules.
•cash equities and equity options: revenues in our equity and equity options markets represent trade execution fees. cash trading and equity options contain one performance obligation related to each transaction which occurs instantaneously, and the revenue is recorded at the point in time of the transaction. we make liquidity payments to certain customers, as well as charge routing fees related to orders in our markets which are routed to other markets for execution and recognize those payments as a cost of revenue. in addition, we pay nyse regulatory oversight fees to the sec and collect equal amounts from our customers. these are also considered a cost of revenue, and both of these nyse-related fees are included in transaction-based expenses. for one of our equity option exchanges, revenues are reported net of rebates. rebates for that exchange were $51 million, $29 million and $12 million in 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.
•listings: our listings revenues include original and annual listings fees, and other corporate action fees. each distinct listing fee is allocated to multiple performance obligations including original and incremental listing and investor relations services, as well as a customer's material right to renew the option to list on our exchanges. in performing this allocation, the standalone selling price of the listing services is based on the original and annual listing fees and the standalone selling price of the investor relations services is based on its market value. all listings fees are billed upfront and the identified performance obligations are satisfied over time. revenue related to the investor relations performance obligation is recognized ratably over the period these services are provided, with the remaining revenue recognized ratably over time as customers continue to list on our exchanges. listings fees related to other corporate actions are considered contract modifications of our listing contracts and are recognized ratably over time as customers continue to list on our exchanges.
•data and connectivity services: our data and connectivity services revenues are related to the various data and connectivity services that we provide which are directly attributable to our exchange venues. exchange data services include, among other offerings, proprietary real-time and historical pricing data, as well as order book and transaction information related to our global futures markets and the nyse exchanges. in addition, we receive a share of revenue from the national market system, or nms, plan. separately, we also provide connectivity services directly related to our futures, cash equity and options exchanges and clearing houses. data and connectivity services revenues are primarily subscription-based, billed monthly, quarterly or annually in advance and recognized ratably over time as our performance obligations of data delivery are met consistently throughout the period. considering that these contracts primarily consist of single performance obligations with fixed prices, there is no variable consideration and no need to allocate the transaction price.
•otc and other: our otc revenues are generated in our bilateral energy markets where we offer electronic trading on contracts based on physically settled natural gas, power and refined oil contracts. other revenues primarily include interest income on certain clearing margin deposits, regulatory penalties and fines, fees for use of our facilities, regulatory fees charged to member organizations of our u.s. securities exchanges, designated market maker service fees, exchange membership fees and agricultural grading and certification fees. generally, fees for otc and other revenues contain one performance obligation. because these contracts primarily consist of single performance obligations with fixed prices, there is no variable consideration and no need to allocate the transaction price. services for otc and other revenues are primarily satisfied at a point in time. therefore, there is no need to allocate the fee and no deferral results as we have no further obligation to the customer at that time.
in certain of our revenue share arrangements with third parties we control the delivered contract; in these arrangements we are acting as a principal and the revenue is recorded gross.
fixed income and data services revenues
•fixed income execution: execution fees are reported net of rebates, and can be variable based on trade volume discounts used in the determination of rebates, however virtually all volume discounts are calculated and recorded on a monthly basis. execution fees and rebates are calculated and billed monthly in accordance with our published fee schedules. fixed income execution rebates were nominal in 2021, 2020 and 2019. in addition, we earn fixed income transaction fees on the trade execution of agency trades, commissions and net markups and markdowns on riskless principal trades. fixed income execution fees contain one performance obligation related to each transaction which occurs instantaneously, and the revenue is recorded at the point in time. fixed income revenues also include interest income on certain clearing margin deposits related to our cds clearing business which are satisfied at a point in time and consists of a single performance obligations.
•cds clearing: cds clearing revenues are reported net of rebates. rebates were nominal in 2021 and 2020 and were $5 million in 2019. we provide clearing services to the global cds market and the timing and nature of our cds transaction and clearing revenue is similar in nature to the exchanges segment transaction and clearing revenues discussed above. the cds derivatives trading and clearing fees contain two performance obligations: (1) trade execution/clearing novation and (2) risk management of open interest. while we allocate the transaction price between these two performance obligations, since they generally are satisfied almost simultaneously, there is no significant deferral of revenue.
•fixed income data and analytics, and other data and network services: fixed income data and analytics services revenues are recurring in nature and include evaluated pricing and reference data and analytics including sovereign, corporate and municipal bonds, mortgage and asset-backed securities, as well as leveraged loans. other data and network services include those related to the ice global network and our consolidated feeds business, as well as desktops and other multi-asset class analytics.
the nature and timing of each contract type for the data services above are similar in nature. data services revenues are primarily subscription-based, billed monthly, quarterly or annually in advance and recognized ratably over time as our performance obligations of data delivery are met consistently throughout the period. considering that these contracts primarily consist of single performance obligations with fixed prices, there is no variable consideration and no need to allocate the transaction price. in certain of our data contracts, where third parties are involved, we either arrange for the third party to transfer the services to our customers, or we transfer third-party data to our customers; in these arrangements we are acting as an agent and revenue is recorded net.
•origination technology: our origination technology acts as a system of record for the mortgage origination, automating the gathering, reviewing, and verifying of mortgage-related information and enabling automated enforcement of rules and business practices designed to help ensure that each completed loan transaction is of high quality and adheres to secondary market standards. these revenues are based on recurring software as a service, or saas, subscription fees, with an additive success-based pricing fee as lenders exceed the number of loans closed that are included with their monthly base subscription.
in addition, the ice mortgage technology network provides originators connectivity to the mortgage supply chain and facilitates the secure exchange of information between our customers and a broad ecosystem of third-party service providers, as well as lenders and investors that are critical to consummating the millions of loan transactions that occur on our origination network each year. revenue from the ice mortgage technology network is largely transaction-based.
performance obligations consist of a series of distinct services and support services. mortgage subscription customers simultaneously receive and consume benefits from our performance and revenues are recognized over time as our performance obligations are met consistently throughout the period. contracts generally range from one year to five years. success-based contracts are subject to monthly billing calculations whereby customers are obligated to pay the greater of a contractual base fee or variable closed loan fee based on the number of closed loan transactions processed by the customer in the specific month. under success-based contracts, monthly base fees are recognized ratably over the contract terms as subscription performance obligations are satisfied and closed loan fees in excess of base fees are considered variable consideration.
for the majority of contracts that include variable consideration, such fees are recognized in the month in which they are earned because the terms of the variable payments relate specifically to the outcome from transferring the distinct time increment (one month) of service and because such amounts reflect the fees to which we expect to be entitled for providing access to the encompass platform for that period, consistent with the allocation objective of topic 606. for certain contracts where the allocation objective would not be met by allocating variable consideration in this way, total variable consideration to be received is estimated at contract inception and recognized ratably over the contract term considering historical trends, industry data, and contract specific factors to determine an expected amount to which we expect to be entitled. the amount of variable consideration included in the transaction price is constrained to ensure that it is probable that a significant reversal in the amount of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur when the amount of variable consideration is subsequently resolved. when agreements involve multiple distinct performance obligations, we allocate arrangement consideration to all performance obligations at the inception of an arrangement based on the relative standalone selling prices of each performance obligation.
•closing solutions: our closing solutions connect key participants such as lenders, title and settlement agents and individual county recorders together to digitize the closing and recording process. for these services, we act as agent and revenues are recorded net. revenues for these services primarily contain one performance obligation related to each transaction which occurs instantaneously, and the revenues are primarily recorded at the point in time of the transaction. closing solutions also includes revenues from our mortgage electronic registrations systems, inc., or mers database, which provides a system of record for recording and tracking changes and servicing rights and beneficial ownership interests in loans secured by u.s. residential real estate. mers implemented a revised pricing structure effective july 1, 2021. as a result, mers database revenues contain multiple performance obligations related to each new loan registration and future transfers, and the revenues are primarily recorded at the point in time of each transaction. closing solutions revenues may include a fixed-fee subscription component recognized ratably over the contract term, as this method best depicts our pattern of performance.
•data and analytics: revenues include those related to ice mortgage technology's automation, intelligence, quality, or aiq, offering which applies machine learning and artificial intelligence to the entire loan origination process, offering customers greater efficiency by streamlining data collection and validation through our automated document recognition and data extraction capabilities. aiq revenues can be both recurring and transaction-based in nature. in addition, our data offerings include real-time industry and peer benchmarking tools, which provide originators a granular view into the real-time trends of nearly half the u.s. residential mortgage market. we also provide a data as a service, or daas, offering through private data clouds for lenders to access their own data and origination information. revenues related to our data products are largely subscription-based and recurring in nature and recognized ratably over time as this method best depicts our pattern of performance. our performance obligations of data delivery are met consistently throughout the period.
•other: other revenues include professional services fees, as well as revenues from ancillary products. other revenues are transaction-based and primarily contain one performance obligation which occurs instantaneously, therefore revenues are recorded at the point in time of the transaction.
the following table depicts the disaggregation of our revenue according to business line and segment (in millions). amounts here have been aggregated as they follow consistent revenue recognition patterns, and are consistent with the segment information in note 18:

debt repayment schedule as of december 31, 2021, the outstanding debt repayment schedule is as follows (in millions):
11.share-based compensation the non-cash compensation expenses recognized in our consolidated statements of income for stock options, restricted stock and under our employee stock purchase plan were $188 million, $139 million and $139 million in 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively, net of $13 million, $12 million and $14 million, respectively, that was capitalized as software development costs. as of december 31, 2021, we had 31.6 million shares in total under various equity plans available for future issuance as stock option and restricted stock awards. this includes the expense related to the bakkt incentive units, described below.
stock option plans stock options are granted with an exercise price equal to the fair value of our common stock on the grant date. we may grant, under provisions of the plans, both incentive stock options and nonqualified stock options. the options generally vest over three or four years and may generally be exercised up to ten years after the date of grant, but generally expire either 14 or 60 days after termination of employment. the shares of common stock issued under our stock option plans are made available from authorized and unissued common stock or treasury shares.
the fair value is based on our closing stock price on the date of grant as well as certain other assumptions. compensation expense arising from option grants is recognized ratably over the vesting period based on the grant date fair value, net of estimated forfeitures.

the risk-free interest rate is based on the zero-coupon u.s. treasury yield curve in effect at the date of grant. the expected life is derived from historical and anticipated future exercise patterns. expected volatility is based on historical volatility data of our stock.
restricted stock plans restricted shares are used as an incentive to attract and retain qualified employees and to align our and our stockholders' interests by linking actual performance to both short and long-term stockholder return. we issue awards that may contain a combination of time, performance and/or market conditions. the grant date fair value of each award is based on the closing stock price of our stock at the date of grant.
granted but unvested shares are generally forfeited upon termination of employment, whereby compensation costs previously recognized for unvested shares are reversed. until the shares vest and are issued, participants have no voting or dividend rights and the shares may not be sold, assigned, transferred, pledged or otherwise encumbered. unvested restricted stock earns dividend equivalents which are paid in cash on the vesting date.
the grant date fair value of time-based restricted stock units is recognized as expense ratably over the vesting period, which is typically three or four years, net of forfeitures. our equity plans include a change in control provision that may accelerate vesting on both the time-based and performance-based restricted shares if the awards are not assumed by an acquirer in the case of a change in control.
for awards with performance conditions, we recognize compensation costs, net of forfeitures, using an accelerated attribution method over the vesting period. compensation costs are recognized only if it is probable that the performance condition will be satisfied. if we initially determine that it is not probable of being satisfied and later determine that it is, or vice versa, a cumulative catch-up adjustment is retroactively recorded in the period of change based on the new estimate. we recognize the remaining compensation costs over the remaining vesting period.
for awards with a market condition, fair value is estimated based on a simulation of various outcomes and includes inputs such as our stock price on the grant date, the valuation of historical awards with market conditions, the probability that the
market condition will affect the number of shares granted (as the market condition only affects shares granted in excess of certain financial performance targets), and our expectation of achieving the financial performance targets.
in february 2021, we reserved a maximum of 0.7 million restricted shares for potential issuance as performance-based restricted shares to certain of our employees. the number of shares ultimately granted under this award is based on our actual financial performance as compared to financial performance targets set by our board and the compensation committee for the year ending december 31, 2021, and is also subject to a market condition reduction based on how our 2021 total stockholder return, or tsr, compared to that of the s&p 500 index. in 2021, a tsr share reduction was required to reflect that the s&p 500 index tsr outperformed ours. based on our actual 2021 financial performance as compared to the 2021 financial performance level thresholds, and as adjusted for the tsr haircut, 0.5 million restricted shares were awarded, which resulted in $58 million in compensation expenses that will be expensed over the three-year accelerated vesting period, including $32 million expensed during 2021.
the following is a summary of nonvested restricted shares under all plans discussed above:
number of                    weighted average restricted                     grant-date fair stock shares                     value per share
total fair value of restricted stock vested under all restricted stock plans                    $184                      $194                      $173
(1) the remaining shares granted are performance-based.
performance-based restricted shares have been presented in the table above to reflect the actual shares issued based on the achievement of past performance targets, also considering the impact of any market conditions. non-vested performance-based restricted shares granted are presented in the table above at the target number of restricted shares that would vest if the performance targets are met. as of december 31, 2021, there were $161 million in total unrecognized compensation costs related to time-based and performance-based restricted stock. these costs are expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 1.5 years as the restricted stock vests.
employee stock purchase plan we offer our employees participation in our espp, under which we have reserved and may sell up to 25 million shares of our common stock to employees. the espp grants participating employees the right to acquire our stock in increments of 1% of eligible pay, with a maximum contribution of 25% of eligible pay, subject to applicable annual internal revenue service, or irs, limitations. under our espp, participating employees are limited to $25,000 of common stock annually, and a maximum of 1,250 shares of common stock each offering period. there are two offering periods each year, from january 1st (or the first trading day thereafter) through june 30th (or the last trading day prior to such date) and from july 1st (or the first trading day thereafter) through december 31st (or the last trading day prior to such date). the purchase price per share of common stock is 85% of the lesser of the fair market value of the stock on the first or the last trading day of each offering period. we recorded compensation expenses of $11 million, $8 million and $7 million during 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively, related to the discount given to our participating employees.
bakkt incentive units prior to the bakkt merger with vih (note 3), we sponsored the bakkt equity incentive plan under which bakkt issued various bakkt preferred, common and phantom, or participation, equity unit awards. these awards were made to certain employees and board members of bakkt. the units were unvested at the issuance date, were subject to the vesting terms in the award agreements and upon vesting were converted into bakkt equity or cash.
during 2020, a $300 million capital call related to the acquisition of bridge2 solutions triggered a market condition of certain of these bakkt equity incentive awards. the market condition was based on numerous possible bakkt transaction or event scenarios established on the original date of grant, each of which have a fixed fair market value. over the life of these awards, we were required to estimate the most likely outcome and reflect the cumulative financial statement impact of any changes between outcomes. as a result, during 2020, we incurred a $10 million non-cash compensation expense related to these awards that was recorded as an acquisition-related cost.
during 2021, the merger of bakkt and vih triggered a market condition of these bakkt equity incentive awards. as a result, during 2021, we incurred $31 million of non-cash compensation expense related to these awards which we recorded as an acquisition-related cost prior to deconsolidating bakkt.
12.equity treasury stock during each of 2021, 2020 and 2019, we received 1.0 million shares of common stock from employees to satisfy tax withholdings we made on their behalf for restricted stock and stock option exercises. we recorded the receipt of the shares as treasury stock.
stock repurchase program we periodically review whether to repurchase our stock. in making a determination regarding the timing and extent of any stock repurchases, we consider multiple factors that may include: overall stock market conditions, our common stock price performance, the remaining amount authorized for repurchases by our board, the potential impact of a stock repurchase program on our debt ratings, our expected free cash flow and working capital needs, our current and future planned strategic growth initiatives, and other potential uses of our cash and capital resources.
repurchases may be made from time to time on the open market, through established trading plans, in privately-negotiated transactions or otherwise, in accordance with all applicable securities laws, rules and regulations. we may begin or discontinue stock repurchases at any time and may amend or terminate a rule 10b5-1 trading plan at any time or enter into additional plans. we discontinued stock repurchases and terminated our rule 10b5-1 trading plan in august 2020 in connection with the ellie mae acquisition. in november 2021, we resumed stock repurchases.
in december 2021, our board approved an aggregate of $3.15 billion for future repurchases of our common stock with no fixed expiration date that became effective january 1, 2022. the $3.15 billion replaces the previous amount approved by the board. in december 2021 we entered into a new rule 10b5-1 trading plan that will become effective in february 2022.
during 2021, 2020 and 2019, we repurchased 1.8 million shares, 13.6 million shares and 17.4 million shares, respectively, of our outstanding common stock at a cost of $250 million, $1.2 billion and $1.5 billion, respectively, excluding shares withheld upon vesting of equity awards. the shares repurchased are held in treasury stock.
as of december 31, 2021, the remaining balance of board approved funds for future repurchase was $903 million. the approval of our board for stock repurchases does not obligate us to acquire any particular amount of our common stock. in addition, our board may increase or decrease the amount available for repurchases from time to time.

deferred tax expense (benefit):
a reconciliation of the statutory u.s. federal income tax rate to our effective income tax rate is as follows:

our effective tax rates were 29%, 24% and 21% in 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. the effective tax rate in 2021 is higher than in 2020 primarily due to the deferred income tax impacts from the u.k. tax law changes as well as the bakkt transaction. in june 2021, the u.k. enacted a corporate income tax rate increase from 19% to 25% effective april 1, 2023.
the effective tax rate in 2020 was higher than in 2019 primarily due to u.k. tax law changes enacted in july 2020, which increased the corporate income tax rate from 17% to 19% effective april 1, 2020. this u.k. deferred tax impact was partially offset by favorable state apportionment changes as a result of our acquisition of ellie mae, as well as favorable changes in certain international tax provisions as part of the tcja in 2020.
on november 15, 2021, the infrastructure investment and jobs act was signed into law. on march 11, 2021, the american rescue plan act, or arpa, was signed into law. the arpa enacted certain provisions that are relevant to corporate income tax. on march 27, 2020, the cares act was enacted and certain income tax related relief was provided under the cares act. these provisions did not have a material impact on our income tax provision for 2021, 2020 or 2019.
deferred tax assets and liabilities deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes. as a result of the u.k. corporate income tax rate change from 19% to 25% enacted in june 2021, and from 17% to 19% enacted in 2020, we revalued the u.k. deferred tax assets and liabilities accordingly. certain unrecognized tax benefits associated with our acquisition of ellie mae are presented as a reduction to related deferred tax assets. during the fourth quarter of 2021, we deconsolidated bakkt and treat it as an equity investment within our consolidated financial statements resulting in a pre-tax gain of $1.4 billion (note 3). the deferred tax liability with respect to the equity investment in bakkt is $424 million as of december 31, 2021 and is reflected in the following table, which summarizes the significant components of our deferred tax liabilities and assets as of december 31, 2021 and 2020 (in millions):

we recognize valuation allowances on deferred tax assets if, based on the weight of the evidence, we believe that it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. we recorded a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets of $99 million and $95 million as of december 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. decreases in 2020 primarily relate to certain tax attributes that expired during the year and increased future taxable capital gains. increases charged against goodwill primarily relate to deferred tax assets arising on acquisitions.
the majority of our undistributed earnings of our non-u.s. subsidiaries are subject to the global intangible low-taxed income provisions under the tcja and, as such, are subject to immediate u.s. income taxation and can be distributed to the u.s. with no material additional income tax consequences in the future. consequently, these earnings are not considered to be indefinitely reinvested and the related tax impact is included in our income tax provision for 2021, 2020 and 2019.
however, our non-u.s. subsidiaries' cumulative undistributed earnings as of december 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019 that are not subject to the global intangible low-taxed income provisions are considered to be indefinitely reinvested. accordingly, no provision for u.s. federal and state income taxes has been made in the accompanying consolidated financial statements. further, a determination of the unrecognized deferred tax liability is not practicable. an estimate of these indefinitely reinvested undistributed earnings as of december 31, 2021, based on post-income tax earnings under u.s. gaap, is $5.8 billion.
as of december 31, 2021 and 2020, we have gross u.s. federal net operating loss carryforwards of $120 million and $125 million, respectively, and gross state and local net operating loss carryforwards of $137 million and $241 million, respectively. the net decrease of federal, state and local net operating loss carryforwards are primarily due to losses utilized in the current year. the net operating loss carryforwards are available to offset future taxable income until they expire, with amounts beginning in 2026. in addition, as of december 31, 2021 and 2020, we have gross foreign net operating loss carryforwards of $293 million and $276 million, respectively. the majority of gross foreign net operating losses are not expected to be realizable in future periods and have related valuation allowances.
a reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of unrecognized tax benefits is as follows (in millions):
beginning balance of unrecognized tax benefits                        188                       103                       $98

ending balance of unrecognized tax benefits                          $229                      $188                      $103
as of december 31, 2021 and 2020, the balance of unrecognized tax benefits which would, if recognized, affect our effective tax rate was $194 million and $109 million, respectively. it is reasonably possible, as a result of settlements of ongoing audits or statute of limitations expirations, that unrecognized tax benefits could increase as much as $35 million and decrease as much as $36 million within the next 12 months. of the $229 million in unrecognized tax benefits as of december 31, 2021, $193 million is recorded within other non-current liabilities and $36 million is recorded within other current liabilities.
we recognize interest and penalties accrued on income tax uncertainties as a component of income tax expense. in 2021, 2020 and 2019, we recognized $10 million, $6 million and $5 million, respectively, of income tax expense for interest and penalties. as of december 31, 2021 and 2020, accrued interest and penalties were $49 million and $39 million, respectively. of the $49 million in accrued interest and penalties as of december 31, 2021, $20 million is recorded within other non-current liabilities and $29 million is recorded within other current liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet.
we or one of our subsidiaries files income tax returns in the u.s. federal jurisdiction and various state and foreign jurisdictions. the following table summarizes open tax years by major jurisdiction:
although the outcome of tax audits is always uncertain, we believe that adequate amounts of tax, including interest and penalties, have been provided for any adjustments expected to result from open tax years.
14.clearing operations we operate six clearing houses, each of which acts as a central counterparty that becomes the buyer to every seller and the seller to every buyer for its clearing members or participants, or members. through this central counterparty function, the clearing houses provide financial security for each transaction for the duration of the position by limiting counterparty credit risk.
our clearing houses are responsible for providing clearing services to each of our futures exchanges, and in some cases to third-party execution venues, and are as follows, referred to herein collectively as "the ice clearing houses":

the amounts that members are required to maintain are determined by proprietary risk models established by each ice clearing house and reviewed by the relevant regulators, independent model validators, risk committees and the boards of directors of the respective ice clearing house. the amounts required may fluctuate over time. each of the ice clearing houses is a separate legal entity and is not subject to the liabilities of the others, or the obligations of members of the other ice clearing houses.
should a particular member fail to deposit its original margin or fail to make a variation margin payment, when and as required, the relevant ice clearing house may liquidate or hedge the defaulting member's open positions and use their original margin and guaranty fund deposits to pay any amount owed. in the event that the defaulting member's deposits are not sufficient to pay the amount owed in full, the ice clearing houses will first use their respective contributions to the guaranty fund, often referred to as skin in the game, or sitg, to pay any remaining amount owed. in the event that the sitg is not sufficient, the ice clearing houses may utilize the respective guaranty fund deposits, or collect limited additional funds from their respective non-defaulting members on a pro-rata basis, to pay any remaining amount owed.
as of december 31, 2021 and 2020, the ice clearing houses had received or had been pledged $239.9 billion and $154.1 billion, respectively, in cash and non-cash collateral in original margin and guaranty fund deposits to cover price movements of underlying contracts for both periods.
guaranty funds and ice contribution as described above, mechanisms have been created, called guaranty funds, to provide partial protection in the event of a member default. with the exception of ice ngx, each of the ice clearing houses requires that each member make deposits into a guaranty fund.
in addition, we have contributed our own capital that could be used if a defaulting member's original margin and guaranty fund deposits are insufficient. such amounts are recorded as long-term restricted cash and cash equivalents in our balance sheets and are as follows (in millions):
ice portion of guaranty fund contribution                                     default insurance as of december 31,                                    as of december 31, clearing house                                       2021                                      2020                    2021                          2020
of our total contribution to ice clear u.s. above, as of december 31, 2021, $15 million is solely applicable to any losses associated with a default in bitcoin contracts and other digital assets that ice clear u.s. may clear in the future. in february 2021, we decreased our contribution to ice clear u.s.'s guaranty fund applicable to any losses associated with a default in bitcoin contracts and other digital asset contracts by $20 million from $35 million as of december 31, 2020. in march 2021, we increased our contribution to ice clear europe's guaranty fund by $10 million in connection with the launch of ice futures abu dhabi limited.
we also maintain default insurance as an additional layer of clearing member default protection which is reflected in the table below. the default insurance was added in september 2019 and has a three-year term for the following clearing houses in the following amounts: ice clear europe - $75 million; ice clear u.s. - $25 million; and ice clear credit - $50 million. the default insurance layer resides after and in addition to the ice clear europe, ice clear u.s. and ice clear credit sitg contributions and before the guaranty fund contributions of the non-defaulting members.
similar to sitg, the default insurance layer is not intended to replace or reduce the position risk-based amount of the guaranty fund. as a result, the default insurance layer is not a factor that is included in the calculation of the members' guaranty fund contribution requirement. instead, it serves as an additional, distinct, and separate default resource that should serve to further protect the non-defaulting members' guaranty fund contributions from being mutualized in the event of a default.
as of december 31, 2021, ice ngx maintains a guaranty fund utilizing a $115 million letter of credit and a default insurance policy, discussed below.
cash and invested deposits we have recorded cash and invested margin deposits and amounts due in our balance sheets as current assets with corresponding current liabilities to the members. as of december 31, 2021, our cash and invested margin deposits were as follows (in millions):
as of december 31, 2020, our cash and invested margin deposits, were as follows (in millions):
(1) $92.0 billion and $6.2 billion is related to futures/options and cds, respectively.
(2) $31.8 billion and $6.3 billion is related to futures/options and cds, respectively.
our cash and invested margin and guaranty fund deposits are maintained in accounts with national banks and highly-rated financial institutions or secured through direct investments, primarily in u.s. treasury and other highly-rated foreign government securities, or reverse repurchase agreements with primarily overnight maturities. we primarily use level 1 inputs when evaluating the fair value of the non-cash equivalent direct investments, as highly-rated government securities are quoted in active markets. the carrying value of these deposits are deemed to approximate fair value.
to provide a tool to address the liquidity needs of our clearing houses and manage the liquidation of margin and guaranty fund deposits held in the form of cash and high quality sovereign debt, ice clear europe, ice clear credit and ice clear u.s. have entered into committed repurchase agreement facilities, or committed repo. additionally, ice clear credit and ice clear netherlands have entered into committed fx facilities to support these liquidity needs. as of december 31, 2021 the following facilities were in place:
details of our deposits are as follows (in millions):

other deposits non-cash original margin and guaranty fund deposits are not reflected in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets as the risks and rewards of these assets remain with the clearing members unless the clearing houses have sold or re-pledged the assets or in the event of a clearing member default, where the clearing member is no longer entitled to redeem the assets. any income, gain or loss accrues to the clearing members.
in addition to the cash and invested deposits above, the ice clearing houses have also received other assets from members, which include government obligations, and may include other non-cash collateral such as letters of credit at ice ngx, or gold on rare occasions at ice clear europe, to mitigate credit risk. for certain deposits, we may impose discount or "haircut" rates to ensure adequate collateral if market values fluctuate. the value-related risks and rewards of these assets remain with the members. any gain or loss accrues to the member. the ice clearing houses do not, in the ordinary course, rehypothecate or re-pledge these assets. these pledged assets are not reflected in our balance sheets, and are as follows (in millions):
as of december 31, 2021
letters of credit                         -                          -                          -                             3,566                                  3,566

ice ngx ice ngx owns a clearing house which administers the physical delivery of energy trading contracts. ice ngx is the central counterparty to members on opposite sides of its physically-settled contracts, and the balance related to delivered but unpaid contracts is recorded as a delivery contract net receivable, with an offsetting delivery contract net payable in our balance sheets. unsettled variation margin equal to the fair value of open contracts is recorded as of each balance sheet date. there is no impact on our consolidated statements of income as an equal amount is recognized as both an asset and a liability. ice ngx marks all outstanding contracts to market daily, but only collects variation margin when a member's open position falls outside a specified percentage of its pledged collateral. due to the highly liquid nature and the short period of time to maturity, the fair values of our delivery contract net payable and net receivable are determined to approximate carrying value.
ice ngx requires members to maintain cash or letters of credit to serve as collateral in the event of default. the cash is maintained in a segregated bank account, held in trust and remains the property of the member, therefore, it is not included in our balance sheets. ice ngx maintains a $250 million daylight liquidity facility with a third-party canadian chartered bank which is available in the event of physical settlement shortfalls, subject to certain conditions.
as of december 31, 2021, ice ngx maintains a guaranty fund of $115 million funded by a $100 million letter of credit issued by a major canadian chartered bank and backed by default insurance underwritten by export development canada, a crown corporation operated at arm's length from the canadian government, plus $15 million held as restricted cash to fund the first loss amount the ice ngx is responsible for under the default insurance policy. in the event of a participant default where the member's collateral is depleted, the shortfall would be covered by a draw down on the letter of credit following which ice ngx would file a claim under the default insurance to recover additional losses up to $100 million beyond the $15 million first-loss amount that ice ngx is responsible for under the default insurance policy.
clearing house exposure the net notional value of unsettled contracts was $3.0 trillion as of december 31, 2021. each ice clearing house bears financial counterparty credit risk and provides a central counterparty guarantee, or performance guarantee, to its members. to reduce their exposure, the ice clearing houses have a risk management program with both initial and ongoing membership standards. excluding the effects of original and variation margin, guaranty fund and collateral requirements and default insurance, the ice clearing houses' maximum estimated exposure for this guarantee is $218.9 billion as of december 31, 2021, which represents the maximum estimated value by the ice clearing houses of a hypothetical one-day movement in pricing of the underlying unsettled contracts. this value was determined using proprietary risk management software that simulates gains and losses based on historical market prices, volatility and other factors present at that point in time for those particular unsettled contracts. future actual market price volatility could result in the exposure being significantly different than this amount.
we also performed calculations to determine the fair value of our counterparty performance guarantee taking into consideration factors such as daily settlement of contracts, margining and collateral requirements, other elements of our risk management program, historical evidence of default payments, and estimated probability of potential default payouts by the ice clearing houses. based on these analyses, the estimated counterparty performance guarantee liability was determined to be nominal and no liability was recorded as of december 31, 2021 or 2020. the ice clearing houses have never experienced an incident of a clearing member default which has required the use of the guaranty funds of non-defaulting clearing members or the assets of the ice clearing houses.
15.commitments and contingencies leases we have lease agreements for office space, equipment facilities and certain computer equipment for varying periods that expire at various dates through 2029. all of our leases are classified as operating leases. for details of our lease assets, lease liabilities and rent expense see note 2.
legal proceedings in the ordinary course of our business, from time to time we are subject to legal proceedings, lawsuits, government investigations and other claims with respect to a variety of matters. in addition, we are subject to periodic reviews, inspections, examinations and investigations by regulators in the u.s. and other jurisdictions, any of which may result in claims, legal proceedings, assessments, fines, penalties, restrictions on our business or other sanctions. we record estimated expenses and reserves for legal or regulatory matters or other claims when these matters present loss contingencies that are probable and the related amount is reasonably estimable. any such accruals may be adjusted as circumstances change. assessments of losses are inherently subjective and involve unpredictable factors. while the outcome of legal and regulatory matters is inherently difficult to predict and/or the range of loss often cannot be reasonably estimable, we do not believe that the liabilities, if any, which may ultimately result from the resolution of the various legal and regulatory matters that arise in the ordinary course of our business, including the matters described below, are likely to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition, results of operations, or liquidity. it is possible, however, that future results of operations for any particular quarterly or annual period could be materially and adversely affected by any developments relating to these legal and regulatory matters.
city of providence litigation in 2014, new york stock exchange llc and nyse arca, inc., two of our subsidiaries, were among more than 40 financial institutions and u.s.-based equity exchanges named as defendants in four purported class action lawsuits filed in the u.s. district court for the southern district of new york, or the southern district, by the city of providence, rhode island, and other plaintiffs. in a subsequent consolidated amended complaint filed against only the exchange defendants (which include exchanges owned and operated by nasdaq and cboe), the plaintiffs asserted claims on behalf of a class of "all public investors" who bought or sold stock from april 18, 2009 to the present on the named exchanges.
in 2015, the district court granted a motion to dismiss filed by the exchange defendants and dismissed the complaint with prejudice. the court held that the plaintiffs had failed to sufficiently state a claim under sections 10(b) and 6(b) of the exchange act, and additionally that some of the claims were barred by the doctrine of self-regulatory organization immunity. the plaintiffs appealed, and in 2017 the u.s. court of appeals for the second circuit, or the second circuit, issued a decision vacating the dismissal and remanding the case to the district court for further proceedings. the second circuit held that the claims against the exchanges were not barred by the doctrine of self-regulatory organization immunity because (in the view of the second circuit) the exchanges were not carrying out regulatory functions while operating their markets and engaging in the challenged conduct at issue, and that the plaintiffs had adequately pleaded claims against the defendants under section 10(b) of the exchange act. the second circuit directed that, on remand, the district court should address and rule upon various other defenses raised by the exchanges in their motion to dismiss (which the district court did not address in its prior opinion and order).
in 2019, the district court denied a new motion to dismiss filed by the defendants, and the exchanges filed answers to the complaint, denying the principal allegations of the plaintiffs, denying liability in the matter, and asserting various affirmative defenses. during 2021, the parties conducted discovery, relating largely to class certification issues; the plaintiffs filed a motion for class certification; and the defendants filed motions for summary judgment on the basis of preclusion and lack of standing. the parties are awaiting decisions from the court.
libor litigation in 2019, three virtually identical purported class action complaints were filed in the southern district against ice and several of its subsidiaries, including ice benchmark administration limited, or iba, collectively referred to as the ice defendants, as well as 18 multinational banks and various of their respective subsidiaries and affiliates, or the panel bank defendants, by, respectively, putnam bank, a savings bank based in putnam, connecticut; two municipal pension funds affiliated with the city of livonia, michigan; and four retirement and benefit funds affiliated with the hawaii sheet metal workers union. iba is the administrator for various regulated benchmarks, including the ice libor benchmark that is calculated daily based upon the submissions from a reference panel (which includes the panel bank defendants).
the plaintiffs sought to litigate on behalf of a purported class of all u.s.-based persons or entities who transacted with a panel bank defendant by receiving a payment on an interest rate indexed to a one-month or three-month usd libor-benchmarked rate during the period from february 1, 2014 to the present. the plaintiffs alleged that the ice defendants and the panel bank defendants engaged in a conspiracy to set the libor benchmark at artificially low levels, with an alleged purpose and effect of depressing payments by the panel bank defendants to members of the purported class.
subsequent to the filing of the individual complaints, the various plaintiffs referenced above filed a consolidated amended complaint against the ice defendants and the panel bank defendants. as with the individual complaints, the consolidated amended complaint asserted a claim for violations of the sherman and clayton antitrust acts and sought unspecified treble damages and other relief. the ice defendants and the panel bank defendants filed motions to dismiss the consolidated amended complaint.
on march 26, 2020, the court issued a decision and order granting the ice defendants and the panel bank defendants' motions to dismiss for failure to state a claim. among other things, the court found that the amended complaint "...is made up of almost entirely conclusory allegations and is essentially devoid of any evidence, direct or circumstantial, to support the conclusion that defendants colluded with one another."
the plaintiffs appealed the decision to the second circuit. while briefing of the appeal was ongoing, each of the named plaintiffs withdrew from the case. dyj holdings, llc, a new jersey-based holding company, was permitted, over the objection of the defendants, to intervene for the purpose of serving as named plaintiff and representative of the purported class. on november 29, 2021, the second circuit heard oral argument on the merits of the underlying appeal, and the parties are awaiting a decision.
ice data pricing & reference data matter our subsidiary ice data pricing & reference data, llc, or prd, is a registered investment advisor in the business of, among other things, providing clients with evaluated pricing and other information for fixed-income securities. prd formerly had a business practice of passing through third-party price quotes, or broker quotes, in certain fixed income securities as-is to its clients when prd did not believe it had the capability to model an evaluated price for such securities. broker quoted securities were less than 2% of the securities prd priced. a list of securities that were broker quoted, as distinguished from evaluated, was made available to prd's clients every day. prd first notified its clients on december 16, 2019 that it would cease providing broker quotes and did so as of october 1, 2020.
on december 9, 2020, following an sec investigation of prd's legacy business practices with respect to broker quotes, the sec announced a settlement in which prd, without admitting or denying the findings therein, agreed to pay an $8 million civil monetary penalty, together with certain non-monetary provisions. for further details about the settlement and underlying matter under investigation, please refer to order instituting administrative and cease-and-desist proceedings, pursuant to sections 203(e) and 203(k) of the investment advisers act of 1940, making findings, and imposing remedial sanctions and a cease-and-desist order, administrative proceeding file no. 3-20164 (in the matter of ice data pricing & reference data, llc).
separately, prd's legacy business practices with respect to broker quotes received from a now-bankrupt entity named live well financial, inc., or live well, are relevant to potential civil claims against prd. in august 2019, the sec and the united states department of justice, respectively, filed civil and criminal charges against live well and certain of its executives, alleging that live well fraudulently provided over-stated "broker quotes" to a then-unnamed "industry-leading price service" (which was prd). certain of live well's financial institution creditors and its bankruptcy trustee have asserted to prd that they believe they have putative claims against prd related to live well's actions. as of december 31, 2021, prd has resolved the potential claims of the trustee and all but one of the financial institution creditors. prd continues to deny any wrongdoing, and to the extent any unresolved assertions relating to broker quotes prd received from live well become litigated matters, we plan to vigorously defend any such litigation.
span trademark dispute cme group, inc., or cme, filed suit against two of ice's clearing houses (ice clear u.s. and ice clear europe limited) in 2018 in the u.s. district court for the northern district of illinois, alleging infringement of cme's trademark for span, which is a name generally used to refer to a type of initial margining approach that assesses risk for a variety of financial instruments on a portfolio-wide basis, as well as breach of contract and counterfeiting. the ice clearing entities and cme were parties to 10-year license agreements that expired in 2017, pursuant to which the clearing entities paid cme a collective total of $50,001 over such 10-year period for the right to use the span trademark.
in 2020, cme informed ice and the court that it was not seeking compensatory damages based on the license fees but rather that it would seek at trial the disgorgement of profits of the ice clearing entities over the approximate one-year period during which the mark was referenced following expiration of the formal agreements. a bench trial was held during september 2020, and, on august 17, 2021, the trial court issued findings of fact and conclusions of law, in which, among other things, the court found in favor of ice on cme's counterfeiting and breach of contract claims; held that ice had a valid implied license defense for significant periods of time of the alleged infringement; and, excluding the periods to which the implied license applied, awarded cme a judgment for infringement of approximately $16 million. in october 2021, this matter was resolved.
tax audits we are engaged in ongoing discussions and audits with taxing authorities on various tax matters, the resolutions of which are uncertain. currently, there are matters that may lead to assessments involving us or one of our subsidiaries, some of which may not be resolved for several years. based on currently available information, we believe we have adequately provided for any assessments that could result from those proceedings where it is more likely than not that we will be assessed. we continuously review our positions as these matters progress.
16.pension and other benefit programs defined benefit pension plan we have a pension plan covering employees in certain of our u.s. operations whose benefit accrual has been frozen. retirement benefits are derived from a formula, which is based on length of service and compensation.
we did not make any contributions to our pension plan during 2021, 2020 or 2019. the plan's target allocation is 5% equity securities and 95% fixed income securities. the fixed income allocation includes corporate bonds of companies from diversified industries and u.s. government bonds. our long-term objective is to keep the plan at or near full funding, while minimizing the risk inherent in pension plans. as a result, we don't anticipate that there will be a strong need for contributions in future years, and the pension plan will not be required to pay the pension benefit guaranty corporation variable rate premiums. we do not expect to make contributions to the pension plan in 2022. we will continue to monitor the plan's funded status, and we will consider modifying the plan's investment policy based on the actuarial and funding characteristics of the retirement plan, the demographic profile of plan participants, and our business objectives.

we use a market-related value of plan assets when determining the estimated return on plan assets. gains/losses on plan assets are amortized over a four-year period and accumulate in other comprehensive income. we recognize deferred gains and losses in future net income based on a "corridor" approach, where the corridor is equal to 10% of the greater of the benefit obligation or the market-related value of plan assets at the beginning of the year.
supplemental executive retirement plan we have a u.s. nonqualified supplemental executive retirement plan, or serp, which provides supplemental retirement benefits for certain employees. the future benefit accrual of the serp plan is frozen. to provide for the future payments of these benefits, we have purchased insurance on the lives of certain of the participants through company-owned policies. as of december 31, 2021 and 2020, the cash surrender value of such policies was $61 million and $60 million, respectively, and is included in other non-current assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. we also acquired a serp through both the ice ngx and chx acquisitions. the following table provides a summary of the changes in the serp benefit obligations (in millions):

serp plan expense in the accompanying consolidated statements of income was $1 million each year in 2021, 2020 and 2019 and primarily consisted of interest cost. the following table shows the projected payments for the serp plan based on the actuarial assumptions (in millions):
pension and serp plans assumptions the weighted-average assumptions used to develop the actuarial present value of the projected benefit obligation and net periodic pension/serp costs in 2021, 2020 and 2019 are set forth below:
weighted-average discount rate for determining benefit obligations (pension/serp plans)             2.6% / 2.1%                   2.2% / 1.6%                   3.0% / 2.7%
expected long-term rate of return on plan assets (pension/serp plans)                                2.3% / n/a                    3.1% / n/a                    3.9% / n/a rate of compensation increase                                                                               n/a                           n/a                           n/a the assumed discount rate reflects the market rates for high-quality corporate bonds currently available. the discount rate was determined by considering the average of pension yield curves constructed on a large population of high quality corporate bonds. the resulting discount rates reflect the matching of plan liability cash flows to yield curves. to develop the expected long-term rate of return on assets assumption, we considered the historical returns and the future expectations for returns for each asset class as well as the target asset allocation of the pension portfolio.
the determination of the interest cost component utilizes a full yield curve approach by applying the specific spot rates along the yield curve used in the determination of the benefit obligation to each year's discounted cash flow.
post-retirement benefit plans our defined benefit plans provide certain health care and life insurance benefits for certain eligible retired nyse u.s. employees. these post-retirement benefit plans, which may be modified in accordance with their terms, are fully frozen. the net periodic post-retirement benefit costs were $2 million each in 2021, 2020 and 2019. the defined benefit plans are unfunded and we currently do not expect to fund the post-retirement benefit plans. the weighted-average discount rate for determining the benefit obligation as of december 31, 2021 and 2020 is 2.6% and 2.1%, respectively. the weighted-average discount rate for determining the interest cost as of december 31, 2021 and 2020 is 1.6% and 2.6%, respectively. the following table shows the actuarial determined benefit obligation, interest costs, employee contributions, actuarial (gain) loss, benefits paid during the periods and the accrued employee benefits (in millions):

projected post-retirement benefit by year:                projected payment
for measurement purposes, we assumed a 5.7% annual rate of increase in the per capita cost of covered health care benefits in 2021 which will decrease on a graduated basis to 4.5% in the year 2038 and thereafter.
accumulated other comprehensive loss the accumulated other comprehensive loss, after tax, as of december 31, 2021, consisted of the following amounts that have not yet been recognized in net periodic benefit cost (in millions):
pension plans        serp plans        post-retirementbenefit plans        total unrecognized net actuarial losses (gains), after tax        $56                  $6                $(14)                               $48
other benefit plans and defined contribution plans our u.s. employees are eligible to participate in 401(k) and profit sharing plans and our non-u.s. employees are eligible to participate in defined contribution pension plans. total contributions under the 401(k), profit sharing and defined contribution pension plans were $63 million, $52 million and $42 million in 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. no discretionary or profit sharing contributions were made during 2021, 2020 or 2019.
17.fair value measurements financial assets and liabilities recorded or disclosed at fair value in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets as of december 31, 2021 and 2020 are classified in their entirety based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the asset or liability's fair value measurement.
our mutual funds are equity and fixed income mutual funds held for the purpose of providing future payments for the supplemental executive savings plan and serp. these mutual funds are classified as equity investments and measured at fair value using level 1 inputs with adjustments recorded in net income (note 16).
excluding our equity investments without a readily determinable fair value, all other financial instruments are determined to approximate carrying value due to the short period of time to their maturities.
we did not use level 3 inputs to determine the fair value of assets or liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of december 31, 2021 or 2020.
we measure certain assets, such as intangible assets, at fair value on a non-recurring basis. these assets are recognized at fair value if they are deemed to be impaired. as of december 31, 2021 and 2020, except for the 2020 impairment of software developed at bakkt that is no longer useful (note 7), none of our intangible assets were required to be recorded at fair value since no other impairments were recorded.
we measure certain equity investments at fair value on a non-recurring basis using our policy election under asu no. 2016-01 (note 2). during 2021, we evaluated these investments and concluded that certain fair value adjustments were required under this election based on recent transactions related to our investment in euroclear (note 4).
the table below displays the fair value of our debt as of december 31, 2021 and december 31, 2020. the fair values of our fixed rate notes were estimated using quoted market prices for these instruments. the fair value of our commercial paper includes a discount and other short-term debt approximates par value since the interest rates on this short-term debt approximate market rates as of december 31, 2021 and december 31, 2020.
as of december 31, 2021                                           as of december 31, 2020
as of december 31, 2021                                           as of december 31, 2020
18.segment reporting beginning in the first quarter of 2021, origination technology revenues include those related to our ice mortgage technology network (previously reported in closing solutions revenues) and closing solutions revenues now include registration revenues related to mers (previously reported in other revenues). we believe these changes more accurately reflect how we operate the business. the prior-year periods have been adjusted to reflect this change.
our business is conducted through three reportable business segments, comprised of the following:
•our exchanges segment includes our global futures platforms for trade execution and clearing, nyse trading and listings and various data services related to those platforms;
•our fixed income and data services segment includes our fixed income and data analytics offerings, including pricing and reference data, indices, analytics, fixed income execution, or ice bonds, cds clearing, our consolidated feeds, ice global network businesses, other multi-asset class data and network services; and
•our mortgage technology segment provides mortgage technology solutions for the u.s. residential mortgage market from application through closing and the secondary market.
while revenues are recorded specifically in the segment in which they are earned or to which they relate, a significant portion of our operating expenses are not solely related to a specific segment because the expenses serve functions that are necessary for the operation of more than one segment. we directly allocate expenses when reasonably possible to do so. otherwise, we use a pro-rata revenue approach as the allocation method for the expenses that do not relate solely to one segment and serve functions that are necessary for the operation of all segments.
our chief operating decision maker does not review total assets or statements of income below operating income by segments; therefore, such information is not presented below. our three segments do not engage in intersegment transactions.
financial data for our business segments is as follows in 2021, 2020 and 2019 (in millions):

revenue from one member of our exchanges segment comprised $443 million or 11% of our exchanges revenue, less transaction based expenses during 2021. no customers or clearing members accounted for more than 10% of our segment revenues or consolidated revenues, less transaction-based expenses, in 2020. revenue from one clearing member of the exchanges segment comprised $368 million, or 11% of our exchanges revenues less transaction-based expenses in 2019. clearing members are primarily intermediaries and represent a broad range of principal trading firms. if a clearing member ceased its operations, we believe that the trading firms would continue to conduct transactions and would clear those transactions through another clearing member firm. no additional customers or clearing members accounted for more than 10% of our segment revenues or consolidated revenues in 2021 or 2019.
geographical information the following represents our revenues, less transaction-based expenses, net assets and net property and equipment based on the geographic location (in millions):
as of december 31, 2021                                $14,628                 $8,120             $22,748

19.earnings per common share the following is a reconciliation of the numerators and denominators of the basic and diluted earnings per common share computations in 2021, 2020 and 2019 (in millions, except per share amounts):
net income attributable to intercontinental exchange, inc.                    $4,058                      $2,089                      $1,933
effect of dilutive securities - stock options and restricted stock                 3                           3                           4
basic earnings per common share is calculated using the weighted average common shares outstanding during the periods. changes in the weighted average common shares outstanding between years was primarily due to the stock issued in 2020 for the ellie mae acquisition, and by stock repurchases.
common equivalent shares from stock options and restricted stock awards, calculated using the treasury stock method, are included in the diluted per share calculations unless the effect of their inclusion would be antidilutive. during 2021, 2020 and 2019 281,000, 372,000 and 454,000 outstanding stock options, respectively, were not included in the computation of diluted earnings per common share because to do so would have had an antidilutive effect. in addition, we excluded warrants and preferred and common incentive units under the bakkt equity incentive plan in 2020 and 2019 because they were also antidilutive. none of these warrants and preferred/common units are outstanding as of december 31, 2021 due to the deconsolidation of bakkt. as of both december 31, 2021 and 2020, there were 50,000 and 89,000, respectively, of restricted stock units that were vested but have not been issued that are included in the computation of diluted earnings per share. certain figures in the table above may not recalculate due to rounding.

item 7.    management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements for many reasons. see the factors set forth under the heading "forward looking statements" at the beginning of part 1 of this annual report and in item 1(a) under the heading "risk factors." for discussion related to the results of operations and changes in financial condition for 2020 compared to 2019 refer to part ii, item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in our 2020 annual report on form 10-k, which was filed with the u.s. securities and exchange commission on february 4, 2021.

recent developments bakkt transaction on october 15, 2021, bakkt holdings, llc, or bakkt, completed its merger with vpc impact acquisition holdings, or vih, a special purpose acquisition company sponsored by victory park capital, or vpc. bakkt is an integrated platform that enables customers and consumers to transact in digital assets.
the business combination between bakkt and vih resulted in enterprise value of approximately $2.1 billion, including approximately $479 million of cash on the combined company's balance sheet, reflecting a contribution of up to $123 million of cash held in vih's trust account, and a $325 million concurrent private investment in public equity, or pipe, of class a common stock of the combined company and $31 million of cash held in bakkt accounts. the pipe was priced at $10.00 per share and included a $47 million commitment from us. the newly combined company has been renamed bakkt holdings, inc. and is listed on the new york stock exchange, or nyse.
as part of the transaction, bakkt's existing equity holders and management rolled 100% of their equity into the combined company, and are subject to a six-month lockup period. certain shareholders of vih exercised their redemption rights, and at closing, bakkt equity holders, including ice, owned approximately 81% of the combined company, vih's public shareholders owned approximately 5%, vpc owned 2%, and pipe investors (a group that also includes us) owned approximately 12% of the issued and outstanding common stock of the combined company.
following completion of the business combination, we initially held a 68% economic interest and a minority voting interest in the combined company. prior to the closing, bakkt revenues and operating expenses were reported within our consolidated revenues and operating expenses. following the closing, as a consequence of holding a minority voting interest in the combined company, during the fourth quarter of 2021 we deconsolidated bakkt and treat it as an equity method investment within our financial statements. we recorded a gain on the transaction of $1.4 billion during the fourth quarter of 2021, which is included in other non-operating income within our consolidated income statement. for the three months ended december 31, 2021, we recorded estimated equity losses of ($92 million) related to our investment in bakkt.
since march 2020, the coronavirus (covid-19) pandemic has created economic and financial disruptions globally and has led governmental authorities to take unprecedented measures to mitigate the spread of the disease, including travel bans, border closings, business closures, quarantines and shelter-in-place orders, and to take actions designed to stabilize markets and promote economic growth.
from an operational perspective, our businesses, including our exchanges, clearing houses, listing venues, data services businesses, and mortgage platforms, have remained open and we do not have any plans to close any of our business operations as a result of the covid-19 pandemic. however, due to the covid-19 pandemic, we have taken preventative measures and implemented contingency plans, and many of our employees are continuing to work remotely. we believe that our global office closures and phased re-opening measures were and continue to be in compliance, as necessary, with local government directives and social distancing directives. we continue to monitor local government mandates in determining our office re-openings, re-closures and work-related travel.
global health concerns relating to covid-19 and preventive measures taken to reduce its spread have created significant volatility in financial markets, which has resulted in higher trading volumes for some of our products and increased demand for our services.
the extent of the impact of the pandemic on our business will depend on future developments, including the duration, spread and severity of the outbreak, the effectiveness of vaccines against covid-19 over the long term and against new and emerging variants thereof, and the actions taken to contain the spread of the disease or mitigate its impact. we continue to monitor this dynamic situation, including guidance and regulations issued by u.s. and other governmental authorities. in light of the continually evolving nature of the covid-19 outbreak, we are not able at this time to estimate the ultimate effect of the pandemic on our business, results of operations or financial condition in the future.

•revenues, less transaction-based expenses, increased $1.1 billion in 2021 from 2020. the increase in revenues includes $44 million in favorable foreign exchange effects arising from the weaker u.s. dollar in 2021 from 2020.
•revenues, less transaction-based expenses, increased $834 million in 2020 from 2019. the increase in revenues includes $7 million in favorable foreign exchange effects arising from the weaker u.s. dollar in 2020 from 2019.
•operating expenses increased $694 million in 2021 from 2020. the increase in operating expenses includes $22 million in unfavorable foreign exchange effects arising from the weaker u.s. dollar in 2021 from 2020.
•operating expenses increased $474 million in 2020 from 2019. the increase in operating expenses includes $2 million in unfavorable foreign exchange effects arising from the weaker u.s. dollar in 2020 from 2019.
•other income (expense), net, in 2021 primarily includes our gain on the bakkt transaction of $1.4 billion, our gain on the sale of our coinbase global, inc., or coinbase, investment of $1.2 billion, equity earnings in occ of $51 million, estimated equity losses in our investment in bakkt during the post-merger period of $92 million, dividend income from euroclear plc, or euroclear, of $60 million, a fair value adjustment gain on our euroclear investment of $34 million and interest expense of $423 million.
•other income (expense), net, in 2020 primarily includes interest expense of $357 million, equity earnings in occ of $71 million, an accrual for potential legal settlements of $30 million, a fair value adjustment gain on our euroclear investment of $35 million, and gain on the sale of our bids trading, lp, or bids, investment of $20 million.
•the effective tax rate in 2021 is higher than the effective tax rate in 2020 primarily due to the deferred income tax impacts resulting from the u.k. tax law changes as well as the bakkt transaction. in june 2021, the u.k. enacted a corporate income tax rate increase from 19% to 25% effective april 1, 2023.
•the effective tax rate in 2020 was higher than the effective tax rate in 2019 primarily due to u.k. tax law changes enacted in july 2020, partially offset by favorable state apportionment changes as a result of our acquisition of ellie mae, as well as favorable changes in certain international tax provisions as part of the u.s. federal tax cuts and jobs act, or tcja, in 2019.
business environment and market trends our business environment has been characterized by:
•globalization of marketplaces, customers and competitors;
•growing customer demand for workflow efficiency and automation;
•commodity, interest rate and financial markets uncertainty;
•growing demand for data to inform customers' risk management and investment decisions;
•price volatility increasing customers' demand for risk management services;
•increasing focus on capital and cost efficiencies;
•customers' preference to manage risk in markets demonstrating the greatest depth of liquidity and product diversity;
•the evolution of existing products and new product innovation to serve emerging customer needs and changing industry agreements;
•rising demand for speed, data, data capacity and connectivity by market participants, necessitating increased investment in technology; and
•consolidation and increasing competition among global markets for trading, clearing and listings.
recent changes with regard to global financial reform have emphasized the importance of transparent markets, centralized clearing and access to data, all of which are important aspects of our product offering. however, some of the proposed rules have yet to be implemented and some rules that have already been partially implemented are being reconsidered. in addition, some of the global regulations have not been fully harmonized and several non-u.s. regulations are inconsistent with u.s. rules. as the evolution continues, legislative and regulatory actions may change the way we conduct our business and may create uncertainty for market participants, which could affect trading volumes or demand for market data. as a result, it is difficult to predict all of the effects that the legislation and its implementing regulations will have on us. as discussed more fully in item 1 "- business - regulation" included in this annual report, brexit, the implementation of mifid ii and other regulations may result in operational, regulatory and/or business risk.
we have diversified our business so that we are not dependent on volatility or transaction activity in any one asset class. in addition, we have increased our portion of recurring revenues from 34% in 2014 to 49% in 2021. these recurring revenues include data services, listings and various mortgage technology solutions.
many of the data products we sell and services we provide are required for our clients' business operations regardless of market volatility or shifts in business profitability levels. we anticipate that there will continue to be growth in the financial information services sector driven by a number of global trends, including the following:
•increasing global regulatory demands;
•greater use of fair value accounting standards and reliance on independent valuations;
•greater emphasis on risk management;
•market fragmentation driven by regulatory changes;
•ongoing growth in the size and diversity of financial markets;
•increased automation of fixed income, mortgage and other less automated markets;
•the development of new data products;
•the demand for greater data capacity and connectivity;
•increasing demand for outsourced services by financial institutions.
we continue to focus on our strategy to grow each of our revenue streams, and prudently manage expenses, in order to mitigate these uncertainties and to build on our growth opportunities by leveraging our proprietary data, clearing, markets and technology solutions.
segment results our business is conducted through three reportable business segments, comprised of the following:
•our exchanges segment includes our trade execution and clearing within our global futures network and nyse businesses, various data and connectivity services that are directly related to those exchange platforms, administration fees and our nyse listings business. trade execution and clearing products include energy, agricultural and metals, financial futures and options, cash equities, equity options, otc and other;
•our fixed income and data services segment includes pricing and reference data, analytics, indices, trade execution and clearing within our ice bonds and cds businesses, consolidated feeds and our ice global network businesses; and
•our mortgage technology segment includes origination technology, closing solutions, data and analytics and other mortgage technology businesses.
while revenues are recorded specifically in the segment in which they are earned or to which they relate, a significant portion of our operating expenses are not solely related to a specific segment because the expenses serve functions that are necessary for the operation of more than one segment. we directly allocate expenses when reasonably possible to do so. otherwise, we use a pro-rata revenue approach as the allocation method for the expenses that do not relate solely to one segment and serve functions that are necessary for the operation of all segments. our segments do not engage in intersegment transactions.
beginning in the first quarter of 2021, origination technology revenues include those related to our ice mortgage technology network (previously reported in closing solutions revenues) and closing solutions revenues now include registration revenues related to merscorp holdings, inc., or mers, (previously reported in other revenues). we believe these changes more accurately reflect how we operate the business. prior-year periods have been adjusted to reflect these changes.

(1)transaction-based expenses are largely attributable to our cash equities and options business.
exchanges revenues our exchanges segment includes transaction and clearing revenues from our futures and nyse exchanges, related data and connectivity services, and our listings business. transaction and clearing revenues consist of fees collected from derivatives, cash equities and equity options trading and derivatives clearing, and are reported on a net basis, except for the nyse transaction-based expenses discussed below. rates per-contract, or rpc, are driven by the number of contracts or securities traded and the fees charged per contract, net of certain rebates. our per-contract transaction and clearing revenues will depend upon many factors, including, but not limited to, market conditions, transaction and clearing volume, product mix, pricing, applicable revenue sharing and market making agreements, and new product introductions. because transaction and clearing revenues are generally assessed on a per-contract basis, revenues and profitability fluctuate with changes in contract volume and product mix. our data and connectivity services revenues are recurring subscription fees related to the various data and connectivity services that we provide which are directly attributable to our exchange venues. our listings revenues are also recurring subscription fees that we earn for the provision of nyse listings services for public companies and etfs, and related corporate actions for listed companies.
in 2021 and 2020, 17% and 14%, respectively, of our exchanges segment revenues, less transaction-based expenses, were billed in pounds sterling or euros. due to the fluctuations of the pound sterling and euro compared to the u.s. dollar, our exchanges segment revenues, less transaction-based expenses, were higher by $30 million in 2021 from 2020.
our exchange transaction and clearing revenues are presented net of rebates. we recorded rebates of $1.0 billion and $962 million in 2021 and 2020, respectively. we offer rebates in certain of our markets primarily to support market liquidity and trading volume by providing qualified participants in those markets a discount to the applicable commission rate. such rebates are calculated based on volumes traded. the increase in rebates is primarily due to the launch of new products, including ice murban crude oil futures and the sterling overnight index average, or sonia.
•energy futures and options: total energy volume increased 1% and revenues increased 10% in 2021 from 2020.
-total oil volume increased 3% in 2021 from 2020 driven by price volatility related to oil supply and demand dynamics and macroeconomic uncertainty in late 2021.
-our global natural gas futures and options volume decreased 4% in 2021 from 2020 as 2020 benefited from elevated volatility related to covid-19, partially offset by 2021 continued growth in our ttf and asian jkm gas complexes driven by the globalization of gas, coupled with heightened price volatility in 2021 related to natural gas supply and demand dynamics in the u.k. and europe.
-our environmentals and other futures and options volume increased 18% to record levels in 2021 from 2020 due to an increase in the price of carbon and continued demand for market-based mechanisms to price climate risk and help enable greenhouse gas reduction goals.
•agricultural and metals futures and options: total volume in our agricultural and metals futures and options markets decreased 10% and revenues decreased 7% in 2021 from 2020. the overall decrease in agricultural volumes was due to 2020 benefiting from elevated volatility related to covid-19 and a sharp decline in oil prices, partially offset by elevated volatility in late 2021 as a result of weather-related supply and demand dynamics impacting our coffee and cotton markets as well as geopolitical events impacting our cocoa markets.
-sugar futures and options volumes decreased 21% in 2021 from 2020.
-other agricultural and metal futures and options volumes were flat in 2021 as compared to 2020.

-interest rate futures and options volume and revenue increased 6% and 23% in 2021 from 2020, respectively, driven by interest rate volatility from increased speculation of central bank activity due to post-pandemic global economic re-opening and inflation concerns. interest rate futures and options revenues were $237 million and $193 million in 2021 and 2020, respectively.
-other financial futures and options volume, which includes our msci®, ftse® and nyse fang+ equity index products, decreased 12% and revenue decreased 4% in 2021 from 2020. other financial futures and options volume decreased as 2020 benefited from elevated volatility across global equity markets driven by the emergence of covid-19. other financial futures and options revenues were $157 million and $164 million in 2021 and 2020, respectively.
•cash equities and equity options: cash equities volume decreased 6% in 2021 from 2020 as 2020 benefited from elevated volatility across global equity markets driven by the emergence of covid-19. cash equities revenues, net of transaction-based expenses, were $246 million and $276 million in 2021 and 2020, respectively. equity options volume increased 40% in 2021 from 2020 driven by increased participation and higher market share. equity options revenues, net of transaction-based expenses, were $109 million and $101 million in 2021 and 2020, respectively.
•otc and other: otc and other transactions include revenues from our otc energy business and other trade confirmation services, as well as interest income on certain clearing margin deposits, regulatory penalties and fines, fees for use of our facilities, regulatory fees charged to member organizations of our u.s. securities exchanges, designated market maker service fees, exchange membership fees and agricultural grading and certification fees. our otc and other revenues increased 10% in 2021 from 2020. following the october 2021 bakkt transaction, bakkt revenues are no longer included within our otc and other revenues.
•data and connectivity services: our data and connectivity services revenues increased 6% in 2021 from 2020. the increase in revenue was driven by the strong retention rate of existing customers and increased purchases by existing customers.
•listings revenues: through nyse, nyse american and nyse arca, we generate listings revenue related to the provision of listings services for public companies and etfs, and related corporate actions for listed companies. listings revenues increased 7% in 2021 from 2020, driven by equity capital markets activity, including an increase in demand for special purpose acquisition company, or spac, listings.
listings revenues in our securities markets arise from fees applicable to companies listed on our cash equities exchanges- original listing fees and annual listing fees. original listing fees consist of two components: initial listing fees and fees related to corporate actions. initial listing fees, subject to a minimum and maximum amount, are based on the number of shares that a company initially lists. all listings fees are billed upfront and the identified performance obligations are satisfied over time. revenue related to the investor relations performance obligation is recognized ratably over the period these services are provided, with the remaining revenue recognized ratably over time as customers continue to list on our exchanges.
in addition, we earn corporate actions-related listing fees in connection with actions involving the issuance of new shares, such as stock splits, rights issues and sales of additional securities, as well as mergers and acquisitions. listings fees related to other corporate actions are considered contract modifications of our listing contracts and are recognized ratably over time as customers continue to list on our exchanges.
in a record year for new issuance, nyse raised $221 billion in ipos and follow-on offerings from over 594 transactions, an increase of 20% from $185 billion raised in 2020.

open interest is the aggregate number of contracts (long or short) that clearing members hold either for their own account or on behalf of their clients. open interest refers to the total number of contracts that are currently "open," - in other words, contracts that have been entered into but not yet liquidated by either an offsetting trade, exercise, expiration or assignment. open interest is also a measure of the future activity remaining to be closed out in terms of the number of contracts that members and their clients continue to hold in the particular contract and by the number of contracts held for each contract month listed by the exchange. the following charts and table present our year-end open interest for our futures and options contracts (in thousands, except for percentages):

handled volume represents the total number of shares of equity securities, etfs and crossing session activity internally matched on our exchanges or routed to and executed on an external market center. matched volume represents the total number of shares of equity securities, etfs and crossing session activity executed on our exchanges.
transaction-based expenses our equities and equity options markets pay fees to the sec pursuant to section 31 of the exchange act. section 31 fees are recorded on a gross basis as a component of transaction and clearing fee revenue. these section 31 fees are assessed to recover the government's costs of supervising and regulating the securities markets and professionals and are subject to change. we, in turn, collect corresponding activity assessment fees from member organizations clearing or settling trades on the equities and options exchanges, and recognize these amounts in our transaction and clearing revenues when invoiced. the activity assessment fees are designed to equal the section 31 fees. as a result, activity assessment fees and the corresponding section 31 fees do not have an impact on our net income, although the timing of payment by us will vary from collections. section 31 fees were $248 million and $622 million in 2021 and 2020, respectively. the decrease in section 31 fees was primarily related to a decline in rates, which were revised in february of both years. the fees we collect are included in cash at the time of receipt and we remit the amounts to the sec semi-annually as required. the total amount is included in accrued liabilities and was $57 million as of december 31, 2021.
we make liquidity payments to cash and options trading customers, as well as routing charges made to other exchanges which are included in transaction-based expenses. we incur routing charges when we do not have the best bid or offer in the market for a security that a customer is trying to buy or sell on one of our securities exchanges. in that case, we route the customer's order to the external market center that displays the best bid or offer. the external market center charges us a fee per share (denominated in tenths of a cent per share) for routing to its system. we record routing charges on a gross basis as a component of transaction and clearing fee revenue. cash liquidity payments, routing and clearing fees were $1.8 billion and $1.6 billion in 2021 and 2020, respectively.

our fixed income and data services segment represents fixed income and credit trading and clearing as well as subscription-based, or recurring, revenues related to our fixed income data and analytics offerings as well as other multi-asset class data and network services.
in both 2021 and 2020, 14% of our fixed income and data services segment revenues were billed in pounds sterling or euros. as the pound sterling or euro exchange rate changes, the u.s. equivalent of revenues denominated in foreign currencies changes accordingly. due to the fluctuations of the pound sterling and euro compared to the u.s. dollar during 2021, our fixed income and data services revenues were higher by $14 million in 2021 than in 2020.
fixed income and data services revenues our fixed income and data services revenues increased 4% in 2021 from 2020 primarily due to growth in our fixed income data and analytics products and our other data and network services.
•fixed income execution: fixed income execution includes revenues from ice bonds. execution fees are reported net of rebates, which were nominal in 2021, 2020 and 2019. our fixed income execution revenues decreased 25% in 2021 from 2020. the decrease in revenue was due to 2020 benefiting from price volatility related to covid-19, as well as decreased retail activity, particularly in municipal and corporate bonds, as a result of low interest rates.
•cds clearing: cds clearing revenues decreased 8% in 2021 from 2020. the notional value of cds cleared was $17.0 trillion and $17.9 trillion in 2021 and 2020, respectively. elevated volatility in 2020 related to covid-19 benefited 2020 revenues, with volatility and cleared volumes generally returning to more normal levels late in 2021.
•fixed income data and analytics: our fixed income data and analytics revenues increased 6% in 2021 from 2020. the increase in revenue was due to strength in our index business and continued growth in our pricing and reference data business driven by the strong retention rate of existing customers, the addition of new customers, and increased purchases by existing customers.
•other data and network services: our other data and network services revenues increased 8% in 2021 from 2020. the increase in revenues was driven primarily by growth in our ice global network offering, coupled with strength in our consolidated feeds and desktop revenues.
annual subscription value, or asv, represents, at a point in time, the data services revenues, which includes fixed income data and analytics as well as other data and network services, subscribed for the succeeding 12 months. asv does not include new sales, contract terminations or price changes that may occur during that 12-month period. however, while it is an indicative forward-looking metric, it does not provide a precise growth forecast of the next 12 months of data services revenues.
as of december 31, 2021, asv was $1.646 billion, which increased 4.9% compared to the asv as of december 31, 2020. asv represents nearly 100% of total data services revenues for this segment. this does not adjust for year-over-year foreign exchange fluctuations.

mortgage technology revenues our mortgage technology revenues are derived from our comprehensive, end-to-end u.s. residential mortgage platform. our mortgage technology business enables greater workflow efficiency for customers focused on originating u.s. residential mortgage loans. mortgage technology revenues increased $812 million or 137% in 2021 from 2020. revenues from ellie mae following our september 2020 acquisition were $351 million in 2020.
•origination technology: our origination technology acts as a system of record for the mortgage transaction, automating the gathering, reviewing, and verifying of mortgage-related information and enabling automated enforcement of rules and business practices designed to help ensure that each completed loan transaction is of high quality and adheres to secondary market standards. these revenues are based on recurring software as a service, or saas, subscription fees, with an additive transaction-based or success-based pricing fee as lenders exceed the number of loans closed that are included with their monthly base subscription.
in addition, the ice mortgage technology network provides originators connectivity to the mortgage supply chain and facilitates the secure exchange of information between our customers and a broad ecosystem of third-party service providers, as well as lenders and investors that are critical to consummating the millions of loan transactions that occur on our origination network each year. revenue from the ice mortgage technology network is largely transaction-based.
•closing solutions: our closing solutions uniquely connect key participants, such as lenders, title and settlement agents and individual county recorders, to digitize the traditionally manual and paper-based closing and recording process. our closing solutions also include revenues from the mers database, a leading system for recording and tracking changes in mortgage servicing rights and beneficial ownership interests in loans secured by u.s. residential real estate. closing solutions revenues increased in 2021 from 2020 as a result of an increase in residential home sales, market share gains and increased demand and adoption of digital solutions. revenues from closing solutions are largely transaction-based.
•data and analytics: revenues include those related to ice mortgage technology's automation, intelligence, quality, or aiq, offering, which applies machine learning and artificial intelligence, or ai, to the entire loan origination process, offering customers greater efficiency by streamlining data collection and validation through our automated document recognition and data extraction capabilities. aiq revenues can be both recurring and transaction-based in nature. in addition, our data offerings include real-time industry and peer benchmarking tools, which provide originators a granular view into the real-time trends of nearly half the u.s. residential mortgage market. we also provide a data as a service, or daas, offering through private data clouds for lenders to access their own data and origination information. revenues related to our data products are largely subscription-based and recurring in nature.
•other: other revenues include professional services fees, as well as revenues from ancillary products. other revenues can be both recurring and transaction-based in nature.

the majority of our operating expenses do not vary directly with changes in our volume and revenues, except for certain technology and communication expenses, including data acquisition costs, licensing and other fee-related arrangements and a portion of our compensation expense that is tied directly to our data sales or overall financial performance.
we expect our operating expenses to increase in absolute terms in future periods in connection with the growth of our business, and to vary from year-to-year based on the type and level of our acquisitions, our integrations and other investments.
in 2021 and 2020, 10% and 11%, respectively, of our operating expenses were incurred in pounds sterling or euros. due to fluctuations in the u.s. dollar compared to the pound sterling and euro, our consolidated operating expenses were $22 million higher in 2021 than in 2020. see item 7(a) "- quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk - foreign currency exchange rate risk" below for additional information.
compensation and benefits expenses compensation and benefits expense is our most significant operating expense and includes non-capitalized employee wages, bonuses, non-cash or stock compensation, certain severance costs, benefits and employer taxes. the bonus component of our compensation and benefits expense is based on both our financial performance and individual employee performance. the performance-based restricted stock compensation expense is also based on our financial performance. therefore, our compensation and benefits expense will vary year-to-year based on our financial performance and fluctuations in our number of employees. the below chart summarizes the significant drivers of our compensation and benefits expense results for the periods presented (dollars in millions, except employee headcount).
2021                                                     2020                                   change employee headcount                          8,858                         8,890                 -         %
employee headcount decreased in 2021 from 2020 primarily due to the deconsolidation of bakkt, which was partially offset by increased hiring in 2021. ellie mae compensation and benefits expense was $174 million higher in 2021 than in 2020 due to our september 2020 acquisition. bakkt compensation and benefits expense was $16 million higher in 2021 than in 2020 due to increases in employee headcount prior to deconsolidating bakkt. in addition, compensation and benefits expense increased $67 million in 2021 from 2020 due to merit pay increases, above target performance-based compensation and higher employee insurance costs than in 2020 due to the impact of covid-19. the stock-based compensation expenses in the table above relate to employee stock option and restricted stock awards.
professional services expenses professional services expense includes fees for consulting services received on strategic and technology initiatives, temporary labor, as well as regulatory, legal and accounting fees, and may fluctuate as a result of changes in our use of these services in our business.
professional services expenses increased in 2021 from 2020 primarily due to an increase of $26 million from ellie mae which was partially offset by lower legal expenses for 2021.
acquisition-related transaction and integration costs in 2021, we incurred $59 million in acquisition-related transaction costs related to the deconsolidation of bakkt, which included $31 million non-cash compensation related to a market condition event triggered on the bakkt equity incentive awards in connection with the merger of bakkt and vih. additionally, we incurred $39 million in integration costs related to ellie mae.
we expect to continue to explore and pursue various potential acquisitions and other strategic opportunities to strengthen our competitive position and support our growth. as a result, we may incur acquisition-related transaction costs in future periods.
technology and communication expenses technology support services consist of costs for running our wholly-owned data centers, hosting costs paid to third-party data centers, and maintenance of our computer hardware and software required to support our technology and cybersecurity. these costs are driven by system capacity, functionality and redundancy requirements. communication expenses consist of costs for network connections for our electronic platforms and telecommunications costs.
technology and communications expense also includes fees paid for access to external market data, licensing and other fee agreement expenses. technology and communications expenses may be impacted by growth in electronic contract volume, our capacity requirements, changes in the number of telecommunications hubs and connections with customers to access our electronic platforms directly.
technology and communications expenses increased by $117 million in 2021 from 2020, primarily due to the inclusion of ellie mae expenses, which were $87 million higher in 2021 than in 2020. in addition, technology and communications expenses increased by $24 million in 2021 from 2020 due to increased license fees and data acquisition costs.
rent and occupancy expenses rent and occupancy expense relates to leased and owned property and includes rent, maintenance, real estate taxes, utilities and other related costs. we have significant operations located in the u.s., u.k., and india, with smaller offices located throughout the world.
rent and occupancy expenses includes the expenses of ellie mae, which increased $6 million in 2021 from 2020. these expenses were partially offset by a reduction in other occupancy expenses in 2021 and the early termination of our nyse chicago office lease in 2020. see item 2 "- properties" above for additional information regarding our leased and owned property.
selling, general and administrative expenses selling, general and administrative expenses include marketing, advertising, public relations, insurance, bank service charges, dues and subscriptions, travel and entertainment, non-income taxes and other general and administrative costs.
selling, general and administrative expenses increased in 2021 from 2020, primarily due to the inclusion of $13 million of ellie mae expenses and $12 million of bakkt expenses related to the launch of bakkt's digital wallet, bakkt app. in addition, marketing expenses increased $19 million in 2021 from 2020 primarily due to a higher number of nyse initial public offerings, or ipos, which were partially offset by a charitable contribution in support of covid-19 relief efforts of $10 million and an $8 million regulatory settlement accrual in 2020.
depreciation and amortization expenses depreciation and amortization expense results from depreciation of long-lived assets such as buildings, leasehold improvements, aircraft, hardware and networking equipment, software, furniture, fixtures and equipment over their estimated useful lives. this expense includes amortization of intangible assets obtained in our acquisitions of businesses, as well as on various licensing agreements, over their estimated useful lives. intangible assets subject to amortization consist primarily of customer relationships, trading products with finite lives and technology. this expense also includes amortization of internally-developed and purchased software over its estimated useful life.
we recorded amortization expenses on intangible assets acquired as part of our acquisitions, as well as on other intangible assets, of $622 million and $388 million in 2021 and 2020, respectively. the increase in 2021 over 2020 was primarily due to an increase in the amortization of ellie mae intangible assets of $246 million.
we recorded depreciation expenses on our fixed assets of $387 million and $363 million in 2021 and 2020, respectively. the increase in 2021 over 2020 was primarily due to an increase in the depreciation of ellie mae fixed assets of $31 million, partially offset by a software impairment charge of $11 million in 2020 related to a portion of customized software developed at bakkt that was no longer useful.
consolidated non-operating income (expense)
income and expenses incurred through activities outside of our core operations are considered non-operating. the following tables present our non-operating income (expenses) (dollars in millions):
2021                                                                                             2020            change                           2020                        2019                  change other income (expense):
interest expense interest expense increased in 2021 from 2020 primarily due to the issuance of senior notes in may 2020 to refinance existing debt, the issuance of senior notes in august 2020 related to the ellie mae acquisition, and $4 million in accelerated unamortized costs related to the early redemption in september 2021 of the floating rate notes due june 2023, partially offset by a $14 million extinguishment payment we incurred related to the june 2020 early redemption of senior notes with an original maturity of december 1, 2020, or the december 2020 senior notes, and $5 million pre-acquisition interest expense on debt issued for ellie mae acquisition. see "- debt" below.
other income (expense), net during 2021, bakkt completed its merger with vih, which resulted in an initial 68% economic interest, and we recorded a gain of $1.4 billion as other income upon our deconsolidation of bakkt. following the merger, we show our economic interest share of estimated bakkt profits/(losses) as equity earnings, which are also included in other income (expense), net. we recorded other expense of ($92 million) related to our bakkt investment for the post-merger period during 2021.
during 2021, coinbase completed an ipo and we sold our investment in coinbase for $1.2 billion, and recorded a gain of $1.2 billion as other income.
during 2021, we recorded a gain of $7 million related to the settlement of an acquisition-related indemnification claim from a prior acquisition as other income. in addition, we accrued approximately $16 million related to a legal settlement. in 2020, we recorded an accrual for potential legal settlements of $30 million as other income.
we own a 40% interest in the options clearing corporation, or occ, which we treat as an equity method investment. occ is regulated by the sec and the cftc. we recognized $51 million and $71 million of equity earnings as our share of occ's estimated profits during 2021 and 2020, respectively, which is included in other income. refer to note 4 to our consolidated financial statements, included in this annual report for additional details on our occ investment.
in connection with our equity investment in euroclear, we recognized dividend income of $60 million in 2021 and $19 million in 2019, included in other income. as a result of a 2020 european regulation limiting dividend payments, we did not receive a euroclear dividend in 2020, but we received two dividend payments during 2021. in addition, in both september 2021 and in november 2020 we became aware of observable price changes in orderly transactions of similar euroclear investments by third parties. the transactions resulted in fair value adjustments of our euroclear investment, and we recorded gains of $34 million and $35 million in other income in 2021 and 2020, respectively, including the impacts of foreign currency exchange.
we historically held a 9% ownership interest in bids, a registered broker-dealer and the operator of the bids alternative trading system. in december 2020, we sold our investment in bids to cboe and recorded a gain on the sale of $20 million, included in other income.
we incurred foreign currency transaction losses of $13 million and $5 million in 2021 and 2020, respectively. this was primarily attributable to the fluctuations of the pound sterling and euro relative to the u.s. dollar. foreign currency transaction gains and losses are recorded in other income (expense), net, when the settlement of foreign currency assets, liabilities and payables occur in non-functional currencies and there is an increase or decrease in the period-end foreign currency exchange rates between periods. see item 7a "- quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk - foreign currency exchange rate risk" included elsewhere in this annual report for more information on these items.
in connection with our adoption of accounting standards update, or asu, 2017-07, compensation retirement benefits: improving the presentation of net periodic pension cost and net periodic postretirement benefit cost, or asu 2017-07, we are recognizing the other components of net benefit cost of our defined benefit plans in the income statement as non-operating income on a full retrospective basis. the combined net periodic expense of these plans was $3 million and $6 million in 2021 and 2020, respectively.
non-controlling interest for consolidated subsidiaries in which our ownership is less than 100%, and for which we have control over the assets, liabilities and management of the entity, the outside stockholders' interests are shown as non-controlling interests. as of december 31, 2021, our non-controlling interests include those related to the non-ice limited partners' interest in our cds clearing subsidiaries and non-controlling interest in ice futures abu dhabi. prior to completion of the bakkt transaction on october 15, 2021, our non-controlling interest also included the redeemable non-controlling interest of the non-ice partners in bakkt, as discussed further below.
the non-ice limited partners of our cds clearing subsidiaries hold a 26.7% ownership interest as of december 31, 2021. in addition, during 2020 we received a contribution from a group of minority investors for a non-controlling interest in ice futures abu dhabi.
as of december 31, 2020, minority interests related to bakkt were reflected as redeemable non-controlling interests in temporary equity within our consolidated balance sheet. on october 15, 2021, bakkt completed its merger with vih and as of december 31, 2021, we no longer hold redeemable non-controlling interest related to bakkt. refer to note 3 to our consolidated financial statements contained elsewhere in this annual report.
consolidated income tax provision consolidated income tax expense was $1.6 billion and $658 million in 2021 and 2020, respectively. the change in consolidated income tax expense between years is primarily due to the tax impact of changes in our pre-tax income and the changes in our effective tax rate. the consolidated income tax expense for 2021 was elevated due to the tax expense associated with the gains resulting from our coinbase and bakkt transactions.
our effective tax rate was 29% and 24% in 2021 and 2020, respectively. the effective tax rate for 2021 is higher than the effective tax rate for 2020 primarily due to the deferred income tax impacts from the u.k. tax law changes as well as the bakkt transaction. in june 2021, the u.k. enacted a corporate income tax rate increase from 19% to 25% effective april 1, 2023.
on march 27, 2020, the cares act was enacted and certain income tax related relief was provided under the cares act. on march 11, 2021, the american rescue plan act, or arpa, was signed into law. the arpa enacted certain provisions that are relevant to corporate income tax. on november 15, 2021, the infrastructure investment and jobs act was signed into law. these provisions did not have a material impact on our income tax provision for 2021 or 2020.
see note 13 to our consolidated financial statements and related notes, which are included in this annual report, for additional information on these tax items.
liquidity and capital resources below are charts that reflect our outstanding debt and capital allocation. the acquisition and integration costs in the chart below include cash paid for acquisitions, net of cash received for divestitures, cash paid for equity and equity method investments, cash paid for non-controlling interest and redeemable non-controlling interest, and acquisition-related transaction and integration costs, in each year.
we have financed our operations, growth and cash needs primarily through income from operations and borrowings under our various debt facilities. our principal capital requirements have been to fund capital expenditures, working capital, strategic acquisitions and investments, stock repurchases, dividends and the development of our technology platforms. we believe that our cash on hand and cash flows from operations will be sufficient to repay our outstanding debt, but we may also need to incur additional debt or issue additional equity securities in the future. see "- future capital requirements" below.
see "- cash flow" below for a discussion of our capital expenditures and capitalized software development costs.
consolidated cash and cash equivalents were $607 million and $583 million as of december 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. we had $1.4 billion in short-term and long-term restricted cash and cash equivalents as of both december 31, 2021 and 2020. we had $145.9 billion and $81.6 billion of cash and cash equivalent margin deposits and guaranty funds as of december 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.
as of december 31, 2021, the amount of unrestricted cash held by our non-u.s. subsidiaries was $400 million. due to u.s. tax reform, the majority of our foreign earnings since january 1, 2018 have been subject to immediate u.s. income taxation, and the existing non-u.s. unrestricted cash balance can be distributed to the u.s. in the future with no material additional income tax consequences.
our cash and cash equivalents and financial investments are managed as a global treasury portfolio of non-speculative financial instruments that are readily convertible into cash, such as overnight deposits, term deposits, money market funds, mutual funds for treasury investments, short duration fixed income investments and other money market instruments, thus ensuring high liquidity of financial assets. we may invest a portion of our cash in excess of short-term operating needs in investment-grade marketable debt securities, including government or government-sponsored agencies and corporate debt securities. as of december 31, 2021, we held $13 million of unrestricted cash that was set aside for legal, regulatory and surveillance operations at nyse.
cash flow the following table presents the major components of net changes in cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash and cash equivalents (in millions):
operating activities                                                                                                                                     $3,123                        $2,881                      $2,659
effect of exchange rate changes                                                                                                                             (6)                             8                           4
operating activities net cash provided by operating activities primarily consists of net income adjusted for certain items, including depreciation and amortization, deferred taxes, stock based compensation and the effects of changes in working capital.
the $242 million increase in net cash provided by operating activities in 2021 from 2020 was driven by an increase of accounts receivable collections of $144 million, primarily due to a prior period covid-19-related decision to allow customers to defer payment of their 2020 listings invoices. in addition, operating cash increased due to a $2.0 billion increase in net income, adjusted for depreciation and amortization, deferred taxes, the gain from the sale of our coinbase investment, net of taxes, of $892 million, and the gain from the deconsolidation of bakkt, of $1.4 billion. these increases were partially offset by a decrease in section 31 fee collections of $219 million, primarily due to lower rates, which were revised in february of each year. the remaining change is due to fluctuations in our working capital and the timing of various payments such as transaction-related expenses and taxes payable on the sale of our coinbase investment.
investing activities consolidated net cash used in investing activities in 2021 primarily relates to $5.1 billion purchases of invested margin deposits, $179 million of capitalized expenditures, $273 million of software development costs, $117 million for the purchase of an equity method investment and $66 million cash paid for acquisitions, net of cash acquired, partially offset by $3.7 billion of proceeds from the sale of invested margin deposits and $1.2 billion in proceeds from the sale of our coinbase investment. consolidated net cash used in investing activities in 2020 relates to $9.4 billion cash paid for acquisitions, primarily ellie mae, net of cash acquired, $3.4 billion purchases of invested margin deposits, $207 million of capitalized expenditures and $203 million of software development costs, partially offset by $2.8 billion proceeds from the sale of invested margin deposits.
the capital expenditures primarily relate to hardware and software purchases to continue the development and expansion of our electronic platforms, data services and clearing houses and leasehold improvements. the software development expenditures primarily relate to the development and expansion of our electronic trading platforms, data services, mortgage services and clearing houses.
financing activities consolidated net cash provided by financing activities in 2021 primarily relates to an increase in our cash and cash equivalent margin deposits and guaranty fund balances of $65.7 billion, partially offset by $1.2 billion in repayments of debt facilities, $1.4 billion in net repayments under our commercial paper program, $250 million in repurchases of common stock, $747 million in dividend payments to our stockholders and $70 million in cash payments related to treasury shares received for restricted stock tax payments and stock options exercises.
consolidated net cash provided by financing activities in 2020 primarily relates to an increase in our cash and cash equivalent margin deposits and guaranty fund balances of $19.3 billion, $9.6 billion in net proceeds from the issuance of the may 2020 notes and the august 2020 notes, borrowings under a term loan facility and $1.1 billion in net issuances under our commercial paper program. cash provided by financing activities was partially offset by repayments of our $1.25 billion december 2020 senior notes, and the early payoff of the term loan mentioned above, $1.2 billion in repurchases of common stock, $669 million in dividend payments to stockholders and $74 million in cash payments related to treasury shares received for restricted stock tax payments and stock options exercises.
we have adjusted our historical presentation of opening and ending amounts of cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash and cash equivalents in our consolidated statements of cash flows to include cash and cash equivalent margin deposits and guaranty funds. changes in these balances are reflected as cash provided by/(used in) financing activities.
see note 10 to our consolidated financial statements, included in this annual report.
debt as of december 31, 2021, we had $13.9 billion in outstanding debt, consisting of $12.9 billion of fixed rate senior notes, $1.0 billion under our u.s. dollar commercial paper program, or the commercial paper program and $10 million under credit lines at our ice india subsidiaries. our fixed rate senior notes of $12.9 billion have a weighted average maturity of 15 years and a weighted average cost of 2.9% per annum. the commercial paper notes had original maturities ranging from three to 73 days as of december 31, 2021, with a weighted average interest rate of 0.33% per annum, and a weighted average remaining maturity of 26 days.
as of december 31, 2020, we had $16.5 billion in outstanding debt, consisting of $12.9 billion of fixed rate senior notes, $1.2 billion of floating rate senior notes, $2.4 billion under the commercial paper program and $6 million under credit lines at our ice india subsidiaries. our fixed rate senior notes of $12.9 billion had a weighted average maturity of 16 years and a weighted average cost of 3.0% per annum. the commercial paper notes had original maturities ranging from four to 266 days as of december 31, 2020, with a weighted average interest rate of 0.40% per annum, and a weighted average remaining maturity of 82 days.
in september 2021, we used the proceeds from commercial paper issuances and cash on hand to fund the redemption of $1.25 billion aggregate principal amount of senior floating rate notes due in june 2023, or the floating rate notes. we delivered a notice of redemption of the floating rate notes to wells fargo bank, national association, as trustee, under the indenture governing the floating rate notes, which was delivered to the holders of the floating rate notes on september 17, 2021, and they were subsequently redeemed on september 27, 2021. in connection with this redemption, we recorded $4 million in accelerated unamortized deferred loan costs, which are included in interest expense in our consolidated statements of income for 2021.
we have a $3.8 billion senior unsecured revolving credit facility, or the credit facility, pursuant to a credit agreement with wells fargo bank, n.a., as primary administrative agent, issuing lender and swing-line lender, bank of america, n.a., as syndication agent, backup administrative agent and swing-line lender, and the lenders party thereto. as of december 31, 2021, of the $3.8 billion that is currently available for borrowing under the credit facility, $1.0 billion is required to back-stop the amount outstanding under our commercial paper program and $171 million is required to support certain broker-dealer and other subsidiary commitments. the amount required to backstop the amounts outstanding under the commercial paper program will fluctuate as we increase or decrease our commercial paper borrowings. the remaining $2.6 billion is available for working capital and general corporate purposes, including, but not limited to, acting as a backstop to future increases in the amounts outstanding under the commercial paper program. on october 15, 2021, we agreed with the lenders to extend the maturity date of the credit facility to october 15, 2026, among other items.
on august 21, 2020, we entered into a $750 million 18-month senior unsecured delayed draw term loan facility with a maturity date of february 21, 2022. we borrowed in full under the facility on september 3, 2020 and the proceeds were used to fund a portion of the purchase price for the ellie mae acquisition. we had the option to prepay the facility in whole or in part at any time and paid off the full balance of the loan on december 16, 2020. interest on borrowings under this term loan facility were based on the principal amount outstanding at libor plus an applicable margin, which was equal to 1.125%.
on august 20, 2020, we issued $6.5 billion in aggregate principal amount of new senior notes, comprised of $1.25 billion in aggregate principal amount of floating rate senior notes due in 2023, $1.0 billion in aggregate principal amount of 0.70% senior notes due in 2023, $1.5 billion in aggregate principal amount of 1.85% senior notes due in 2032, $1.25 billion in aggregate principal amount of 2.65% senior notes due in 2040, and $1.5 billion in aggregate principal amount of 3.00% senior notes due in 2060. we used the net proceeds from the offering to fund a portion of the purchase price for the ellie mae acquisition.
on may 26, 2020, we issued $2.5 billion in aggregate principal amount of new senior notes, comprised of $1.25 billion in aggregate principal amount of 2.10% senior notes due in 2030 and $1.25 billion in aggregate principal amount of 3.00% senior notes due in 2050. we used the net proceeds from the offering for general corporate purposes, including to fund the redemption of our $1.25 billion aggregate principal amount of 2.75% senior notes due in december 2020 and to pay down a portion of our commercial paper outstanding.
our commercial paper program enables us to borrow efficiently at reasonable short-term interest rates and provides us with the flexibility to de-lever using our strong annual cash flows from operating activities whenever our leverage becomes elevated as a result of investment or acquisition activities. we had net repayments of $1.4 billion under our commercial paper program during 2021. we used $1.2 billion of proceeds received from the sale of our coinbase investment to pay down the balance under our commercial paper program.
upon maturity of our commercial paper and to the extent old issuances are not repaid by cash on hand, we are exposed to the rollover risk of not being able to issue new commercial paper. to mitigate this risk, we maintain the credit facility for an aggregate amount which meets or exceeds the amount issued under our commercial paper program at any time. if we were not able to issue new commercial paper, we have the option of drawing on the backstop revolving facility. however, electing to do so would result in higher interest expense.
for additional details of our debt instruments, refer to note 10 to our consolidated financial statements, included in this annual report.
capital return in december 2019, our board approved an aggregate of $2.4 billion for future repurchases of our common stock with no fixed expiration date that became effective january 1, 2020.
during 2021, we repurchased 1.8 million shares of our outstanding common stock at a cost of $250 million on the open market. during 2020, we repurchased 13.6 million shares of our outstanding common stock at a cost of $1.2 billion, including 10.4 million shares at a cost of $948 million under our rule 10b5-1 trading plan and 3.2 million shares at a cost of $299 million on the open market. shares repurchased are held in treasury stock.
we discontinued stock repurchases and terminated our rule 10b5-1 trading plan in august 2020 in connection with our ellie mae acquisition and in november 2021, we resumed repurchases. the remaining balance of board approved funds for future repurchases as of december 31, 2021 was $903 million. in december 2021, our board approved an aggregate of $3.15 billion for future repurchases of our common stock with no fixed expiration date that became effective january 1, 2022. the $3.15 billion replaces the previous amount approved by the board. in december 2021 we entered into a new rule 10b5-1 trading plan that will become effective in february 2022. we may discontinue stock repurchases at any time and may amend or terminate a rule 10b5-1 trading plan at any time. the approval of our board for the stock repurchases does not obligate us to acquire any particular amount of our common stock. in addition, our board may increase or decrease the amount available for repurchases from time to time.
from time to time, we enter into rule 10b5-1 trading plans, as authorized by our board, to govern some or all of the repurchases of our shares of common stock. we expect funding for any stock repurchases to come from our operating cash flow or borrowings under our commercial paper program or our debt facilities. the timing and extent of future repurchases that are not made pursuant to a rule 10b5-1 trading plan will be at our discretion and will depend upon many conditions. in making a determination regarding any stock repurchases, management considers multiple factors, including overall stock market conditions, our common stock price performance, the remaining amount authorized for repurchases by our board, the potential impact of a stock repurchase program on our corporate debt ratings, our expected free cash flow and working capital needs, our current and future planned strategic growth initiatives, and other potential uses of our cash and capital resources.
during 2021, we paid cash dividends of $1.32 per share of our common stock in the aggregate, including quarterly dividends of $0.33 per share, for an aggregate payout of $747 million, which includes the payment of dividend equivalents on unvested employee restricted stock units. refer to note 12 to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report, for details on the amounts of our quarterly dividend payouts for the last three years.
future capital requirements our future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including the rate of growth across our segments, strategic plans and acquisitions, available sources for financing activities, required and discretionary technology and clearing initiatives, regulatory requirements, the timing and introduction of new products and enhancements to existing products, the geographic mix of our business and potential stock repurchases.
we currently expect to incur capital expenditures (including operational and real estate capital expenditures) and to incur software development costs that are eligible for capitalization ranging in the aggregate between $490 million and $520 million in 2022, which we believe will support the enhancement of our technology, business integration and the continued growth of our businesses.
as of december 31, 2021, we had $903 million authorized for future repurchases of our common stock. refer to note 12 to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report for additional details on our stock repurchase program.
our board has adopted a quarterly dividend policy providing that dividends will be approved quarterly by the board or the audit committee taking into account factors such as our evolving business model, prevailing business conditions, our current and future planned strategic growth initiatives and our financial results and capital requirements, without a predetermined net income payout ratio. for the first quarter of 2022, we announced a $0.38 per share dividend payable on march 31, 2022 to stockholders of record as of march 17, 2022.
other than the facilities for the ice clearing houses, our credit facility and our commercial paper program are currently the only significant agreements or arrangements that we have for liquidity and capital resources with third parties. see notes 10 and 14 to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion. in the event of any strategic acquisitions, mergers or investments, or if we are required to raise capital for any reason or desire to return capital to our stockholders, we may incur additional debt, issue additional equity to raise necessary funds, repurchase additional shares of our common stock or pay a dividend. however, we cannot provide assurance that such financing or transactions will be available or successful, or that the terms of such financing or transactions will be favorable to us. see "-risk factors" and note 10 to our consolidated financial statements, included in this annual report.
non-gaap measures we use certain financial measures internally to evaluate our performance and make financial and operational decisions that are presented in a manner that adjusts from their equivalent gaap measures or that supplement the information provided by our gaap measures. we use these adjusted results because we believe they more clearly highlight trends in our business that may not otherwise be apparent when relying solely on gaap financial measures, since these measures eliminate from our results specific financial items that have less bearing on our core operating performance.
we use these measures in communicating certain aspects of our results and performance, including in this annual report, and believe that these measures, when viewed in conjunction with our gaap results and the accompanying reconciliation, can provide investors with greater transparency and a greater understanding of factors affecting our financial condition and results of operations than gaap measures alone. in addition, we believe the presentation of these measures is useful to investors for making period-to-period comparisons of results because the adjustments to gaap are not reflective of our core business performance.
these financial measures are not presented in accordance with, or as an alternative to, gaap financial measures and may be different from non-gaap measures used by other companies. we encourage investors to review the gaap financial measures included in this annual report, including our consolidated financial statements, to aid in their analysis and understanding of our performance and in making comparisons.
the table below outlines our adjusted operating expenses, adjusted operating income, adjusted operating margin, adjusted net income attributable to ice common stockholders and adjusted earnings per share, which are non-gaap measures that are calculated by making adjustments for items we view as not reflective of our cash operations and core business performance. these measures, including the adjustments and their related income tax effect and other tax adjustments (in millions, except for percentages and per share amounts), are as follows:

amortization of acquisition-related intangibles are included in non-gaap adjustments as excluding these non-cash expenses provides greater clarity regarding our financial strength and stability of cash operating results.
transaction and integration costs are included as part of our core business expenses, except for those that are directly related to the announcement, closing, financing or termination of a transaction. however, we adjust for the acquisition-related transaction and integration costs relating to acquisitions such as ellie mae given the magnitude of the $11.4 billion purchase price of the acquisition. we also adjust for the acquisition-related transaction costs related to the merger of bakkt and vih due to the significance of the transaction. in 2020, we also included a $10 million adjustment for bridge2 solutions acquisition costs resulting from a bakkt incentive award market condition estimation adjustment as an acquisition-related success fee. this adjustment was directly related to the march 2020 capital call to fund the acquisition of bridge2 solutions and we believe is therefore appropriate since we exclude costs directly related to the success of a transaction.
in 2021, we recorded a $1.2 billion gain on the sale of our coinbase equity investment and a $1.4 billion gain on the deconsolidation of bakkt. we do not consider these items to be part of our core business operations.
effective january 1, 2021, we exclude net income from our unconsolidated equity method investees for purposes of calculating non-gaap measures and have retroactively restated the prior-year periods for comparability purposes. for 2021, this adjustment includes our share of net income from occ, bondlink, and bakkt (from the period of the bakkt merger on october 15, 2021 through december 31, 2021). this is consistent with how we treat changes in the fair value of our equity investments. we believe these adjustments provide greater clarity of our performance given that equity investments are non-cash and not a part of our core operations.
in addition, we also include the following items as non-gaap adjustments, as each of these are not considered a part of our core business operations:
•2021: the $34 million gain on the fair value adjustment of our euroclear equity investment;
•2021: the $7 million gain related to the settlement of an acquisition-related indemnification claim;
•2021: accrual of $16 million relating to a legal settlement;
•2021: the acceleration of unamortized costs of $4 million related to the september 2021 early redemption of our floating rate notes;
•2020: the $11 million impairment of software developed at bakkt when it was our subsidiary since it relates to the build-out of a fundamental software design vs. a recurring upgrade;
•2020: accrual of $30 million relating to a legal settlement;
•2020: accrual of $8 million relating to a regulatory settlement;
•2020: the $35 million gain on the fair value adjustment of our euroclear equity investment;
•2020: the extinguishment payment of $14 million related to the june 2020 early redemption of the december 2020 senior notes which had an original maturity of december 1, 2020, as a result of our new senior notes offering in may 2020. this included both a make-whole redemption payment and duplicative interest;
•2020: the $20 million gain on the sale of our bids equity investment;
•2020: pre-acquisition interest expense of $5 million on the august 2020 debt issued to fund a portion of the purchase price of our ellie mae acquisition;
•2020: promissory note impairment charges of $2 million on work performed by the original plan processor on the cat as non-gaap adjustments (this was in addition to the 2019 accrual of $16 million for the same item). see additional discussion on the cat in item 1(a) "-risk factors" in this annual report;
•2019: impairment of exchange registration intangible assets of $31 million at ice futures singapore. this non-cash impairment was a result of the estimated fair value of an acquired intangible asset falling below its carrying value. see note 8 to our consolidated financial statements, included in this annual report.
the tax items in non-gaap adjustments are either the tax impacts of the pre-tax non-gaap adjustments or tax items as described below that are not in the normal course of business and are not indicative of our core business performance. the following tax-related items are included as non-gaap adjustments:
•deferred tax adjustments on acquisition-related intangibles, including the impact of u.k. and u.s. state tax law changes and apportionment updates, as well as other foreign tax law changes which resulted in deferred tax expense/(benefit) of $183 million, $36 million and ($8 million) in 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. the deferred tax adjustments in 2021 relate primarily to the u.k. tax law changes enacted in june 2021, which increased the u.k. corporate income tax rate from 19% to 25% effective april 1, 2023. the deferred tax adjustments in 2020 were due to the tax law changes enacted in july 2020, which increased the u.k. corporate income tax rate from 17% to 19% effective april 1, 2020, as well as impacts of u.s. state apportionment charges.
•other tax adjustments of $3 million in 2019 for audit settlement payments primarily related to pre-acquisition tax matters in connection with our acquisition of nyse in 2013.
for additional information on these items, refer to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report and "- recent developments," "- consolidated operating expenses", "- consolidated non-operating income (expenses)" and "-consolidated income tax provision" above.
off-balance sheet arrangements as described in note 14 to our consolidated financial statements, which are included elsewhere in this annual report, certain clearing house collateral is reported off-balance sheet. we do not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities.
contractual obligations and commercial commitments we intend to fund our contractual obligations and commercial commitments from existing cash and cash flow from operations. as of december 31, 2021, our primary cash requirements include the following contractual and other obligations.
as of december 31, 2021, we had $13.9 billion in outstanding debt, including $1.5 billion of short-term debt. our outstanding debt consists of $12.9 billion of fixed rate senior notes, $1.0 billion under our u.s. dollar commercial paper program, or the commercial paper program and $10 million under credit lines at our ice india subsidiaries.
our operating leases primarily relate to our leased office space and data center facilities, and as of december 31, 2021, we had fixed lease payment obligations of $350 million, with $82 million payable within one-year.
we have other purchase obligations to purchase various goods and services that we believe are enforceable and legally binding.
in addition, we have $150.4 billion in cash and cash equivalent margin deposits and guaranty funds, invested deposits, delivery contracts payable and unsettled variation margin. clearing members of our clearing houses are required to deposit original margin and variation margin and to make deposits to a guaranty fund. the cash and cash equivalent deposits made to these margin accounts and to the guaranty fund are recorded in the consolidated balance sheet as current assets with corresponding current liabilities to the clearing members that deposited them. ice ngx administers the physical delivery of energy trading contracts. it has an equal and offsetting claim to and from its respective participants on opposite sides of the physically-settled contract, each of which is reflected as a delivery contract receivable with an offsetting delivery contract payable. see note 14 to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report for additional information on our clearing houses and the margin deposits, guaranty funds, invested deposits, delivery contracts payable and unsettled variation margin.
we also have unrecognized tax benefits, or utbs. as of december 31, 2021, our cumulative utbs were $229 million, and accrued interest and penalties related to utbs were $49 million. we are under examination by various tax authorities. we are unable to make a reasonable estimate of the periods of cash settlement because it is not possible to reasonably predict the amount of tax, interest and penalties, if any, that might be assessed by a tax authority or the timing of an assessment or payment. it is also not possible to reasonably predict whether or not the applicable statutes of limitations might expire without us being examined by any particular tax authority. see note 13 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information on our utbs.
as of december 31, 2021, we, through nyse, have net obligations of $103 million related to our pension and other benefit programs. the date of payment under these net obligations cannot be determined. see note 16 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information on our pension and other benefit programs.
in addition, the future funding of the implementation and operation of the cat is ultimately expected to be provided by both the sros and broker-dealers. to date, however, funding has been provided solely by the sros, and future funding is expected to be repaid if industry member fees are approved by the sec and subsequently collected by industry members. see "- non-gaap measures" above.
new and recently adopted accounting pronouncements refer to note 2 to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report for information on the new and recently adopted accounting pronouncements that are applicable to us.
critical accounting policies we have identified the policies below as critical to our business operations and the understanding of our results of operations. the impact of, and any associated risks related to, these policies on our business operations is discussed throughout "- management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations." for a detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies, see note 2 to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report.
our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with u.s. gaap. the preparation of financial statements in conformity with these accounting principles requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities, and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities, at the date of our financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
we base our estimates and judgments on our historical experience and other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances when we make these estimates and judgments and re-evaluate them on a periodic basis. based on these factors, we make estimates and judgments about, among other things, the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from market prices or other independent sources and about the recognition and characterization of our revenues and expenses. the values and results based on these estimates and judgments could differ significantly under different assumptions or conditions and could change materially in the future.
we believe that the following critical accounting policies, among others, affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements and could materially increase or decrease our reported results, assets and liabilities.
goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets assets acquired and liabilities assumed in connection with our acquisitions are recorded at their estimated fair values. goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price of an acquired company over the fair value of its identifiable net assets, including identified intangible assets. we recognize specifically identifiable intangibles, such as customer relationships, trademarks, technology, trading products, data, exchange registrations, backlog, trade names and licenses when a specific right or contract is acquired. our determination of the fair value of the intangible assets and whether or not these assets may be impaired following their acquisition requires us to apply significant judgments and make significant estimates and assumptions regarding future cash flows. if we change our strategy or if market conditions shift, our judgments and estimates may change, which may result in adjustments to recorded asset balances. intangible assets with finite useful lives are amortized over their estimated useful lives whereas goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are not.
in performing the allocation of the acquisitions' purchase price to assets and liabilities, we consider, among other factors, the intended use of the acquired assets, analysis of past financial performance and estimates of future performance of the acquired business. at the acquisition date, a preliminary allocation of the purchase price is recorded based upon a preliminary valuation performed with the assistance of a third-party valuation specialist. we continue to review and assess our estimates, assumptions and valuation methodologies during the measurement period provided by gaap, which ends as soon as we receive the information about facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date or we learn that more information is not obtainable, which usually does not exceed one year from the date of acquisition. accordingly, these estimates and assumptions are subject to change, which could have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. estimation uncertainty may exist due to the sensitivity of the respective fair value to underlying assumptions about the future performance of an acquired business in our discounted cash flow models. significant assumptions typically include revenue growth rates and expense synergies that form the basis of the forecasted results and the discount rate.
our goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets are evaluated for impairment annually in our fiscal fourth quarter or more frequently if conditions exist that indicate that the value may be impaired. we test our goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level, and we have identified four reporting units, which were updated in 2020 to reflect our new segment presentation. our reporting units identified for our goodwill testing are the nyse, other exchanges, fixed income and data services, and mortgage technology reporting units. these impairment evaluations are performed by comparing the carrying value of the goodwill or other indefinite-lived intangibles to its estimated fair value.
in accordance with accounting standards update 2017-04, simplifying the test for goodwill impairment, or asu-2017, for both goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible impairment testing, we have the option to first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit or indefinite-lived intangible asset is less than its carrying amount. if the fair value of the goodwill or indefinite-lived intangible asset is less than its carrying value, an impairment loss is recognized in earnings in an amount equal to the difference. alternatively, we may choose to bypass the qualitative option and perform quantitative testing to determine if the fair value is less than the carrying value. for our goodwill impairment testing, we have elected to bypass the qualitative assessment and apply the quantitative approach. for our testing of indefinite-lived intangible assets, we apply qualitative and quantitative approaches.
application of the impairment test requires judgment, including the identification of reporting units, assignment of assets and liabilities to reporting units, assignment of goodwill to reporting units, and determination of the fair value of each reporting unit. we have historically determined the fair value of our reporting units based on various valuation techniques, including discounted cash flow analysis and a multiple of earnings approach. in assessing whether goodwill and other intangible assets are impaired, we must make estimates and assumptions regarding future cash flows, long-term growth rates of our business, operating margins, discount rates, weighted average cost of capital and other factors to determine the fair value of our assets. these estimates and assumptions require management's judgment, and changes to these estimates and assumptions, as a result of changing economic and competitive conditions, could materially affect the determination of fair value and/or impairment. during 2019, we recorded an impairment charge of $31 million on the remaining value of exchange registration intangible assets on ice futures singapore as a result of a decrease in fair value determined during our annual impairment testing. we did not record any impairments in 2021 or 2020 as a result of our goodwill or indefinite-lived impairment testing.
we are also required to evaluate other finite-lived intangible assets for impairment by first determining whether events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of these assets to be held and used may not be recoverable. if impairment indicators are present, then an estimate of undiscounted future cash flows produced by these long-lived assets is compared to the carrying value of those assets to determine if the asset is recoverable. if an asset is not recoverable, the loss is measured as the difference between fair value and carrying value of the impaired asset. fair value of these assets is based on various valuation techniques, including discounted cash flow analysis.
income taxes we are subject to income taxes in the u.s., u.k. and other foreign jurisdictions where we operate. the determination of our provision for income taxes and related accruals, deferred tax assets and liabilities requires the use of significant judgment, estimates, and the interpretation and application of complex tax laws. we recognize a current tax liability or tax asset for the estimated taxes payable or refundable on tax returns for the current year. we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax bases of our assets and liabilities. we establish valuation allowances if we believe that it is more likely than not that some or all of our deferred tax assets will not be realized. deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using current enacted tax rates in effect for the years in which those temporary differences and carryforwards are expected to reverse.
the fasb staff has provided additional guidance to address the accounting for the effects of the provisions related to the taxation of global intangible low-taxed income noting that companies should make an accounting policy election to recognize deferred taxes for temporary basis differences expected to reverse in future years or to include the tax expense in the year it is incurred. we have made a policy election to recognize such taxes as current period expenses when incurred.
we do not recognize a tax benefit unless we conclude that it is more likely than not that the benefit will be sustained on audit by the taxing authority based solely on the technical merits of the associated tax position. if the recognition threshold is met, we recognize a tax benefit measured at the largest amount of the tax benefit that, in our judgment, is greater than 50 percent likely to be realized. we recognize accrued interest and penalties related to uncertain income tax positions as income tax expense in the consolidated statements of income.
we operate within multiple domestic and foreign taxing jurisdictions and are subject to audit in these jurisdictions by domestic and foreign tax authorities. these audits include questions regarding our tax filing positions, including the timing and amount of deductions taken and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions. we record accruals for the estimated outcomes of these audits, and the accruals may change in the future due to new developments in each matter. at any point in time, many tax years are subject to or in the process of being audited by various taxing authorities. to the extent our estimates of settlements change or the final tax outcome of these matters is different from the amounts recorded, such differences will impact the income tax provision in the period in which such determinations are made. our income tax expense includes changes in our estimated liability for exposures associated with our various tax filing positions. determining the income tax expense for these potential assessments requires management to make assumptions that are subject to factors such as proposed assessments by tax authorities, changes in facts and circumstances, issuance of new regulations, and resolution of tax audits.
item 7 (a).     quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk as a result of our operating and financing activities, we are exposed to market risks such as interest rate risk, foreign currency exchange rate risk and credit risk. we have implemented policies and procedures designed to measure, manage, monitor and report risk exposures, which are regularly reviewed by the appropriate management and supervisory bodies.
interest rate risk we have exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relating to our cash and cash equivalents, short-term and long-term restricted cash and cash equivalents, short-term and long-term investments and indebtedness. as of december 31, 2021 and 2020, our cash and cash equivalents and short-term and long-term restricted cash and cash equivalents were $2.0 billion for both periods, of which $276 million and $245 million, respectively, were denominated in pounds sterling, euros or canadian dollars, and the remaining amounts are denominated in u.s. dollars. we do not use our investment portfolio for trading or other speculative purposes. a hypothetical 50% decrease in short-term interest rates would have an immaterial impact on our annual pre-tax earnings as of december 31, 2021, assuming no change in the amount or composition of our cash and cash equivalents and short-term and long-term restricted cash and cash equivalents.
as of december 31, 2021, we had $13.9 billion in outstanding debt, of which $12.9 billion relates to our fixed rate senior notes. the remaining amount outstanding of $1.0 billion relates to $1.0 billion outstanding under our commercial paper program, which bears interest at fluctuating rates, and $10 million under lines of credit at our india subsidiaries. a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in short-term interest rates relating to the amounts under our commercial paper program as of december 31, 2021 would decrease annual pre-tax earnings by $10 million, assuming no change in the volume or composition of our outstanding indebtedness and no hedging activity. see part ii, item 7, "management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations - debt," and note 10 to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report.
the interest rates on our commercial paper program are currently evaluated based upon current maturities and market conditions. the weighted average interest rate on our commercial paper program decreased from 0.40% as of december 31, 2020 to 0.33% as of december 31, 2021. the effective interest rate of commercial paper issuances will continue to fluctuate based on the movement in short-term interest rates along with shifts in supply and demand within the commercial paper market.
foreign currency exchange rate risk as an international business, we are subject to foreign currency exchange rate risk. we may experience gains or losses from foreign currency transactions in the future given that a significant part of our assets and liabilities are recorded in pounds sterling, canadian dollars or euros, and a significant portion of our revenues and expenses are recorded in pounds sterling or euros. certain assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses of foreign subsidiaries are denominated in the local functional currency of such subsidiaries. our exposure to foreign denominated earnings in 2021 and 2020 is presented by primary foreign currency in the following table (dollars in millions, except exchange rates):

we have a significant part of our assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses recorded in pounds sterling or euros. in both 2021 and 2020, 13% of our consolidated revenues, less transaction-based expenses, were denominated in pounds sterling or euros, and in 2021 and 2020, 10% and 11%, respectively, of our consolidated operating expenses were denominated in pounds sterling or euros. as the pound sterling or euro exchange rate changes, the u.s. equivalent of revenues and expenses denominated in foreign currencies changes accordingly.
foreign currency transaction risk related to the settlement of foreign currency denominated assets, liabilities and payables occurs through our operations, which are received in or paid in pounds sterling, canadian dollars, or euros, due to the increase or decrease in the foreign currency exchange rates between periods. we incurred foreign currency transaction losses of $13 million and $5 million in 2021 and 2020, respectively inclusive of the impact of foreign currency hedging transactions. the foreign currency transaction losses were primarily attributable to the fluctuations of the pound sterling and euro relative to the u.s. dollar. a 10% adverse change in the underlying foreign currency exchange rates as of december 31, 2021, assuming no change in the composition of the foreign currency denominated assets, liabilities and payables and assuming no hedging activity, would result in a foreign currency loss of $15 million.
we entered into foreign currency hedging transactions during 2021 and 2020 as economic hedges to help mitigate a portion of our foreign exchange risk exposure and may enter into additional hedging transactions in the future to help mitigate our foreign exchange risk exposure. although we may enter into additional hedging transactions in the future, these hedging arrangements may not be effective, particularly in the event of imprecise forecasts of the levels of our non-u.s. denominated assets and liabilities.
we have foreign currency translation risk equal to our net investment in our foreign subsidiaries. the financial statements of these subsidiaries are translated into u.s. dollars using a current rate of exchange, with gains or losses included in the cumulative translation adjustment account, a component of equity. our exposure to the net investment in foreign currencies is presented by primary foreign currencies in the table below (in millions):

foreign currency translation adjustments are included as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income/(loss) within our balance sheet. see the table below for the portion of equity attributable to foreign currency translation adjustments as well as the activity by year included within our statement of other comprehensive income. the impact of the foreign currency exchange rate differences in the table below were primarily driven by fluctuations of the pound sterling as compared to the u.s. dollar which were 1.3524, 1.3665 and 1.3260 as of december 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively.

the future impact on our business relating to the u.k. leaving the eu and the corresponding regulatory changes are uncertain at this time, including future impacts on currency exchange rates.
credit risk we are exposed to credit risk in our operations in the event of a counterparty default. we limit our exposure to credit risk by rigorously selecting the counterparties with which we make our investments, monitoring them on an ongoing basis and executing agreements to protect our interests.
clearing house cash deposit risks the ice clearing houses hold material amounts of clearing member margin deposits which are held or invested primarily to provide security of capital while minimizing credit, market and liquidity risks. refer to note 14 to our consolidated financial statements for more information on the ice clearing houses' cash and cash equivalent margin deposits and guaranty funds, invested deposits, delivery contracts receivable and unsettled variation margin which were $150.4 billion as of december 31, 2021. while we seek to achieve a reasonable rate of return which may generate interest income for our clearing members, we are primarily concerned with preservation of capital and managing the risks associated with these deposits. as the ice clearing houses may pass on interest revenues (minus costs) to the clearing members, this could include negative or reduced yield due to market conditions. the following is a summary of the risks associated with these deposits and how these risks are mitigated:
•credit risk: when a clearing house has the ability to hold cash collateral at a central bank, the clearing house utilizes its access to the central bank system to minimize credit risk exposures. credit risk is managed by using exposure limits depending on the credit profile of the counterparty as well as the nature and maturity of transactions. our investment objective is to invest in securities that preserve principal while maximizing yields, without significantly increasing risk. we seek to substantially mitigate the credit risk associated with investments by placing them with governments, well-capitalized financial institutions and other creditworthy counterparties.
an ongoing review is performed to evaluate changes in the financial status of counterparties. in addition to the intrinsic creditworthiness of counterparties, our policies require diversification of counterparties (banks, financial institutions, bond issuers and funds) so as to avoid a concentration of risk.
•liquidity risk: liquidity risk is the risk a clearing house may not be able to meet its payment obligations in the right currency, in the right place and at the right time. to mitigate this risk, the clearing houses monitor liquidity requirements closely and maintain funds and assets in a manner which minimizes the risk of loss or delay in the access by the clearing house to such funds and assets. for example, holding funds with a central bank where possible or making only short term investments such as overnight reverse repurchase agreements serves to reduce liquidity risks.
•interest rate risk: interest rate risk is the risk that interest rates rise and cause the value of securities we hold or invest in to decline. if we were required to sell securities prior to maturity, and interest rates had risen, the sale might be made at a loss relative to the carrying value. our clearing houses seek to manage this risk by making short term investments. for example, where possible and in accordance with regulatory requirements, the clearing houses invest cash pursuant to overnight reverse repurchase agreements or term reverse repurchase agreements with short dated maturities. in addition, the clearing house investment guidelines allow for direct purchases of high quality sovereign debt (for example, u.s. treasury securities) and supranational debt instruments (euro cash deposits only) with short dated maturities.
•security issuer risk: security issuer risk is the risk that an issuer of a security defaults on the payment when the security matures or debt is serviced. this risk is mitigated by limiting allowable investments under the reverse repurchase agreements to high quality sovereign or government agency debt and limiting any direct investments to high quality sovereign debt instruments.
•investment counterparty risk: investment counterparty risk is the risk that a reverse repurchase agreement counterparty might become insolvent and, thus, fail to meet its obligations to our clearing houses. we mitigate this risk by only engaging in transactions with high credit quality counterparties and by limiting the acceptable collateral to securities of high quality issuers. when engaging in reverse repurchase agreements, our clearing houses take delivery of the securities underlying the reverse repurchase arrangement in custody accounts under clearing house control. additionally, the securities purchased subject to reverse repurchase have a market value greater than the reverse repurchase amount. the typical haircut for high quality sovereign debt is 2% of the reverse repurchase amount which provides additional excess collateral. thus, in the event that a reverse repurchase counterparty defaults on its obligation to repurchase the underlying reverse repurchase securities, our clearing house will have possession of a security with a value potentially greater than the counterparty's obligation.
the ice clearing houses may use third-party investment advisors who make investments subject to the guidelines provided by each clearing house. such advisors do not hold clearing member cash or cash equivalent deposits or the underlying investments. clearing house property is held in custody accounts under clearing house control with credit worthy custodians. the ice clearing houses employ (or may employ) multiple investment advisors and custodians to ensure that in the event a single advisor or custodian is unable to fulfill its role, additional advisors or custodians are available as alternatives.
•cross-currency margin deposit risk: each of the ice clearing houses may permit posting of cross-currency collateral to satisfy margin requirements (for example, accepting margin deposits denominated in u.s. dollars to secure a euro margin obligation). the ice clearing houses mitigate the risk of a currency value exposure by applying a "haircut" to the currency posted as margin at a level viewed as sufficient to provide financial protection during periods of currency volatility. cross-currency balances are marked-to-market on a daily basis. should the currency posted to satisfy margin requirements decline in value, the clearing member is required to increase its margin deposit on a same-day basis.
impact of inflation we have not been adversely affected by inflation as technological advances and competition have generally caused prices for the hardware and software that we use for our electronic platforms to remain constant. in the event of inflation, we believe that we will be able to pass on any price increases to our participants, as the prices that we charge are not governed by long-term contracts.

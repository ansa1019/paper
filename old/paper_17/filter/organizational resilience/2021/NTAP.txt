item 1a.  risk factors the information included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10-k should be considered and understood in the context of the following risk factors, which describe circumstances that may materially harm our future business, operating results or financial condition. the following discussion reflects our current judgment regarding the most significant risks we face. these risks can and will change in the future.
risks related to our business and industry if we are unable to develop, introduce and gain market acceptance for new products and services while managing the transition from older ones, or if we cannot provide the expected level of quality and support for our new products and services, our business, operating results, financial condition and cash flows could be harmed.
our future growth depends upon the successful development and introduction of new hardware and software products and services. due to the complexity of storage software, subsystems and appliances and the difficulty in gauging the engineering effort required to produce new products and services, such products and services are subject to significant technical and quality control risks.
if we are unable, for technological, customer reluctance or other reasons, to develop, introduce and gain market acceptance for new products and services, as and when required by the market and our customers, our business, operating results, financial condition and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected.
new or additional product introductions, including new software and cloud offerings, such as astra by netapp, spot by netapp and new hardware and all-flash storage products, subject us to additional financial and operational risks, including our ability to forecast customer preferences and/or demand, our ability to successfully manage the transition from older products and solutions, our ability to forecast the impact of customers' demand for new products, services and solutions or the products being replaced, and our ability to manage production capacity to meet the demand for new products and services. in addition, as new or enhanced products and services are introduced, we must avoid excessive levels of older product inventories and related components and ensure that new products and services can be delivered to meet customers' demands. further risks inherent in the introduction of new products, services and solutions include the uncertainty of price-performance relative to products of competitors, competitors' responses to the introductions, delays in sales caused by the desire of customers to evaluate new products for extended periods of time and our partners' investment in selling our new products and solutions. if these risks are not managed effectively, we could experience material risks to our business, operating results, financial condition and cash flows.
as we enter new or emerging markets, we will likely increase demands on our service and support operations and may be exposed to additional competition. we may not be able to provide products, services and support to effectively compete for these market opportunities.
our business may be harmed by technological trends in our market or if we are unable to keep pace with rapid industry, technological and market changes.
our industry and the markets in which we compete have historically experienced significant growth due to the increase in the demand for storage and data management solutions by consumers, enterprises and governments around the world, and the purchases of storage and data management solutions to address this demand. however, despite continued data growth, our traditional market, the networked storage hardware market, experienced a decline in each of the last three calendar years due to a combination of customers delaying purchases in the face of technology transitions, increasing adoption of cloud environments built on commodity hardware, increased storage efficiency, and changing economic and business environments. while customers are navigating through their information technology (it) transformations, which leverage modern architectures and hybrid cloud environments, they are also reducing it budgets, looking for simpler solutions, and changing how they consume it. this evolution is diverting spending towards transformational projects and architectures like flash, hybrid cloud, it as a service, converged infrastructure, and software defined storage. we are unable to predict whether the impact of the covid-19 pandemic will accelerate the decline of our traditional market and increase demand for our cloud offerings. our business may be adversely impacted if we are unable to keep pace with rapid industry, technological or market changes or if our data fabric strategy is not accepted in the marketplace. as a result of these and other factors discussed in this report, our revenue may decline on a year-over-year basis, as it did in fiscal years 2017 and 2020. the future impact of these trends on both short- and long-term growth patterns is uncertain. if the general historical rate of industry growth declines, if the growth rates of the specific markets in which we compete decline, and/or if the consumption model of storage changes and our new and existing products, services and solutions do not receive customer acceptance, our business, operating results, financial condition and cash flows could suffer.
our sales and distribution structure makes forecasting revenues difficult and, if disrupted, could harm our business, operating results, financial condition and cash flows.
our business and sales models make revenues difficult to forecast. we sell to a variety of customers directly and through various channels, with a corresponding variety of sales cycles. the majority of our sales are made and/or fulfilled indirectly through channel partners, including value-added resellers, systems integrators, distributors, original equipment manufacturers (oems) and strategic business partners, which now include public cloud providers. this structure significantly complicates our ability to forecast future revenue, especially within any particular fiscal quarter or year. moreover, our relationships with our indirect channel partners and strategic business partners are critical to our success. the loss of one or more of our key indirect channel partners in a given geographic area or the failure of our channel or strategic partners to promote our products could harm our operating results. qualifying and developing new indirect channel partners typically requires a significant investment of time and resources before acceptable levels of productivity are met. if we fail to maintain our relationships with our indirect channel partners and strategic partners, if their financial condition, business or customer relationships were to weaken, if they fail to comply with legal or regulatory requirements, or if we were to cease to do business with them for these or other reasons, our business, operating results, financial condition and cash flows could be harmed.
increasing competition and industry consolidation could harm our business, operating results, financial condition and cash flows.
the storage and data management markets are intensely competitive and are characterized by rapidly changing technology and fragmentation. we compete with many companies in the markets we serve, including established public companies, newer public companies with a strong flash focus, and new market entrants addressing the growing opportunity for application data management for kubernetes. some offer a broad spectrum of it products and services (full-stack vendors) and others offer a more limited set of storage and data management products or services. technology trends, such as the emergence of hosted or public cloud storage, saas and flash storage are driving significant changes in storage architectures and solution requirements. cloud service provider competitors provide customers storage for their data centers on demand, without requiring a capital expenditure, which meets rapidly evolving business needs and has changed the competitive landscape. the impacts of the covid-19 pandemic, including the increase in the number of employees working remotely, has accelerated customer adoption of competitors' cloud solutions and contributed to increased competition in the market.
competitors may develop new technologies or products in advance of us or establish new business models, more flexible contracting models or new technologies disruptive to us. by extending our flash, cloud storage and converged infrastructure offerings, we are competing in new segments with both traditional competitors and new competitors, particularly smaller emerging storage vendors. the longer-term potential and competitiveness of these emerging vendors remains to be determined. in cloud and converged infrastructure, we also compete with large well-established competitors.
it is possible that new competitors or alliances among competitors might emerge and rapidly acquire significant market share or buying power. an increase in industry consolidation might result in stronger competitors that are better able to compete as full-stack vendors for customers and achieve increased economies of scale in the supply chain. in addition, current and potential competitors have established or might establish cooperative relationships among themselves or with third parties, including some of our partners or suppliers. for additional information regarding our competitors, see the section entitled "competition" contained in item 1 - business of part i of this form 10-k.
continuing uncertain economic and political conditions restrict our visibility and may harm our business, operating results, including our revenue growth and profitability, financial condition and cash flows.
continuing global economic uncertainty, political conditions and fiscal challenges in the u.s. and abroad have, among other things, limited our ability to forecast future demand for our products, contributed to increased periodic volatility in the computer, storage and networking industries at large, as well as the it market, impacted availability of supplies and could constrain future access to capital for our suppliers, customers and partners. the impacts of these circumstances are global and pervasive, and the timing and nature of any ultimate resolution of these matters remain highly uncertain. adverse macroeconomic conditions, including inflation, slower growth or recession, new or increased tariffs or other barriers to global trade, changes to fiscal and monetary policy and higher interest rates, could materially adversely impact the demand for our products and our operating results. we are also unable to predict whether increased customer spending on our cloud offerings and virtual desktop infrastructure will continue after the covid-19 pandemic. consequently, we expect these concerns to challenge our business for the foreseeable future, which could cause harm to our operating results. such conditions have resulted, and may in the future again result, in failure to meet our forecasted financial expectations and to achieve historical levels of revenue growth.
transition to consumption-based business models may adversely affect our revenues and profitability in other areas of our business and as a result may harm our business, operating results, financial condition and cash flows.
we offer customers a full range of consumption models, including the deployment of our software through our subscription and cloud-based software as a service (saas), and utility pricing and managed services offerings for our hardware and software systems.
these business models continue to evolve, and we may not be able to compete effectively, generate significant revenues or maintain the profitability of our consumption-based offerings. additionally, the increasing prevalence of cloud and saas delivery models offered by us and our competitors may unfavorably impact the pricing of our on-premise hardware and software offerings and could have a dampening impact on overall demand for our on-premise hardware and software product and service offerings, which could reduce our revenues and profitability, at least in the near term. if we do not successfully execute our consumption model strategy or anticipate the needs of our customers, our revenues and profitability could decline.
as customer demand for our consumption model offerings increases, we will experience differences in the timing of revenue recognition between our traditional hardware and software license arrangements (for which revenue is generally recognized in full at the time of delivery), relative to our consumption model offerings (for which revenue is generally recognized ratably over the term of the arrangement). we incur certain expenses associated with the infrastructure and marketing of our consumption model offerings in advance of our ability to recognize the revenues associated with these offerings.
due to the global nature of our business, risks inherent in our international operations could materially harm our business.
a significant portion of our operations are located, and a significant portion of our revenues are derived, outside of the u.s. in addition, most of our products are manufactured outside of the u.s., and we have research and development, sales and service centers overseas. accordingly, our business and future operating results could be adversely impacted by factors affecting our international operations including, among other things, local political or economic conditions, trade protection and export and import requirements, tariffs, local labor conditions, transportation costs, government spending patterns, acts of terrorism, international conflicts and natural disasters in areas with limited infrastructure and adverse public health developments. in particular, the ongoing covid-19 pandemic and current trade tensions between the u.s. and china could impact our business and operating results. for products we manufacture in mexico, tensions between the u.s. and mexico related to trade and border security issues could delay our shipments to customers, or impact pricing or our business and operating results. in addition, due to the global nature of our business, we are subject to complex legal and regulatory requirements in the u.s. and the foreign jurisdictions in which we operate and sell our products, including antitrust and anti-competition laws, rules and regulations, and regulations related to data privacy, data protection, and cybersecurity. we are also subject to the potential loss of proprietary information due to piracy, misappropriation, or laws that may be less protective of our intellectual property rights than u.s. laws. such factors could have an adverse impact on our business, operating results, financial condition and cash flows.
we face exposure to adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates as a result of our international operations. these exposures may change over time as business practices evolve, and they could have a material adverse impact on our operating results, financial condition and cash flows. we utilize forward and option contracts in an attempt to reduce the adverse earnings impact from the effect of exchange rate fluctuations on certain assets and liabilities. our hedging strategies may not be successful, and currency exchange rate fluctuations could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and cash flows. in addition, our foreign currency exposure on assets, liabilities and cash flows that we do not hedge could have a material impact on our financial results in periods when the u.s. dollar significantly fluctuates in relation to foreign currencies.
moreover, in many foreign countries, particularly in those with developing economies, it is common to engage in business practices that are prohibited by our internal policies and procedures, or u.s. laws and regulations applicable to us, such as the foreign corrupt practices act. there can be no assurance that all our employees, contractors and agents, as well as those companies to which we outsource certain of our business operations, will comply with these policies, procedures, laws and/or regulations. any such violation could subject us to fines and other penalties, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, financial condition and cash flows.
if we are unable to attract and retain qualified personnel, our business, operating results, financial condition and cash flows could be harmed.
our continued success depends, in part, on our ability to hire and retain qualified personnel and to advance our corporate strategy and preserve the key aspects of our corporate culture. because our future success is dependent on our ability to continue to enhance and introduce new products, we are particularly dependent on our ability to hire and retain qualified engineers, including in emerging areas of technology such as artificial intelligence and machine learning. in addition, to increase revenues, we will be required to increase the productivity of our sales force and support infrastructure to achieve adequate customer coverage. competition for qualified employees, particularly in silicon valley, is intense. we have periodically reduced our workforce, including reductions announced in fiscal years 2019, 2020 and 2021, and these actions may make it more difficult to attract and retain qualified employees. our inability to hire and retain qualified management and skilled personnel, particularly engineers, salespeople and key executive management, could disrupt our development efforts, sales results, business relationships and/or our ability to execute our business plan and strategy on a timely basis and could materially and adversely affect our operating results, financial condition and cash flows.
equity grants are a critical component of our current compensation programs. if we reduce, modify or eliminate our equity programs or fail to grant equity competitively, we may have difficulty attracting and retaining critical employees.
in addition, because of the structure of our sales, cash and equity incentive compensation plans, we may be at increased risk of losing employees at certain times. for example, the retention value of our compensation plans decreases after the payment of periodic bonuses or the vesting of equity awards.
our acquisitions may not achieve expected benefits, and may increase our liabilities, disrupt our existing business and harm our operating results, financial condition and cash flows.
as part of our strategy, we seek to acquire other businesses and technologies to complement our current products, expand the breadth of our markets, or enhance our technical capabilities. for example, in both fiscal 2021 and fiscal 2020 we acquired two privately held companies. the benefits we have received, and expect to receive, from these and other acquisitions depend on our ability to successfully conduct due diligence, negotiate the terms of the acquisition and integrate the acquired business into our systems, procedures and organizational structure. any inaccuracy in our acquisition assumptions or any failure to uncover liabilities or risks associated with the acquisition, such as differing or inadequate cybersecurity and data privacy protection controls, make the acquisition on favorable terms, integrate the acquired business or assets as and when expected or retain key employees of the acquired company may reduce or eliminate the expected benefits of the acquisition to us, increase our costs, disrupt our operations, result in additional liabilities, investigations and litigation, and may also harm our strategy, our business and our operating results. the failure to achieve expected acquisition benefits may also result in impairment charges for goodwill and purchased intangible assets.
we often incur expenses before we receive related benefits, and expenses may be difficult to reduce quickly if demand declines.
we base our expense levels in part on future revenue expectations and a significant percentage of our expenses are fixed. it is difficult to reduce our fixed costs quickly, and if revenue levels are below our expectations, operating results could be adversely impacted. during periods of uneven growth or decline, we may incur costs before we realize the anticipated related benefits, which could also harm our operating results. we have made, and will continue to make, significant investments in engineering, sales, service and support, marketing and other functions to support and grow our business. we are likely to recognize the costs associated with these investments earlier than some of the related anticipated benefits, such as revenue growth, and the return on these investments may be lower, or may develop more slowly, than we expect, which could harm our business, operating results, financial condition and cash flows.
initiatives intended to make our cost structure, business processes and systems more efficient may not achieve the expected benefits and could inadvertently have an adverse effect on our business, operating results, financial condition and cash flows.
we continuously seek to make our cost structure and business processes more efficient, including by moving our business activities from higher-cost to lower-cost locations, outsourcing certain business processes and functions, and implementing changes to our business information systems. these efforts involve a significant investment of financial and human resources and significant changes to our current operating processes. in addition, as we move operations into lower-cost jurisdictions and outsource certain business processes, we become subject to new regulatory regimes and lose control of certain aspects of our operations and, as a consequence, become more dependent upon the systems and business processes of third-parties. if we are unable to move our operations, outsource business processes and implement new business information systems in a manner that complies with local law and maintains adequate standards, controls and procedures, the quality of our products and services may suffer and we may be subject to increased litigation risk, either of which could have an adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition. additionally, we may not achieve the expected benefits of these and other transformational initiatives, which could harm our business, operating results, financial condition and cash flows.
we are exposed to credit risks and our investment portfolio may experience fluctuations in market value or returns.
we maintain an investment portfolio of various holdings, types, and maturities. credit ratings and pricing of our investments can be negatively affected by liquidity, credit deterioration, financial results, economic risk, political risk, sovereign risk or other factors. as a result, the value and liquidity of our investments and the returns thereon may fluctuate substantially. a resurgence of covid-19 or other circumstances could result in an economic slowdown and possibly cause a global recession. an economic slowdown or increased regional or global economic uncertainty may lead to failures of counterparties, including financial institutions, governments and insurers, which could result in a material decline in the value of our investment portfolio and substantially reduce our investment returns.
risks related to our customers and sales if we are unable to maintain and develop relationships with strategic partners, our revenues may be harmed.
our growth strategy includes developing and maintaining strategic partnerships with major third-party software and hardware vendors to integrate our products into their products and also co-market our products with them. a number of our strategic partners are industry leaders that offer us expanded access to segments of the storage and data management markets. in particular, strategic partnerships with public cloud providers and other cloud service vendors are critical to the success of our cloud-based business. however, there is intense competition for attractive strategic partners, and these relationships may not be exclusive, may not generate
significant revenues and may be terminated on short notice. for instance, some of our partners are also partnering with our competitors, which may increase the availability of competing solutions and harm our ability to grow our relationships with those partners. moreover, some of our partners, particularly large, more diversified technology companies, including major cloud providers, are also competitors, thereby complicating our relationships. if we are unable to establish new partnerships or maintain existing partnerships, if our strategic partners favor their relationships with other vendors in the storage industry or if our strategic partners increasingly compete with us, we could experience lower than expected revenues, suffer delays in product development, or experience other harm to our business, operating results, financial condition and cash flows.
a portion of our revenues is generated by large, recurring purchases from various customers, resellers and distributors. a loss, cancellation or delay in purchases by any of these parties has negatively affected our revenues in the past, and could negatively affect our revenues in the future.
a significant portion of our net revenues is generated through sales to a limited number of customers and distributors. we generally do not enter into binding purchase commitments with our customers, resellers and distributors for extended periods of time, and thus there is no guarantee we will continue to receive large, recurring orders from these customers, resellers or distributors. for example, our reseller agreements generally do not require minimum purchases, and our customers, resellers and distributors can stop purchasing and marketing our products at any time. in addition, unfavorable economic conditions may negatively impact the solvency of our customers, resellers and distributors or the ability of such customers, resellers and distributors to obtain credit to finance purchases of our products. if any of our key customers, resellers or distributors changes its pricing practices, reduces the size or frequency of its orders for our products, or stops purchasing our products altogether, our operating results, financial condition and cash flows could be materially adversely impacted.
our success depends upon our ability to effectively plan and manage our resources and restructure our business in response to changing market conditions and market demand for our products, and such actions may have an adverse effect on our business, operating results, financial condition and cash flows.
our ability to successfully offer our products and services in a rapidly evolving market requires an effective planning, forecasting, and management process to enable us to effectively scale and adjust our business in response to fluctuating market opportunities and conditions.
we recently reorganized our sales resources, which included changes and additions to our sales leadership team, to gain operational efficiencies and improve the alignment of our resources with customer and market opportunities. we expect to continue developing our sales organization and go-to-market model towards these goals throughout fiscal 2022. the reorganization of our sales resources, and ongoing evolution of our go-to-market model, could result in short or long-term disruption of our sales cycles, may not produce the efficiencies and benefits desired, and could harm our operating results, financial condition and cash flows.
in response to changes in market conditions and market demand for our products, we have in the past undertaken cost savings initiatives. for example, in may 2018, april 2019, may 2019, may 2020 and august 2020 we executed restructuring events designed to streamline our business, reduce our cost structure and focus our resources on key strategic opportunities. as a result, we have recognized substantial restructuring charges. in fiscal 2020, we further reorganized our go-to-market organization to streamline operations and improve alignment with customer and market opportunities. in the first quarter of fiscal 2021, we realigned resources to optimize our business and fund our biggest opportunities. we may in the future undertake initiatives that could include reorganizing our workforce, restructuring, disposing of, and/or otherwise discontinuing certain products, or a combination of these actions. rapid changes in the size, alignment or organization of our workforce, including our business unit structure and sales account coverage, could adversely affect our ability to develop, sell and deliver products and services as planned or impair our ability to realize our current or future business and financial objectives. any decision to take these actions may result in charges to earnings associated with, among other things, inventory or other fixed, intangible or goodwill asset reductions (including, without limitation, impairment charges), workforce and facility reductions and penalties and claims from third-party resellers or users of discontinued products. charges associated with these activities could harm our operating results. in addition to the costs associated with these activities, we may not realize any of the anticipated benefits of the underlying restructuring activities.
reduced u.s. government demand could materially harm our business, operating results, financial condition and cash flows. in addition, we could be harmed by claims that we have or a channel partner has failed to comply with regulatory and contractual requirements applicable to sales to the u.s. government.
the u.s. government is an important customer for us. however, government demand is uncertain, as it is subject to political and budgetary fluctuations and constraints. events such as the u.s. federal government shutdown from december 2018 to january 2019 and continued uncertainty regarding the u.s. budget and debt levels have increased demand uncertainty for our products. in addition, like other customers, the u.s. government may evaluate competing products and delay purchasing in the face of the technology transitions taking place in the storage industry. if the u.s. government or an individual agency or multiple agencies within the u.s. government continue to reduce or shift their it spending patterns, our operating results, including revenues may be harmed.
selling our products to the u.s. government, whether directly or through channel partners, also subjects us to certain regulatory and contractual requirements. failure to comply with these requirements by either us or our channel partners could subject us to investigations, fines, and other penalties, which could materially harm our operating results and financial condition. as an example, the united states department of justice (doj) and the general services administration (gsa) have in the past pursued claims against and financial settlements with it vendors, including us and several of our competitors and channel partners, under the false claims act and other statutes related to pricing and discount practices and compliance with certain provisions of gsa contracts for sales to the federal government. although the doj and gsa currently have no claims pending against us, we could face claims in the future. violations of certain regulatory and contractual requirements, including with respect to data security, could also result in us being suspended or debarred from future government contracting. any of these outcomes could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, financial condition and cash flows.
if we do not achieve forecasted sales orders in any quarter, our operating results, financial condition and cash flows could be harmed.
we derive a majority of our revenues in any given quarter from orders booked in the same quarter. orders typically follow intra-quarter seasonality patterns weighted toward the back end of the quarter. if we do not achieve the level, timing and mix of orders consistent with our quarterly targets and historical patterns, or if we experience cancellations of significant orders, our operating results, financial condition and cash flows could be harmed.
our gross margins reflect a variety of factors, including competitive pricing, component and product design, and the volume and relative mix of revenues from product, software support, hardware support and other services offerings. increased component costs, increased pricing and discounting pressures, the relative and varying rates of increases or decreases in component costs and product prices, or changes in the mix of revenue or decreased volume from product, software support, hardware support and other services offerings could harm our revenues, gross margins or earnings. our gross margins are also impacted by the cost of any materials that are of poor quality and our sales and distribution activities, including, without limitation, pricing actions, rebates, sales initiatives and discount levels, and the timing of service contract renewals.
the costs of third-party components comprise a significant portion of our product costs. while we generally have been able to manage our component and product design costs, we may have difficulty managing these costs if supplies of certain components become limited or component prices increase. any such limitation could result in an increase in our product costs. an increase in component or design costs relative to our product prices could harm our gross margins and earnings.
we are exposed to the credit and non-payment risk of our customers, resellers and distributors, especially during times of economic uncertainty and tight credit markets, which could result in material losses.
most of our sales to customers are on an open credit basis, with typical payment terms of 30 days. we may experience increased losses as potentially more customers are unable to pay all or a portion of their obligations to us, particularly in the current environment when access to sources of liquidity may be limited as a result of the global covid-19 pandemic. beyond our open credit arrangements, some of our customers have entered into recourse and non-recourse financing leasing arrangements using third-party leasing companies. under the terms of recourse leases, which are generally three years or less, we remain liable for the aggregate unpaid remaining lease payments to the third-party leasing companies in the event of end-user customer default. during periods of economic uncertainty, our exposure to credit risks from our customers increases. in addition, our exposure to credit risks of our customers may increase further if our customers and their customers or their lease financing sources are adversely affected by global economic conditions.
risks related to our products and services any disruption to our supply chain could materially harm our business, operating results, financial condition and cash flows.
we do not manufacture our products or their components. instead, we rely on third parties to manufacture our products and critical components, such as disk drives, as well as for associated logistics. our lack of direct responsibility for, and control over, these elements of our business, as well as the diverse international geographic locations of our manufacturing partners and suppliers, creates significant risks for us, including, among other things:
•impacts on our supply chain from adverse public health developments, including outbreaks of contagious diseases such as the ongoing covid-19 pandemic;
•limited number of suppliers for certain components;
•no guarantees of supply and limited ability to control the quality, quantity and cost of our products or of their components;
•the potential for binding price or purchase commitments with our suppliers at higher than market rates;
•limited ability to adjust production volumes in response to our customers' demand fluctuations;
•business, legal compliance, litigation and financial concerns affecting our suppliers or their ability to manufacture and ship our products in the quantities, quality and manner we require; and
•disruptions due to floods, earthquakes, storms and other natural disasters, particularly in countries with limited infrastructure and disaster recovery resources.
such risks have subjected us, and could in the future subject us, to supply constraints, price increases and minimum purchase requirements and our business, operating results, financial condition and cash flows could be harmed. for example, the current global shortage of semiconductors could reduce our flexibility to react to product mix changes and un-forecasted orders. the risks associated with our outsourced manufacturing model are particularly acute when we transition products to new facilities or manufacturers, introduce and increase volumes of new products or qualify new contract manufacturers or suppliers, at which times our ability to manage the relationships among us, our manufacturing partners and our component suppliers, becomes critical. new manufacturers, products, components or facilities create increased costs and risk that we will fail to deliver high quality products in the required volumes to our customers. any failure of a manufacturer or component supplier to meet our quality, quantity or delivery requirements in a cost-effective manner will harm our business, including customer relationships and as a result could harm our operating results, financial condition and cash flows.
we rely on a limited number of suppliers for critical product components.
we rely on a limited number of suppliers for drives and other components utilized in the assembly of our products, including certain single source suppliers, which has subjected us, and could in the future subject us, to price rigidity, periodic supply constraints, and the inability to produce our products with the quality and in the quantities demanded. consolidation among suppliers, particularly within the semiconductor and disk drive industries, has contributed to price rigidity and supply constraints. when industry supply is constrained, our suppliers may allocate volumes away from us and to our competitors, all of which rely on many of the same suppliers as we do. accordingly, our business, operating results, financial condition and cash flows may be harmed.
if a cybersecurity or other security breach occurs on our systems, within our supply chain, or on our end-user customer systems, or if stored data is improperly accessed, customers may reduce or cease using our solutions, our reputation may be harmed and we may incur significant liabilities.
we store and transmit, and sell products and services that store and transmit, personal, sensitive and proprietary data related to our products, our employees, customers, clients and partners (including third-party vendors such as data centers and providers of saas, cloud computing, and internet infrastructure and bandwidth), and their respective customers, including intellectual property, books of record and personal information. it is critical to our business strategy that our infrastructure, products and services remain secure and are perceived by customers, clients and partners to be secure. there are numerous and evolving risks to cybersecurity and privacy, including criminal hackers, state-sponsored intrusions, industrial espionage, human error and technological vulnerabilities. cybersecurity incidents or other security breaches could result in (1) unauthorized access to, or loss or unauthorized use, alteration, or disclosure of, such information; (2) litigation, indemnity obligations, government investigations and proceedings, and other possible liabilities; (3) negative publicity; and (4) disruptions to our internal and external operations. any of these could damage our reputation and public perception of the security and reliability of our products, as well as harm our business and cause us to incur significant liabilities. in addition, a cybersecurity incident or loss of personal information, or other security breach could result in other negative consequences, including remediation costs, disruption of internal operations, increased cybersecurity protection costs and lost revenues.
our clients and customers use our platforms for the transmission and storage of sensitive data. we do not review the information or content that our clients and their customers upload and store, and, therefore, we have no direct control over the substance of the information or content stored within our platforms. if our employees, or our clients, partners or their respective customers use our platforms for the transmission or storage of personal or other sensitive information or our supply chain cybersecurity is compromised and our security measures are breached as a result of third-party action, employee error, malfeasance, stolen or fraudulently obtained log-in credentials or otherwise, our reputation could be damaged, our business may be harmed and we could incur significant liabilities.
high-profile cyberattacks and security breaches have increased in recent years, with the potential for such acts heightened as a result of the number of employees working remotely due to covid-19. security industry experts and government officials have warned about the risks of hackers and cyberattacks targeting it products and businesses. because techniques used to obtain unauthorized access or to sabotage systems change frequently and often are not recognized until launched against a target, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures. as we continue to increase our client base and expand our brand, we may become more of a target for third parties seeking to compromise our security systems and we anticipate that hacking attempts and cyberattacks will increase in the future. we cannot give assurance that we will always be successful in preventing or repelling unauthorized access to our systems. we also may face delays in our ability to identify or otherwise respond to any cybersecurity incident or any other breach. additionally, we use third-party service providers to provide some services to us that involve the storage or transmission of data, such as saas, cloud computing, and internet infrastructure and bandwidth, and they face various cybersecurity threats and also may suffer cybersecurity incidents or other security breaches.
many jurisdictions have enacted or are enacting laws requiring companies to notify regulators or individuals of data security incidents involving certain types of personal data. these mandatory disclosures regarding security incidents often lead to widespread negative publicity. moreover, the risk of reputational harm may be magnified and/or distorted through the rapid dissemination of information over the internet, including through news articles, blogs, social media, and other online communication forums and services. any security incident, loss of data, or other security breach, whether actual or perceived, or whether impacting us or our third-party service providers, could harm our reputation, erode customer confidence in the effectiveness of our data security measures, negatively impact our ability to attract new customers, cause existing customers to elect not to renew their support contracts or their saas subscriptions, or subject us to third-party lawsuits, regulatory fines or other action or liability, which could materially and adversely affect our business and operating results.
there can be no assurance that the limitations of liability in our contracts would be enforceable or adequate or would otherwise protect us from any such liabilities or damages with respect to any particular claim. our existing general liability insurance coverage and coverage for errors and omissions may not continue to be available on acceptable terms or may not be available in sufficient amounts to cover one or more large claims, or our insurers may deny coverage as to any future claim. the successful assertion of one or more large claims against us that exceeds available insurance coverage, or the occurrence of changes in our insurance policies, including premium increases or the imposition of large deductible or co-insurance requirements, could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, financial condition and cash flows.
if a data center or other third-party who relies on our products experiences a disruption in service or a loss of data, such disruption could be attributed to the quality of our products, thereby causing financial or reputational harm to our business.
our clients, including data centers, saas, cloud computing and internet infrastructure and bandwidth providers, rely on our products for their data storage needs. our clients may authorize third-party technology providers to access their data on our systems. because we do not control the transmissions between our clients, their customers, and third-party technology providers, or the processing of such data by third-party technology providers, we cannot ensure the complete integrity or security of such transmissions or processing. errors or wrongdoing by clients, their customers, or third-party technology providers resulting in actual or perceived security breaches may result in such actual or perceived breaches being attributed to us.
a failure or inability to meet our clients' expectations with respect to security and confidentiality through a disruption in the services provided by these third-party vendors, or the loss or alteration of data stored by such vendors, could result in financial or reputational harm to our business to the extent that such disruption or loss is caused by, or perceived by our customers to have been caused by, defects in our products. moreover, the risk of reputational harm may be magnified and/or distorted through the rapid dissemination of information over the internet, including through news articles, blogs, social media, and other online communication forums and services. this may affect our ability to retain clients and attract new business.
failure to comply with new and existing laws and regulations relating to privacy, data protection, and information security could cause harm to our reputation, result in liability and adversely impact our business.
our business is subject to increasing regulation by various federal, state and international governmental agencies responsible for enacting and enforcing laws and regulations relating to privacy, data protection, and information security. the rapidly evolving regulatory framework in this area is likely to remain uncertain for the foreseeable future.  in addition, changes in the interpretation and enforcement of existing laws and regulations could impact our business operations and those of our partners, vendors and customers. customers, privacy advocates and industry groups also may propose new and different self-regulatory standards or standards of care that may legally or contractually apply to us, and these standards may be subject to change. these factors create uncertainty and we cannot yet determine the impact such future laws, regulations and standards, or changes to such laws, regulations, or standards, or to their interpretation or enforcement, may have on our business or the businesses of our partners, vendors and customers. in addition, changes in the interpretation of existing laws and regulations could impact our business operations and those of our partners, vendors and customers.
because the interpretation and application of many laws and regulations relating to privacy, data protection and information security, along with industry standards, are uncertain, it is possible that relevant laws, regulations, or standards may be interpreted and applied in manners that are, or are alleged to be, inconsistent with our data management practices or the features of our products. any failure, or perceived failure, by us or our business partners to comply with federal, state or international laws and regulations relating to privacy, data protection, and information security, commitments relating to privacy, data protection, and information security contained in our contracts, self-regulatory standards that apply to us or that third parties assert are applicable to us, or our policies or notices we post or make available could subject us to claims, investigations, sanctions, enforcement actions and other proceedings, disgorgement of profits, fines, damages, civil and criminal liability, penalties or injunctions.
additionally, as a technology provider, our customers expect that we can demonstrate compliance with laws and regulations relating to privacy, data protection, and information security, and our inability or perceived inability to do so may adversely impact sales of our products and services, particularly to customers in highly-regulated industries. we have invested company resources in complying with new laws, regulations, and other obligations relating to privacy, data protection, and information security, and we may be required to make additional, significant changes in our business operations, all of which may adversely affect our revenue and our business overall. as a result of any inability to comply with such laws and regulations, our reputation and brand may be harmed, we could incur significant costs, and financial and operating results could be materially adversely affected, and we could be required to modify or change our products or our business practices, any of which could have an adverse effect on our business. our business could be subject to stricter obligations, greater fines and private causes of action under the enactment of new laws and regulations relating to privacy, data protection, and information security, including but not limited to, the european union general data protection regulation, which provides for penalties of up to 20 million euros or four percent of our annual global revenues, the california consumer privacy act and the california privacy rights act.
if our products or services are defective, or are perceived to be defective as a result of improper use or maintenance, our operating results, including gross margins, and customer relationships may be harmed.
our products and services are complex. we have experienced in the past, and expect to experience in the future, quality issues impacting certain products, and in the future, we could experience reliability issues with services we provide. such quality and reliability issues may be due to, for example, our own designs or processes, the designs or processes of our suppliers, and/or flaws in third-party software used in our products. these types of risks are most acute when we are introducing new products. quality or reliability issues have and could again in the future cause customers to experience outages or disruptions in service, data loss or data corruption. if we fail to remedy a product defect or flaw, we may experience a failure of a product line, temporary or permanent withdrawal from a product or market, damage to our reputation, loss of revenue, inventory costs or product reengineering expenses and higher ongoing warranty and service costs, and these occurrences could have a material impact on our gross margins, business and operating results. in addition, we exercise little control over how our customers use or maintain our products and services, and in some cases improper usage or maintenance could impair the performance of our products and services, which could lead to a perception of a quality or reliability issue. customers may experience losses that may result from or are alleged to result from defects or flaws in our products and services, which could subject us to claims for damages, including consequential damages.
changes in regulations relating to our products or their components, or the manufacture, sourcing, distribution or use thereof, may harm our business, operating results financial condition and cash flows.
the laws and regulations governing the manufacturing, sourcing, distribution and use of our products have become more complex and stringent over time. for example, in addition to various environmental laws relating to carbon emissions, the use and discharge of hazardous materials and the use of certain minerals originating from identified conflict zones, many governments, including the u.s., the united kingdom and australia, have adopted regulations concerning the risk of human trafficking in supply chains which govern how workers are recruited and managed. we incur costs to comply with the requirements of such laws. further, since our supply chain is complex, we may face reputational harm if our customers or other stakeholders conclude that we are unable to verify sufficiently the origins of the minerals used in the products we sell or the actions of our suppliers with respect to workers. as the laws and regulations governing our products continue to expand and change, our costs are likely to rise, and the failure to comply with any such laws and regulations could subject us to business interruptions, litigation risks and reputational harm.
some of our products are subject to u.s. export control laws and other laws affecting the countries in which our products and services may be sold, distributed, or delivered, and any violation of these laws could have a material and adverse effect on our business, operating results, financial condition and cash flows.
due to the global nature of our business, we are subject to import and export restrictions and regulations, including the export administration regulations administered by the commerce department's bureau of industry and security (bis) and the trade and economic sanctions regulations administered by the treasury department's office of foreign assets control (ofac). the u.s., through the bis and ofac, places restrictions on the sale or export of certain products and services to certain countries and persons. the bis and ofac have also placed restrictions on dealing with certain "blocked" entities, such as russia's federal security service (fsb), including the company's filing of notifications to the fsb for exporting certain products to russia. violators of these export control and sanctions laws may be subject to significant penalties, which may include significant monetary fines, criminal proceedings
against them and their officers and employees, a denial of export privileges, and suspension or debarment from selling products to the federal government. our products could be shipped to those targets by third parties, including potentially our channel partners, despite our precautions.
if we were ever found to have violated u.s. export control laws, we may be subject to various penalties available under the laws, any of which could have a material and adverse impact on our business, operating results and financial condition. even if we were not found to have violated such laws, the political and media scrutiny surrounding any governmental investigation of us could cause us significant expense and reputational harm. such collateral consequences could have a material adverse impact on our business, operating results, financial condition and cash flows.
our failure to protect our intellectual property could harm our business, operating results, financial condition and cash flows.
our success depends significantly upon developing, maintaining and protecting our proprietary technology. we rely on a combination of patents, copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions with employees, resellers, strategic partners and customers, to protect our proprietary rights. we currently have multiple u.s. and international patent applications pending and multiple u.s. and international patents issued. the pending applications may not be approved, and our existing and future patents may be challenged. if such challenges are brought, the patents may be invalidated. we may not be able to develop proprietary products or technologies that are patentable, and patents issued to us may not provide us with any competitive advantages and may be challenged by third parties. further, the patents of others may materially and adversely affect our ability to do business. in addition, a failure to obtain and defend our trademark registrations may impede our marketing and branding efforts and competitive condition. litigation may be necessary to protect our proprietary technology. any such litigation may be time-consuming and costly. despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights, unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of our products or obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary. in addition, the laws of some foreign countries do not protect proprietary rights to as great an extent as do the laws of the u.s. our means of protecting our proprietary rights may not be adequate or our competitors may independently develop similar technology, duplicate our products, or design around patents issued to us or other intellectual property rights of ours. in addition, while we train employees in confidentiality practices and include terms in our employee and consultant agreements to protect our intellectual property, there is persistent risk that some individuals will improperly take our intellectual property after terminating their employment or other engagements with us, which could lead to intellectual property leakage to competitors and a loss of our competitive advantages.
we may be found to infringe on intellectual property rights of others.
we compete in markets in which intellectual property infringement claims arise in the normal course of business. third parties have, from time to time, asserted intellectual property-related claims against us, including claims for alleged patent infringement brought by non-practicing entities. such claims may be made against our products and services, our customers' use of our products and services, or a combination of our products and third-party products. we also may be subject to claims and indemnification obligations from customers and resellers with respect to third-party intellectual property rights pursuant to our agreements with them. if we refuse to indemnify or defend such claims, even in situations in which the third-party's allegations are meritless, then customers and resellers may refuse to do business with us.
patent litigation is particularly common in our industry. we have been, and continue to be, in active patent litigations with non-practicing entities. while we vigorously defend our ability to compete in the marketplace, there is no guarantee that, in patent or other types of intellectual property litigation, we will prevail at trial or be able to settle at a reasonable cost.  if a judge or jury were to find that our products infringe, we could be required to pay significant monetary damages and be subject to an injunction that could cause product shipment delays, require us to redesign our products, affect our ability to supply or service our customers, and/or require us to enter into compulsory royalty or licensing agreements.
we expect that companies in the network storage and data management markets will increasingly be subject to infringement claims as the number of products and competitors in our industry segment grows and the functionality of products in different industry segments overlaps. any such claims, and any such infringement claims discussed above, could be time consuming, result in costly litigation, cause suspension of product shipments or product shipment delays, require us to redesign our products, or require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements, any of which could materially and adversely affect our operating results, financial condition and cash flows. such royalty or licensing agreements, if required, may not be available on terms acceptable to us or at all.
we rely on software from third parties, and a failure to properly manage our use of third-party software could result in increased costs or loss of revenue.
many of our products are designed to include software licensed from third parties. such third-party software includes software licensed from commercial suppliers and software licensed under public open source licenses. we have internal processes to manage our use of such third-party software. however, if we fail to adequately manage our use of third-party software, then we may be subject to copyright infringement or other third-party claims. if we are non-compliant with a license for commercial software, then we may be required to pay penalties or undergo costly audits pursuant to the license agreement. in the case of open-source software licensed under certain "copyleft" licenses, the license itself may require, or a court-imposed remedy for non-compliant use of the open source
software may require, that proprietary portions of our own software be publicly disclosed or licensed. this could result in a loss of intellectual property rights, increased costs, damage to our reputation and/or a loss of revenue.
our failure to adjust to emerging standards in the storage and data management industry may harm our business.
emerging standards in the storage and data management markets may adversely affect the unix®, windows® and world wide web server markets upon which we depend. for example, we provide our open access data retention solutions to customers within the financial services, healthcare, pharmaceutical and government market segments, industries that are subject to various evolving governmental regulations with respect to data access, reliability and permanence in the u.s. and in the other countries in which we operate. if our products do not meet and continue to comply with these evolving governmental regulations in this regard, customers in these market and geographical segments will not purchase our products, and we may not be able to expand our product offerings in these market and geographical segments at the rates which we have forecasted.
risks related to our securities our stock price is subject to volatility.
our stock price is subject to changes in recommendations or earnings estimates by financial analysts, changes in investors' or analysts' valuation measures for our stock, changes in our capital structure, including issuance of additional debt, changes in our credit ratings, our ability to pay dividends and to continue to execute our stock repurchase program as planned and market trends unrelated to our performance.
our ability to pay quarterly dividends and to continue to execute our stock repurchase program as planned will be subject to, among other things, our financial condition and operating results, available cash and cash flows in the u.s., capital requirements, and other factors. future dividends are subject to declaration by our board of directors, and our stock repurchase program does not obligate us to acquire any specific number of shares. however, if we fail to meet any investor expectations related to dividends and/or stock repurchases, the market price of our stock could decline significantly, and could have a material adverse impact on investor confidence. additionally, price volatility of our stock over a given period may cause the average price at which we repurchase our own stock to exceed the stock's market price at a given point in time.
furthermore, speculation in the press or investment community about our strategic position, financial condition, results of operations or business can cause changes in our stock price. these factors, as well as general economic and political conditions and the timing of announcements in the public market regarding new products or services, product enhancements or technological advances by our competitors or us, and any announcements by us of acquisitions, major transactions, or management changes may adversely affect our stock price.
our quarterly operating results may fluctuate materially, which could harm our common stock price.
our operating results have fluctuated in the past and will continue to do so, sometimes materially. all of the matters discussed in this risk factors section could impact our operating results in any fiscal quarter or year. in addition to those matters, we face the following issues, which could impact our quarterly results:
•   seasonality, such as our historical seasonal decline in revenues in the first quarter of our fiscal year and seasonal increase in revenues in the second quarter of our fiscal year, with the latter due in part to the impact of the u.s. federal government's september 30 fiscal year end on the timing of its orders;
•   linearity, such as our historical intra-quarter customer orders and revenue pattern in which a disproportionate percentage of each quarter's total orders and related revenue occur in the last month of the quarter; and
•   unpredictability associated with larger scale enterprise software license agreements which generally take longer to negotiate and occur less consistently than other types of contracts, and for which revenue attributable to the software license component is typically recognized in full upon delivery.
if our operating results fall below our forecasts and the expectations of public market analysts and investors, the trading price of our common stock may decline.
there are risks associated with our outstanding and future indebtedness.
as of april 30, 2021, we had $2.7 billion aggregate principal amount of outstanding indebtedness for our senior notes that mature at specific dates in calendar years 2022, 2024, 2025, 2027 and 2030. we may incur additional indebtedness in the future under existing credit facilities and/or enter into new financing arrangements. we may fail to pay these or additional future obligations, as and when required. specifically, if we are unable to generate sufficient cash flows from operations or to borrow sufficient funds in the future to service or refinance our debt, our business, operating results, financial condition and cash flows will be harmed. any downgrades from credit rating agencies such as moody's investors service or standard & poor's rating services may adversely
impact our ability to obtain additional financing or the terms of such financing and reduce the market capacity for our commercial paper. furthermore, if prevailing interest rates or other factors result in higher interest rates upon any potential future financing, then interest expense related to the refinance indebtedness would increase.
in addition, all our debt and credit facility arrangements subject us to continued compliance with restrictive and financial covenants. if we do not comply with these covenants or otherwise default under the arrangements, we may be required to repay any outstanding amounts borrowed under these agreements. moreover, compliance with these covenants may restrict our strategic or operational flexibility in the future, which could harm our business, operating results, financial condition and cash flows.
general risks we are unable to predict the extent to which the global covid-19 pandemic may adversely impact our business, operating results, financial condition, and cash flows.
the covid-19 pandemic and efforts to control its spread have significantly curtailed the movement of people, goods and services worldwide, including in most or all of the regions in which we sell our products and services and conduct our business operations. while we are currently considered an essential business in many of the key regions in which we operate, including in the united states (u.s.), there is no guarantee that we will continue to be classified as such. we have taken precautionary measures intended to minimize the risk of the virus to our employees, our customers, and the communities in which we operate such as india, including office closures and working remotely for the vast majority of employees, all of which could negatively impact our business. the magnitude and duration of the disruption and resulting decline in business activity is uncertain and has limited our ability to forecast future demand for our products and services. the covid-19 pandemic and its uneven recovery have adversely affected, and we expect may continue to adversely affect, our business in a variety of ways, including by negatively impacting the demand for our products and services, and our ability to build and convert our sales pipeline (including delayed and deferred purchases); restricting our sales, marketing and distribution efforts; disrupting our supply chain and our ability to deliver product to customers; and constraining business operations, research and development capabilities, engineering, design and manufacturing processes and other important business activities, including in india. in addition, the covid-19 pandemic has disrupted the operations of our suppliers, customers and partners for an indefinite period of time, including as a result of travel restrictions and/or business shutdowns and limited access to capital markets, all of which have and may continue to negatively impact our business and results of operations, including cash flows. accordingly, we expect the covid-19 pandemic to have a negative impact on our future sales and results of operations, the magnitude and duration of which we are unable to predict. additionally, concerns over the economic impact of covid-19 pandemic have caused extreme volatility in financial and other capital markets, which volatility has and may continue to adversely impact our stock price and could impact our ability to access capital markets. more generally, the covid-19 pandemic has adversely affected economies and financial markets globally, potentially leading to a prolonged economic downturn, which could decrease technology spending and adversely affect demand for our offerings and harm our business and results of operations for an extended period of time. to the extent that the covid-19 pandemic adversely affects our business and financial results, it may also have the effect of heightening many of the other risks described in this "risk factors" section and those incorporated by reference herein, such as those relating to our products and services, financial performance, credit rating and debt obligations.
our business could be materially and adversely affected as a result of natural disasters, terrorist acts or other catastrophic events.
we depend on the ability of our personnel, inventories, equipment and products to move reasonably unimpeded around the world. any political, military, terrorism, global trade, world health or other issue that hinders this movement or restricts the import or export of materials could lead to significant business disruptions. for example, the ongoing covid-19 pandemic is impeding the mobility of our personnel, inventories, equipment and products and disrupting our business operations. furthermore, any economic failure or other material disruption caused by natural disasters, including fires, floods, hurricanes, earthquakes, and volcanoes; power loss or shortages; environmental disasters; telecommunications or business information systems failures or break-ins and similar events could also adversely affect our ability to conduct business. if such disruptions result in cancellations of customer orders or contribute to a general decrease in economic activity or corporate spending on it, or directly impact our marketing, manufacturing, financial and logistics functions, or impair our ability to meet our customer demands, our operating results and financial condition could be materially adversely affected. our headquarters is located in northern california, an area susceptible to earthquakes and wildfires. if any significant disaster were to occur there, our ability to operate our business and our operating results, financial condition and cash flows could be adversely impacted.
our effective tax rate is influenced by a variety of factors, many of which are outside of our control. these factors include among other things, fluctuations in our earnings and financial results in the various countries and states in which we do business, changes to the tax laws in such jurisdictions and the outcome of income tax audits. changes to any of these factors could materially impact our operating results, financial condition and cash flows.
we receive significant tax benefits from sales to our non-u.s. customers. these benefits are contingent upon existing tax laws and regulations in the u.s. and in the countries in which our international operations are located. future changes in domestic or
international tax laws and regulations or a change in how we manage our international operations could adversely affect our ability to continue realizing these tax benefits.
many countries around the world are beginning to implement legislation and other guidance to align their international tax rules with the organisation for economic co-operation and development's base erosion and profit shifting recommendations and related action plans that aim to standardize and modernize global corporate tax policy, including changes to cross-border tax, transfer-pricing documentation rules and nexus-based tax incentive practices. as a result, many of these changes, if enacted, could increase our worldwide effective tax rate and harm our operating result, financial condition and cash flows.
our effective tax rate could also be adversely affected by changes in tax laws and regulations and interpretations of such laws and regulations, which in turn would negatively impact our earnings and cash and cash equivalent balances we currently maintain. additionally, our effective tax rate could also be adversely affected if there is a change in international operations, our tax structure and how our operations are managed and structured, and as a result, we could experience harm to our operating results and financial condition. evolving or revised tax laws and regulations globally, including the 2017 tax cuts and jobs act deferral on tax deductions for certain research and development expenses could change the amount or accounting treatment of the expense we occur in the future. president biden has detailed his made in america tax plan which includes proposed increases to tax rates on both domestic and foreign income. if these proposals are ultimately enacted into legislation, they could materially impact our operations and financial results.
we are routinely subject to income tax audits in the u.s. and several foreign tax jurisdictions. if the ultimate determination of income taxes or at-source withholding taxes assessed under these audits results in amounts in excess of the tax provision we have recorded or reserved for, our operating results, financial condition and cash flows could be adversely affected.
item 7.  management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read together with the financial statements and the accompanying notes set forth under item 8. - financial statements and supplementary data. the following discussion also contains trend information and other forward-looking statements that involve a number of risks and uncertainties. the risk factors set forth in item 1a. - risk factors are hereby incorporated into the discussion by reference.
executive overview our company netapp is a global cloud-led, data-centric software company that give organizations the freedom to put data to work in the applications that elevate their business. we help our customers get the most out of their data with industry-leading cloud data services, storage systems, and software. throughout our history, we have kept our focus on one thing - the data, continuously improving how data are managed, stored, analyzed, protected, and moved. our strategy has been shaped around helping our customers embrace the full potential of new technologies - from the rise of the internet, to helping large enterprise customers in vertical markets, to bringing new systems to market. today, we are focused on unlocking the best of cloud.
netapp helps customers move from building data centers to building data fabrics that achieve business objectives. a data fabric simplifies the integration and orchestration of data services across clouds and on-premises to accelerate digital transformation. we help organizations to get the most out of their cloud experience - whether private, public, or hybrid - by enabling it to discover, integrate, automate, optimize, protect, and secure data and applications. netapp delivers the full range of capabilities organizations need for their data fabrics, enabling the business to deliver the right data and applications to the right place at the right time with the right capabilities to fuel innovation.
we bring the enterprise-grade data services our customers rely on into the cloud, and the simple flexibility of cloud into the data center. our industry-leading solutions work across diverse environments and the world's biggest clouds. netapp can help a company wherever it is on its hybrid cloud journey.
we focus on delivering an exceptional customer experience to become our customers' preferred data partner. netapp's unique approach to data enables organizations to create new customer experiences, seize every opportunity to innovate, and optimize operations for cost, scale, speed, and agility - all while thriving in a multi-cloud world.
we employ a multichannel distribution strategy, selling products and services to end users and service providers through a direct sales force and through channel partners, including value-added resellers, system integrators, original equipment manufacturers (oems) and distributors.
as our product portfolio evolves, market dynamics change, and management continues to assess our largest opportunities, we periodically change how we group product revenue. to provide improved visibility into the value created by our software innovation and r&d investment, beginning in fiscal 2021, we no longer group our products by "strategic" and "mature" solutions, but instead disclose the "software" and "hardware" components of our product revenues. the engineering dna of netapp and the value we provide to customers is grounded in software (particularly our ontap os) and we will continue to look for opportunities to highlight and reinvest in this innovation engine. software product revenue includes the os software and optional add-on software solutions attached to our systems across our entire product set: all-flash fas, solidfire, ef-series, hybrid fas, e-series, netapp hci, and storagegrid. hardware product revenues include the non-software component of our systems across our entire product set.
in addition to our products and solutions, we provide a variety of services to our customers, including software support, hardware support and other services including professional services, and customer education and training to help customers most effectively build their unique data fabrics and efficiently manage their data. revenues generated by our public cloud services (formerly referred to as cloud data services) offerings, are included in software support revenues.
the novel coronavirus, or covid-19, pandemic and efforts to control its spread have significantly curtailed the movement of people, goods and services worldwide, including in most or all of the regions in which we sell our products and services and conduct our business operations. we have taken precautionary measures intended to minimize the risk of the virus to our employees, our customers, and the communities in which we operate. since march 2020, the vast majority of our employees have been working remotely and we have suspended business travel.
during fiscal 2021, due to macroeconomic uncertainty caused by covid-19, we continued to observe certain customers delay purchases of our products and services, while other customers accelerated or placed new orders to address the demands of remote working and digital business. we also experienced certain logistical challenges in delivering our products and services to customers in
certain regions, and minor supply chain constraints. given recent developments in the broader technology supply chain, we have begun to invest in inventory and certain longer-term commitments to help mitigate the risk of supply shortages.
we believe our existing balances of cash, cash equivalents and investments, cash generated from operations, and ability to access capital markets and committed lines of credit will be sufficient to satisfy our working capital needs, capital expenditures, dividends, stock repurchases, required debt repayments and other liquidity requirements associated with our operations.
the magnitude and duration of the disruption to our business, and impact to our operational and financial performance, caused by covid-19 pandemic remain uncertain. refer to item 1a. - risk factors for the significant risks we have identified as a result of the covid-19 pandemic.
financial results and key performance metrics overview the following table provides an overview of key financial metrics for each of the last three fiscal years (in millions, except per share amounts and percentages):
gross profit                                                        $3,815                      $3,623                      $3,945
gross profit margin percentage                                          66   %                      67   %                      64   %
income from operations as a percentage of net revenues                  18   %                      17   %                      20   %
net cash provided by operating activities                           $1,333                      $1,060                      $1,341
deferred revenue and financed unearned services revenue   $4,003        $3,698
•   net revenues: our net revenues increased 6% in fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020, primarily due to an increase in software support revenues.
•   gross profit margin percentage: our gross profit margin as a percentage of net revenues decreased by approximately one percentage point in fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020, primarily due to a reduction in gross profit margins on product revenues, partially offset by software support revenues representing a higher percentage of total revenues in fiscal 2021.
•   income from operations as a percentage of net revenues: our income from operations as a percentage of net revenues increased by approximately one percentage point in fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020, primarily due to the gain on sale of certain properties in fiscal 2021, partially offset by higher sales and marketing expense and the lower gross profit margin percentage.
•   provision for income taxes: our provision for income taxes increased in fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020 primarily as a result of discrete tax impacts in the prior year.
•   net income and diluted income per share: the decrease in both net income and diluted net income per share in fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020 reflect the factors discussed above. the impact of the lower net income in fiscal year 2021 on diluted net income per share was partially offset by a decrease in the number of weighted average dilutive shares outstanding primarily as a result of share repurchases.
•   operating cash flows: operating cash flows increased by 26% in fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020, primarily reflecting lower cash payments for incentive compensation.
•   deferred revenue and financed unearned services revenue: total deferred revenue and financed unearned services revenue increased $305 million, or 8%, as of fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020 primarily due to increases in the installed base and aggregate contract values under software and hardware support contracts, public cloud services contracts, and the favorable impact of foreign exchange rate fluctuations.
stock repurchase program and dividend activity during fiscal 2021, we repurchased approximately 2 million shares of our common stock at an average price of $67.61 per share, for an aggregate purchase price of $125 million. we also declared aggregate cash dividends of $1.92 per share in fiscal 2021, for which we paid a total of $427 million.
acquisitions on april 28, 2020, we acquired all the outstanding shares of privately-held cloud jumper corporation, a provider of virtual desktop infrastructure and remote desktop services solutions, for $34 million in cash.
on july 9, 2020, we acquired all the outstanding shares of privately-held spot, inc. (spot) for $340 million in cash. spot is a provider of compute management cost optimization services on the public clouds and is based in israel.
restructuring events in each of the first quarter and second quarter of fiscal 2021, we announced separate restructuring plans to reduce costs and redirect resources to our highest return activities, which included a reduction in our global workforce by less than 1% and approximately 5%, respectively, and incurred charges of approximately $5 million and $37 million, respectively, consisting primarily of employee severance costs. see note 13 - restructuring charges for additional information.
senior notes issuance and redemption in june 2020, we issued $750 million aggregate principal amount of 1.875% senior notes due 2025, $550 million aggregate principal amount of 2.375% senior notes due 2027 and $700 million aggregate principal amount of 2.70% senior notes due 2030, for which we received total proceeds of approximately $2.0 billion, net of discount and issuance costs. on july 27, 2020, we extinguished our 3.375% senior notes due june 2021 for an aggregate cash redemption price of $513 million, plus accrued and unpaid interest and fees.
real estate transactions in april 2021, we announced the sale of our corporate headquarters located in sunnyvale, california, consisting primarily of land, buildings and improvements, for cash proceeds of $365 million. the assets sold had a net book value totaling $210 million. to facilitate an orderly transition to a new location, we executed short-term lease agreements with the buyer to lease back these properties. the agreed lease payments were below market rates and as a result we recognized an asset of $7 million for the difference between the fair value of the leases and the agreed lease payments. the cash proceeds, less direct selling costs, plus the fair value of the below-market leases resulted in a net gain on the sale of $156 million.
contemporaneous with the sale, we executed a lease with a separate landlord for our new corporate headquarters located in san jose, california, which is comprised of approximately three hundred thousand square feet of office space. the lease commenced in the first quarter of fiscal 2022 and requires future minimum undiscounted payments of approximately $180 million over the initial 11-year lease term. it also provides us two successive renewal options, each for five years.
critical accounting policies and estimates our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america (gaap), which require management to make judgments, estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, net revenues and expenses, and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. our estimates are based on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, including the ongoing covid-19 pandemic, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities. we believe that the accounting estimates employed and the resulting balances are reasonable; however, actual results may differ from these estimates and such differences may be material.
the summary of significant accounting policies is included in note 1 - description of business and significant accounting policies of the notes to consolidated financial statements. an accounting policy is deemed to be critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made, if different estimates reasonably could have been used, or if changes in the estimate that are reasonably possible could materially impact the financial statements. the accounting policies described below reflect the significant judgments, estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements.
revenue recognition our contracts with customers often include the transfer of multiple products and services to the customer. in determining the amount and timing of revenue recognition, we assess which products and services are distinct performance obligations and allocate the
transaction price, which may include fixed and/or variable amounts, among each performance obligation on a relative standalone selling price (ssp) basis. the following are the key estimates and assumptions and corresponding uncertainties included in this approach:
•   we evaluate whether products and services promised in our contracts with customers are distinct performance obligations that should be accounted for separately versus together.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     •   in certain contracts, the determination of our distinct performance obligations requires significant judgment. as our business and offerings to customers change over time, the products and services we determine to be distinct performance obligations may change. such changes may adversely impact the amount of revenue and gross margin we report in a particular period.
•   in determining the transaction price of our contracts, we estimate variable consideration based on the expected value, primarily relying on our history. in certain situations, we may also use the most likely amount as the basis of our estimate.                                                                                                                                                                 •   we may have insufficient relevant historical data or other information to arrive at an accurate estimate of variable consideration using either the "expected value" or "most likely amount" method. additionally, changes in business practices, such as those related to sales returns or marketing programs, may introduce new forms of variable consideration, as well as more complexity and uncertainty in the estimation process.
•   in contracts with multiple performance obligations, we establish ssps based on the price at which products and services are sold separately. if ssps are not observable through past transactions, we estimate them by maximizing the use of observable inputs including pricing strategy, market data, internally-approved pricing guidelines related to the performance obligations and other observable inputs.   •   as our business and offerings evolve over time, modifications to our pricing and discounting methodologies, changes in the scope and nature of product and service offerings and/or changes in customer segmentation may result in a lack of consistency, making it difficult to establish and/or maintain ssps. changes in ssps could result in different and unanticipated allocations of revenue in contracts with multiple performance obligations. these factors, among others, may adversely impact the amount of revenue and gross margin we report in a particular period.
inventory valuation and purchase order accruals inventories consist primarily of purchased components and finished goods and are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value, which approximates actual cost on a first-in, first-out basis. a provision is recorded when inventory is determined to be in excess of anticipated demand or obsolete in order to adjust inventory to its estimated realizable value. the following are the key estimates and assumptions and corresponding uncertainties for estimating the value of our inventories:
•   we periodically perform an excess and obsolete analysis of our inventory. inventories are written down based on excess and obsolete reserves determined primarily on assumptions about future demand forecasts and market conditions. at the point of the loss recognition, a new, lower cost basis for that inventory is established, and subsequent changes in facts and circumstances do not result in the restoration or increase in that newly established cost basis.   •   although we use our best estimates to forecast future product demand, any significant unanticipated changes in demand, which could be exacerbated by the effects of the covid-19 pandemic, or obsolescence related to technological developments, new product introductions, customer requirements, competition or other factors could have a significant impact on the valuation of our inventory. if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected, additional write-downs and other charges against earnings that adversely impact gross margins may be required. if actual market conditions are more favorable, we may realize higher gross profits in the period when the written-down inventory is sold.
we are subject to a variety of environmental laws relating to the manufacture of our products. if there are changes to the current regulations, we may be required to make product design changes which may result in excess or obsolete inventory, which could adversely impact our operating results.
•   we make commitments to our third-party contract manufacturers and other suppliers to manage lead times and meet product forecasts and to other parties to purchase various key components used in the manufacture of our products. we establish accruals for estimated losses on non-cancelable purchase commitments when we believe it is probable that the components will not be utilized in future operations.   •   if the actual materials demand is significantly lower than our forecast, we may be required to increase our recorded liabilities for estimated losses on non-cancelable purchase commitments, including incremental commitments made in response to recent developments in the broader technology supply chain, which would adversely impact our operating results.
goodwill and purchased intangible assets we allocate the purchase price of acquisitions to identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed at their acquisition date fair values based on established valuation techniques. goodwill represents the residual value as of the acquisition date, which in most cases is measured as the excess of the purchase consideration transferred over the net of the acquisition date fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed.
the carrying values of purchased intangible assets are reviewed whenever events and circumstances indicate that the net book value of an asset may not be recovered through expected future cash flows from its use and eventual disposition. we periodically review the estimated remaining useful lives of our intangible assets. this review may result in impairment charges or shortened useful lives, resulting in charges to our consolidated statements of income.
we review goodwill for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of our reporting unit may exceed its fair value. the provisions of the accounting standard for goodwill allow us to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform the quantitative goodwill impairment test. for our annual goodwill impairment test in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021, we performed a quantitative test and determined the fair value of our reporting unit substantially exceeded its carrying amount, therefore, found no impairment of goodwill. to date, the impacts of the covid-19 pandemic have not significantly adversely affected the fair value of our reporting unit.
the following are the key estimates and assumptions and corresponding uncertainties for estimating the value of our goodwill and purchased intangible assets:
•   the assessment of fair value for goodwill and purchased intangible assets is based on factors that market participants would use in an orderly transaction in accordance with the accounting guidance for the fair value measurement of nonfinancial assets.                                  •   while we employ experts to determine the acquisition date fair value of acquired intangibles, the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed are based on significant management assumptions and estimates, which are inherently uncertain and highly subjective and as a result, actual results may differ from estimates. if different assumptions were to be used, it could materially impact the purchase price allocation. volatile macroeconomic and market conditions caused by the covid-19 pandemic have increased the level of uncertainty and subjectivity of certain management assumptions and estimates.
the valuation of purchased intangible assets is principally based on estimates of the future performance and cash flows expected to be generated by the acquired assets from the acquired business.
•   evaluations of possible goodwill and purchased intangible asset impairment require us to make judgments and assumptions related to the allocation of our balance sheet and income statement amounts and estimate future cash flows and fair market values of our reporting unit and assets.   •   in response to changes in industry and market conditions, we could be required to strategically realign our resources and consider restructuring, disposing of, or otherwise exiting businesses, which could result in an impairment of goodwill or purchased intangible assets.
assumptions and estimates about expected future cash flows and the fair values of our reporting unit and purchased intangible assets are complex and subjective. they can be affected by a variety of factors, including external factors such as the adverse impact of unanticipated changes in macroeconomic conditions, such as those related to the covid-19 pandemic, and technological changes or new product introductions from competitors. they can also be affected by internal factors such as changes in business strategy or in forecasted product life cycles and roadmaps. our ongoing consideration of these and other factors could result in future impairment charges or accelerated amortization expense, which could adversely affect our operating results.
valuation of investment securities our investments in debt securities are reported at fair value and are subject to periodic impairment review. unrealized gains and losses related to changes in the fair value of these securities are recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income, net of tax, unless they are determined to be other-than-temporary impairments. the ultimate value realized on these securities is subject to market price volatility until they are sold.
the following are the key estimates and assumptions and corresponding uncertainties for the valuation of our investment securities:
•   the estimated fair value of our debt securities, and the associated accounting for unrealized losses is based on an evaluation of current economic and market conditions, the credit rating of the security's issuer, the length of time and extent the security's fair value has been below its amortized cost and our ability and intent to hold the security for a period of time sufficient to allow for anticipated recovery in value. if we determine that an investment has an other-than-temporary decline in fair value, we recognize the investment loss in earnings.   •   the fair value of our investments in debt securities could decrease significantly from uncertainties in the credit and capital markets, credit rating downgrades and/or solvency of the issuer or decreases in the marketability of the securities, with the ongoing covid-19 pandemic contributing to these uncertainties. if the fair value of our investments decreases significantly and, if because of changes in our ability and intent to continue to hold the securities or other factors, it is determined to be other-than-temporary, we may incur impairment charges that could adversely affect our results of operations.
income taxes we are subject to income taxes in the united states and numerous foreign jurisdictions. we compute our provision for income taxes using the asset and liability method, under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities, and for operating losses and tax credit carryforwards. deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the currently enacted tax rates that apply to taxable income in effect for the years in which those tax assets or liabilities are expected to be realized or settled. the company records a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is believed more likely than not to be realized.
•   our income tax provision is based on existing tax law and advanced pricing agreements or letter rulings we have with various tax authorities.                                                                             •   our provision for income taxes is subject to volatility and could be adversely impacted by future changes in existing tax laws, such as a change in tax rate, possible u.s. changes to the taxation of earnings of our foreign subsidiaries, and uncertainties as to future renewals of favorable tax agreements and rulings.
•   the determination of whether we should record or adjust a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets is based on assumptions regarding our future profitability.                                                 •   our future profits could differ from current expectations resulting in a change to our determination as to the amount of deferred tax assets that are more likely than not to be realized. we could adjust our valuation allowance with a corresponding impact to the tax provision in the period in which such determination is made.
•   the estimates for our uncertain tax positions are based primarily on company specific circumstances, applicable tax laws, tax opinions from outside firms and past results from examinations of our income tax returns.   •   significant judgment is required in evaluating our uncertain tax positions. although we believe our reserves are reasonable, no assurance can be given that the final tax outcome or tax court rulings of these matters will not be different from that which is reflected in our historical tax provisions and accruals.
new accounting standards see note 1 - description of business and significant accounting policies for the impact to our financial statements of the adoption of the accounting standard update on the measurement of credit losses on financial instruments in the first quarter of fiscal 2021.

results of operations our fiscal year is reported on a 52- or 53-week year that ends on the last friday in april. an additional week is included in the first fiscal quarter approximately every six years to realign fiscal months with calendar months. fiscal year 2021, ending on april 30, 2021 is a 53-week year, with 14 weeks included in its first quarter and 13 weeks in each subsequent quarter. fiscal year 2020, which ended on april 24, 2020, and fiscal year 2019, which ended on april 26, 2019 were both 52-week years. unless otherwise stated, references to particular years, quarters, months and periods refer to our fiscal years ended in april and the associated quarters, months and periods of those fiscal years.
the following table sets forth certain consolidated statements of income data as a percentage of net revenues for the periods indicated:

percentages may not add due to rounding discussion and analysis of results of operations net revenues (in millions, except percentages):
2021               2020                  % change          2019                  % change net revenues          $5,744             $5,412         6             %          $6,146                (12    )%
the increase in net revenues for fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020 was primarily due to an increase in hardware and software support revenues, which benefited from an additional week in the first quarter of fiscal 2021, while product revenues were relatively flat. product revenues as a percentage of net revenues decreased by approximately three percentage points compared to fiscal 2020. fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates benefited net revenues by approximately one percentage point for fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020.
the decrease in net revenues for fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019 was primarily due to a decrease in product revenues. product revenues as a percent of net revenues decreased six percentage points in fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019.
sales through our indirect channels represented 77%, 79% and 76% of net revenues in fiscal 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.
the following customers, each of which is a distributor, accounted for 10% or more of net revenues:
2021               2020                  % change          2019                  % change product revenues          $2,991             $2,995                -      %          $3,755                (20    )%
product revenues are derived through the sale of our data solutions and consist of sales of configured all-flash array and hybrid systems, which are bundled hardware and software products, as well as add-on flash, disk and/or hybrid storage and related os, netapp hci, storagegrid, oem products and add-on optional software.
total product revenues were relatively flat in fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020, suffering from less favorable macroeconomic conditions through most of the current year, in part due to the economic uncertainty caused by the covid-19 pandemic, but then improving in the last quarter of the year. sales of all-flash array systems increased in the current year, though this increase was offset by a decline in sales of our other products. fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates benefited product revenues by approximately one percentage point for fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020.
total product revenues declined in fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019 primarily due to less favorable macroeconomic conditions, lower enterprise it spending throughout fiscal 2020 and go-to-market execution issues experienced in the first quarter of fiscal 2020 with some of our largest global customer accounts. additionally, in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020, increasing macroeconomic uncertainty caused by the covid-19 pandemic contributed to demand weakness, while associated logistical challenges led to delays in deliveries of products and services to certain customers.
as discussed in the overview section, beginning in fiscal 2021, we disclose the software and hardware components of our product revenues. because our revenue recognition policy under generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america (gaap) defines a configured storage system, inclusive of the operating system software essential to its functionality, as a single performance obligation, the hardware and software components of our product revenues are considered non-gaap measures. the hardware and software components of our product revenues are derived from an estimated fair value allocation of the transaction price of our contracts with customers, down to the level of the product hardware and software components. this allocation is primarily based on the contractual prices at which netapp has historically billed customers for such respective components. we believe that the presentation of the software and hardware components of our product revenues is meaningful to investors and management as it illustrates the significance of the company's software and provides improved visibility into the value created by our software innovation and r&d investment.
revenues from the hardware component of product revenues totaled $1,355 million, representing 45% of product revenues, in fiscal 2021, compared to $1,541 million, representing 51% of product revenues, in fiscal 2020, compared to $1,935 million, representing 52% of product revenues, in fiscal 2019. the software component of product revenues totaled $1,636 million, representing 55% of product revenues, in fiscal 2021, compared to $1,454 million, representing 49% of product revenues, in fiscal 2020, compared to $1,820 million, representing 48% of product revenues, in fiscal 2019. the increase in the software component percentage of product revenues in fiscal 2021 is primarily due to a higher mix of all-flash array systems revenues, which contain a higher proportion of software components than other products.
software support revenues (in millions, except percentages):
2021               2020                  % change          2019                % change software support revenues          $1,281             $1,034         24            %          $946         9             %
software support revenues are associated with contracts which entitle customers to receive unspecified product upgrades and enhancements on a when-and-if-available basis, bug fixes and patch releases, as well as internet and telephone access to technical support personnel located in our global support centers.
the growth in software support revenues reflects higher public cloud services revenue and the higher aggregate contract value of the installed base under software support contracts, which is recognized as revenue ratably over the terms of the underlying contracts.
software support for fiscal 2021 benefitted from the continued growth in all-flash array product sales, as all-flash systems carry a higher support dollar content than our other products. software support revenues were also favorably impacted by the additional week of deferred revenue amortization in the first quarter of fiscal 2021, which contributed approximately $20 million of additional revenues.
hardware support and other services revenues (in millions, except percentages):
2021               2020                  % change          2019                  % change hardware support and other services revenues          $1,472             $1,383         6             %          $1,445                (4     )%
hardware support and other services revenues include hardware support, professional services and educational and training services revenues.
hardware support contract revenues were $1,195 million, $1,142 million and $1,182 million in fiscal 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. the increase in fiscal 2021 is primarily due to the additional week in the first quarter of fiscal 2021, which contributed approximately $20 million of additional revenues, and an increase in our installed base. the decrease in fiscal 2020 was primarily attributable to a decline in average selling price on contracts executed during the year.
professional services and educational and training services revenues were $277 million, $241 million and $263 million in fiscal 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.
percentages may not add due to rounding americas revenues consist of sales to americas commercial and united states (u.s.) public sector markets. demand across geographies was relatively consistent in fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020. during fiscal 2020, americas revenues were negatively impacted by general macroeconomic conditions in the region and go-to-market execution issues with some of our largest customer accounts in the first quarter of fiscal 2020, which was reflected in the geographic distribution of revenues as a percentage of net revenues in fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019.
cost of revenues our cost of revenues consists of three elements: (1) cost of product revenues, which includes the costs of manufacturing and shipping our storage products, amortization of purchased intangible assets, inventory write-downs, and warranty costs, (2) cost of software support, which includes the costs of providing software support and third-party royalty costs and (3) cost of hardware support and other services revenues, which includes costs associated with providing support activities for hardware support, global support partnership programs, professional services and educational and training services.
cost of product revenues (in millions, except percentages):
2021               2020                  % change          2019                  % change cost of product revenues          $1,432             $1,368         5             %          $1,752                (22    )%
the changes in cost of product revenues consisted of the following (in percentage points of the total change):
total change                                                5                       (22             )
cost of product revenues represented 48%, 46% and 47% of product revenues for fiscal 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. materials cost represented 89%, 86% and 90% of product costs for fiscal 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.
total materials costs increased by approximately $96 million in fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020. the trend in product mix toward all-flash array systems, which have higher margins, but carry higher materials costs, than hybrid systems, was the primary driver of these increases. excess and obsolete inventory reserves and warranty expenses were lower in fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020.
product gross margins in fiscal 2021 decreased by two percentage points compared to fiscal 2020 primarily due to a decrease in the average selling prices of most of our products, partially offset by a higher mix of all-flash array product sales.
materials costs decreased $393 million in fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019, primarily due to a decline in product revenue and, to a lesser extent, a decline in the price of certain product components.
product gross margins in fiscal 2020 increased one percentage point compared to fiscal 2019, primarily due to a higher mix of all-flash array product sales in fiscal 2020, partially offset by a decrease in high-margin revenue recognized from the software license component of several enterprise license agreements.
cost of software support revenues (in millions, except percentages):
2021           2020              % change          2019              % change cost of software support revenues         $95            $48         98            %         $35         37            %
cost of software support revenues increased in fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020, reflecting the increase in public cloud services revenue and an increase in amortization expense for acquired developed technology. cost of software support revenues increased in fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019, in line with the increase in software support revenues. cost of software support revenues represented 7%, 5% and 4% of software support revenues for fiscal 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.

cost of hardware support and other services revenues increased in fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020, in line with the increase in hardware support and other services revenues. cost of hardware support and other services revenues decreased in fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019, primarily due to the favorable impact of cost savings initiatives, and the decrease in hardware support and other services revenues. costs represented 27%, 27% and 29% of hardware support and other services revenues for fiscal 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.
operating expenses sales and marketing, research and development and general and administrative expenses sales and marketing, research and development, and general and administrative expenses for fiscal 2021 totaled $2,882 million, or 50% of net revenues, remaining relatively flat in percentage points as compared to fiscal 2020. sales and marketing, research and development, and general and administrative expenses for fiscal 2020 totaled $2,695 million, or 50% of net revenues, representing an increase of five percentage points compared to fiscal 2019, primarily due to lower net revenues in fiscal 2020.
compensation costs represent the largest component of operating expenses. included in compensation costs are salaries, benefits, other compensation-related costs, stock-based compensation expense and employee incentive compensation plan costs.
total compensation costs included in operating expenses increased by $225 million, or 15% during fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020, primarily reflecting higher incentive compensation expense, a 3% increase in average headcount and the impact of one additional week in the first quarter of fiscal 2021.
total compensation costs included in operating expenses decreased $22 million, or 1% during fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019, primarily due to lower incentive compensation expenses, partially offset by higher salaries, reflecting a 3% increase in average headcount.

the increase in compensation costs in fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020 reflected an increase in average headcount of 7%, with this expansion of our sales and marketing teams supporting our ability to execute on key market opportunities. compensation costs for fiscal 2021 also reflected the impact of one additional week in the first quarter.
the increase in commissions expense for fiscal 2021 is primarily due to higher performance against sales goals than in fiscal 2020. advertising and marketing promotional expense increased in fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020, primarily due to higher spending levels on certain projects. travel and entertainment spend decreased significantly due to the ongoing covid-19 pandemic.
the decrease in compensation costs in fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019 reflects a slight reduction in average headcount, while the decrease in commissions expense was primarily due to lower performance against sales goals. we incurred $3 million of non-recurring expenses in fiscal 2020, primarily due to the cancellation of a major sales event, as a direct result of the covid-19 pandemic.

the increase in compensation costs during fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020 was primarily due to higher incentive compensation expense, while average headcount was relatively consistent in each period. compensation costs for fiscal 2021 also reflected the impact of one additional week in the first quarter. the decrease in development projects and outside services was primarily due to the lower spending on certain engineering projects. the decrease in facilities and it support costs was primarily due to cost containment efforts, and lower travel and entertainment expense was due to the impact of the ongoing covid-19 pandemic.
the increase in compensation costs during fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019 was attributable to an increase in average headcount of 8%, resulting in higher salaries and benefits expense. this increase was partially offset by lower incentive compensation plan expense. the average headcount increase in fiscal 2020 reflected our investment in additional engineering resources to support the expansion and enhancement of products and solutions targeted at our most important customer and market opportunities.

the increase in compensation costs in fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020 was primarily due to higher incentive compensation expense, while average headcount was relatively consistent in each period. the decrease in professional and legal fees and outside services expense in fiscal 2021 was primarily due to lower spending on business transformation projects in the current year. the increase in facilities and it support costs was primarily due to higher spending levels on it projects. during the second quarter of fiscal 2021, we incurred a litigation settlement charge of approximately $5 million that was included in general and administrative expenses in our consolidated statements of income.
the decrease in compensation costs in fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019 was primarily attributable to lower incentive compensation plan expense and lower stock-based compensation expense. while average headcount increased in fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019, salaries and benefits expense remained relatively flat as a greater percentage of employees were located in lower cost geographies. the increase in professional and legal fees and outside services expense in fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019 was due to higher spending levels on projects and outside services. the decrease in facilities and it support costs in fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019 was primarily due to lower spending levels on it projects.

in an effort to reduce our cost structure and redirect resources to our highest return activities, in fiscal years 2021, 2020 and 2019, we initiated a number of business realignment plans designed to streamline our business and focus on key strategic opportunities, resulting in aggregate reductions of our global workforce of approximately 6% in fiscal 2021, 2% in fiscal 2020 and less than 3% in fiscal 2019, for which we recognized aggregate charges of $42 million, $21 million and $35 million, respectively, consisting primarily of employee severance costs. see note 13 - restructuring charges of the notes to consolidated financial statements for more details regarding our restructuring plans.

in april 2021, we sold certain land and buildings located in sunnyvale, california with an aggregate net book value of $210 million and received cash proceeds of $365 million, resulting in a gain, net of direct selling cost, and adjusted for below-market rent, of $156 million.
in september 2017, we entered into an agreement to sell certain land and buildings located in sunnyvale, california, through two separate and independent closings, the first of which was completed in fiscal 2018. on august 29, 2019, the second closing occurred and we consummated the sale of the land, with a net book value of $53 million, and received cash proceeds of $96 million, resulting in a gain, net of direct selling costs, of $38 million.
in february 2019, we contributed cash and other assets with a total book value of $7 million to a newly formed joint venture with lenovo in exchange for a non-controlling 49% equity interest in the new entity, lenovo netapp technology limited ("lntl"). the value of our equity interest was $80 million, resulting in a gain of $73 million in fiscal 2019.

interest expense increased during fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020, as we issued senior notes in aggregate principal amount of $2.0 billion in the first quarter of fiscal 2021. the impact from the issuance of these senior notes was partially offset by the extinguishment of our senior notes due june 2021 in the first quarter of fiscal 2021, and a lower average outstanding commercial paper balance during fiscal 2021. interest expense remained relatively flat in fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019 as we repaid our maturing senior notes, but increased our average outstanding commercial paper balance.
in fiscal 2021, other (expense) income, net includes a $6 million gain recognized on our sale of a minority equity interest in a privately held company for proceeds of approximately $8 million. this benefit was more than offset by a $14 million loss recognized from the extinguishment of our senior notes due june 2021 in the first quarter of fiscal 2021.
other (expense) income, net decreased during fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019, primarily due to a $10 million impairment of our equity method investment in lntl and the net unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rate fluctuations in fiscal 2020, partially offset by a $14 million gain we realized from the sale of approximately $1.0 billion of available-for-sale debt securities.

our effective tax rate for fiscal 2021 was 24.1% compared to an effective tax rate of 13.2% for fiscal 2020. our effective tax rate for fiscal 2021 was higher than the prior year primarily due to the impact of taxes resulting from the integration of acquired companies
and a shift in jurisdictional mix of income resulting in a lower foreign rate differential. additionally, the fiscal 2020 tax provision included a benefit of $61 million related to the lapse of statute of limitations compared to a benefit of $6 million recognized in fiscal 2021. our effective tax rate for fiscal 2019 of 7.8% was lower than fiscal 2020 as it included larger benefits related to foreign profits taxed at effective rates lower than the u.s. federal statutory rates as well as larger benefits related to stock-based compensation.

the following is a summary of our cash flow activities:
net cash provided by operating activities                                              $1,333                 $1,060
effect of exchange rate changes on cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash              71                    (34   )
as of april 30, 2021, our cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments totaled $4.6 billion, reflecting an increase of $1.7 billion from april 24, 2020. the increase was primarily due to $2.0 billion of net proceeds from the issuance of senior notes, $1.3 billion of cash provided by operating activities and $365 million proceeds from the sale of properties in sunnyvale, california, partially offset by $513 million used for the extinguishment of our senior notes due june 2021, $420 million used for the net repayment of commercial paper notes with original maturities of three months or less, $350 million used for the acquisitions of two privately-held companies, $427 million used for the payment of dividends, $162 million in purchases of property and equipment and $125 million used to repurchase shares of our common stock. working capital increased by $1.9 billion to $2.5 billion as of april 30, 2021 compared to april 24, 2020 primarily due to the increases in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments discussed above.
cash flows from operating activities during fiscal 2021, we generated cash from operating activities of $1.3 billion, reflecting net income of $730 million, adjusted by adding non-cash depreciation and amortization expense of $207 million and non-cash stock-based compensation expense of $197 million and subtracting the gain on sale or derecognition of assets of $156 million.
significant changes in assets and liabilities during fiscal 2021 included the following:
•   deferred revenue and financed unearned services revenue increased $193 million, primarily due to an increase in deferred software and hardware support contracts associated with a growing installed base as well as growth in public cloud services.
during fiscal 2020, we generated cash from operating activities of $1.1 billion, reflecting net income of $819 million, adjusted by adding non-cash depreciation and amortization expense of $193 million and non-cash stock-based compensation expense of $153 million and subtracting the gain on derecognition of assets of $38 million.
significant changes in assets and liabilities during fiscal 2020 included the following:
•   accounts payable decreased $117 million, reflecting the timing of payments to our suppliers.
•   long-term taxes payable decreased $163 million, primarily due to resolution of income tax matters and transition taxes associated with u.s. tax reform.
we expect that cash provided by operating activities may materially fluctuate in future periods due to a number of factors, including fluctuations in our operating results, shipment linearity, accounts receivable collections performance, inventory and supply chain management, vendor payment initiatives, tax benefits or charges from stock-based compensation, and the timing and amount of compensation and other payments.
cash flows from investing activities during fiscal 2021, we generated $365 million from the sale of properties located in sunnyvale, california and $160 million from maturities and sales of investments in available-for-sale debt securities, net of purchases. we paid $350 million to acquire two privately-held companies and $162 million for capital expenditures.
during fiscal 2020, we generated $1.4 billion from maturities and sales of investments in available-for-sale debt securities, net of purchases and paid $124 million for capital expenditures. additionally, we received $96 million for the sale of land in sunnyvale, california and paid $73 million to acquire two privately-held companies.
cash flows from financing activities during fiscal 2021, we received $2.0 billion from the issuance of senior notes, which was partially offset by the use of $513 million for the extinguishment of our senior notes due june 2021, $420 million for the net repayment of commercial paper notes with original maturities of three months or less, $427 million for the payment of dividends, and $125 million for the repurchase of two million shares of our common stock.
during fiscal 2020, we used $1.4 billion for the purchase of 25 million shares of our common stock, $439 million for the payment of dividends and $400 million for the repayment of our senior notes due september 2019. these purchases and payments were partially offset by $273 million in proceeds from the issuance of commercial paper notes, net and $102 million in proceeds from the issuance of common stock under employee common stock award plans.
key factors that could affect our cash flows include changes in our revenue mix and profitability, our ability to effectively manage our working capital, in particular, accounts receivable, accounts payable and inventories, the timing and amount of stock repurchases and payment of cash dividends, the impact of foreign exchange rate changes, our ability to effectively integrate acquired products, businesses and technologies, and the timing of repayments of our debt. based on past performance and our current business outlook, we believe that our sources of liquidity, including cash generated from operations, and our ability to access capital markets and committed credit lines will satisfy our working capital needs, capital expenditures, investment requirements, stock repurchases, cash dividends, contractual obligations, commitments, principal and interest payments on our debt and other liquidity requirements associated with operations and meet our cash requirements for at least the next 12 months. however, in the event our liquidity is insufficient, we may be required to curtail spending and implement additional cost saving measures and restructuring actions or enter into new financing arrangements. we cannot be certain that we will continue to generate cash flows at or above current levels or that we will be able to obtain additional financing, if necessary, on satisfactory terms, if at all. for further discussion of factors that could affect our cash flows and liquidity requirements, including the impact of the covid-19 pandemic, see item 1a. risk factors.
liquidity our principal sources of liquidity as of april 30, 2021 consisted of cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments, cash we expect to generate from operations, and our commercial paper program and related credit facility.
cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments consisted of the following (in millions):
as of april 30, 2021 and april 24, 2020, $2.5 billion of cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments were held by various foreign subsidiaries and were generally based in u.s. dollar-denominated holdings, while $2.1 billion and $0.4 billion, respectively, were available in the u.s. the tax cuts and jobs act (tcja) enacted into law in december 2017 imposed a one-time transition tax on substantially all accumulated foreign earnings through december 31, 2017, and generally allows companies to make distributions of foreign earnings without incurring additional federal taxes. as a part of the recognition of the impacts of the tcja, we reviewed our projected global cash requirements and determined that certain historical and future foreign earnings were no longer indefinitely reinvested.
our principal liquidity requirements are primarily to meet our working capital needs, support ongoing business activities, fund research and development, meet capital expenditure needs, invest in critical or complementary technologies through asset purchases and/or business acquisitions, service interest and principal payments on our debt, fund our stock repurchase program, and pay dividends, as and if declared.
the principal objectives of our investment policy are the preservation of principal and maintenance of liquidity. we attempt to mitigate default risk by investing in high-quality investment grade securities, limiting the time to maturity and monitoring the counter-parties and underlying obligors closely. we believe our cash equivalents and short-term investments are liquid and accessible. we are not aware of any significant deterioration in the fair value of our cash equivalents or investments from the values reported as of april 30, 2021.
our investment portfolio has been and will continue to be exposed to market risk due to trends in the credit and capital markets. we continue to closely monitor current economic and market events to minimize the market risk of our investment portfolio. we routinely monitor our financial exposure to both sovereign and non-sovereign borrowers and counterparties. we utilize a variety of planning and financing strategies in an effort to ensure our worldwide cash is available when and where it is needed. we also have an automatic shelf registration statement on file with the securities and exchange commission (sec). we may in the future offer an additional unspecified amount of debt, equity and other securities.
senior notes the following table summarizes the principal amount of our senior notes as of april 30, 2021 (in millions):
interest on the senior notes is payable semi-annually. for further information on the underlying terms, see note 9 - financing arrangements of the notes to consolidated financial statements.
commercial paper program and credit facility we have a commercial paper program (the program), under which we may issue unsecured commercial paper notes. amounts available under the program may be borrowed, repaid and re-borrowed, with the aggregate face or principal amount of the notes outstanding under the program at any time not to exceed $1.0 billion. the maturities of the notes can vary, but may not exceed 397 days from the date of issue. the notes are sold under customary terms in the commercial paper market and may be issued at a discount from par or, alternatively, may be sold at par and bear interest at rates dictated by market conditions at the time of their issuance. the proceeds from the issuance of the notes are used for general corporate purposes. no commercial paper notes were outstanding as of april 30, 2021.
in connection with the program, we have a senior unsecured credit agreement with a syndicated group of lenders. the credit agreement, which was amended on january 22, 2021, provides for a $1.0 billion revolving unsecured credit facility, with a sublimit of $50 million available for the issuance of letters of credit on our behalf. the credit facility matures on january 22, 2026, with an option for us to extend the maturity date for two additional 1-year periods, subject to certain conditions. the proceeds of the loans may be used by us for general corporate purposes and as liquidity support for our existing commercial paper program. as of april 30, 2021, we were compliant with all associated covenants in the agreement.  no amounts were drawn against this credit facility during any of the periods presented.
capital expenditure requirements we expect to fund our capital expenditures, including our commitments related to facilities, equipment, operating leases and internal-use software development projects over the next few years through existing cash, cash equivalents, investments and cash generated from operations. the timing and amount of our capital requirements cannot be precisely determined and will depend on a number of factors, including future demand for products, changes in the network storage industry, hiring plans and our decisions related to the financing of our facilities and equipment requirements. we anticipate capital expenditures for fiscal 2022 to be between $225 million and $250 million.
dividends and stock repurchase program on may 28, 2021, we declared a cash dividend of $0.50 per share of common stock, payable on july 28, 2021 to holders of record as of the close of business on july 9, 2021.
as of april 30, 2021, our board of directors had authorized the repurchase of up to $13.6 billion of our common stock under our stock repurchase program, and on may 28, 2021 authorized the repurchase of an additional $500 million of our common stock. under this program, we may purchase shares of our outstanding common stock through solicited or unsolicited transactions in the open market, in privately negotiated transactions, through accelerated share repurchase programs, pursuant to a rule 10b5-1 plan or in such other manner as deemed appropriate by our management. the stock repurchase program may be suspended or discontinued at any time. since the may 13, 2003 inception of this program through april 30, 2021, we repurchased a total of 340 million shares of our common stock at an average price of $39.02 per share, for an aggregate purchase price of $13.3 billion. as of april 30, 2021, the remaining authorized amount for stock repurchases under this program was $0.3 billion.
purchase commitments in the ordinary course of business, we make commitments to third-party contract manufacturers and component suppliers to manage manufacturer lead times and meet product forecasts, and to other parties, to purchase various key components used in the manufacture of our products. in addition, we have open purchase orders and contractual obligations associated with our ordinary course of business for which we have not yet received goods or services. these off-balance sheet purchase commitments totaled $800 million at april 30, 2021, of which $584 million is due in fiscal 2022, with the remainder due thereafter.
financing guarantees while most of our arrangements for sales include short-term payment terms, from time to time we provide long-term financing to creditworthy customers. we have generally sold receivables financed through these arrangements on a non-recourse basis to third party financing institutions within 10 days of the contracts' dates of execution, and we classify the proceeds from these sales as cash flows from operating activities in our consolidated statements of cash flows. we account for the sales of these receivables as "true sales" as defined in the accounting standards on transfers of financial assets, as we are considered to have surrendered control of these financing receivables. we sold $102 million and $59 million of receivables during fiscal 2021 and 2020, respectively.
in addition, we enter into arrangements with leasing companies for the sale of our hardware systems products. these leasing companies, in turn, lease our products to end-users. the leasing companies generally have no recourse to us in the event of default by the end-user.
some of the leasing arrangements described above have been financed on a recourse basis through third-party financing institutions. under the terms of recourse leases, which are generally three years or less, we remain liable for the aggregate unpaid remaining lease payments to the third-party leasing companies in the event of end-user customer default. these arrangements are generally collateralized by a security interest in the underlying assets. as of april 30, 2021 and april 24, 2020, the aggregate amount by which such contingencies exceeded the associated liabilities was not significant. to date, we have not experienced significant losses under our lease financing programs or other financing arrangements.
we have entered into service contracts with certain of our end-user customers that are supported by third-party financing arrangements. if a service contract is terminated as a result of our non-performance under the contract or our failure to comply with the terms of the financing arrangement, we could, under certain circumstances, be required to acquire certain assets related to the service contract or to pay the aggregate unpaid payments under such arrangements. as of april 30, 2021, we have not been required to make any payments under these arrangements, and we believe the likelihood of having to acquire a material amount of assets or make payments under these arrangements is remote. the portion of the financial arrangement that represents unearned services revenue is included in deferred revenue and financed unearned services revenue in our consolidated balance sheets.
legal contingencies we are subject to various legal proceedings and claims which arise in the normal course of business. see further details on such matters in note 18 - commitments and contingencies of the notes to consolidated financial statements.

item 1a.    risk factors the risks described below and in other documents we file from time to time with the securities and exchange commission could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations, cash flow, liquidity or financial condition. although the risks are organized by headings, and each risk is discussed separately, many are interrelated. readers should not interpret the disclosure of any risk factor to imply that the risk has not already materialized.
economic and strategic risks the covid-19 pandemic has adversely impacted our business, results of operations, cash flow and financial condition, and the continuing effects of the covid-19 pandemic remain highly unpredictable and could adversely impact our business, results of operations, cash flow, liquidity and financial condition in the future.
our business, results of operations, cash flow and financial condition have been, and may be in the future, adversely affected by the covid-19 pandemic, including the impacts resulting from efforts by public health and governmental authorities to contain and combat the outbreak and spread of covid-19. since the onset of the pandemic, we have made changes in our business designed to support these efforts and protect the health and well-being of our employees and customers. the changes in our business have included: temporarily reducing store hours and closing our sales floors in our company-operated paint stores to the general public; requiring our customers to order product online or via phone and to access their products via curbside pickup or delivery; implementing remote, alternate and flexible work arrangements where possible; enhancing cleaning and sanitation procedures; implementing domestic and international travel restrictions and return to work and visitor screening protocols; postponing or canceling the hosting or attending of large events; and enhancing certain employee benefits, such as telehealth, paid sick leave, family leave and voluntary leave of absence policies and programs. we continue to evaluate the changes we have made in our business, consider new and further changes, and work with public health, government and other authorities and organizations to maintain our operations and support the health and well-being of our employees, customers and their families.
the necessary and appropriate measures we have taken have resulted in additional costs, including for covid-related leave and healthcare costs, and have adversely impacted our business and financial performance. as the pandemic continues and evolves, we may incur additional costs and experience further adverse impacts to our business, each of which may be significant. we also have faced, and may continue to face, operational risks in connection with remote and hybrid in-office work arrangements, including but not limited to cybersecurity risks and increased vulnerability to damage or interruption resulting from, among other causes, cyber attacks, security breaches, phishing, malware, viruses, ransomware, power outages or system failures.
the covid-19 pandemic has severely impacted the global economy, disrupted consumer spending and global supply chains, and created significant volatility and disruption of financial markets, all of which may continue, and all of which have adversely affected, and may continue to adversely affect, our business. we have experienced occasional, temporary disruptions and closures of some of our facilities, including more recently in connection with the omicron variant and due to our employees or their family members testing positive for covid-19. we also have seen shifts in consumer behaviors and preferences, as well as impacts in the demand for some of our products. while demand levels for our products have been returning to more normalized levels, our ability to predict and meet any future changes in the demand for our products due to the impacts of the pandemic remains uncertain.
while we continue to closely monitor the impact of the pandemic on all aspects of our business, the extent of the impact on our results of operations, cash flow, liquidity, and financial performance, as well as our ability to execute near-term and long-term business strategies and initiatives, will depend on numerous evolving factors and future developments, which are highly uncertain and which we cannot predict or control, and some of which we are not currently aware, including, but not limited to: (a) the duration, severity and scope of the pandemic, including additional variants and waves of covid-19 cases; (b) rapidly-changing governmental and public health directives to contain and combat the outbreak, including with respect to covid-19 vaccination and testing requirements, and the duration, degree, effectiveness and easing, removal or reinstitution of directives; (c) the further development, availability, effectiveness and distribution of covid-19 treatments and vaccines; (d) the extent and duration of the pandemic's adverse and/or volatile effects on economic and social activity, supply chain logistics, inflationary pressures, consumer confidence, discretionary spending and preferences, labor and healthcare costs, labor markets and unemployment rates, any of which may reduce demand for some of our products, impact our ability to predict and meet any future changes in the demand for our products, or impair the ability of those with whom we do business to satisfy their obligations to us; (e) our ability to sell, provide and meet the demand for our services and products, including as a result of new, or the reinstitution of prior, directives; (f) any temporary reduction in our workforce or closures of our offices and facilities and our ability to adequately staff and maintain our operations, including as a result of employees or their family members testing positive for covid-19; (g) the ability of our customers and suppliers to continue their operations, which could affect our ability to sell, provide and meet the demand for our services and products and result in terminations of contracts, losses of revenue and adverse effects to our supply chain; and (h) any impairment in value of our tangible or intangible assets which could be recorded as a result of weaker economic conditions. if the pandemic continues to create disruptions or turmoil in the credit or financial markets or impacts our credit ratings in the future, it could adversely affect our ability to access capital on favorable terms and continue to meet our liquidity needs.
given the inherent uncertainty surrounding covid-19, the pandemic may continue to create challenging operating environments and may have an adverse impact on our business in the near term. if these conditions persist or worsen for a prolonged period, the covid-19 pandemic, including any of the above factors and others that are currently unknown, may also have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flow, liquidity, or financial condition.
adverse changes in general business and economic conditions in the united states and worldwide may adversely affect our results of operations, cash flow, liquidity or financial condition.
our business is sensitive to global and regional business and economic conditions. adverse changes in such conditions in the united states and worldwide, including due to the covid-19 pandemic, may reduce the demand for some of our products, adversely impact our ability to predict and meet any future changes in the demand for our products, and impair the ability of those with whom we do business to satisfy their obligations to us, each of which could adversely affect our results of operations, cash flow, liquidity or financial condition. higher inflation rates, interest rates, tax rates and unemployment rates, higher labor and healthcare costs, recessions, changing governmental policies, laws and regulations, business disruptions due to cybersecurity incidents, terrorist activity, armed conflict, war, public health crises (including the covid-19 pandemic), impacts of climate change, fires or other natural disasters, supply chain disruptions, and other economic factors could also adversely affect demand for some of our products, our ability to predict and meet any future changes in the demand for our products, the availability, delivery or cost of raw materials, our ability to adequately staff and maintain operations at affected facilities and our results of operations, cash flow, liquidity or financial condition and that of our customers, vendors and suppliers.
protracted duration of economic downturns in cyclical segments of the economy may depress the demand for some of our products and adversely affect our sales, earnings, cash flow or financial condition.
portions of our business involve the sale of paint, coatings and related products to segments of the economy that are cyclical in nature, particularly segments relating to construction, housing, manufacturing and oil production, refining, storage and transportation. our sales to these segments are affected by the levels of discretionary consumer and business spending in these segments. during economic downturns in these segments, the levels of consumer and business discretionary spending may decrease, and the recovery of these segments may lag behind the recovery of the overall economy. this decrease in spending likely will reduce the demand for some of our products and may adversely affect our sales, earnings, cash flow or financial condition.
although interest rates remain low by historical standards, any increase may adversely affect the demand for new residential homes, existing home turnover and new non-residential construction. a worsening in these segments will reduce the demand for some of our products and may adversely impact sales, earnings and cash flow.
in the u.s. construction and housing segments, the recent demand for new construction has caused contractors to experience a shortage of skilled workers, resulting in related project backlogs and an adverse effect on the growth rate of demand for our products. while we expect to see higher demand for our products as project backlogs are reduced in the future, this labor shortage may adversely impact our sales, earnings, cash flow or financial condition.
financial risks a weakening of global credit markets could adversely affect our results of operations, cash flow, liquidity or financial condition.
a weakening of global credit markets could adversely impact our net sales, the collection of accounts receivable, funding for working capital needs, expected cash flow generation from current and acquired businesses, access to capital and our investments, which could adversely impact our results of operations, cash flow, liquidity or financial condition.
we finance a portion of our sales through trade credit. credit markets remain tight, and some customers who require financing for their businesses have not been able to obtain, and may in the future have difficulty obtaining, necessary financing. a continuation or worsening of these conditions could limit our ability to collect our accounts receivable, which could adversely affect our results of operations, cash flow, liquidity or financial condition.
we generally fund a portion of our seasonal working capital needs and obtain funding for other general corporate purposes through short-term borrowings backed by our revolving credit facility and other financing facilities. if any of the banks in these credit and financing facilities are unable to perform on their commitments, such inability could adversely impact our cash flow, liquidity or financial condition, including our ability to obtain funding for working capital needs and other general corporate purposes.
although we have available credit facilities to fund our current operating needs, we cannot be certain we will be able to replace our existing credit facilities or refinance our existing or future debt when necessary. our cost of borrowing and ability to access the capital markets are affected not only by market conditions, but also by our debt and credit ratings assigned by the major credit rating agencies. downgrades in these ratings, including due to uncertainties regarding covid-19, likely would increase our cost of borrowing and could have an adverse effect on our access to the capital markets, including our access to the commercial paper market. an inability to access the capital markets could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flow, liquidity or financial condition.
we have goodwill and intangible assets recorded on our balance sheet. we periodically evaluate the recoverability of the carrying value of our goodwill and intangible assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate such value may not be recoverable. an impairment assessment involves judgment as to assumptions regarding future sales and cash flow and the impact of market conditions on those assumptions. future events and changing market conditions may impact our assumptions and change our estimates of future sales and cash flow, resulting in us incurring substantial impairment charges, which would adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition.
we hold investments in equity and debt securities in some of our defined benefit pension plans. a decrease in the value of plan assets resulting from a general financial downturn may cause a negative pension plan investment performance, which may adversely affect our results of operations, cash flow, liquidity or financial condition.
we require a significant amount of cash to service the substantial amount of debt we have outstanding. our ability to generate cash depends on many factors beyond our control. we also depend on the business of our subsidiaries to satisfy our cash needs. if we cannot generate the required cash, we may not be able to make the necessary payments required under our indebtedness.
at december 31, 2021, we had total debt of approximately $9.615 billion, which is an increase of $1.323 billion since december 31, 2020. we have the ability under our existing credit facilities to incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future. our ability to make payments on our debt, fund our other liquidity needs, and make planned capital expenditures will depend on our ability to generate cash in the future. our historical financial results have been, and we anticipate our future financial results will be, subject to fluctuations. our ability to generate cash, to a certain extent, is subject to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other factors beyond our control, including public health crises, such as the covid-19 pandemic, adverse weather conditions or natural disasters, such as due to the impacts of climate change, supply chain disruptions and related impacts. we cannot guarantee our business will generate sufficient cash flow from our operations or future borrowings will be available to us in an amount sufficient to enable us to make payments of our debt, fund other liquidity needs and make planned capital expenditures.
•require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to the payment of debt service, reducing the availability of our cash flow to fund working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and other long-term growth initiatives and general corporate purposes;
•increase our vulnerability to adverse economic or industry conditions;
•limit our ability to obtain additional financing in the future to enable us to react to changes in our business or economic or industry conditions; or
•place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to businesses in our industry that have less debt.
additionally, any failure to comply with covenants in the instruments governing our debt could result in an event of default which, if not cured or waived, would have a material adverse effect on us.
a significant portion of our operations are conducted through our subsidiaries. as a result, our ability to generate sufficient cash flow for our needs is dependent to some extent on the earnings of our subsidiaries and the payment of those earnings to us in the form of dividends, loans or advances and through repayment of loans or advances from us. our subsidiaries are separate and distinct legal entities. our subsidiaries have no obligation to pay any amounts due on our debt or to provide us with funds to meet our cash flow needs, whether in the form of dividends, distributions, loans or other payments. further, any payment of dividends, loans or advances by our subsidiaries could be subject to statutory or contractual restrictions. payments to us by our subsidiaries will also be contingent upon our subsidiaries' earnings and business considerations. our right to receive any assets of any of our subsidiaries upon their liquidation or reorganization will be effectively subordinated to the claims of that subsidiary's creditors, including trade creditors. even if we are a creditor of any of our subsidiaries, our rights as a creditor would be subordinate to any security interest in the assets of our subsidiaries and any indebtedness of our subsidiaries senior to that held by us. finally, changes in the laws of foreign jurisdictions in which we operate may adversely affect the ability of some of our foreign subsidiaries to repatriate funds to us.
fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could adversely affect our results of operations, cash flow, liquidity or financial condition.
because of our international operations, we are exposed to risk associated with interest rates and value changes in foreign currencies, which may adversely affect our business. historically, our reported net sales, earnings, cash flow and financial condition have been subjected to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates. our primary exchange rate exposure is with the euro, the chinese yuan, the canadian dollar, the brazilian real, the british pound, and the mexican peso, each against the u.s. dollar. while we actively manage the exposure of our foreign currency risk as part of our overall financial risk management policy, we believe we may experience losses from foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, and such losses could adversely affect our sales, earnings, cash flow, liquidity or financial condition.
operational risks adverse weather conditions and natural disasters, including due to the impacts of climate change, may temporarily reduce the demand for some of our products, impact our ability to meet the demand for our products or cause supply chain disruptions and increased costs, and could have a negative effect on our sales, earnings or cash flow.
our business is seasonal in nature, with the second and third quarters typically generating a higher proportion of sales and earnings than other quarters. from time to time, adverse weather conditions and natural disasters, including due to the impacts of climate change, have had or may have an adverse effect on our sales, manufacture and distribution of paint, coatings and related products. in the event adverse weather conditions or a natural disaster cause significant damage to any one or more of our principal manufacturing or distribution facilities, we may not be able to manufacture the products needed to meet customer demand, which could have an adverse effect on our sales of certain paint, coatings and related products.
the impact of these risks to our suppliers also have had or may have an adverse effect on our sales, manufacture and distribution of certain of our products. during 2021, winter storm uri and hurricane ida caused significant damage to certain of our suppliers' facilities in texas and louisiana, respectively. these natural disasters and their impacts to certain of our suppliers resulted in unprecedented industry-wide supply chain disruptions, increased raw material and other costs, and significantly hindered our ability to manufacture the products needed to fully meet customer demand. we discuss these natural disasters and their adverse impact to our business in more detail in the "outlook" section in item 7.
in any of these instances, an adverse effect on sales may cause a reduction in our earnings or cash flow.
unexpected shortages and increases in the cost of raw materials and energy may adversely affect our earnings or cash flow.
we purchase raw materials (including titanium dioxide and petrochemical feedstock sources, such as propylene and ethylene) and energy for use in the manufacturing, distribution and sale of our products. factors such as political instability, higher tariffs, supply chain disruptions, adverse weather conditions and natural disasters (including hurricanes and severe winter or other storms due to the impacts of climate change) or public health crises (including the covid-19 pandemic) could disrupt the availability of raw material and fuel supplies, adversely impact our ability to meet customer demands for some of our products or adequately staff and maintain operations at affected facilities and increase our costs. in addition, environmental and social regulations, including regulations related to climate change, may negatively impact us or our suppliers in terms of availability and cost of raw materials, as well as sources and supply of energy. although raw materials and energy supplies (including oil and natural gas) are generally available from various sources in sufficient quantities, unexpected shortages and increases in the cost of raw materials and energy, or any deterioration in our relationships with or the financial viability of our suppliers, may have an adverse effect on our earnings or cash flow. in the event we experience supply chain disruptions from our suppliers, we may not be able to timely secure alternate sources in order to prevent significant impacts to our business, or we may experience quality issues with raw materials and energy sourced from alternate sources. if the cost of raw materials and energy increases, we may not be able to offset higher costs in a timely manner by sufficiently decreasing our operating costs or raising the prices of our products. in recent years, some raw material and energy prices have increased, particularly titanium dioxide and petrochemical feedstock sources, such as propylene and ethylene, as well as metal and plastic packaging.
the cost of raw materials and energy could continue to experience periods of volatility in the future and may adversely affect our earnings and cash flow.
although we have an extensive customer base, the loss of any of our largest customers could adversely affect our sales, earnings or cash flow.
we have a large and varied customer base due to our extensive distribution platform. during 2021, no individual customer accounted for sales totaling more than ten percent of our sales. however, we have some customers that, individually, purchase a large amount of products from us. although our broad distribution channels help to minimize the impact of the loss of any one customer, the loss of any of these large customers could have an adverse effect on our sales, earnings or cash flow.
increased competition or failure to keep pace with developments in key competitive areas of our business may reduce our sales, earnings or cash flow performance.
we face substantial competition from many international, national, regional and local competitors of various sizes in the manufacture, distribution and sale of our paint, coatings and related products. some of our competitors operate more extensively in certain regions around the world and have greater financial or operational resources to compete internationally. other competitors are smaller and may be able to offer more specialized products. technology, product quality, product innovation, breadth of product line, technical expertise, distribution, service and price are key competitive factors for our business. competition in any of these areas, or failure to keep pace with developments in any of these areas, may reduce our sales and adversely affect our earnings or cash flow by resulting in decreased sales volumes, reduced prices and increased costs of manufacturing, distributing and selling our products.
our results of operations, cash flow or financial condition may be negatively impacted if we do not successfully integrate future acquisitions into our existing operations and if the performance of the businesses we acquire do not meet our expectations.
we have historically made strategic acquisitions of businesses in the paint and coatings industry and likely will acquire additional businesses in the future as part of our long-term growth strategy. the success of future acquisitions depends in large part on our ability to integrate the operations and personnel of the acquired companies and manage challenges that may arise as a result of the acquisitions, particularly when the acquired businesses operate in new or foreign markets. in the event we do not successfully integrate such future acquisitions into our existing operations so as to realize the expected return on our investment, our results of operations, cash flow or financial condition could be adversely affected.
risks and uncertainties associated with our expansion into and our operations in asia, europe, south america and other foreign markets could adversely affect our results of operations, cash flow, liquidity or financial condition.
net external sales of our consolidated foreign subsidiaries totaled approximately 21.2%, 19.5% and 20.6% of our total consolidated net sales in 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. sales outside of the united states make up a significant part of our current business and future strategic plans. our results of operations, cash flow, liquidity or financial condition could be adversely affected by a variety of domestic and international factors, including general economic conditions, political instability, inflation rates, recessions, tariffs, foreign currency exchange rates, foreign currency exchange controls, interest rates, foreign investment and repatriation restrictions, legal and regulatory constraints, civil unrest, difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations and other external economic and political factors. in addition, public health crises (including the covid-19 pandemic) in foreign jurisdictions may temporarily reduce the demand for some of our products and adversely affect the availability and cost of raw materials. our inability to successfully manage the risks and uncertainties relating to any of these factors could adversely affect our results of operations, cash flow, liquidity or financial condition.
in many foreign countries, it is not uncommon to engage in certain business practices we are prohibited from engaging in because of regulations applicable to us, such as the foreign corrupt practices act and the uk bribery act. recent years have seen a substantial increase in anti-bribery law enforcement activity, with more frequent and aggressive investigations and enforcement proceedings by both u.s. and non-u.s. regulators, and an increase in criminal and civil proceedings brought against companies and individuals. although we have internal control policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with these regulations, there can be no assurance our policies and procedures will prevent a violation of these regulations. any violation could cause an adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flow or financial condition.
policy changes affecting international trade could adversely impact the demand for our products and our competitive position.
due to the international scope of our operations, changes in government policies on foreign trade and investment may affect the demand for our products and services, impact the competitive position of our products or prevent us from being able to sell products in certain countries. our business benefits from free trade agreements, which may include the united states-mexico-canada agreement, and efforts to withdraw from, or substantially modify such agreements, in addition to the implementation of more restrictive trade policies, such as more detailed inspections, higher tariffs, import or export licensing requirements, exchange controls or new barriers to entry, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition or cash flow and that of our customers, vendors and suppliers.
additionally, the results of the united kingdom's referendum on european union membership, which resulted in the united kingdom's exit from the european union on january 31, 2020 ("brexit"), caused significant volatility in global stock markets, currency exchange rate fluctuations and global economic uncertainty. the transition period post-brexit expired on december 31, 2020, and the united kingdom and european union entered into a free trade agreement that now governs the united kingdom's relationship with the european union. while the united kingdom and european union generally have continued to trade with each other without the imposition of tariffs for imports and exports, trades have been subject to new customs requirements that require additional documentation and data and new controls on the movement and reporting of goods (including chemicals). although we have not experienced any material disruption in our business as a result of brexit to date, we do not know the extent to which brexit and the free trade agreement will ultimately impact the business and regulatory environment in the united kingdom, the rest of the european union or other countries, although it is possible there will be tighter controls and administrative requirements for imports and exports between the united kingdom and the european union or other countries, as well as increased regulatory complexities, as the transition continues. any of these factors could adversely impact customer demand, our relationships with customers and suppliers and our results of operations.
cybersecurity incidents and other disruptions to our information technology systems could interfere with our operations, result in the compromise or loss of critical and confidential information and severely harm our business.
we rely on information technology systems to conduct our business, including recording and processing transactions, manufacturing and selling our products, researching and developing new products, maintaining and growing our competitive position, and supporting and communicating with our employees, customers, suppliers and other vendors. these information technology systems are important to many business-critical processes including, but not limited to, production planning, manufacturing, finance, company operations, sales and customer service. some of these systems are maintained or operated by third-party providers. despite our efforts to prevent disruptions to these information technology systems, these systems may be affected by damage or interruption resulting from, among other causes, cyber attacks, security breaches, phishing, malware, viruses, ransomware, power outages or system failures. these risks could be magnified due to the increased reliance on information technology systems to conduct our business, including those used in furtherance of remote and hybrid in-office work environments. disruptions to these systems may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.
as part of our business, we collect and handle sensitive and confidential information about our business, customers, employees and suppliers. despite the security measures we have in place, our facilities and systems, and those third parties with which we do business, may be vulnerable to cyber attacks, security breaches, malware, viruses, ransomware, power outages, system failures, acts of vandalism or misconduct, human or technical errors or other similar events or disruptions. any such event involving the misappropriation, loss or other unauthorized disclosure of information, whether impacting us or third parties with which we do business, could result in losses, damage our reputation or relationships with customers and suppliers, expose us to the risks of litigation, regulatory action and liability, disrupt our operations and have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. we continue to mitigate these risks in a number of ways, including through additional investment, engagement of third-party experts and consultants, improving the security of our facilities and systems, providing annual training for all employees (with more enhanced or frequent training based on role), assessing the continued appropriateness of relevant insurance coverage and strengthening our controls to monitor and mitigate these threats.
the domestic and international regulatory environment related to information security, collection and privacy is increasingly rigorous and complex, with new and rapidly changing requirements applicable to our business. compliance with these requirements, including the european union's general data protection regulation, the california consumer privacy act and other international and domestic regulations, could result in additional costs and changes to our business practices.
our ability to attract, retain, develop and progress a qualified workforce could adversely impact our business and impair our ability to meet our strategic objectives and the needs of our customers.
our continued success depends in part on our ability to identify, attract and onboard qualified candidates with the requisite education, background, skills and experience and our ability to retain, develop, progress and engage qualified employees across our business, including our stores, fleet, manufacturing, corporate and other operations and functions. competition for talent is intense, and we are facing increased wage rates and labor shortages due to a tightened labor market and other macroeconomic conditions that have been exacerbated by the covid-19 pandemic. to the extent we are unable to remain competitive with our compensation and benefits, talent management strategy, inclusive workplace culture and related initiatives, programs and practices, or if qualified candidates or employees become more difficult to attract or retain under reasonable terms, we may experience higher labor-related costs and may be unable to attract, retain, develop and progress a qualified workforce, which could adversely affect our business and future success and impair our ability to meet our strategic objectives and the needs of our customers.
inability to protect or enforce our material trademarks and other intellectual property rights could have an adverse effect on our business.
we have numerous patents, trade secrets, trademarks, trade names and know-how that are valuable to our business. despite our efforts to protect such intellectual property and other proprietary information from unauthorized use or disclosure, third parties may attempt to disclose, obtain or use our trademarks or such other intellectual property and information without our authorization. although we rely on the patent, trademark, trade secret and copyright laws of the united states and other countries to protect our intellectual property rights, the laws of some countries may not protect such rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states. unauthorized use of our intellectual property by third parties, the failure of foreign countries to have laws to protect our intellectual property rights, or an inability to effectively enforce such rights in foreign countries could have an adverse effect on our business.
legal and regulatory risks we are subject to a wide variety of complex domestic and foreign laws, rules and regulations, for which compliance could adversely affect our results of operations, cash flow or financial condition.
we are subject to a wide variety of complex domestic and foreign laws, rules and regulations, and legal compliance risks, including securities laws, tax laws, employment and pension-related laws, competition laws, u.s. and foreign export and trading laws, data privacy and security laws, and laws governing improper business practices. we are affected by new laws and regulations, and changes to existing laws and regulations, including interpretations by courts and regulators. from time to time, our company, our operations and the industries in which we operate may be reviewed or investigated by regulators, which could lead to enforcement actions or the assertion of private litigation claims and damages.
although we believe we have adopted appropriate risk management and compliance programs to mitigate these risks, the global and diverse nature of our operations means compliance risks will continue to exist. investigations, examinations and other proceedings, the nature and outcome of which cannot be predicted, likely will arise from time to time. these investigations, examinations and other proceedings could subject us to significant liability and require us to take significant accruals or pay significant settlements, fines and penalties, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flow or financial condition.
we are subject to tax laws and regulations in the united states and multiple foreign jurisdictions. we are affected by changes in tax laws and regulations, as well as changes in related interpretations and other tax guidance. in the ordinary course of our business, we are subject to examinations and investigations by various tax authorities and other regulators. in addition to existing examinations and investigations, there could be additional examinations and investigations in the future, and existing examinations and investigations could be expanded.
for non-income tax risks, we estimate material loss contingencies and accrue for such loss contingencies as required by u.s. generally accepted accounting principles based on our assessment of contingencies where liability is deemed probable and reasonably estimable in light of the facts and circumstances known to us at a particular point in time. subsequent developments may affect our assessment and estimates of the loss contingency. in the event the loss contingency is ultimately determined to be significantly higher than currently accrued, the recording of the additional liability may result in a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition for the annual or interim period during which such additional liability is accrued. in those cases where no accrual is recorded because it is not probable a liability has been incurred and cannot be reasonably estimated, any potential liability ultimately determined to be attributable to us may result in a material adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flow or financial condition for the annual or interim period during which such liability is accrued or paid. for income tax risks, we recognize tax benefits based on our assessment that a tax benefit has a greater than 50% likelihood of being sustained upon ultimate settlement with the applicable taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant facts. for those income tax positions where we determine there is not a greater than 50% likelihood such tax benefits will be sustained, we do not recognize a tax benefit in our financial statements. subsequent events may cause us to change our assessment of the likelihood of sustaining a previously-recognized benefit which could result in a material adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flow or financial position for the annual or interim period during which such liability is accrued or paid.
we discuss risks and uncertainties with regard to taxes in more detail in note 19 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8.
we are required to comply with, and may become subject to additional, numerous complex and increasingly stringent domestic and foreign health, safety and environmental (including related to climate change) laws, regulations and requirements, the cost of which is likely to increase and may adversely affect our results of operations, cash flow or financial condition.
our operations are subject to various domestic and foreign health, safety and environmental laws, regulations and requirements, including those related to chemicals, climate change and the covid-19 pandemic. these laws, regulations and requirements not only govern our current operations and products, but also impose potential liability on us for our past operations.
increased global focus on climate change may result in the imposition of new or additional regulations or requirements applicable to, and increased financial risks for, our business and industry. a number of government authorities and agencies have introduced or are contemplating regulatory changes to address climate change, including the regulation of greenhouse gas emissions. the outcome of new legislation or regulation in the u.s. and other jurisdictions in which we operate may result in new or additional requirements, including to fund energy efficiency activities or renewable energy use, and fees or restrictions on certain activities or materials. compliance with these climate change initiatives may also result in additional costs to us, including, among other things, increased production costs, additional taxes, additional investments in renewable energy use and other initiatives, reduced emission allowances or additional restrictions on production or operations. we may not be able to timely recover the cost of compliance with such new or more stringent laws and regulations, which could adversely affect our results of operations, cash flow or financial condition.
we expect health, safety and additional environmental laws, regulations and requirements to be increasingly stringent upon our industry and us in the future. our costs to comply with these laws, regulations and requirements may increase as they become more stringent in the future, and these increased costs may adversely affect our results of operations, cash flow or financial condition.
we are involved with environmental investigation and remediation activities at some of our currently- and formerly-owned sites, as well as a number of third-party sites, for which our ultimate liability may exceed the current amount we have accrued.
we are involved with environmental investigation and remediation activities at some of our currently- and formerly-owned sites and a number of third-party sites. we accrue for estimated costs of investigation and remediation activities at these sites for which commitments or clean-up plans have been developed and when such costs can be reasonably estimated based on industry standards and professional judgment. these estimated costs are based on currently available facts regarding each site. we continuously assess our potential liability for investigation and remediation activities and adjust our environmental-related accruals as information becomes available upon which more accurate costs can be reasonably estimated. due to the uncertainties surrounding environmental investigation and remediation activities, our liability may result in costs that are significantly higher than currently accrued and may have an adverse effect on our earnings. we discuss these risks and uncertainties in more detail in the "environmental-related liabilities" and "environmental matters" sections in item 7 and in note 9 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8.
the nature, cost, quantity and outcome of pending and future litigation, such as litigation arising from the historical manufacture and sale of lead pigments and lead-based paint, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flow, liquidity and financial condition.
in the course of our business, we are subject to a variety of claims and lawsuits, including, but not limited to, litigation relating to product liability and warranty, personal injury, environmental (including natural resource damages), intellectual property, commercial, contractual and antitrust claims that are inherently subject to many uncertainties regarding the possibility of a loss to us. these uncertainties will ultimately be resolved when one or more future events occur or fail to occur confirming the incurrence of a liability or the reduction of a liability. in accordance with the contingencies topic of the asc, we accrue for these contingencies by a charge to income when it is both probable that one or more future events will occur confirming the fact of a loss and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. in the event a loss contingency is ultimately determined to be significantly higher than currently accrued, the recording of the additional liability may result in a material impact on our results of operations, liquidity or financial condition for the annual or interim period during which such additional liability is accrued. in those cases where no accrual is recorded because it is not probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of any such loss cannot be reasonably estimated, any potential liability ultimately determined to be attributable to us may result in a material impact on our results of operations, liquidity or financial condition for the annual or interim period during which such liability is accrued.
our past operations included the manufacture and sale of lead pigments and lead-based paints. along with other companies, we are and have been a defendant in a number of legal proceedings, including individual personal injury actions, purported class actions and actions brought by various counties, cities, school districts and other government-related entities, arising from the manufacture and sale of lead pigments and lead-based paints. the plaintiffs' claims have been based upon various legal theories, including negligence, strict liability, breach of warranty, negligent misrepresentations and omissions, fraudulent misrepresentations and omissions, concert of action, civil conspiracy, violations of unfair trade practice and consumer protection laws, enterprise liability, market share liability, public nuisance, unjust enrichment and other theories. the plaintiffs seek various damages and relief, including personal injury and property damage, costs relating to the detection and abatement of lead-based paint from buildings, costs associated with a public education campaign, medical monitoring costs and others. we have also been a defendant in legal proceedings arising from the manufacture and sale of non-lead-based paints that seek recovery based upon various legal theories, including the failure to adequately warn of potential exposure to lead during surface preparation when using non-lead-based paint on surfaces previously painted with lead-based paint. we believe the litigation brought to date is without merit or subject to meritorious defenses and are vigorously defending such litigation. we expect additional lead pigment and lead-based paint litigation may be filed against us in the future asserting similar or different legal theories and seeking similar or different types of damages and relief. the company will continue to vigorously defend against any additional lead pigment and lead-based paint litigation that may be filed, including utilizing all avenues of appeal, if necessary.
notwithstanding our views on the merits, litigation is inherently subject to many uncertainties, and we ultimately may not prevail. adverse court rulings or determinations of liability, among other factors, could affect the lead pigment and lead-based paint litigation against us and encourage an increase in the number and nature of future claims and proceedings. from time to time, various legislation and administrative regulations have been enacted, promulgated or proposed to impose obligations on present and former manufacturers of lead pigments and lead-based paints respecting asserted health concerns associated with such products or to overturn the effect of court decisions in which we and other manufacturers have been successful.
due to the uncertainties involved, management is unable to predict the outcome of the lead pigment and lead-based paint litigation, the number or nature of possible future claims and proceedings, or the effect any legislation and/or administrative regulations may have on the litigation or against us. further, management cannot reasonably determine the scope or amount of the potential costs and liabilities related to such litigation, or resulting from any such legislation and regulations. except with respect to the california public nuisance litigation, we have not accrued any amounts for such litigation because we do not believe it is probable that a loss has occurred, and we believe it is not possible to estimate the range of potential losses as there is no substantive information upon which an estimate could be based. in addition, any potential liability that may result from any changes to legislation and regulations cannot reasonably be estimated. due to the uncertainties associated with the amount of any such liability and/or the nature of any other remedy which may be imposed in such litigation, any potential liability determined to be attributable to us arising out of such litigation may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flow, liquidity or financial condition. we discuss the risks and uncertainties related to litigation, including the lead pigment and lead-based paint litigation, in more detail in note 10 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8.
item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations
company background the sherwin-williams company, founded in 1866, and its consolidated wholly owned subsidiaries (collectively, the company) are engaged in the development, manufacture, distribution and sale of paint, coatings and related products to professional, industrial, commercial and retail customers primarily in north and south america with additional operations in the caribbean region and throughout europe, asia and australia.
the company is structured into three reportable segments - the americas group, consumer brands group and performance coatings group (collectively, the reportable segments) - and an administrative segment in the same way it is internally organized for assessing performance and making decisions regarding allocation of resources. see note 21 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 for additional information on the company's reportable segments.
◦raw material availability issues negatively impacted full year sales by a mid-single digit percentage
•completed a three-for-one stock split to improve accessibility to a broader base of investors
•finalized the divestiture of our wattyl business in australia and new zealand
•continued to invest in acquisitions expanding our product offerings and manufacturing capacity outlook the company navigated many uncertainties during 2021, including unprecedented raw material inflation, industry-wide supply chain disruptions, as well as temporary changes in the demand for our products due to the impacts of the covid-19 pandemic earlier in the year and the omicron variant later in the year. despite the uncertainties, our businesses continue to be well-positioned, and we have confidence in our long-term outlook.
the covid-19 pandemic continues to evolve and disrupt normal activities in many segments of the global economy. we continue to work with government and health authorities to operate our business, including our company-operated stores, manufacturing plants and other facilities. we also continue to follow recommended actions of government authorities and health officials in order to protect the health and well-being of our employees, customers and their families worldwide.
as we look to 2022, we are encouraged by the demand environment, which remains robust across our end markets. our customers remain positive, and we expect that jobs delayed by raw material availability issues in 2021 will be completed in the quarters ahead rather than cancelled. we brought on 50 million gallons of incremental architectural paint production capacity in 2021 to meet this demand and will continue to add paint stores in 2022. we expect raw material availability to continue improving. we are implementing additional price increases to offset to the sustained cost inflation and expect raw material costs will ultimately moderate, enabling the recovery of our margins over time.
we intend to remain disciplined in our capital allocation approach, focused on driving value for our customers and returns for our shareholders. capital expenditures, excluding our new global headquarters, will remain modest at approximately 2 percent of sales and we will continue to pursue acquisitions that fit our strategy. we expect to use any excess cash to make open market purchases of company stock. our balance sheet remains strong, and we expect debt to ebitda to approach the high end of our target of 2.0 to 2.5 times range.
please see item 1a "risk factors" in part i of this annual report on form 10-k for further information regarding the current and potential impact of the covid-19 pandemic and the potential impact of supply chain disruptions and raw material inflation on the company.

results of operations the following discussion and analysis addresses comparisons of material changes in the consolidated financial statements for the years ended december 31, 2021 and 2020. for comparisons of the years ended december 31, 2020 and 2019, see management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in part ii, item 7 of the company's annual report on form 10-k for the fiscal year ended december 31, 2020 filed on february 19, 2021.
2021                                                                      2020                       $ change                     % change net sales:
performance coatings group           6,003.8                       4,922.4                       1,081.4                         22.0    %
consolidated net sales for 2021 increased due primarily to selling price increases in all reportable segments and higher product sales volume in the performance coatings group, partially offset by lower sales volume in the consumer brands group. currency translation rate changes increased 2021 consolidated net sales by 0.8%. net sales of all consolidated foreign subsidiaries increased 17.9% to $4.223 billion for 2021 versus $3.581 billion for 2020 due primarily to returning demand in most industrial end markets globally. net sales of all operations other than consolidated foreign subsidiaries increased 6.4% to $15.722 billion for 2021 versus $14.781 billion for 2020.
net sales in the americas group increased due primarily to selling price increases in all end markets, while sales volume remained flat as a result of raw material availability challenges. net sales from stores in u.s. and canada open for more than twelve calendar months increased 6.0% in the year over last year's comparable period. currency translation rate changes reduced net sales by 0.1% compared to 2020. during 2021, the americas group opened 92 new stores and closed 7 redundant locations for a net increase of 85 stores, with a net increase of 73 new stores in the u.s. and canada. the total number of stores in operation at december 31, 2021 was 4,859 in the united states, canada, latin america and the caribbean. the americas group's objective is to expand its store base an average of 2% each year, primarily through organic growth. sales of products other than paint increased approximately 12.5% over last year. a discussion of changes in volume versus pricing for sales of products other than paint is not pertinent due to the wide assortment of general merchandise sold.
net sales of the consumer brands group decreased in 2021 primarily due to lower volume sales to most of the group's retail customers as diy demand returned to more normal levels, raw material availability issues, and the wattyl divestiture, partially offset by selling price increases. in 2022, the consumer brands group is focused on meeting customer needs through product development, building inventory, and optimizing the product assortment at existing customers.
the performance coatings group's net sales in 2021 increased due primarily to higher sales volumes in most end markets and selling price increases. currency translation rate changes increased net sales 2.2% compared to 2020. at december 31, 2021, the performance coatings group had 282 branches open in the united states, canada, mexico, south america, europe and asia. in 2022, the performance coatings group plans to continue expanding its worldwide presence, including improving its customer base and product offering.
net sales in the administrative segment, which primarily consists of external leasing revenue of excess headquarters space and leasing of facilities no longer used by the company in its primary business, decreased by an insignificant amount in 2021.
income before income taxes the following table presents the components of income before income taxes as a percentage of net sales:

consolidated cost of goods sold increased $1.723 billion, or 17.8% in 2021 compared to the same period in 2020 primarily due to higher raw material costs (including titanium dioxide and petrochemical feedstock sources) and unfavorable currency translation rate changes, partially offset by lower sales volumes primarily as a result of raw material availability issues during the second half of 2021. currency translation rate changes increased cost of goods sold by 1.1% in the current year.
consolidated gross profit decreased $139.9 million in 2021 compared to the same period in 2020. consolidated gross profit as a percent to consolidated net sales decreased to 42.8% in 2021 from 47.3% in 2020. consolidated gross profit dollars decreased primarily due to higher raw material costs in each reportable segment and lower sales volume in the consumer brands group, partially offset by selling price increases in each reportable segment as well as higher sales volume in the performance coatings group and the americas group. the gross margin rate decreased primarily as a result of higher raw material costs in each reportable segment.
the americas group's gross profit for 2021 increased $134.7 million compared to the same period in 2020. the americas group's gross profit dollars increased primarily as a result of selling price increases, partially offset by higher raw material costs. the america's group gross margin rate decreased primarily due to higher raw material costs. the consumer brands group's gross profit decreased $327.8 million in 2021 compared to the same period in 2020. the consumer brands group's gross profit dollars and margin rate decreased primarily as a result of lower sales volume, the wattyl divestiture, higher raw material costs and supply chain inefficiencies. the performance coatings group's gross profit for 2021 increased $58.6 million compared to the same period in 2020. the performance coatings group's gross profit dollars increased due to higher sales and favorable currency translation rate changes, partially offset by higher raw material costs. the performance coatings group's gross margin rate decreased primarily due to higher raw material costs, partially offset by higher sales volumes and selling price increases.
consolidated sg&a increased by $94.6 million due primarily to increased expenses to support higher sales levels and net new store openings, partially offset by good cost control. as a percent of net sales, sg&a decreased 190 basis points compared to the same period in 2020 as a result of good cost control, partially offset by increased spending from new store openings and costs to support higher sales levels.
the americas group's sg&a increased $196.3 million for the year due primarily to increased spending from new store openings and costs to support higher sales levels, including the hiring of additional sales representatives. the consumer brands group's sg&a decreased by $104.9 million for the year primarily due to good sales and marketing cost control in line with a return to more normal diy sales levels. the performance coatings group's sg&a increased by $75.4 million for the year primarily to support higher sales levels and unfavorable currency translation rate changes, partially offset by good cost control. the administrative segment's sg&a decreased $72.2 million primarily due to lower compensation, including incentive compensation.
other general expense - net increased $74.1 million in 2021 compared to 2020. the increase was primarily attributable to the recognition of a $111.9 million loss on the wattyl divestiture in march 2021, partially offset by a $41.1 million decrease in provisions for environmental matters in the administrative segment. see notes 3, 9 and 18 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 for additional information concerning the wattyl divestiture, environmental matters and other general expense - net, respectively.
for information on the amortization of acquired intangible assets and related impairment considerations, see note 5 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8.
interest expense decreased $5.7 million in 2021 primarily due to lower expense associated with short-term borrowings. see note 6 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 for additional information on the company's outstanding debt.
other (income) expense - net improved $24.8 million in 2021 compared to 2020 primarily due to the $21.3 million loss recognized upon extinguishment of debt in 2020 in the administrative segment. see notes 6 and 18 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 for additional information related to debt and other (income) expense - net, respectively.
the following table presents income before income taxes by segment and as a percentage of net sales by segment:
2021                                                                                     2020               $ change                             % change income before income taxes:

nm - not meaningful income tax expense the effective income tax rate for 2021 was 17.1% compared to 19.4% in 2020. the decrease in the effective rate was primarily due to an increase in tax benefits related to employee share-based payments and the net favorable impact of various other tax benefits received by the company in the current year. see note 19 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 for additional information.
net income per share diluted net income per share for 2021 decreased to $6.98 per share from $7.36 per share for 2020. diluted net income per share in 2021 included acquisition-related amortization expense of $0.83 per share and a $0.34 per share loss from the wattyl divestiture. see note 3 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 for additional information regarding the wattyl divestiture. currency translation rate changes decreased diluted net income per share in the year by $0.05 per share.
diluted net income per share in 2020 included acquisition-related amortization expense of $0.83 per share.
financial condition, liquidity and cash flow overview the company's financial condition, liquidity and cash flow continued to be strong in 2021. the company generated $2.245 billion in net operating cash despite ongoing and industry-wide raw material availability issues which negatively impacted total sales and gross margins. the net operating cash generation was primarily attributable to operating results as consolidated income before income taxes was $2.249 billion or 11.3% of net sales. the strong cash generation, along with an increase in our short-term borrowings and long-term debt, allowed the company to invest $372.0 million in capital expenditures and return $3.339 billion to shareholders in the form of cash dividends and share buybacks during the year.
during 2021, the company generated ebitda of $3.156 billion and adjusted ebitda of $3.268 billion. see the non-gaap financial measures section in item 7 for definition and calculation of ebitda and adjusted ebitda. as of december 31, 2021, the company had cash and cash equivalents of $165.7 million and total debt outstanding of $9.615 billion. total debt, net of cash and cash equivalents, was $9.449 billion and was 2.9 times the company's adjusted ebitda in 2021.
net working capital net working capital, defined as total current assets less total current liabilities, decreased $662.8 million to a deficit of $665.8 million at december 31, 2021 from a deficit of $3.0 million at december 31, 2020. the net working capital decrease is due to an increase in current liabilities, partially offset by an increase in current assets.
current liability balances increased $1.125 billion at december 31, 2021 compared to december 31, 2020 primarily due to a $763.4 million increase in short-term borrowings and $235.5 million increase in the current portion of long-term debt. excluding short-term borrowings and the current portion of long-term debt, current liabilities increased $126.2 million primarily due to the timing of payments related to accounts payable, partially offset by lower accruals, including compensation.
as a result of the net effect of these changes, the company's current ratio decreased to 0.88 at december 31, 2021 from 1.00 at december 31, 2020. accounts receivable as a percent of net sales increased to 11.8% in 2021 from 11.3% in 2020. accounts receivable days outstanding remained unchanged at 57 days in 2021. in 2021, provisions for allowance for doubtful collection of accounts decreased $4.6 million, or 8.6%. inventories as a percent of net sales decreased to 9.7% in 2021 from 9.8% in 2020. inventory days outstanding was 75 days in 2021 compared to 74 days in 2020. the company has sufficient total available borrowing capacity to fund its current operating needs.
property, plant and equipment net property, plant and equipment increased $32.8 million to $1.867 billion at december 31, 2021 due primarily to capital expenditures of $372.0 million, assets acquired through business combinations of $33.5 million, partially offset by depreciation expense of $263.1 million, sale or disposition of assets with remaining net book value of $53.1 million, and other adjustments of $56.5 million, which includes government incentives associated with the construction of our new global headquarters (new headquarters) in downtown cleveland, ohio and new research and development (r&d) center in the cleveland suburb of brecksville and currency translation.
capital expenditures during 2021 in the americas group were primarily attributable to the opening of new paint stores and renovation and improvements in existing stores. in the consumer brands group and the performance coatings group, capital expenditures during 2021 were primarily attributable to operational efficiencies, capacity, health and safety at sites currently in operation. the administrative segment incurred capital expenditures primarily related to construction activities associated with the new headquarters and new r&d center. the company has committed to spend a minimum of $600 million of capital expenditures to build both the new headquarters and r&d center. construction on the new headquarters and r&d center is expected to continue in 2022, with completion in 2024 at the earliest. the company has not made any decisions regarding the disposition of the company's current cleveland-area headquarters and r&d centers, which are all owned by the company.
in 2022, the company expects to spend more than 2021 for capital expenditures. the predominant share of the capital expenditures in 2022 is expected to be for various productivity improvement and maintenance projects at existing manufacturing, distribution and research and development facilities, new store openings, new or upgraded information systems hardware and the new headquarters and r&d center in ohio. the company does not anticipate the need for any specific long-term external financing to support these capital expenditures.
goodwill and intangible assets goodwill, which represents the excess of cost over the fair value of net assets acquired in purchase business combinations, increased $85.5 million in 2021 primarily due to incremental goodwill recognized in 2021 acquisitions of $155.6 million, partially offset by foreign currency translation rate fluctuations and the wattyl divestiture.
intangible assets decreased $469.7 million in 2021 primarily due to amortization of finite-lived intangible assets of $309.5 million, dispositions of $148.5 million primarily related to wattyl divestiture, and foreign currency translation rate fluctuations of $37.2 million, partially offset by finite-lived intangible assets recognized in 2021 through acquisitions of $25.5 million.
see note 3 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 for additional information related to acquisitions and divestitures. see note 5 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 for a description of goodwill, identifiable intangible assets and asset impairments recognized in accordance with the goodwill and other intangibles topic of the asc and summaries of the remaining carrying values of goodwill and intangible assets.
other assets other assets increased $94.7 million to $789.0 million at december 31, 2021. the increase was primarily due to incremental deposits and investments (including an increase in deferred pension assets), partially offset by the sale of investments to fund the company's domestic defined contribution plan. see note 7 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 for additional information related to the domestic defined contribution plan.
total debt including short-term borrowings increased by $1.323 billion to $9.615 billion in 2021. short-term borrowings are primarily comprised of amounts outstanding under the company's domestic commercial paper program and various foreign credit facilities. the company's long-term debt primarily consists of senior notes.
in november 2021, the company issued $500.0 million of 2.20% senior notes due march 2032 and $500.0 million of 2.90% senior notes due march 2052 in a public offering. the net proceeds from the issuance of these notes were used to repay outstanding borrowings under the company's domestic commercial paper program.
in october 2021, the company redeemed the entire outstanding $400.0 million aggregate principal amount of its 4.20% senior notes due 2022 and its 4.20% notes due 2022 initially issued by the valspar corporation (collectively, the 4.20% senior notes) after exercising its optional redemption rights. the 4.20% senior notes were redeemed at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount, plus accrued interest, and resulted in a gain of $1.4 million recorded in other (income) expense - net.
on june 29, 2021, the company and two of its wholly-owned subsidiaries, sherwin-williams canada inc. (sw canada) and sherwin-williams luxembourg s.à r.l. (sw luxembourg, together with the company and sw canada, the borrowers), entered into a new five-year $2.000 billion credit agreement (new credit agreement). the new credit agreement may be used for general corporate purposes, including the financing of working capital requirements. the new credit agreement replaced the $2.000 billion credit agreement dated july 19, 2018, as amended, which was terminated effective june 29, 2021. the new credit agreement will mature on june 29, 2026 and provides that the company may request to extend the maturity date of the facility for two additional one-year periods. in addition, the new credit agreement provides that the borrowers may increase the aggregate amount of the facility to $2.750 billion, subject to the discretion of each lender to participate in the increase, and the borrowers may request letters of credit in an amount of up to $250.0 million. at december 31, 2021 and 2020, there were no short-term borrowings under these credit agreements.
on august 2, 2021, the company entered into an amended and restated $625.0 million credit agreement (august 2021 credit agreement), which amends and restates the five-year credit agreement entered into in september 2017. the august 2021 credit agreement was subsequently amended on multiple dates to extend the maturity of commitments available for borrowing or letters of credit under the agreement. on may 9, 2016, the company entered into a five-year credit agreement (may 2016 credit agreement), subsequently amended on multiple dates to extend the maturity of commitments available for borrowing or letters of credit under the agreement. the may 2016 credit agreement gives the company the right to borrow and obtain letters of credit up to an aggregate availability of $875.0 million. both of these credit agreements are being used for general corporate purposes. at december 31, 2021 and 2020, there were no borrowings outstanding under these credit agreements.
the company's available capacity under its committed credit agreements is reduced for amounts outstanding under its domestic commercial paper program and letters of credit. at december 31, 2021, the company had unused capacity under its various credit agreements of $2.725 billion.
see note 6 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 for a detailed description and summary of the company's outstanding debt, short-term borrowings and other available financing programs.
defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans in accordance with the accounting prescribed by the retirement benefits topic of the asc, the company's total liability for unfunded or underfunded defined benefit pension plans decreased $31.3 million to $79.0 million primarily due to changes in the actuarial assumptions. the company's liability for other postretirement benefits decreased $15.2 million to $276.4 million at december 31, 2021 due primarily to changes in the actuarial assumptions.
the assumed discount rate used to determine the projected benefit obligation for domestic defined benefit pension plans was 3.1% at december 31, 2021 and 2.9% at december 31, 2020. the assumed discount rate used to determine the projected benefit obligation for foreign defined benefit pension plans increased to 2.3% at december 31, 2021 from 1.6% at december 31, 2020. the increase in the discount rates for both the domestic and foreign defined benefit pension plans was primarily due to higher interest rates. the assumed discount rate used to determine the projected benefit obligation for other postretirement benefit obligations increased to 2.8% at december 31, 2021 from 2.5% at december 31, 2020 for the same reason.
the rate of compensation increases used to determine the projected benefit obligations at december 31, 2021 was 3.0% for the domestic pension plan and 3.3% for foreign pension plans, which was comparable to the rates used in the prior year. in deciding on the rate of compensation increases, management considered historical company increases as well as expectations for future increases. the expected long-term rate of return on assets remained 5.0% at december 31, 2021 for the domestic pension plan and was slightly lower for most foreign plans. in establishing the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets for 2021, management considered the historical rates of return, the nature of investments and an expectation for future investment strategies. the assumed health care cost trend rates used to determine the net periodic benefit cost of other postretirement benefits for 2021 were 5.1% and 8.3%, respectively, for medical and prescription drug cost increases, both decreasing gradually to 4.5% in 2029. in developing the assumed health care cost trend rates, management considered industry data, historical company experience and expectations for future health care costs.
for 2022 net pension cost for the ongoing domestic pension plan, the company will use a discount rate of 3.1%, an expected long-term rate of return on assets of 5.0% and a rate of compensation increase of 3.0%. lower discount rates and expected long-term rates of return on plan assets will be used for most foreign plans. for 2022 net periodic benefit costs for other postretirement benefits, the company will use a discount rate of 2.8%. net pension cost in 2022 for the ongoing domestic pension plan is expected to be approximately $1.5 million. net periodic benefit costs for other postretirement benefits in 2022 is expected to be approximately $11.0 million. see note 7 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 for additional information on the company's obligations and funded status of its defined benefit pension plans and other postretirement benefits.
deferred income taxes deferred income taxes at december 31, 2021 decreased $77.9 million from the prior year primarily due to the change in deferred taxes as a result of the amortization of intangible assets in the current year. see note 19 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 for additional information on deferred taxes.
other long-term liabilities other long-term liabilities increased $47.1 million during 2021 due primarily to an increase in long-term commitments related to affordable housing and historic real estate properties, partially offset by the payment of u.s. federal payroll withholding taxes in accordance with the terms of the legislatively authorized tax payment deferral mechanisms established in 2020.
environmental-related liabilities the operations of the company, like those of other companies in the same industry, are subject to various federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations. these laws and regulations not only govern current operations and products, but also impose potential liability on the company for past operations. management expects environmental laws and regulations to impose increasingly stringent requirements upon the company and the industry in the future. management believes that the company conducts its operations in compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations and has implemented various programs designed to protect the environment and promote continued compliance.
depreciation of capital expenditures and other expenses related to ongoing environmental compliance measures were included in the normal operating expenses of conducting business. the company's capital expenditures, depreciation and other expenses related to ongoing environmental compliance measures were not material to the company's financial condition, liquidity, cash flow or results of operations during 2021. management does not expect that such capital expenditures, depreciation and other expenses will be material to the company's financial condition, liquidity, cash flow or results of operations in 2022. see note 9 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 for further information on environmental-related long-term liabilities.
contractual and other obligations and commercial commitments during 2021, the company signed agreements related to various acquisitions, including related to the european industrial coatings business of sika ag (sika). the sika transaction is expected to close in the first quarter of 2022. refer to note 3 for additional information. the company has certain obligations and commitments to make future payments under contractual and other obligations and commercial commitments. the company believes that cash generated from operating activities and borrowings available under long-term and short-term debt, including its committed credit agreements and commercial paper program, will be sufficient for it to meet its contractual and other obligations and commercial commitments. the following tables summarize such obligations and commitments as of december 31, 2021.

warranties the company offers product warranties for certain products. the specific terms and conditions of such warranties vary depending on the product or customer contract requirements. management estimated the costs of unsettled product warranty claims based on historical results and experience and included an amount in other accruals. management periodically assesses the adequacy of the accrual for product warranty claims and adjusts the accrual as necessary. changes in the company's accrual for product warranty claims during 2021 and 2020, including customer satisfaction settlements during the year, were as follows:
shareholders' equity shareholders' equity decreased $1.174 billion to $2.437 billion at december 31, 2021 from $3.611 billion last year. the decrease was primarily attributable to the company repurchasing $2.752 billion in treasury stock and declaring $587.1 million in cash dividends, partially offset by $1.864 billion of net income and an increase of $268.3 million associated with stock option exercises and the recognition of stock-based compensation expense. see the statements of consolidated shareholders' equity and statements of consolidated comprehensive income in item 8 for additional information.
the company purchased 10.1 million shares of its common stock for treasury purposes through open market purchases during 2021. the company acquires its common stock for general corporate purposes, and depending on its cash position and market conditions, it may acquire shares in the future. on february 17, 2021, the board of directors authorized the company to purchase an additional 45.0 million shares of the company's stock for treasury purposes. the company had remaining authorization from its board of directors at december 31, 2021 to purchase 48.6 million shares of its common stock.
the company's 2021 annual cash dividend of $2.20 per share represented 30% of 2020 diluted net income per share. the 2021 annual dividend represented the 43rd consecutive year of increased dividend payments since the dividend was suspended in 1978. on february 16, 2022, the board of directors increased the quarterly cash dividend to $0.60 per share. this quarterly dividend, if approved in each of the remaining quarters of 2022, would result in an annual dividend for 2022 of $2.40 per share or a 34% payout of 2021 diluted net income per share.
cash flow net operating cash decreased $1.164 billion in 2021 to a cash source of $2.245 billion from $3.409 billion in 2020 due primarily to incremental working capital requirements and a decrease in net income, partially offset by favorable changes in non-cash items associated with the wattyl divestiture and deferred taxes when compared to 2020. net operating cash decreased as a percent to sales to 11.3% in 2021 compared to 18.6% in 2020.
net investing cash usage increased $154.0 million to a usage of $476.4 million in 2021 from a usage of $322.4 million in 2020 due primarily to cash used for acquisitions and an increase in capital expenditures, partially offset by higher proceeds received from the sale of businesses and assets (including the wattyl divestiture). see note 3 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 for additional information on acquisitions and divestitures.
net financing cash usage decreased $1.186 billion to a usage of $1.834 billion in 2021 from a usage of $3.020 billion in 2020 due primarily to $1.746 billion of incremental cash provided by short-term borrowings and long-term debt, partially offset by an increase of $405.1 million, or 13.8%, in cash returned to shareholders in the form of cash dividends and share buybacks during the year and lower proceeds from treasury stock issuances.
litigation see note 10 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 for information concerning litigation.
market risk the company is exposed to market risk associated with interest rate, foreign currency and commodity fluctuations. the company occasionally utilizes derivative instruments as part of its overall financial risk management policy, but does not use derivative instruments for speculative or trading purposes. in 2021 and 2020, the company entered into foreign currency forward contracts with maturity dates of less than twelve months primarily to hedge against value changes in foreign currency and cross currency swap contracts to hedge its net investment in european operations. see notes 1, 15 and 18 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 for additional information related to the company's use of derivative instruments.
the company believes it may be exposed to continuing market risk from foreign currency exchange rate and commodity price fluctuations. however, the company does not expect that foreign currency exchange rate and commodity price fluctuations or hedging contract losses will have a material adverse effect on the company's financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.
financial covenant certain borrowings contain a consolidated leverage covenant. the covenant states the company's leverage ratio is not to exceed 3.75 to 1.00. the leverage ratio is defined as the ratio of total indebtedness (the sum of short-term borrowings, current portion of long-term debt and long-term debt) at the reporting date to consolidated "earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization" (ebitda) for the 12-month period ended on the same date. refer to the "non-gaap financial measures" section in item 7 for a reconciliation of ebitda to net income. at december 31, 2021, the company was in compliance with the covenant. the company's notes, debentures and revolving credit agreement contain various default and cross-default provisions. in the event of default under any one of these arrangements, acceleration of the maturity of any one or more of these borrowings may result. see note 6 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 for additional information.
employee stock ownership plan participants in the company's employee stock ownership plan (esop) are allowed to contribute up to the lesser of 50% of their annual compensation and the maximum dollar amount allowed under the internal revenue code. the company matches 6% of eligible employee contributions. the company's matching contributions to the esop charged to operations were $133.7 million in 2021 compared to $120.0 million in 2020. at december 31, 2021, there were 20,639,085 shares of the company's common stock being held by the esop, representing 7.9% of the total number of voting shares outstanding. see note 12 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 for additional information concerning the company's esop.
non-gaap financial measures management utilizes certain financial measures that are not in accordance with u.s. generally accepted accounting principles (us gaap) to analyze and manage the performance of the business. the required disclosures for these non-gaap measures are shown below. the company provides such non-gaap information in reporting its financial results to give investors additional data to evaluate the company's operations. management does not, nor does it suggest investors should, consider such non-gaap measures in isolation from, or in substitution for, financial information prepared in accordance with us gaap.
ebitda and adjusted ebitda earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (ebitda) is a non-gaap financial measure defined as net income before income taxes and interest, depreciation and amortization. adjusted ebitda is a non-gaap financial measure that excludes the loss on the wattyl divestiture. management considers ebitda and adjusted ebitda useful in understanding the operating performance of the company. the reader is cautioned that the company's ebitda and adjusted ebitda should not be compared to other entities unknowingly. further, ebitda and adjusted ebitda should not be considered alternatives to net income or net operating cash as an indicator of operating performance or as a measure of liquidity. the reader should refer to the determination of net income and net operating cash in accordance with us gaap disclosed in the statements of consolidated income and statements of consolidated cash flows in item 8.
the following table summarizes ebitda and adjusted ebitda as calculated by management for the years indicated below:
(millions of dollars)                                       year ended december 31,
free cash flow free cash flow is a non-gaap financial measure defined as net operating cash, as shown in the statements of consolidated cash flows, less the amount reinvested in the business for capital expenditures and the return of investment to its shareholders by the payment of cash dividends. management considers free cash flow to be a useful tool in its determination of appropriate uses of the company's net operating cash. the reader is cautioned that the free cash flow measure should not be compared to other entities unknowingly as it may not be comparable and it does not consider certain non-discretionary cash flows, such as mandatory debt and interest payments. the amount shown below should not be considered an alternative to net operating cash or other cash flow amounts provided in accordance with us gaap as disclosed in the statements of consolidated cash flows in item 8.
the following table summarizes free cash flow as calculated by management for the years indicated below:
(millions of dollars)                                    year ended december 31,
net operating cash               $2,244.6                          $3,408.6
capital expenditures              (372.0)                           (303.8)
adjusted diluted net income per share management of the company believes that investors' understanding of the company's operating performance is enhanced by the disclosure of diluted net income per share excluding the loss on divestiture of wattyl and valspar acquisition-related amortization expense. this adjusted earnings per share measurement is not in accordance with us gaap. it should not be considered a substitute for earnings per share in accordance with us gaap and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies.
(1)    the tax effect is calculated based on the statutory rate and the nature of the item, unless otherwise noted.
(2)    acquisition-related amortization expense consists primarily of the amortization of intangible assets related to the valspar acquisition and is included in amortization.
adjusted segment profit management of the company believes that investors' understanding of the company's operating performance is enhanced by the disclosure of segment profit excluding the loss on divestiture of wattyl and valspar acquisition-related amortization expense. this adjusted segment profit measurement is not in accordance with us gaap. it should not be considered a substitute for segment profit in accordance with us gaap and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. the following tables reconcile segment profit computed in accordance with us gaap to adjusted segment profit.

critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with u.s. generally accepted accounting principles (us gaap) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported in the accompanying consolidated financial statements. these determinations were made based upon management's best estimates, judgments and assumptions that were believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, giving due consideration to materiality. we do not believe there is a great likelihood that materially different amounts would be reported under different conditions or using different assumptions related to the accounting policies described below. however, application of these accounting policies involves the exercise of judgment and use of assumptions as to future uncertainties and, as a result, actual results could differ from these estimates.
all of the significant accounting policies that were followed in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements are disclosed in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8. management believes that the following critical accounting policies and estimates have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements.
inventories inventories were stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value with cost determined principally on the last-in, first-out (lifo) method based on inventory quantities and costs determined during the fourth quarter. inventory quantities were adjusted throughout the year as formal cycle counts were completed, or during the fourth quarter as a result of annual physical inventory counts. if inventories accounted for on the lifo method are reduced on a year-over-year basis, then liquidation of certain quantities carried at costs prevailing in prior years occurs. management recorded the best estimate of net realizable value for obsolete and discontinued inventories based on historical experience and current trends through reductions to inventory cost by recording a provision included in cost of goods sold. if management estimates that the reasonable market value is below cost or determines that future demand was lower than current inventory levels, based on historical experience, current and projected market demand, current and projected volume trends and other relevant current and projected factors associated with the current economic conditions, a reduction in inventory cost to estimated net realizable value is provided for in the reserve for obsolescence. see note 4 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 for more information regarding the impact of the lifo inventory valuation and the reserve for obsolescence.
goodwill and intangible assets in accordance with the goodwill and other intangibles topic of the asc, management performs impairment tests of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets on an annual basis, as well as whenever an event occurs or circumstances change that indicate impairment has more likely than not occurred. an optional qualitative assessment allows companies to skip the annual quantitative test if it is not more likely than not that impairment has occurred based on monitoring key company financial performance metrics and macroeconomic conditions. the qualitative assessment is performed when deemed appropriate.
in accordance with the goodwill and other intangibles topic of the asc, management tests goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level. a reporting unit is an operating segment per the segment reporting topic of the asc or one level below the operating segment (component level) as determined by the availability of discrete financial information that is regularly reviewed by operating segment management or an aggregate of component levels of an operating segment having similar economic characteristics. at the time of goodwill impairment testing (if performing a quantitative assessment), management determines fair value through the use of a discounted cash flow valuation model incorporating discount rates commensurate with the risks involved for each reporting unit. if the calculated fair value is less than the current carrying value, then impairment of the reporting unit exists. the use of a discounted cash flow valuation model to determine estimated fair value is common practice in impairment testing. the key assumptions used in the discounted cash flow valuation model for impairment testing include discount rates, growth rates, cash flow projections and terminal value rates. discount rates are set by using the weighted average cost of capital ("wacc") methodology. the wacc methodology considers market and industry data as well as company-specific risk factors for each reporting unit in determining the appropriate discount rates to be used. the discount rate utilized for each reporting unit is indicative of the return an investor would expect to receive for investing in such a business. operational management, considering industry and company-specific historical and projected data, develops growth rates, sales projections and cash flow projections for each reporting unit. terminal value rate determination follows common methodology of capturing the present value of perpetual cash flow estimates beyond the last projected period assuming a constant wacc and low long-term growth rates. as an indicator that each reporting unit has been valued appropriately through the use of the discounted cash flow valuation model, the aggregate of all reporting units' fair value is reconciled to the total market capitalization of the company.
the company had seven components, some of which are aggregated due to similar economic characteristics, to form three reporting units (also the operating segments) with goodwill as of october 1, 2021, the date of the annual impairment test. the annual impairment review performed as of october 1, 2021 did not result in any of the reporting units having impairment or deemed at risk for impairment.
in accordance with the goodwill and other intangibles topic of the asc, management tests indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment at the asset level, as determined by appropriate asset valuations at acquisition. management utilizes the royalty savings method and valuation model to determine the estimated fair value for each indefinite-lived intangible asset or trademark. in this method, management estimates the royalty savings arising from the ownership of the intangible asset. the key assumptions used in estimating the royalty savings for impairment testing include discount rates, royalty rates, growth rates, sales projections, terminal value rates and, to a lesser extent, tax rates. discount rates used are similar to the rates developed by the wacc methodology considering any differences in company-specific risk factors between reporting units and trademarks. royalty rates are established by management and valuation experts and periodically substantiated by valuation experts. operational management, considering industry and company-specific historical and projected data, develops growth rates and sales projections for each significant trademark. terminal value rate determination follows common methodology of capturing the present value of perpetual sales estimates beyond the last projected period assuming a constant wacc and low long-term growth rates. the royalty savings valuation methodology and calculations used in 2021 impairment testing are consistent with prior years. the annual impairment review performed as of october 1, 2021 did not result in any of the reporting units having impairment or deemed at risk for impairment.
the discounted cash flow and royalty savings valuation methodologies require management to make certain assumptions based upon information available at the time the valuations are performed. actual results could differ from these assumptions. management believes the assumptions used are reflective of what a market participant would have used in calculating fair value considering the current economic conditions. see note 5 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 for a discussion of goodwill and intangible assets and the impairment tests performed in accordance with the goodwill and other intangibles topic of the asc.
valuation of long-lived assets in accordance with the property, plant and equipment topic of the asc, if events or changes in circumstances indicated that the carrying value of long-lived assets, including operating lease right-of-use assets, may not be recoverable or the useful life had changed, impairment tests were performed or the useful life was adjusted. undiscounted cash flows were used to calculate the recoverable value of long-lived assets to determine if such assets were not recoverable. if the carrying value of the assets was deemed to not be recoverable, the impairment to be recognized is the amount by which the carrying value of the assets exceeds the estimated fair value of the assets as determined in accordance with the fair value topic of the asc. if the usefulness of an asset was determined to be impaired, then management estimated a new useful life based on the period of time for projected uses of the asset. fair value approaches and changes in useful life required management to make certain assumptions based upon information available at the time the valuation or determination was performed. actual results could differ from these assumptions. management believes the assumptions used are reflective of what a market participant would have used in calculating fair value or useful life considering the current economic conditions. all tested long-lived assets or groups of long-lived assets had undiscounted cash flows that were substantially in excess of their carrying value. see note 5 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 for a discussion of the reductions in carrying value or useful life of long-lived assets in accordance with the property, plant and equipment topic of the asc. see note 1 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 for the property, plant and equipment accounting policy.
defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans to determine the company's ultimate obligation under its defined benefit pension plans and other postretirement benefit plans, management must estimate the future cost of benefits and attribute that cost to the time period during which each covered employee works. to determine the obligations of such benefit plans, management uses actuaries to calculate such amounts using key assumptions such as discount rates, inflation, long-term investment returns, mortality, employee turnover, rate of compensation increases and medical and prescription drug costs. management reviews all of these assumptions on an ongoing basis to ensure that the most current information available is being considered. an increase or decrease in the assumptions or economic events outside management's control could have a direct impact on the company's results of operations or financial condition.
in accordance with the retirement benefits topic of the asc, the company recognizes each plan's funded status as an asset for overfunded plans and as a liability for unfunded or underfunded plans. actuarial gains and losses and prior service costs are recognized and recorded in aoci. the amounts recorded in aoci will continue to be modified as actuarial assumptions and service costs change, and all such amounts will be amortized to expense over a period of years through the net pension and net periodic benefit costs.
in 2022, pension costs are expected to decrease slightly and other postretirement benefit plan costs are expected to increase slightly based on the actuarial assumptions being applied. see note 7 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 for information concerning the company's defined benefit pension plans and other postretirement benefit plans.
environmental matters the company is involved with environmental investigation and remediation activities at some of its currently and formerly owned sites (including sites which were previously owned and/or operated by businesses acquired by the company). the company initially provides for estimated costs of environmental-related activities relating to its past operations and third-party sites for which commitments or clean-up plans have been developed and when such costs can be reasonably estimated based on industry standards and professional judgment. these estimated costs, which are mostly undiscounted, are determined based on currently available facts regarding each site. if the reasonably estimable costs can only be identified as a range and no specific amount within that range can be determined more likely than any other amount within the range, the minimum of the range is provided.
the company continuously assesses its potential liability for investigation and remediation-related activities and adjusts its environmental-related accruals as information becomes available upon which more accurate costs can be reasonably estimated and as additional accounting guidelines are issued. actual costs incurred may vary from the accrued estimates due to the inherent uncertainties involved. see note 9 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 for information concerning the accrual for extended environmental-related activities and a discussion concerning unaccrued future loss contingencies.
litigation and other contingent liabilities in the course of its business, the company is subject to a variety of claims and lawsuits, including, but not limited to, litigation relating to product liability and warranty, personal injury, environmental, intellectual property, commercial, contractual and antitrust claims. management believes that the company has properly accrued for all known liabilities that existed and those where a loss was deemed probable for which a fair value was available or an amount could be reasonably estimated in accordance with us gaap. however, because litigation is inherently subject to many uncertainties and the ultimate result of any present or future litigation is unpredictable, the company's ultimate liability may result in costs that are significantly higher than currently accrued. in the event that the company's loss contingency is ultimately determined to be significantly higher than currently accrued, the recording of the liability may result in a material impact on net income for the annual or interim period during which such liability is accrued. additionally, due to the uncertainties involved, any potential liability determined to be attributable to the company arising out of such litigation may have a material adverse effect on the company's results of operations, liquidity or financial condition. see note 10 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 for information concerning litigation.
income taxes the company estimated income taxes for each jurisdiction that it operated in. this involved estimating taxable earnings, specific taxable and deductible items, the likelihood of generating sufficient future taxable income to utilize deferred tax assets and possible exposures related to future tax audits. to the extent these estimates change, adjustments to deferred and accrued income taxes will be made in the period in which the changes occur.
we recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. the tax benefits recognized in the consolidated financial statements from such a position are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate resolution. these assessments of uncertain tax positions contain judgments related to the interpretation of tax regulations in the jurisdictions in which we transact business. the judgments and estimates made at a point in time may change based on the outcome of tax audits, expiration of statutes of limitations, as well as changes to, or further interpretations of, tax laws and regulations. income tax expense is adjusted in our statements of consolidated income in the period in which these events occur. see note 19 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 for information concerning income taxes.

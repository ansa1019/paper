cpuc authority over operational matters the cpuc has regulatory authority related to safety standards and practices, competitive conditions, reliability and planning, affiliate relationships and a wide range of other operational matters, including citation programs concerning matters such as safety activity, disconnection and billing practices, resource adequacy and environmental compliance. for example, in june 2019, the cpuc opened an oii to determine whether socalgas' and sempra's organizational culture and governance prioritize safety. phase 1 of the oii involved a cpuc consultant producing a report that evaluates organizational culture, governance, policies, practices, and accountability metrics in relation to operations, including record of safety incidents. in january 2022, the cpuc issued a ruling initiating phase 2 activities and entering the phase 1 consultant's report into the record. consistent with the recommendations of the phase 1 consultant's report, the ruling indicates that phase 2 will focus on constructive, forward-looking actions intended to improve safety outcomes in the future. many of these standards and programs are becoming more stringent and could impose severe penalties, including enforcement programs under which the cpuc staff can issue citations that in some cases can impose substantial fines. the cpuc conducts reviews and audits of the matters under its authority and could launch investigations or open proceedings at any time on any such matter it deems appropriate, the results of which could lead to citations, disallowances, fines and penalties, as well as corrective or mitigation actions required to address any noncompliance that may not be sufficiently funded in customer rates or at all. any such occurrence could have a material adverse effect on sempra's, sdg&e's and socalgas' results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and/or prospects.

aep routinely submits irps in various regulatory jurisdictions to address future generation and capacity needs. these irps take into account economics, customer demand, grid reliability and resilience, regulations and rto capacity requirements. the objective of the irps is to recommend future generation and capacity resources that provide the most cost-efficient and reliable power to customers. based on the output of the company's irps, in october 2022, aep announced new intermediate and long-term co2 emission reduction goals. aep adjusted its near-term co2 emission reduction target from a 2000 baseline to a 2005 baseline, upgraded its 80% reduction by 2030 target to include full scope 1 emissions and accelerated its net-zero goal by five years to 2045 for scope 1 and scope 2 emissions. risks to achieving these goals include, among other things, the ability to execute on renewable resource plans, evolving rto requirements, regulatory approvals, customer demand for carbon-free energy, potential tariffs, carbon policy and regulation, operational performance of renewable generation and supply chain costs and constraints, all while continuing to provide the most cost-efficient and reliable power to customers. technology research and development, innovation, and advancements in carbon-free generation are also critical to aep's ability to achieve its 2045 goal.

risk factors" and note 10 to our consolidated financial statements, included in this annual report.
non-gaap measures we use certain financial measures internally to evaluate our performance and make financial and operational decisions that are presented in a manner that adjusts from their equivalent gaap measures or that supplement the information provided by our gaap measures. we use these adjusted results because we believe they more clearly highlight trends in our business that may not otherwise be apparent when relying solely on gaap financial measures, since these measures eliminate from our results specific financial items that have less bearing on our core operating performance.
we use these measures in communicating certain aspects of our results and performance, including in this annual report, and believe that these measures, when viewed in conjunction with our gaap results and the accompanying reconciliation, can provide investors with greater transparency and a greater understanding of factors affecting our financial condition and results of operations than gaap measures alone. in addition, we believe the presentation of these measures is useful to investors for making period-to-period comparisons of results because the adjustments to gaap are not reflective of our core business performance.
these financial measures are not presented in accordance with, or as an alternative to, gaap financial measures and may be different from non-gaap measures used by other companies. we encourage investors to review the gaap financial measures included in this annual report, including our consolidated financial statements, to aid in their analysis and understanding of our performance and in making comparisons.
the table below outlines our adjusted operating expenses, adjusted operating income, adjusted operating margin, adjusted net income attributable to ice common stockholders and adjusted diluted earnings per share, which are non-gaap measures that are calculated by making adjustments for items we view as not reflective of our cash operations and core business performance. these measures, including the adjustments and their related income tax effect and other tax adjustments (in millions, except for percentages and per share amounts), are as follows:

amortization of acquisition-related intangibles are included in non-gaap adjustments as excluding these non-cash expenses provides greater clarity regarding our financial strength and stability of cash operating results.
transaction and integration costs are included as part of our core business expenses, except for those that are directly related to the announcement, closing, financing or termination of a transaction. however, we adjust for the acquisition-related transaction and integration costs relating to acquisitions such as black knight and ellie mae given the magnitude of the $11.8 and $11.4 billion, respectively, purchase prices of the acquisitions. we also adjusted for the acquisition-related transaction costs related to the merger of bakkt and vih in 2021 due to the significance of the transaction.
we adjust for gains and losses on investment transactions and changes in the fair value of our investments. our investments are not considered to be a part of our core business operations and the impacts of changes in our investments are often non-cash in nature.
the following non-gaap adjustments are reported in the table above related to investments:
•during 2023, we excluded the combined realized loss of $3 million related to our sales of the dun & bradstreet investment, net of dividends;
•during 2022, we excluded the $41 million gain on the sale of our euroclear investment;
•during 2021, we excluded a $34 million fair value gain on our euroclear equity investment and euroclear dividends received of $60 million;
•in 2021, we excluded the $1.4 billion gain on the deconsolidation of bakkt and the $1.2 billion gain on the sale of our coinbase equity investment.
similarly, and as included in the table above, we adjust for our share of net income/(losses) and impairment charges related to our equity method investments, which primarily include occ and bakkt. our share of 2021 net losses from unconsolidated investees includes the period from the bakkt merger on october 15, 2021 through december 31, 2021. in 2023, our share of total bakkt net losses was $135 million and our share of occ net income was $16 million. during 2022, after recording our share of bakkt's equity method losses, which included an impairment charge recorded by bakkt, we recorded an impairment in our investment in bakkt to its fair value as other expense. in 2022, the total bakkt net losses and impairment was $1.4 billion and our share of occ net income was $15 million. in 2021, our share of bakkt losses was $92 million and our share of occ income was $51 million. we believe these adjustments provide greater clarity of our performance given that equity method investments are non-cash and not a part of our core operations.
we adjust for certain items related to our debt. certain debt activities, such as the early termination of notes, pre-acquisition interest and expense and accelerated amortization of debt costs are not considered to be a part of our core business operations and the impacts of changes in our investments are often non-cash in nature. the following non-gaap adjustments are reported in the table above related to our debt:
•in 2023, we excluded $170 million of interest income earned on investments from the pre-acquisition debt proceeds. this adjustment was net of $158 million of interest expense on pre-acquisition-related debt from our may 2022 debt refinancing related to the black knight acquisition.
•in 2022, we excluded $59 million of net interest expense on pre-acquisition-related debt from our may 2022 debt refinancing related to the black knight acquisition. this adjustment was net of interest income earnings on investments from the pre-acquisition debt proceeds.
•in 2022, we adjusted for costs of $30 million associated with the may and june 2022 extinguishment of four series of senior notes that would have matured in 2022 and 2023 using proceeds from our may 2022 issuance of new senior notes.
•in 2021, we adjusted for the acceleration of unamortized costs of $4 million related to the september 2021 early redemption of our floating rate notes.
other adjustments not considered to be a part of our core business operations include:
•we adjust for the 2023 fair value loss of $160 million related to the black knight promissory note as this not believed to be part of our core operations.
•a $6 million expense for claims made following a nyse system outage that occurred in january 2023;
•2023 accruals related to regulatory matters of $11 million;
•the 2023 impairment related to our cat loan receivable of $16 million. the cat was approved by the sec in 2016 to improve regulators' ability to monitor trading activity;
•in 2021 we excluded a gain of $7 million related to the settlement of an acquisition-related indemnification claim and $16 million related to a legal settlement.
non-gaap tax adjustments include the tax impacts of the pre-tax non-gaap adjustments, deferred tax adjustments on acquisition-related intangibles and other tax adjustments. other tax adjustments of $79 million in 2023 are primarily related to audit settlements for pre-acquisition tax matters as well as state apportionment changes in prior years. deferred tax adjustments on acquisition-related intangibles include the impact of tax law changes and apportionment updates resulting in deferred tax (benefit)/expense of ($126 million), $9 million and $183 million in 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively, related to the following:
•deferred tax adjustments in in 2023 and 2022 related primarily to u.s. state apportionment changes; and
•deferred tax adjustments in 2021 related primarily to the u.k. tax law changes enacted in june 2021, which increased the u.k. corporate income tax rate from 19% to 25% effective april 1, 2023.

non-gaap liquidity measures we consider free cash flow and adjusted free cash flow to be non-gaap liquidity measures that provide useful information to management and investors to analyze cash resources generated from our operations. we believe that free cash flow and adjusted free cash flow are useful as the bases for comparing our performance with our competitors and demonstrate our ability to convert the reinvestment of capital expenditures and capitalized software development costs required to maintain and grow our business, as well as adjust for timing differences related to the payment of section 31 fees. these non-gaap liquidity measures are not presented in accordance with, or as an alternative to, gaap liquidity measures and may be different from non-gaap measures used by other companies. free cash flow and adjusted free cash flow, including the related adjustments are as follows (in millions):

off-balance sheet arrangements as described in note 14 to our consolidated financial statements, which are included elsewhere in this annual report, certain clearing house collateral is reported off-balance sheet. we do not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities.
contractual obligations and commercial commitments we intend to fund our contractual obligations and commercial commitments from existing cash and cash flow from operations. as of december 31, 2023, our primary cash requirements include the following contractual and other obligations.
as of december 31, 2023, we had $22.6 billion in outstanding debt, including $2.0 billion of short-term debt. our outstanding debt consists of $19.0 billion of fixed rate senior notes, $1.6 billion under our term loan and $2.0 billion in commercial paper.
our operating leases primarily relate to our leased office space and data center facilities, and as of december 31, 2023, we had fixed lease payment obligations of $442 million, with $73 million payable within one-year.
we have other purchase obligations to purchase various goods and services that we believe are enforceable and legally binding.
in addition, we have $80.8 billion in cash and cash equivalent margin deposits and guaranty funds, invested deposits, delivery contracts payable and unsettled variation margin. clearing members of our clearing houses are required to deposit original margin and variation margin and to make deposits to a guaranty fund. the cash and cash equivalent deposits made to these margin accounts and to the guaranty fund are recorded in the consolidated balance sheets as current assets with corresponding current liabilities to the clearing members that deposited them. ice ngx administers the physical delivery of energy trading contracts. it has an equal and offsetting claim to and from its respective participants on opposite sides of the physically-settled contract, each of which is reflected as a delivery contract receivable with an offsetting delivery contract payable. see note 14 to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report for additional information on our clearing houses and the margin deposits, guaranty funds, invested deposits, delivery contracts payable and unsettled variation margin.
we also have unrecognized tax benefits, or utbs. as of december 31, 2023, our cumulative utbs were $268 million, and accrued interest and penalties related to utbs were $32 million. we are under examination by various tax authorities. we are unable to make a reasonable estimate of the periods of cash settlement because it is not possible to reasonably predict the amount of tax, interest and penalties, if any, that might be assessed by a tax authority or the timing of an assessment or payment. it is also not possible to reasonably predict whether or not the applicable statutes of limitations might expire without us being examined by any particular tax authority. see note 13 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information on our utbs.
as of december 31, 2023, we, through nyse, have net obligations of $102 million related to our pension and other benefit programs. the date of payment under these net obligations cannot be determined. see note 17 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information on our pension and other benefit programs.
in addition, the future funding of the implementation and operation of the cat is ultimately expected to be provided by both the sros and broker-dealers. to date, however, funding has been provided solely by the sros, and future funding is expected to be repaid if industry member fees are approved by the sec and subsequently collected by industry members.
new and recently adopted accounting pronouncements refer to note 2 to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report for information on the new and recently adopted accounting pronouncements that are applicable to us.
critical accounting policies we have identified the policies below as critical to our business operations and the understanding of our results of operations. the impact of, and any associated risks related to, these policies on our business operations is discussed throughout "- management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations." for a detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies, see note 2 to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report.
our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with u.s. gaap. the preparation of financial statements in conformity with these accounting principles requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities, and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities, at the date of our financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
we base our estimates and judgments on our historical experience and other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances when we make these estimates and judgments and re-evaluate them on a periodic basis. based on these factors, we make estimates and judgments about, among other things, the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from market prices or other independent sources and about the recognition and characterization of our revenues and expenses. the values and results based on these estimates and judgments could differ significantly under different assumptions or conditions and could change materially in the future.
we believe that the following critical accounting policies, among others, affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements and could materially increase or decrease our reported results, assets and liabilities.
goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets assets acquired and liabilities assumed in connection with our acquisitions are recorded at their estimated fair values. goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price of an acquired company over the fair value of its identifiable net assets, including identified intangible assets. we recognize specifically identifiable intangibles, such as customer relationships, trademarks, technology, trading products, data, exchange registrations, backlog, trade names and licenses when a specific right or contract is acquired. our determination of the fair value of the intangible assets and whether or not these assets may be impaired following their acquisition requires us to apply significant judgments and make significant estimates and assumptions regarding future cash flows. if we change our strategy or if market conditions shift, our judgments and estimates may change, which may result in adjustments to recorded asset balances. intangible assets with finite useful lives are amortized over their estimated useful lives whereas goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are not.
in performing the allocation of the acquisitions' purchase price to assets and liabilities, we consider, among other factors, the intended use of the acquired assets, analysis of past financial performance and estimates of future performance of the acquired business. at the acquisition date, a preliminary allocation of the purchase price is recorded based upon a preliminary valuation performed with the assistance of a third-party valuation specialist. we continue to review and assess our estimates, assumptions and valuation methodologies during the measurement period provided by gaap, which ends as soon as we receive the information about facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date or we learn that more information is not obtainable, which usually does not exceed one year from the date of acquisition. accordingly, these estimates and assumptions are subject to change, which could have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. estimation uncertainty may exist due to the sensitivity of the respective fair value to underlying assumptions about the future performance of an acquired business in our discounted cash flow models. significant assumptions typically include revenue growth rates and expense synergies that form the basis of the forecasted results and the discount rate.
our goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets are evaluated for impairment annually in our fiscal fourth quarter or more frequently if conditions exist that indicate that the value may be impaired. we test our goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level, and we have identified four reporting units. our reporting units identified for our goodwill testing are the nyse, other exchanges, fixed income and data services, and mortgage technology reporting units. these impairment evaluations are performed by comparing the carrying value of the goodwill or other indefinite-lived intangibles to its estimated fair value.
in accordance with asu 2017-04, simplifying the test for goodwill impairment, for both goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible impairment testing, we have the option to first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit or indefinite-lived intangible asset is less than its carrying amount. if the fair value of the goodwill or indefinite-lived intangible asset is less than its carrying value, an impairment loss is recognized in earnings in an amount equal to the difference. alternatively, we may choose to bypass the qualitative option and perform quantitative testing to determine if the fair value is less than the carrying value. for our goodwill impairment testing, we have elected to bypass the qualitative assessment and apply the quantitative approach. for our testing of indefinite-lived intangible assets, we apply qualitative and quantitative approaches.
application of the impairment test requires judgment, including the identification of reporting units, assignment of assets and liabilities to reporting units, assignment of goodwill to reporting units, and determination of the fair value of each reporting unit. we have historically determined the fair value of our reporting units based on various valuation techniques, including discounted cash flow analysis and a multiple of earnings approach. in assessing whether goodwill and other intangible assets are impaired, we must make estimates and assumptions regarding future cash flows, long-term growth rates of our business, operating margins, discount rates, weighted average cost of capital and other factors to determine the fair value of our assets. these estimates and assumptions require management's judgment, and changes to these estimates and assumptions, as a result of changing economic and competitive conditions, could materially affect the determination of fair value and/or impairment. we considered potential indicators of impairment to goodwill and other intangible assets for each of our reporting units, which included continued global inflation concerns and changing interest rates, including their effect on our forecasts and discount rates, among other things. other than an impairment in 2023 of certain trademark intangible assets, we did not record any impairments in 2023, 2022 or 2021 as a result of our goodwill or indefinite-lived impairment testing.
we are also required to evaluate other finite-lived intangible assets for impairment by first determining whether events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of these assets to be held and used may not be recoverable. if impairment indicators are present, then an estimate of undiscounted future cash flows produced by these long-lived assets is compared to the carrying value of those assets to determine if the asset is recoverable. if an asset is not recoverable, the loss is measured as the difference between fair value and carrying value of the impaired asset. fair value of these assets is based on various valuation techniques, including discounted cash flow analysis, which are assessed and conducted in accordance with our internal impairment analysis policies.
income taxes we are subject to income taxes in the u.s., u.k. and other foreign jurisdictions where we operate. the determination of our provision for income taxes and related accruals, deferred tax assets and liabilities requires the use of significant judgment, estimates, and the interpretation and application of complex tax laws. we recognize a current tax liability or tax asset for the estimated taxes payable or refundable on tax returns for the current year. we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax bases of our assets and liabilities. we establish valuation allowances if we believe that it is more likely than not that some or all of our deferred tax assets will not be realized. deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using current enacted tax rates in effect for the years in which those temporary differences and carryforwards are expected to reverse.
the financial accounting standards board, or fasb, staff has provided additional guidance to address the accounting for the effects of the provisions related to the taxation of global intangible low-taxed income noting that companies should make an accounting policy election to recognize deferred taxes for temporary basis differences expected to reverse in future years or to include the tax expense in the year it is incurred. we have made a policy election to recognize such taxes as current period expenses when incurred.
we do not recognize a tax benefit unless we conclude that it is more likely than not that the benefit will be sustained on audit by the taxing authority based solely on the technical merits of the associated tax position. if the recognition threshold is met, we recognize a tax benefit measured at the largest amount of the tax benefit that, in our judgment, is greater than 50 percent likely to be realized. we recognize accrued interest and penalties related to uncertain income tax positions as income tax expense in the consolidated statements of income.
we operate within multiple domestic and foreign taxing jurisdictions and are subject to audit in these jurisdictions by domestic and foreign tax authorities. these audits include questions regarding our tax filing positions, including the timing and amount of deductions taken and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions. we record accruals for the estimated outcomes of these audits, and the accruals may change in the future due to new developments in each matter. at any point in time, many tax years are subject to or in the process of being audited by various taxing authorities. to the extent our estimates of settlements change or the final tax outcome of these matters is different from the amounts recorded, such differences will impact the income tax provision in the period in which such determinations are made. our income tax expense includes changes in our estimated liability for exposures associated with our various tax filing positions. determining the income tax expense for these potential assessments requires management to make assumptions that are subject to factors such as proposed assessments by tax authorities, changes in facts and circumstances, issuance of new regulations, and resolution of tax audits.
item 7 (a).     quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk as a result of our operating and financing activities, we are exposed to market risks such as interest rate risk, foreign currency exchange rate risk and credit risk. we have implemented policies and procedures designed to measure, manage, monitor and report risk exposures, which are regularly reviewed by the appropriate management and supervisory bodies.
interest rate risk we have exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relating to our cash and cash equivalents, short-term and long-term restricted cash and cash equivalents, short-term and long-term investments and indebtedness. as of december 31, 2023 and 2022, our cash and cash equivalents and short-term and long-term restricted cash and cash equivalents and investments were $2.5 billion and $8.4 billion, respectively, of which $270 million and $346 million, respectively, were denominated in pounds sterling, euros or canadian dollars, and the remaining amounts are denominated in u.s. dollars. we do not use our investment portfolio for trading or other speculative purposes. a hypothetical 50% decrease in short-term interest rates would decrease our annual pre-tax earnings by $15 million as of december 31, 2023, assuming no change in the amount or composition of our cash and cash equivalents and short-term and long-term restricted cash and cash equivalents.
as of december 31, 2023, we had $22.6 billion in outstanding debt, consisting of $19.0 billion related to our senior notes, $1.6 billion under our term loan and $2.0 billion in commercial paper. see part ii, item 7, "management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations - debt," and note 10 to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report.
the interest rates on our commercial paper program are currently evaluated based upon current maturities and market conditions. the weighted average interest rate on notes outstanding under our commercial paper program was 5.70% as of december 31, 2023, and we did not have any notes outstanding under our commercial paper program as of december 31, 2022. the effective interest rate of issuances under our commercial paper program will continue to fluctuate based on the movement in short-term interest rates along with shifts in supply and demand within the commercial paper market.
foreign currency exchange rate risk as an international business, we are subject to foreign currency exchange rate risk. we may experience gains or losses from foreign currency transactions in the future given that a significant part of our assets and liabilities are recorded in pounds sterling, canadian dollars or euros, and a significant portion of our revenues and expenses are recorded in pounds sterling or euros. certain assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses of foreign subsidiaries are denominated in the local functional currency of such subsidiaries. our exposure to foreign denominated earnings in 2023 and 2022 is presented by primary foreign currency in the following table (dollars in millions, except exchange rates):

(1)    represents the impact of currency fluctuation for the year compared to the same period in the prior year.
we have a significant part of our assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses recorded in pounds sterling or euros. in 2023 and 2022, 14% and 13%, respectively, of our consolidated revenues, less transaction-based expenses, were denominated in pounds sterling or euros, and in both 2023 and 2022, 9% of our consolidated operating expenses were denominated in pounds sterling or euros. as the pound sterling or euro exchange rate changes, the u.s. equivalent of revenues and expenses denominated in foreign currencies changes accordingly.
foreign currency transaction risk related to the settlement of foreign currency denominated assets, liabilities and payables occurs through our operations, which are received in or paid in pounds sterling, canadian dollars, or euros, due to the increase or decrease in the foreign currency exchange rates between periods. we incurred foreign currency transaction losses of $12 million and $9 million in 2023 and 2022, respectively, inclusive of the impact of foreign currency hedging transactions. the foreign currency transaction losses were primarily attributable to the fluctuations of the pound sterling and euro relative to the u.s. dollar. a 10% adverse change in the underlying foreign currency exchange rates as of december 31, 2023, assuming no change in the composition of the foreign currency denominated assets, liabilities and payables and assuming no hedging activity, would result in a foreign currency loss of $1 million.
we entered into foreign currency hedging transactions during 2023 and 2022 as economic hedges to help mitigate a portion of our foreign exchange risk exposure and may enter into additional hedging transactions in the future to help mitigate our foreign exchange risk exposure. although we may enter into additional hedging transactions in the future, these hedging arrangements may not be effective, particularly in the event of imprecise forecasts of the levels of our non-u.s. denominated assets and liabilities.
we have foreign currency translation risk equal to our net investment in our foreign subsidiaries. the financial statements of these subsidiaries are translated into u.s. dollars using a current rate of exchange, with gains or losses included in the cumulative translation adjustment account, a component of equity. our exposure to the net investment in foreign currencies is presented by primary foreign currencies in the table below (in millions):

foreign currency translation adjustments are included as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income/(loss) within our balance sheet. see the table below for the portion of equity attributable to foreign currency translation adjustments as well as the activity by year included within our statement of other comprehensive income. the impact of the foreign currency exchange rate differences in the table below were primarily driven by fluctuations of the pound sterling as compared to the u.s. dollar which were 1.2732, 1.2093 and 1.3524 as of december 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021, respectively.

the future impact on our business relating to the u.k. leaving the eu and the corresponding regulatory changes are uncertain at this time, including future impacts on currency exchange rates.
credit risk we are exposed to credit risk in our operations in the event of a counterparty default. we limit our exposure to credit risk by rigorously selecting the counterparties with which we make our investments, monitoring them on an ongoing basis and executing agreements to protect our interests.
clearing house cash deposit risks the ice clearing houses hold material amounts of clearing member margin deposits which are held or invested primarily to provide security of capital while minimizing credit, market and liquidity risks. refer to note 14 to our consolidated financial statements for more information on the ice clearing houses' cash and cash equivalent margin deposits and guaranty funds, invested deposits, delivery contracts receivable and unsettled variation margin which were $80.8 billion as of december 31, 2023. while we seek to achieve a reasonable rate of return which may generate interest income for our clearing members, we are primarily concerned with preservation of capital and managing the risks associated with these deposits. as the ice clearing houses may pass on interest revenues (minus costs) to the clearing members, this could include negative or reduced yield due to market conditions. the following is a summary of the risks associated with these deposits and how these risks are mitigated:
•credit risk: when a clearing house has the ability to hold cash collateral at a central bank, the clearing house utilizes its access to the central bank system to minimize credit risk exposures. credit risk is managed by using exposure limits depending on the credit profile of the counterparty as well as the nature and maturity of transactions. our investment objective is to invest in securities that preserve principal while maximizing yields, without significantly increasing risk. we seek to substantially mitigate the credit risk associated with investments by placing them with governments, well-capitalized financial institutions and other creditworthy counterparties.
an ongoing review is performed to evaluate changes in the financial status of counterparties. in addition to the intrinsic creditworthiness of counterparties, our policies require diversification of counterparties (banks, financial institutions, bond issuers and funds) so as to avoid a concentration of risk.
•liquidity risk: liquidity risk is the risk a clearing house may not be able to meet its payment obligations in the right currency, in the right place and at the right time. to mitigate this risk, the clearing houses monitor liquidity requirements closely and maintain funds and assets in a manner which minimizes the risk of loss or delay in the access by the clearing house to such funds and assets. for example, holding funds with a central bank where possible or making only short term investments such as overnight reverse repurchase agreements serves to reduce liquidity risks.
•interest rate risk: interest rate risk is the risk that interest rates rise and cause the value of securities we hold or invest in to decline. if we were required to sell securities prior to maturity, and interest rates had risen, the sale might be made at a loss relative to the carrying value. our clearing houses seek to manage this risk by making short term investments. for example, where possible and in accordance with regulatory requirements, the clearing houses invest cash pursuant to overnight reverse repurchase agreements or term reverse repurchase agreements with short dated maturities. in addition, the clearing house investment guidelines allow for direct purchases of high quality sovereign debt (for example, u.s. treasury securities) and supranational debt instruments (euro cash deposits only) with short dated maturities.
•security issuer risk: security issuer risk is the risk that an issuer of a security defaults on the payment when the security matures or debt is serviced. this risk is mitigated by limiting allowable investments under the reverse repurchase agreements to high quality sovereign or government agency debt and limiting any direct investments to high quality sovereign debt instruments.
•investment counterparty risk: investment counterparty risk is the risk that a reverse repurchase agreement counterparty might become insolvent and, thus, fail to meet its obligations to our clearing houses. we mitigate this risk by only engaging in transactions with high credit quality counterparties and by limiting the acceptable collateral to securities of high quality issuers. when engaging in reverse repurchase agreements, our clearing houses take delivery of the securities underlying the reverse repurchase arrangement in custody accounts under clearing house control. additionally, the securities purchased subject to reverse repurchase have a market value greater than the reverse repurchase amount. thus, in the event that a reverse repurchase counterparty defaults on its obligation to repurchase the underlying reverse repurchase securities, our clearing house will have possession of a security with a value potentially greater than the counterparty's obligation.
the ice clearing houses may use third-party investment advisors who make investments subject to the guidelines provided by each clearing house. clearing house property is held in custody accounts under clearing house control with credit worthy custodians. the ice clearing houses employ (or may employ) multiple investment advisors and custodians to ensure that in the event a single advisor or custodian is unable to fulfill its role, additional advisors or custodians are available as alternatives.
•cross-currency margin deposit risk: each of the ice clearing houses may permit posting of cross-currency collateral to satisfy margin requirements (for example, accepting margin deposits denominated in u.s. dollars to secure a euro margin obligation). the ice clearing houses mitigate the risk of a currency value exposure by applying a "haircut" to the currency posted as margin at a level viewed as sufficient to provide financial protection during periods of currency volatility. cross-currency balances are marked-to-market on a daily basis. should the currency posted to satisfy margin requirements decline in value, the clearing member is required to increase its margin deposit on a same-day basis.
impact of inflation we have not been materially adversely affected by inflation as technological advances and competition have generally caused prices for the hardware and software that we use for our electronic platforms to remain constant. in the event of continued inflation, we believe that we will be able to pass on any price increases to our participants, as the prices that we charge are not governed by long-term contracts.

definition and limitations of internal control over financial reporting a company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. a company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

we also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board (united states) (pcaob), the company's internal control over financial reporting as of december 31, 2023, based on criteria established in internal control-integrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission (2013 framework), and our report dated february 8, 2024 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.
basis for opinion these financial statements are the responsibility of the company's management. our responsibility is to express an opinion on the company's financial statements based on our audits. we are a public accounting firm registered with the pcaob and are required to be independent with respect to the company in accordance with the u.s. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the securities and exchange commission and the pcaob.
we conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the pcaob. those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. we believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
critical audit matters the critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective or complex judgments. the communication of the critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.
accounting for business combinations description of the matter as discussed in note 3 to the consolidated financial statements, during 2023, the company completed its acquisition of black knight, inc. (black knight) for aggregate consideration of $11.8 billion. this transaction was accounted for as a business combination.
auditing the company's accounting for its acquisition of black knight was complex due to the significant estimation in the company's determination of fair value of identified intangible assets of $4.9 billion, which principally consisted of customer relationships, trademark/tradenames, developed technology, data and databases and in-process research and development (collectively referred to as the identified intangibles). the significant estimation was primarily due to sensitivity of the fair value to underlying assumptions about future performance of the acquired business in the company's discounted cash flow models used to measure the identified intangibles. the most significant of these assumptions included the revenue and margin growth rates that form the basis of the forecasted results and the discount rate.
how we addressed the matter in our audit 0000 we obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of the company's controls that address the risk of material misstatement relating to the company's accounting for the acquisition, including the estimated fair value of identified intangible assets. for example, we tested controls over management's review of significant assumptions used in its respective valuation models of the identified intangibles.
to test the estimated fair value of the identified intangibles, we performed audit procedures that included, among others, evaluating the valuation methodology and significant assumptions used by the company's valuation specialist, and evaluating the completeness and accuracy of the underlying data supporting the estimated fair value. we involved our valuation specialists to assist with our assessment of the appropriateness of the valuation methodology applied by the company and significant assumptions included in the fair value estimate, including testing the revenue and margin growth rates that form the basis of the forecasted results and the discount rate. for example, we compared these significant assumptions to current industry, market and economic trends, assumptions used to value similar assets in other acquisitions, historical results of the acquired business, and the company's budgets and forecasts. in addition, we performed sensitivity analysis over those assumptions. we also evaluated the adequacy of the company's disclosures included in note 3 in relation to these acquisition matters.
accounting for income taxes description of the matter as discussed in note 13 to the consolidated financial statements, the company operates globally and files income tax returns in the u.s. and in various state, local and foreign jurisdictions. uncertainty in a tax position may arise because tax laws and rulings are subject to interpretation in each jurisdiction. the company uses significant judgment to (1) determine whether, based on the technical merits, a tax position is more likely than not to be sustained and (2) measure the amount of tax benefit that qualifies for recognition. as of december 31, 2023, the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits was $268 million, of which $228 million, if recognized, would impact the company's effective tax rate.
auditing management's analysis of the company's uncertain tax positions and the related unrecognized tax benefits was challenging as the analysis involved significant judgment due to the complex interpretations and application of tax laws and rulings.
how we addressed the matter in our audit we obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of the controls related to management's accounting for uncertain tax positions. for example, we tested controls relating to the completeness of management's identification of uncertain tax positions and the application of the recognition and measurement principles, including management's review of the inputs and calculations of unrecognized tax benefits.
our audit procedures included, among others, testing management's assessment of which uncertain tax positions are more likely than not to be sustained and the measurement of the amount of tax benefit that is more likely than not to be realized. to test management's assessment, we performed procedures that included, among others, evaluating management's analysis by jurisdiction, including any communications with taxing authorities, tax controversy and litigation trends, and the technical merits of the uncertain tax positions. we involved our tax professionals with specialized skill and knowledge to evaluate the recognition of the uncertain tax positions and the measurement of the unrecognized tax benefit based on the relevant tax laws, rulings and guidance issued by taxing authorities, as well as their experience with the taxing authorities. we also evaluated the adequacy of the company's disclosures included in note 13 in relation to these tax matters.

intercontinental exchange, inc. and subsidiaries notes to consolidated financial statements
1.description of business nature of business and organization intercontinental exchange, inc. is a leading global provider of technology and data to a broad range of customers including financial institutions, corporations and government entities. these products, which span major asset classes including futures, equities, fixed income and united states, or u.s., residential mortgages, provide our customers with access to mission critical tools that are designed to increase asset class transparency and workflow efficiency. our business is conducted through three reportable business segments:
•exchanges: we operate regulated marketplace technology for the listing, trading and clearing of a broad array of derivatives contracts and financial securities as well as data and connectivity services related to those venues.
•fixed income and data services: we provide fixed income pricing, reference data, indices, analytics and execution services as well as global credit default swap, or cds, clearing and multi-asset class data delivery technology.
•mortgage technology: we provide a technology platform that offers customers comprehensive, digital workflow tools that aim to address inefficiencies and mitigate risks that exist in the u.s. residential mortgage market life cycle from application through closing, servicing and the secondary market.
we operate marketplaces, technology and provide data services in the u.s., united kingdom, or u.k., european union, or eu, canada, asia pacific and the middle east.
2.summary of significant accounting policies basis of presentation the accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared by us in accordance with u.s. generally accepted accounting principles, or u.s. gaap. these statements include the accounts of our wholly-owned and controlled subsidiaries. for consolidated subsidiaries in which our ownership is less than 100% and for which we have control over the assets and liabilities and the management of the entity, the outside stockholders' interests are shown as non-controlling interests.
all intercompany balances and transactions between us and our wholly-owned and controlled subsidiaries have been eliminated in consolidation. the financial results of companies we acquire are included from the acquisition dates and the results of companies we sold are included up to the disposition dates. the accounting policies used to prepare these financial statements are the same as those used to prepare the consolidated financial statements in prior years.
use of estimates preparing financial statements in conformity with u.s. gaap requires us to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying disclosures. actual amounts could differ from those estimates.
comprehensive income other comprehensive income includes foreign currency translation adjustments, our proportionate share of our equity method investments' other comprehensive income, and amortization of the difference in the projected benefit obligation and the accumulated benefit obligation associated with benefit plan liabilities, each of which is net of tax.
segment and geographic information as of december 31, 2023, our business is conducted through three reportable business segments: exchanges, fixed income and data services, and mortgage technology. this presentation is reflective of how our chief operating decision maker reviews and operates our business. the majority of our identifiable assets are located in the u.s and u.k. (see note 19).
cash and cash equivalents, short-term and long-term restricted cash and cash equivalents, and cash and cash equivalent margin deposits and guaranty funds cash and cash equivalents we consider all short-term, highly liquid investments with maturities of three months or less at the time of purchase to be cash equivalents.
short-term and long-term restricted cash and cash equivalents we classify all cash and cash equivalents that are not available for immediate or general business use by us as restricted in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets (see note 7). this includes amounts set aside due to regulatory requirements, earmarked for specific purposes, or restricted by specific agreements. we also invest a portion of funds in excess of short-term operating needs in term deposits and investment-grade marketable debt securities, including government or government-sponsored agencies and corporate debt securities. these are classified as cash equivalents, are short-term in nature and carrying amount approximates fair value.
original margin, variation margin and guaranty funds received by our clearing houses may be in the form of cash, government obligations, certain agency debt, letters of credit or on rare occasions, gold (see note 14). we hold the cash deposits at central banks, highly-rated financial institutions or at times secure the cash through reverse repurchase agreements or direct investments, certain of which are not cash equivalents. see "credit risk and significant customers", below. although not included in short term restricted cash and cash equivalents, cash and cash equivalent margin represent a form of restricted cash, and exclude invested deposits, delivery contracts receivable and unsettled variation margin since those amounts represent invested cash and not a form of restricted cash.
consolidated statement of cash flows presentation a reconciliation of the components of cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash and cash equivalents, and cash and cash equivalent margin deposits and guaranty funds as presented in the consolidated statements of cash flows to the balance sheet is as follows (in millions):
as of december 31, 2023                as of december 31, 2022                as of december 31, 2021
investments we have made various investments in debt securities and equity securities of other companies. we also invest in mutual funds and fixed income securities. we classify all other investments that are not cash equivalents with original maturity dates of less than one year as short-term investments and all investments that we intend to hold for more than one year as long-term investments. short-term and long-term investments are included in other current and other non-current assets, respectively, in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.
debt securities we periodically purchase debt securities including u.s. treasury securities or other high quality sovereign debt for purposes of meeting regulatory capital requirements at certain of our clearing houses. we classify these investments as trading securities with changes in fair value included in interest income in the consolidated statements of income. these short term debt securities are primarily included in restricted short-term investments in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.
equity investments our equity investments are subject to valuation under asu 2016-01, financial instruments- overall (subtopic 825-10): recognition and measurement of financial assets and financial liabilities, or asu 2016-01. investments in equity securities, or equity investments, are carried at fair value and included in other non-current assets, with changes in fair value, whether realized or unrealized, recognized in net income. for those investments that we do not control and which do not have readily determinable fair market values, such as those which are not publicly-listed companies, we apply the measurement alternative. under the measurement alternative, these investments are recorded at cost minus impairment and adjusted to fair value if and when there is an observable price change in an orderly transaction of a similar or identical investment, with any change in fair value recognized in net income. the carrying amount of our investments without readily determinable fair values was $86 million as of december 31, 2023.
equity method investments when we do not have a controlling financial interest in an entity but exercise significant influence over the entity's operating and financial policies, such investments are accounted for using the equity method and included in other non-current assets. we recognize dividends when declared as a reduction in the carrying value of our equity method investments. at the end of each reporting period, we record our share of profits or losses of our equity method investments as equity earnings included in other income. we evaluate our equity method investments for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that a decline in value has occurred that is other than temporary. if the investment is determined to have a decline in value deemed to be other than temporary it is written down to estimated fair value. we did not record any impairment charges on our equity method investments in 2023.
property and equipment property and equipment is recorded at cost, reduced by accumulated depreciation (see note 8). depreciation and amortization is computed using the straight-line method based on estimated useful lives of the assets, or in the case of leasehold improvements, the shorter of the remaining lease term or the estimated useful life of the improvement. we review the remaining estimated useful lives at each balance sheet date and make adjustments whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the remaining useful lives have changed. gains on disposals are included in other income and losses on disposals are included in depreciation expense. maintenance and repair costs are expensed as incurred.
allowance for doubtful accounts the allowance for doubtful accounts is maintained at a level that we believe to be sufficient to absorb probable losses over the expected life in our accounts receivable portfolio in accordance with asc 326, financial instruments - credit losses. we estimate our allowance for doubtful accounts using an aging method, disaggregated based on major revenue stream categories as well as other unique revenue stream factors. the allowance is based on several factors, including continuous assessments of risk characteristics, specific customer events that may impact its ability to meet its financial obligations, and other reasonable and supportable economic characteristics. accounts receivable are written-off against the allowance for doubtful accounts when collection efforts cease.
a reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of allowance for doubtful accounts is as follows for the years ended december 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021 (in millions):
beginning balance of allowance for doubtful accounts            $22                       $24                       $27
charge-offs                                                    (18)                      (13)                      (16)
ending balance of allowance for doubtful accounts               $21                       $22                       $24
charge-offs in the table above represent the write-off of uncollectible receivables, net of recoveries. these amounts also include the impact of foreign currency translation adjustments.
software development costs we capitalize costs related to software we develop or obtain for internal use. the costs capitalized include both internal and external direct and incremental costs. general and administrative costs related to developing or obtaining such software are expensed as incurred. development costs incurred during the preliminary or maintenance project stages are expensed as incurred. costs incurred during the application development stage are capitalized and amortized using the straight-line method over the useful life of the software, generally not exceeding three years (except for certain software which has a seven-year useful life). amortization begins when the software is ready for its intended use.
accrued employee benefits we have a defined benefit pension plan and other postretirement benefit plans, or collectively the "benefit plans," covering certain of our u.s. operations. the benefit accrual for the pension plan is frozen. we recognize the funded status of the benefit plans in our consolidated balance sheets, measure the fair value of plan assets and benefit obligations as of the date of our fiscal year-end, and provide additional disclosures in the footnotes (see note 17).
benefit plan costs and liabilities are dependent on assumptions used in calculating such amounts. these are provided by a third-party specialist and include discount rates, health care cost trend rates, benefits earned, interest cost, expected return on assets, mortality rates and other factors. actual results that differ from the assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods and, therefore, generally affect recognized expense and the recorded obligation in future periods. however, certain of these unrecognized amounts are recognized when triggering events occur, such as when a settlement of pension obligations in excess of total interest and service costs occurs. while we believe that the assumptions used are appropriate, differences in actual experience or changes in assumptions may affect our pension and other post-retirement obligations and future expense recognized.
goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price of our acquisitions over the fair value of identifiable net assets acquired, including other identified intangible assets (see note 9). we recognize specifically-identifiable intangibles when a specific right or contract is acquired. that value is determined with the assistance of third-party valuation specialists. goodwill has been allocated to our reporting units for purposes of impairment testing based on the portion of synergy, cost savings and other expected future cash flows expected to benefit the reporting units at the time of the acquisition. the reporting units identified for our goodwill testing are: the nyse, other exchanges, fixed income and data services, and mortgage technology. goodwill impairment testing is performed annually at the reporting unit level in the fiscal fourth quarter or more frequently if conditions exist that indicate that it may be impaired, or if changes are made to the reporting units.
for both goodwill and indefinite-lived impairment testing we have the option to first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit or indefinite lived intangible asset is less than its carrying amount. if the fair value of the reporting unit or indefinite-lived intangible asset is less than its carrying value, an impairment loss is recognized in earnings in an amount equal to the difference. alternatively, we may choose to bypass the qualitative option and perform quantitative testing to determine if the fair value is less than carrying value. for our goodwill impairment testing, we have elected to bypass the qualitative assessment and apply the quantitative approach. for our testing of indefinite-lived intangible assets, we apply qualitative and quantitative approaches.
long-lived assets and finite-lived intangible assets we review our long-lived and finite-lived intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be fully recoverable. when these indicators exist, we project undiscounted net future cash flows over the remaining life of such assets. if the sum of the projected cash flows is less than the carrying amount, an impairment would exist, measured based upon the difference between the carrying amount and the fair value of the assets. finite-lived intangible assets are generally amortized using the straight-line method over the lesser of their contractual or estimated useful lives.
all costs related to internally developed patents and trademarks are expensed as incurred. all costs related to purchased patents, trademarks and internet domain names are recorded as other intangible assets and are amortized using a straight-line method over their estimated useful lives. all costs related to licensed patents are capitalized and amortized using a straight-line method over the term of the license.
derivatives and hedging activity periodically, we may use derivative financial instruments to manage exposure to changes in currency exchange rates. all derivatives are recorded at fair value. we generally do not designate these derivatives as hedges for accounting purposes. accordingly, changes in fair value are recognized in income.
we entered into foreign currency hedging transactions during 2023, 2022 and 2021 as economic hedges to help mitigate a portion of our foreign exchange risk exposure. the gains and losses on these transactions were not material during these years.
income taxes we recognize income taxes under the liability method. we recognize a current tax liability or tax asset for the estimated taxes payable or refundable on tax returns for the current year. we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax bases of assets and liabilities. we establish valuation allowances if we believe that it is more likely than not that some or all of our deferred tax assets will not be realized. deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using current enacted tax rates in effect. we do not recognize a tax benefit unless we conclude that it is more likely than not that the benefit will be sustained on audit by the taxing authority based solely on the technical merits of the associated tax position. if the recognition threshold is met, we recognize a tax benefit measured at the largest amount of the tax benefit that, in our judgment, is greater than 50 percent likely to be realized. we recognize accrued interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions as a component of income tax expense. we recognize the tax effects related to global intangible low-taxed income in the period it is incurred.
we are subject to tax in numerous domestic and foreign jurisdictions primarily based on our operations in these jurisdictions. significant judgment is required in assessing the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns. fluctuations in the actual outcome of these future tax consequences could have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations.
we use a portfolio approach with respect to pension, postretirement benefits plan obligations and currency translation matters when we determine the timing and extent to which stranded income tax effects from items that were previously recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income are released.
revenue recognition our revenues primarily consist of revenues for transactions executed and/or cleared through our global electronic derivatives trading and clearing exchanges and cash equities trading as well as revenues related to our fixed income, data services, mortgage technology services and listings. we recognize revenue when we transfer promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which we expect to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. we enter into contracts that can include various combinations of products and services, which are generally capable of being distinct and accounted for as separate performance obligations. we also evaluate all contracts in order to determine appropriate gross versus net revenue reporting.
substantially all of our revenues are considered to be revenues from contracts with customers. the related accounts receivable balances are recorded in our balance sheets as customer accounts receivable. we do not have obligations for warranties, returns or refunds to customers, other than rebates, which are settled each period and therefore do not result in variable consideration. we do not have significant revenue recognized from performance obligations that were satisfied in prior periods. certain judgments and estimates are used in the identification and timing of satisfaction of performance obligations and the related allocation of transaction price. we believe that these represent a faithful depiction of the transfer of services to our customers.
deferred revenue represents our contract liabilities related to our annual, original and other listings revenues, certain data services, clearing services, mortgage technology services and other revenues. see note 6 for our discussion of deferred revenue balances, activity, and expected timing of recognition.
we have elected not to provide disclosures about transaction price allocated to unsatisfied performance obligations if contract durations are less than one year, or if we are not required to estimate the transaction price. for all of our contracts with customers, except for listings and certain data, mortgage and clearing services, our performance obligations are short term in nature and there is no significant variable consideration. in addition, we have elected the practical expedient of excluding sales taxes from transaction prices.
we capitalize incremental contract acquisition costs that relate directly to an existing contract or a specific anticipated contract and are expected to be recovered. costs that would have been incurred regardless of whether the contract was obtained are expensed as incurred. as a practical expedient, we expense incremental costs of obtaining a contract if the amortization period of the asset would be one year or less. we also consider whether to capitalize costs to fulfill a contract that may be incurred before we commence performance on an obligation. these costs represent incremental, recoverable external costs and certain internal costs that are directly related to the contract and are primarily associated with costs of resources involved in installation of systems, processes and data conversion. these capitalized costs are amortized on a systematic basis consistent with the transfer to the customer of the solutions or services to which the asset relates. we consider the explicit term of the contract with the customer, expected renewals and the rate of change related to our solutions in determining the amortization period.
activity assessment fees and section 31 fees we pay the securities and exchange commission, or sec, fees pursuant to section 31 of the securities exchange act of 1934 for transactions executed on our u.s. equities and options exchanges. these section 31 fees are designed to recover the costs to the government for supervising and regulating the securities markets and securities professionals. we (or the options clearing corporation, or occ, on our behalf), in turn, collect activity assessment fees, which are included in exchanges revenues in the accompanying consolidated statements of income, from member organizations clearing or settling trades on the u.s. equities and options exchanges and recognize these amounts as revenue. fees received are included in cash at the time of receipt and, as required by law, the amount due to the sec is remitted semi-annually and recorded as an accrued liability until paid. the activity assessment fees are designed so that they are equal to the section 31 fees paid by us to the sec. as a result, section 31 fees do not have an impact on our net income.
interest on margin deposits and fees charged for non-cash margin for purposes of safeguarding customer funds, guaranty fund and original margin deposits of clearing members and their customers are maintained in accounts with national banks and highly-rated financial institutions or secured through other vehicles. interest earned on these deposits is provided back to clearing members net of certain costs and administrative fees charged and retained by ice. the ice clearing houses also charge fees for clearing members pledging non-cash margin in lieu of cash margin, and these fees are fully retained by ice. the safeguarding of clearing member funds is considered a core part of the clearing houses' operations, and therefore, the net interest and fees are included in total revenues within the consolidated statements of income.
stock-based compensation we currently have employee and non-employee director incentive plans from which we grant stock options, restricted shares, and restricted stock units with various service, performance, and/or market conditions. we also have an employee stock purchase plan, or espp, to provide additional and incentive-based compensation to our employees and directors (see note 11). stock options and restricted stock are granted at the discretion of the compensation committee of the board of directors. we measure and recognize compensation expense for share-based payment awards, including employee stock options, restricted stock and shares purchased under the espp based on estimated fair values on the date of grant. the value of the portion of the award that is ultimately expected to vest is recognized as stock-based compensation expense over the requisite service period.
we use the black-scholes pricing model to value stock option awards as well as shares purchased as part of our espp. the values estimated by the model are affected by the price of our stock as well as subjective variables that include assumed interest rates, our expected dividend yield, our expected share price volatility over the term of the awards and actual and projected employee stock option exercise behavior. under our espp, employees may purchase shares of our common stock at a price equal to 85% of the lesser of the fair market value of the stock on the first or the last trading day of each offering period. we record compensation expenses related to the discount given to our participating employees.
treasury stock we record treasury stock activities under the cost method whereby the cost of the acquired stock is recorded as treasury stock (see note 12). in the event it occurs in the future, our accounting policy upon the formal retirement of treasury stock is to deduct the par value from common stock and to reflect any excess of cost over par value as a deduction from additional paid-in capital (to the extent created by previous issuances of the shares) and retained earnings.
credit risk and significant customers our clearing houses are exposed to credit risk as a result of maintaining clearing member cash deposits at various financial institutions (see note 14). cash deposit accounts are established at large, highly-rated financial institutions and entered into so that they restrict the rights of offset or imposition of liens by the banks. we also limit our risk of loss by holding the majority of the cash deposits in cash accounts at the federal reserve bank of chicago, high quality short-term sovereign debt reverse repurchase agreements with several different counterparty banks or direct investments in short-term high quality sovereign and supranational debt issues primarily with original maturities of less than three months. while we seek to achieve a reasonable rate of return which may generate interest income for our clearing members, we are primarily concerned with preservation of capital and managing the risks associated with these deposits. as the clearing houses may pass on interest revenues, minus costs, to the members, this could include negative or reduced yield due to market conditions.
when engaging in reverse repurchase agreements, our clearing houses take delivery of the underlying securities in custody accounts under clearing house control. additionally, the securities purchased have a market value greater than the reverse repurchase amount. the typical haircut received for high quality sovereign debt is 2% of the reverse repurchase amount. thus, in the event that a reverse repurchase counterparty defaults on its obligation to repurchase the underlying reverse repurchase securities, our clearing house will have possession of securities with a value potentially greater than the reverse repurchase counterparty's obligation to the clearing house.
ice clear credit, a systemically important financial market utility as designated by the financial stability oversight council, maintains a u.s. dollar account at the federal reserve bank of chicago as of december 31, 2023. ice clear europe maintains a euro-denominated account at the european central bank, or ecb, the central bank of the netherlands, as well as pounds sterling- and euro-denominated accounts at the bank of england, or boe, the central bank of the u.k. these accounts provide the flexibility for ice clear europe to place euro- and pounds sterling-denominated cash margin securely at national banks, in particular during periods when liquidity in the euro and pounds sterling repo markets may temporarily become contracted. such accounts are intended to decrease ice clear credit and ice clear europe's custodial, liquidity and operational risk as compared to alternative custodial and investment arrangements.
our futures businesses have minimal credit risk as the majority of their transaction revenues are currently cleared through our clearing houses. our accounts receivable related to fixed income and data services revenues, cash trading, listing revenues, technology revenues, cds and bilateral over-the-counter, or otc, energy transaction revenues and mortgage technology services subjects us to credit (collection) risk, as we do not require these customers to post collateral. we limit our risk of loss by terminating a customer's ability to remain listed or receive data or terminating other services for entities with delinquent accounts. the concentration of risk on accounts receivable is also mitigated by the large number of entities comprising our customer base. excluding clearing members, there were no individual accounts receivable balances greater than 10% of total consolidated accounts receivable as of december 31, 2023 or december 31, 2022. our accounts receivable are stated at the billed amount.
leases we record our leases in accordance with asc 842, leases. at lease inception, we review the service arrangement and components of a contract to identify if a lease or embedded lease arrangement exists. an indicator of a contract containing a lease is when we have the right to control and use an identified asset over a period of time in exchange for consideration. operating lease right-of-use assets and liabilities are recorded at the lease commencement date based on the present value of the lease payments to be made over the lease term. as the rate implicit in the lease is not readily determinable in most of our leases, we use our incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at the commencement date in determining the present value of lease payments. certain lease agreements include options to extend, renew or terminate the lease agreement and these terms are evaluated at inception and on an ongoing basis to determine the lease term.
we have elected the short-term lease policy to recognize leases with a term of 12 months or less as rent expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term and do not recognize these short-term leases on our balance sheet. we have elected the practical expedient of not separating lease and non-lease components as our lease arrangements are not highly dependent on other underlying assets. our lease agreements do not contain any residual value guarantees. rent expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. rent expense is included in rent and occupancy expenses and technology and communication expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements of income (see note 15).
acquisition-related transaction and integration costs we incur incremental costs relating to our completed and potential acquisitions and other strategic opportunities. this includes fees for investment banking advisors, lawyers, accountants, tax advisors and public relations firms, as well as costs associated with credit facilities and other external costs directly related to the proposed or closed transactions. in accordance with asc 805, business combinations, acquisition-related transaction and integration costs, excluding costs to issue debt or equity securities, are expensed in the period in which these costs are incurred and the services are received and are not included in the purchase price.
the acquisition-related transaction and integration costs incurred during 2023 and 2022 were primarily related to direct costs incurred related to our acquisition and integration of black knight and our integration of ellie mae inc., or ellie mae (see note 3). the acquisition-related transaction and integration costs incurred during 2021 were primarily due to legal and consulting expenses related to the bakkt transaction and direct costs related to our integration of ellie mae.
fair value of financial instruments fair value is the price that would be received from selling an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. our financial instruments consist primarily of certain short-term and long-term assets and liabilities, customer accounts receivable, margin deposits and guaranty funds, equity and equity method investments, and short-term and long-term debt (see note 18).
the fair value of our financial instruments is measured based on a three-level hierarchy:
•level 1 inputs - quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets.
•level 2 inputs - observable inputs other than level 1 inputs such as quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets or inputs other than quoted prices that are directly observable.
•level 3 inputs - unobservable inputs supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities.
foreign currency translation adjustments and foreign currency transaction gains and losses our functional and reporting currency is the u.s. dollar. we have exposure to foreign currency translation gains and losses arising from our net investment in certain u.k., continental european, asian and canadian subsidiaries. the revenues, expenses and financial results of these subsidiaries are recorded in the functional currency of the countries that these subsidiaries are located in, which are primarily pounds sterling and euros. the financial statements of these subsidiaries are translated into u.s. dollars using a current rate of exchange, with gains or losses, net of tax as applicable, included in the cumulative translation adjustment account, a component of equity. as of december 31, 2023 and 2022, the portion of our equity attributable to accumulated other comprehensive loss from foreign currency translation adjustments was $230 million and $278 million, respectively.
we have foreign currency transaction gains and losses related to the settlement of foreign currency denominated assets, liabilities and payables that occur through our operations. these transaction gains and losses are due to the increase or decrease in the foreign currency exchange rates between periods. forward contracts on foreign currencies are entered into to manage the foreign currency exchange rate risk. gains and losses from foreign currency transactions are included in other income/(expense) in the accompanying consolidated statements of income and resulted in net losses of $12 million, $9 million and $13 million in 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively.
earnings per common share basic earnings per common share is calculated using the weighted average common shares outstanding during the year. common equivalent shares from stock options and restricted stock awards, using the treasury stock method, are included in the diluted per share calculations unless the effect of inclusion would be antidilutive (see note 20).

asu 2023-09, income taxes (topic 740): improvements to income tax disclosures, requires greater disaggregation of income tax disclosures related to the income tax rate reconciliation and income taxes paid. the asu also requires disclosure of income (or loss) from continuing operations before income tax expense (or benefit) disaggregated between domestic and foreign and disclosure of income tax expense (or benefit) from continuing operations broken out between federal, state/local and foreign. this standard is effective for our annual periods beginning after december 15, 2024, with early adoption permitted. the asu applies on a prospective basis to the annual financial statements for the periods beginning after the effective date. retrospective application in all prior periods presented is permitted.         we do not expect to adopt this asu early and plan to adopt the asu for our 2025 annual financial statements.         we are currently evaluating the impact of adopting this asu on our income taxes disclosures.
3.acquisitions and divestitures acquisitions and divestitures company                                   transaction date                    primary segment            description black knight, inc., or black knight       acquired on 9/5/2023                mortgage technology        black knight is a software, data and analytics company that serves the housing finance continuum, including real estate data, mortgage lending and servicing, as well as the secondary markets. see below for the black knight preliminary purchase price allocation and supplemental pro forma financial information. pursuant to the certain agreement and plan of merger, dated as of may 4, 2022, among ice, sand merger sub corporation, a wholly owned subsidiary of ice, or sub, and black knight, which we refer to as the "merger agreement," sub merged with and into black knight, which we refer to as the "merger," with black knight surviving as a wholly owned subsidiary of ice.
bakkt holdings, inc., or bakkt            deconsolidated on 10/15/2021        exchanges                  bakkt is a business with an integrated platform that enables consumers and institutions to transact in digital assets. the bakkt platform consists of two complementary aspects: a digital asset marketplace and loyalty redemption services.
in 2021, bakkt completed its merger with vpc impact acquisition holdings, or vih, a special purpose acquisition company sponsored by victory park capital, or vpc. following the closing, as a consequence of our inability to meet the power criterion through our variable interest and because of holding a minority voting interest in the combined company, during the fourth quarter of 2021 we deconsolidated bakkt upon loss of control and prospectively treat it as an equity method investment within our financial statements.
black knight, inc. acquisition on september 5, 2023, we acquired 100% of black knight for aggregate transaction consideration of approximately $11.8 billion, or $76 per share of black knight common stock, with cash comprising 90% of the value of the aggregate transaction consideration. the aggregate cash component of the transaction consideration was $10.5 billion. we issued 10.9 million shares of ice common stock to black knight stockholder, which was based on the market price of our common stock and the average of the volume weighted averages of the trading prices of our common stock on each of the ten consecutive trading days ending three trading days prior to the closing of the merger. we expect that this transaction will build on our position as a provider of end-to-end electronic workflow solutions for the rapidly evolving u.s. residential mortgage industry. we believe the black knight ecosystem adds value for clients of all sizes across the mortgage and real estate lifecycles by helping organizations lower costs, increase efficiencies, grow their businesses, and reduce risk.
on september 14, 2023, or the divestiture date, in connection with the merger agreement, we sold black knight's optimal blue and empower loan origination system, or los, businesses, or the divestitures, to subsidiaries of constellation software, inc. the cash proceeds from the divestitures were $241 million. the structure of the optimal blue transaction also included a promissory note with a face value of $500 million, or the promissory note, issued by the purchaser to black knight, as a subsidiary of ice, at the closing of the transaction. the promissory note has a 40-year term with a maturity date of september 5, 2063, and a coupon interest rate of 7.0% per year. as discussed in more detail below, the promissory note was valued at $235 million on the divestiture date. in accordance with accounting standards codification, or asc, 805, business combinations, or asc 805, as well as asc 360, impairment and disposal of long-lived assets, we are required to measure an acquired long-lived asset or disposal group that is classified as held for sale at the acquisition date at fair value less cost to sell. accordingly, there was no gain or loss recognized on the divestitures.
for the period between the acquisition date of september 5, 2023 through the divestiture date, the discontinued operations of empower and optimal blue were immaterial and have been included in acquisition-related transaction and integration costs in our consolidated statements of income.
pursuant to the agreement containing consent orders entered into between the federal trade commission, or the ftc, and ice and black knight, the promissory note was required to be sold within six months of the divestiture date. on february 7, 2024, the ftc approved the buyer of the promissory note and the proceeds of the promissory note sale will be paid to black knight in the near future. we have elected the fair value option for the right to receive the net proceeds of the sale of the promissory note, which was valued at $235 million based on level 3 inputs on the divestiture date (note 18). as we elected the fair value option for the promissory note, we are required to mark the asset to fair value each reporting period. for subsequent measurement as of december 31, 2023, we wrote down the value of the promissory note, resulting in a fair value loss of $160 million (note 18).
the estimated net fair value of the consideration transferred for black knight was approximately $11.4 billion as of the acquisition date, which consisted of the following (in millions):
* fair value of the ice common stock is based on the ice closing stock price on september 1, 2023.
the purchase price has been allocated to the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets and liabilities based on the preliminary respective estimated fair values on the date of acquisition. the excess of purchase price over the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets has been recorded as goodwill, of which $186 million is expected to be deductible for tax purposes. goodwill represents potential revenue synergies related to new product development, various expense synergies and opportunities to enter new markets and is assigned to our mortgage technology business segment. the preliminary purchase price allocation is as follows (in millions):
net preliminary purchase price allocation cash and cash equivalents                                                            $108
in performing the net preliminary purchase price allocation, we considered, among other factors, the intended future use of acquired assets, analysis of historical financial performance and estimates of future performance of the black knight business. for the identified intangible assets, the fair values have been preliminarily determined using the income and cost approaches and are partially based on inputs that are unobservable including forecasted future cash flows, revenue and margin growth rates, customer attrition rates and discount rates that require judgement and are subject to change. we have not yet obtained all of the information related to the fair value of the acquired assets and liabilities.
the primary areas of the preliminary purchase price allocation that are not yet finalized relate to the valuation of the identifiable intangible assets, income taxes, and certain other tangible assets and liabilities. the allocation of the purchase price will be finalized upon the completion of the analysis of the acquired assets and liabilities within one year of the date of acquisition.
the following table sets forth the components of the preliminary intangible assets associated with the acquisition as of december 31, 2023 (in millions, except years):

from the acquisition date through december 31, 2023, black knight revenues of $363 million, which are included in our mortgage technology revenues, and operating expenses of $470 million were recorded in our consolidated statements of income.
the financial information in the table below summarizes the combined results of operations of ice and black knight, on a pro forma basis, as though the companies had been combined as of the beginning of the prior period presented. the unaudited pro forma financial information is presented for informational purposes only and is not indicative of the results of operations that would have been achieved if the acquisition had taken place at the beginning of the period presented. such unaudited pro forma financial information is based on the historical financial statements of ice and black knight. this unaudited pro forma financial information is based on estimates and assumptions that have been made solely for purposes of developing such unaudited pro forma information, including, without limitation, purchase accounting adjustments, interest expense on debt issued to finance the purchase price, acquisition-related transaction costs, the removal of historical black knight intangible asset amortization and the addition of intangible asset amortization related to this acquisition. the unaudited pro forma financial information does not reflect any synergies or operating cost reductions that have been and may be achieved from the combined operations. the unaudited pro forma financial information combines the historical results for us and black knight for 2023 and 2022 in the following table (in millions).
transaction-based expenses included within revenues, less transaction-based expenses in the table above, were not impacted by pro forma adjustments and agree to the amounts presented historically in our consolidated income statements as they relate solely to ice and not to black knight.
bakkt transaction on october 15, 2021, bakkt completed its merger with vpc impact acquisition holdings, or vih, a special purpose acquisition company sponsored by victory park capital, or vpc. following completion of the business combination, we held an approximate 68% economic interest. as a result of limitations on ice from the bakkt voting agreement entered into in connection with the transaction, we hold a minority voting interest in the combined company. prior to the closing, bakkt revenues and operating expenses were reported within our consolidated revenues and operating expenses. following the closing, as a consequence of our inability to meet the power criterion through our variable interest and because of holding a minority voting interest in the combined company, during the fourth quarter of 2021 we deconsolidated bakkt upon loss of control and prospectively treat it as an equity method investment within our financial statements. we recorded a pre-tax gain on the transaction of $1.4 billion during the fourth quarter of 2021, which is included in other non-operating income within our consolidated income statement. the pre-tax gain is a result of recording an equity method investment value of $1.7 billion plus the removal of our redeemable non-controlling interest liability of $107 million, partially offset by the deconsolidation of bakkt net assets of $295 million and our additional pipe contribution of $47 million. as of december 31, 2023, we held an approximate 64% economic interest in bakkt.
4.investments equity investments dun & bradstreet in connection with our acquisition of black knight, we acquired an investment in dun & bradstreet holdings, inc., or d&b, a global provider of business decisioning data and analytics, which we classified as an equity investment. subsequent to the black knight acquisition and prior to december 31, 2023, we sold the entire investment for a total of $187 million and realized a total loss of $3 million on the sales, net of dividends received, which is included in other income/(expense), net in our consolidated statements of income in 2023.
euroclear we previously owned a 9.8% stake in euroclear, plc, or euroclear, that we originally purchased for $631 million. we participated on the euroclear board of directors, and we classified our investment in euroclear as an equity investment.
on may 20, 2022, we completed the sale of our 9.8% stake in euroclear. the carrying value of our investment was $700 million at the time of the sale and was classified within other current assets on our balance sheet. we recorded a net gain on the sale of $41 million, which is included in other income/(expense), net in our consolidated statements of income in 2022.
coinbase on december 1, 2014, we acquired preferred stock of coinbase global, inc., or coinbase, which operates a cryptocurrency exchange platform, for $10 million, representing a 1.4% ownership share on a fully-diluted, as-converted basis. on april 14, 2021, coinbase completed an initial public offering, or ipo. on april 15, 2021, we completed the sale of our investment in coinbase for $1.24 billion and recorded a gain of $1.23 billion, or $892 million net of tax, as other income/(expense), net in our consolidated statements of income.
equity method investments our equity method investments include occ and bakkt, among others. we recognized $122 million, $1.3 billion and $42 million as our share of estimated losses, net, from our equity method investments included in other income/(expense), net in our consolidated statements of income during 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. the estimated losses during 2023, 2022 and 2021 are primarily related to our investment in bakkt, partially offset by our share of occ profits. in addition, during 2022, after recording our share of bakkt's equity method losses, which included an impairment charge recorded by bakkt, we recorded an impairment in our investment in bakkt to its fair value as other expense. each period includes adjustments to reflect the difference between reported prior period actual results from our original estimates.
when performing our assessment of the carrying value of our investments, we consider, among other things, the length of time and the extent to which the market value has been less than our cost basis, if applicable, the investee's financial condition and near-term prospects, the economic or technological environment in which our investees operate, weakening of the general market condition of the related industry, whether an investee can continue as a going concern, any impairment charges recorded by an investee on goodwill, intangible or long-lived assets, and our intent and ability to retain the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in market value.
occ we own a 40% interest in occ through a direct investment by the nyse. occ is regulated by the sec as a registered clearing agency and by the commodity futures trading commission, or cftc, as a derivatives clearing organization. occ serves as a clearing house for securities options, security futures, commodity futures and options on futures traded on various independent exchanges. occ clears securities options traded on nyse arca and nyse amex options, along with other non-affiliated exchanges.
bakkt as of december 31, 2023, we hold an approximate 64% economic interest in bakkt and treat it as an equity method investment (see note 3). we recorded estimated equity losses and impairment of $1.4 billion during 2022 related to our investment in bakkt, which included the impairment discussed above, which was based on what we consider to be an other-than-temporary decline in fair value as a result of the factors noted above, and included consideration for the impairment charge recorded by bakkt. as of december 31, 2023, the carrying value of our investment in bakkt was determined to be $73 million. as bakkt is a public company with a readily available market price, the fair value of our investment using the quoted market price as of december 31, 2023 was $390 million. we have reviewed the performance indicators discussed above on our bakkt investment, noting that as of september 30, 2023, bakkt disclosed that it is monitoring its ability to continue as a going concern and recorded an impairment charge, our share of which was included in our equity losses in bakkt for the year ended december 31, 2023. we've evaluated our assessment of bakkt's performance, and based on the carrying value of our investment in bakkt, have not recorded an impairment of our investment as of december 31, 2023. bakkt has subsequently disclosed its conclusions regarding its substantial doubt of its ability to continue as a going concern. we will continue to monitor bakkt's financial performance to determine if any impairment of our investment exists in the future.
we concluded that bakkt meets the significance test under rule 3-09 of regulation s-x for 2022. bakkt's total assets and liabilities as of december 31, 2022 were $455 million and $119 million, respectively, and bakkt's net revenues and net loss in 2022 were $55 million and $2.0 billion, respectively. we concluded that bakkt no longer meets the significance test for 2023. in accordance with rule 3-09 of regulation s-x, as bakkt met the significance test for a prior year presented in these financial statements, bakkt financial statements as of and for the year ended december 31, 2023 will be filed subsequently as an amendment to this form 10-k.
5.revenue recognition our primary revenue contract classifications are described below. these categories best represent those with similar economic characteristics of the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of our revenues and cash flows.
exchanges revenues
•futures and options: revenues in our futures and options trading businesses primarily represent fees charged for the performance obligations of derivatives trading and clearing. in our derivatives markets, we earn transaction and clearing revenues from both counterparties to each contract that is traded and/or cleared.
our transaction and clearing revenues are primarily included in our exchanges segment with the exception of our cds and fixed income transaction and clearing revenues which are discussed below and are included in our fixed income and data services segment. derivatives trading and clearing fees contain two performance obligations: (1) trade execution/clearing novation and (2) risk management of open interest. while we allocate the transaction price between these two performance obligations, since they generally are satisfied almost simultaneously, there is no significant deferral of revenue. our exchanges segment futures and options transaction and clearing revenues are reported net of rebates. rebates were $928 million, $815 million and $982 million in 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. transaction and clearing fees can be variable based on trade volume discounts used in the determination of rebates, however virtually all volume discounts are calculated and recorded on a monthly basis. transaction and clearing fees, as well as any volume discounts rebated to our customers, are calculated and billed monthly in accordance with our published fee schedules.
•cash equities and equity options: revenues in our cash equity and equity options markets represent trade execution fees. cash trading and equity options contain one performance obligation related to each transaction which occurs instantaneously, and the revenue is recorded at the point in time of the transaction. we make liquidity payments to certain customers, as well as charge routing fees related to orders in our markets which are routed to other markets for execution and recognize those payments as a cost of revenue. in addition, we pay nyse regulatory oversight fees to the sec and collect equal amounts from our customers. these are also considered a cost of revenue, and both of these nyse-related fees are included in transaction-based expenses. for one of our equity option exchanges, revenues are reported net of rebates. rebates for that exchange were $61 million, $50 million and $51 million in 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively.
•listings: our listings revenues include original and annual listings fees, and other corporate action fees. each distinct listing fee is allocated to multiple performance obligations including original and incremental listing and investor relations services, as well as a customer's material right to renew the option to list on our exchanges. in performing this allocation, the standalone selling price of the listing services is based on the original and annual listing fees and the standalone selling price of the investor relations services is based on its market value. all listings fees are billed upfront and the identified performance obligations are satisfied over time. revenue related to the investor relations performance obligation is recognized ratably over the period these services are provided, with the remaining revenue recognized ratably over time as customers continue to list on our exchanges. listings fees related to other corporate actions are considered contract modifications of our listing contracts and are recognized ratably over time as customers continue to list on our exchanges.
•data and connectivity services: our data and connectivity services revenues are related to the various data and connectivity services that we provide which are directly attributable to our exchange venues. exchange data services include, among other offerings, proprietary real-time and historical pricing data, as well as order book and transaction information related to our global futures markets and the nyse exchanges. in addition, we receive a share of revenue from the national market system, or nms, plan. separately, we also provide connectivity services directly related to our futures, cash equity and options exchanges and clearing houses. data and connectivity services revenues are primarily subscription-based, billed monthly, quarterly or annually in advance and recognized ratably over time as our performance obligations of data delivery are met consistently throughout the period. considering that these contracts primarily consist of single performance obligations with fixed prices, there is no variable consideration and no need to allocate the transaction price.
•otc and other: our otc revenues are generated in our bilateral energy markets where we offer electronic trading on contracts based on physically settled natural gas, power and refined oil contracts. other revenues primarily include interest income on certain clearing margin deposits, regulatory penalties and fines, fees for use of our facilities, regulatory fees charged to member organizations of our u.s. securities exchanges, designated market maker service fees, exchange membership fees and agricultural grading and certification fees. generally, fees for otc and other revenues contain one performance obligation. because these contracts primarily consist of single performance obligations with fixed prices, there is no variable consideration and no need to allocate the transaction price. services for otc and other revenues are primarily satisfied at a point in time. therefore, there is no need to allocate the fee and no deferral results as we have no further obligation to the customer at that time.
in certain of our revenue share arrangements with third parties we control the delivered contract; in these arrangements we are acting as a principal and the revenue is recorded gross.
fixed income and data services revenues
•fixed income execution: execution fees, which include revenues from ice bonds, are reported net of rebates, and can be variable based on trade volume discounts used in the determination of rebates, however virtually all volume discounts are calculated and recorded on a monthly basis. execution fees and rebates are calculated and billed monthly in accordance with our published fee schedules. fixed income execution rebates were nominal in 2023, 2022 and 2021. in addition, we earn fixed income transaction fees on the trade execution of agency trades, commissions and net markups and markdowns on riskless principal trades. fixed income execution fees contain one performance obligation related to each transaction which occurs instantaneously, and the revenue is recorded at a point in time.
•cds clearing: cds clearing revenues are reported net of rebates. rebates were nominal in 2023, 2022 and 2021. we provide clearing services to the global cds market and the timing and nature of our cds transaction and clearing revenue is similar in nature to the exchanges segment transaction and clearing revenues discussed above. the cds derivatives trading and clearing fees contain two performance obligations: (1) trade execution/clearing novation and (2) risk management of open interest. while we allocate the transaction price between these two performance obligations, since they generally are satisfied almost simultaneously, there is no significant deferral of revenue. cds clearing revenues also include interest income on certain clearing margin deposits related to our cds clearing business which are satisfied at a point in time and consists of a single performance obligation.
•fixed income data and analytics, and other data and network services: fixed income data and analytics services revenues are recurring in nature and include evaluated pricing and reference data and analytics including sovereign, corporate and municipal bonds, mortgage and asset-backed securities, as well as leveraged loans. other data and network services include those related to the ice global network and our consolidated feeds business, as well as desktops and other multi-asset class analytics.
the nature and timing of each contract type for the data services above are similar in nature. data services revenues are primarily subscription-based, billed monthly, quarterly or annually in advance and recognized ratably over time as our performance obligations of data delivery are met consistently throughout the period. considering that these contracts primarily consist of single performance obligations with fixed prices, there is no variable consideration and no need to allocate the transaction price. in certain of our data contracts, where third parties are involved, we either arrange for the third party to transfer the services to our customers, or we transfer third-party data to our customers; in these arrangements we are acting as an agent and revenue is recorded net.
•origination technology: our origination technology acts as a system of record for the mortgage transaction. these revenues are based on recurring software as a service, or saas, subscription fees, with an additive transaction-based success-based pricing fee as lenders exceed the number of loans closed that are included with their monthly base subscription. in addition, the ice mortgage technology network provides originators connectivity to the mortgage supply chain and facilitates the secure exchange of information between our customers and third-party service providers, lenders and investors. revenue from the ice mortgage technology network is largely transaction-based.
performance obligations consist of a series of distinct services and support services. mortgage subscription customers simultaneously receive and consume benefits from our performance and revenues are recognized over time using a time elapsed measure of progress as our performance obligations are met consistently throughout the period. contracts generally range from one year to five years. success-based contracts are subject to monthly billing calculations whereby customers are obligated to pay the greater of a contractual base fee or variable closed loan fee based on the number of closed loan transactions processed by the customer in the specific month. under success-based contracts, monthly base fees are recognized ratably over the contract terms as subscription performance obligations are satisfied and closed loan fees in excess of base fees are considered variable consideration.
for the majority of contracts that include variable consideration, such fees meet the variable consideration allocation exception and are recognized in the month in which they are earned because the terms of the variable payments relate specifically to the outcome from transferring the distinct time increment (one month) of service and because such amounts reflect the fees to which we expect to be entitled for providing access to the encompass platform for that period. for certain contracts where the variable consideration allocation exception would not be met, total variable consideration to be received is estimated at contract inception and recognized ratably over the contract term. the amount of variable consideration included in the transaction price is constrained to ensure that it is probable that a significant reversal in the amount of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur when the amount of variable consideration is subsequently resolved. when agreements involve multiple distinct performance obligations, we allocate arrangement consideration to all performance obligations at the inception of an arrangement based on the relative standalone selling prices of each performance obligation.
•closing solutions: our closing solutions connect key participants to digitize the closing and recording process. for these services, we act as agent and revenues are recorded net. revenues for these services primarily contain one performance obligation related to each transaction which occurs instantaneously, and the revenues are primarily recorded at the point in time of the transaction. closing solutions also includes revenues from our merscorp holdings, inc., or mers database, which provides a system of record for recording and tracking changes and servicing rights and beneficial ownership interests in loans secured by u.s. residential real estate. mers database revenues contain multiple performance obligations related to each new loan registration and future transfers, and the revenues are primarily recorded at the point in time of each transaction. closing solutions revenues may include a fixed-fee subscription component recognized ratably over the contract term, as this method best depicts our pattern of performance.
•servicing software: our servicing software revenues include black knight's integrated mortgage servicing solutions, which help automate all areas of the servicing process. our servicing software includes business intelligence, mortgage default and servicing technology, digital mortgage solutions and related professional services. these revenues are primarily comprised of recurring saas offerings for various platforms. contracts for software and hosting solutions typically span five to seven years.
for our saas offerings, we promise our clients to stand ready to provide continuous access to our processing platforms. for this reason, processing services are generally viewed as a stand-ready performance obligation comprised of a series of distinct daily services. we typically satisfy these performance obligations over time as the services are provided. a time-elapsed output method is used to measure progress because our efforts are expended evenly throughout the period. we evaluate our variable payment terms related to these revenues, and they generally meet the criteria for allocating variable consideration entirely to one or more, but not all, performance obligations in a contract. accordingly, when the criteria are met, variable amounts based on the number and type of services performed during a period are allocated to and recognized on the day in which we perform the related services. fixed fees for processing services are generally recognized ratably over the contract period.
•data and analytics: revenues include those related to ice mortgage technology's analyzer (formerly known as aiq) and black knight's suite of data and analytics products and services. ice mortgage technology's analyzer streamlines data collection and validation through our automated document recognition and data extraction capabilities. analyzer revenues can be both recurring and transaction-based in nature. in addition, our data offerings include near real-time industry and peer benchmarking tools and a data as a service, or daas, offering for lenders to access industry data and origination information. revenues related to our data products are largely subscription-based and recurring in nature and recognized ratably over time as our performance obligations are met consistently throughout the period.
black knight's data and analytics revenues are primarily from licenses for new and historical property ownership data and valuation-related analytical services and are generally distinct. license fees are recognized at a point in time upon delivery. revenues allocated to data updates are recognized ratably over the period the updates are provided.
the following table depicts the disaggregation of our revenue according to business line and segment (in millions). amounts here have been aggregated as they follow consistent revenue recognition patterns, and are consistent with the segment information in note 19:

the exchanges segment and the fixed income and data services segment revenues above include data services revenues. our data services revenues are transferred over time, and a majority of those revenues are performed over a short period of time of one month or less and relate to subscription-based data services billed monthly, quarterly or annually in advance. these revenues are recognized ratably over time as our data delivery performance obligations are met consistently throughout the period.
the exchanges segment revenues transferred over time in the table above also include services related to listings, services related to risk management of open interest performance obligations and services related to regulatory fees, trading permits, and software licenses.
the fixed income and data services segment revenues transferred over time in the table above also include services related to risk management of open interest performance obligations, primarily in our cds business.
the mortgage technology segment revenues transferred over time in the table above primarily relate to our origination technology revenue where performance obligations consist of a series of distinct services and are recognized over the contract terms as performance obligations are satisfied, and to a lesser extent, professional services revenues and revenues from certain of our data and analytics and servicing software offerings.

6. deferred revenue our contract liabilities, or deferred revenue, represent consideration received that is yet to be recognized as revenue. total deferred revenue was $307 million as of december 31, 2023, including $200 million in current deferred revenue and $107 million in other non-current liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets. total deferred revenue was $254 million as of december 31, 2022, including $170 million in current deferred revenue and $84 million in other non-current liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets. see note 5 for a description of our listings, data services and mortgage technology services revenues and the revenue recognition policy for each of these revenue streams. the changes in our deferred revenue during 2023 and 2022 are as follows (in millions):
listing revenues                data services and other revenues                 mortgage technology                    total deferred revenue balance at january 1, 2022                    $112                                        $93                                     $79                          $284
(1) 2023 additions in our mortgage technology segment in the table above include $68 million of deferred revenue acquired on the date of the black knight acquisition (note 3) and $37 million of black knight related deferred revenue added in the period after the date of acquisition through december 31, 2023.
the mortgage technology deferred revenue balance as of december 31, 2023 primarily relates to origination and servicing technology subscription services for which the performance obligations have not yet been provided as of the balance sheet date but for which billings or payments have been received in advance. performance obligations for origination technology revenue consist of a series of distinct services and are recognized over the contract terms as performance obligations are satisfied.
included in the amortization recognized in 2023, $167 million was related to the deferred revenue balance as of january 1, 2023. included in the amortization in 2022, $195 million was related to the deferred revenue balance as of january 1, 2022. as of december 31, 2023, the remaining deferred revenue balance will be recognized over the period of time we satisfy our performance obligations. as of december 31, 2023, we estimate that our deferred revenue will be recognized in the following years (in millions):

transaction price allocated to future performance obligations our disclosure of transaction price allocated to these future performance obligations excludes the following:
•volume-based fees in excess of contractual minimums and other usage-based fees to the extent they are part of a single performance obligation and meet certain variable consideration allocation criteria;
•performance obligations that are part of a contract with an original expected duration of one year or less; and
•transactional fees based on a fixed fee per transaction when we have the right to invoice once we have completed the performance obligation.
as of december 31, 2023, the aggregate amount of the transaction price that is allocated to our future performance obligations was approximately $4.0 billion and primarily relates to contracts with customers in the mortgage technology segment. we expect this amount to be recognized as revenue as follows: 33% by december 31, 2024, 78% by december 31, 2026, 95% by december 31, 2028 and the rest thereafter.
7. short-term and long-term restricted cash, cash equivalents, and investments our total restricted cash, cash equivalents, and investments including short-term and long-term portions, consisted of the following (in millions):

black knight senior notes as of december 31, 2023, black knight's $1.0 billion principal amount of its 3.625% senior notes due in 2028 were outstanding. the notes became part of ice's consolidated long-term debt on the acquisition date of september 5, 2023.
•credit facility: we have a $3.9 billion senior unsecured revolving credit facility, or the credit facility, with future capacity to increase our borrowings under the credit facility by an additional $1.0 billion, subject to the consent of the lenders funding the increase and certain other conditions. on may 25, 2022, we agreed with the lenders to extend the maturity date of the credit facility from october 15, 2026, to may 25, 2027 and also exercised our option to increase the amount of the credit facility from $3.8 billion to $3.9 billion, among other items. we incurred new debt issuance costs of $4 million during 2022 relating to the credit facility, increased deferred debt issuance costs carried forward from previous credit facility extensions, and these costs are represented in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet as other non-current assets and will be amortized over the remaining life of the credit facility. no amounts were outstanding under the credit facility as of december 31, 2023.
as of december 31, 2023, of the $3.9 billion that was available for borrowing under the credit facility, $2.0 billion was required to backstop the amount outstanding under the commercial paper program, and $172 million was required to support certain broker-dealer and other subsidiary commitments. amounts required to back-stop notes outstanding under the commercial paper program will fluctuate as we increase or decrease our commercial paper borrowings. the remaining $1.8 billion is available for working capital and general corporate purposes including, but not limited to, acting as a back-stop to future increases in the amounts outstanding under the commercial paper program.
we also pay an annual commitment fee for unutilized amounts under the credit facility, payable in arrears at a rate that ranges from 0.08% to 0.20% determined based on our current long-term debt rating. as of december 31, 2023, the applicable rate for commitments to may 2027 was 0.125%. amounts borrowed under the credit facility may be prepaid at any time without premium or penalty.

commercial paper program our commercial paper program is currently backed by the borrowing capacity available under the credit facility, as described above. the effective interest rate of commercial paper issuances does not materially differ from short-term interest rates, which fluctuate due to market conditions and as a result may impact our interest expense.
in 2023, we issued $2.6 billion under the commercial paper program to fund a portion of the purchase price for the black knight acquisition, offset by net repayments of $600 million funded primarily by cash flows from operations. we had net repayments of $1.0 billion under the commercial paper program during 2022 funded, in part, by the net proceeds from our senior notes issued in may 2022.
as of december 31, 2023, commercial paper notes of $2.0 billion with original maturities ranging from 4 to 45 days were outstanding with a weighted average interest rate of 5.70% per annum, and a weighted average remaining maturity of 32 days. as of december 31, 2022, we did not have any notes outstanding under our commercial paper program.
on may 23, 2022, we issued $8.0 billion in aggregate principal amount of new fixed rate senior notes, comprised of the following:
•$1.25 billion in aggregate principal amount of 3.65% senior notes due in 2025, or the 2025 notes;

11.share-based compensation the non-cash compensation expenses recognized in our consolidated statements of income for stock options, restricted stock and under our employee stock purchase plan were $257 million, $155 million and $188 million in 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively, net of $18 million, $16 million and $13 million, respectively, that was capitalized as software development costs. the 2023 expense includes the expense related to the portion of the black knight replacement awards that were accelerated on the divestiture date, described below. the 2021 expense includes the expense related to the bakkt incentive units, described below. as of december 31, 2023, we had 37.8 million shares in total under various equity plans available for future issuance as stock option and restricted stock awards.
stock option plans stock options are granted with an exercise price equal to the fair value of our common stock on the grant date. we may grant, under provisions of the plans, both incentive stock options and nonqualified stock options. the options generally vest over three or four years and may generally be exercised up to ten years after the date of grant, but generally expire either 14 or 60 days after termination of employment. the shares of common stock issued under our stock option plans are made available from authorized and unissued common stock or treasury shares.
the fair value is based on our closing stock price on the date of grant as well as certain other assumptions. compensation expense arising from option grants is recognized ratably over the vesting period based on the grant date fair value, net of estimated forfeitures.
the following is a summary of our stock option activity:
number of options           weighted average
details of stock options outstanding as of december 31, 2023 are as follows:
number of options        weighted average                 weighted average            aggregate
details of stock options exercised during 2023, 2022 and 2021 are as follows:
total intrinsic value of options exercised (in millions)                  $25                         $28                     $41

number of options exercisable (in millions)                       2.0                         2.2                         2.2
as of december 31, 2023, there were $8 million in total unrecognized compensation costs related to stock options, which are expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of 1.4 years as the stock options vest.
risk-free interest rate                    3.47%                   1.72%                   0.64%
expected volatility                          24%                     23%                     24%
estimated weighted-average fair value of options granted per share               $27.39                     $28.18                     $22.70
the risk-free interest rate is based on the zero-coupon u.s. treasury yield curve in effect at the date of grant. the expected life is derived from historical and anticipated future exercise patterns. expected volatility is based on historical volatility data of our stock.
restricted stock plans restricted shares are used as an incentive to attract and retain qualified employees and to align our and our stockholders' interests by linking actual performance to both short and long-term stockholder return. we issue awards that may contain a combination of time, performance and/or market conditions. the grant date fair value of each award is based on the closing stock price of our stock at the date of grant.
granted but unvested shares are generally forfeited upon termination of employment, whereby compensation costs previously recognized for unvested shares are reversed. until the shares vest and are issued, participants have no voting or dividend rights and the shares may not be sold, assigned, transferred, pledged or otherwise encumbered. unvested restricted stock earns dividend equivalents which are paid in cash on the vesting date.
the grant date fair value of time-based restricted stock units is recognized as expense ratably over the vesting period, which is typically three or four years, net of forfeitures. our equity plans include a change in control provision that may accelerate vesting on both the time-based and performance-based restricted shares if the awards are not assumed by an acquirer in the case of a change in control.
for awards with performance conditions, we recognize compensation costs, net of forfeitures, using an accelerated attribution method over the vesting period. compensation costs are recognized only if it is probable that the performance condition will be satisfied. if we initially determine that it is not probable of being satisfied and later determine that it is, or vice versa, a cumulative catch-up adjustment is recorded in the period of change based on the new estimate. we recognize the remaining compensation costs over the remaining vesting period.
for awards with a market condition, fair value is estimated based on a simulation of various outcomes and includes inputs such as our stock price on the grant date, the valuation of historical awards with market conditions, the probability that the market condition will affect the number of shares granted (as the market condition only affects shares granted in excess of certain financial performance targets), and our expectation of achieving the financial performance targets.
in february 2023, we reserved a maximum of 0.9 million restricted shares for potential issuance as performance-based restricted shares to certain of our employees. the number of shares ultimately granted under this award is based on our actual financial performance as compared to financial performance targets set by our board and the compensation committee for the year ending december 31, 2023, and is also subject to a market condition reduction based on how our 2023 total stockholder return, or tsr, compared to that of the s&p 500 index. in 2023, we performed at a performance level "above-target". based on our actual 2023 financial performance as compared to the 2023 financial performance level thresholds, and with a required tsr haircut since we were "above-target", but underperformed against the s&p 500 index tsr, 0.6 million restricted shares will be awarded. this results in $74 million in compensation expenses that will be expensed over the three-year accelerated vesting period, including $41 million expensed during 2023.
in october 2023, we granted performance-based restricted awards to certain of our employees. we reserved shares for potential issuance of these awards with vesting terms over five years.
the following is a summary of nonvested restricted shares under all plans discussed above:
number of                    weighted average restricted                     grant-date fair stock shares                     value per share
number of                    weighted average restricted                     grant-date fair stock shares                     value per share
total fair value of restricted stock vested under all restricted stock plans                    $150                      $191                      $184
(1) the remaining shares granted are performance-based.
performance-based restricted shares have been presented in the table above to reflect the actual shares issued based on the achievement of past performance targets, also considering the impact of any market conditions. non-vested performance-based restricted shares granted are presented in the table above at the target number of restricted shares that would vest if the performance targets are met. time-based awards reflected in the table above include the black knight unvested awards that converted to our awards on the date of acquisition, as discussed below. as of december 31, 2023, there were $232 million in total unrecognized compensation costs related to time-based and performance-based restricted stock. these costs are expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 1.9 years as the restricted stock vests.
black knight restricted stock awards in connection with our black knight acquisition in september 2023, certain restricted stock awards held by black knight employees were converted to ice restricted stock awards and included in the table above. the replacement awards contain the same terms and conditions as were applicable to the awards immediately prior to the merger. these awards will be fully vested by 2026. our stock compensation expense for december 31, 2023 related to these awards was $18 million. in connection with the divestitures and certain terminations, $55 million of replacement restricted stock awards accelerated for the period between the acquisition date of september 5, 2023, through december 31, 2023, which we recorded as an acquisition-related costs (see note 3).
employee stock purchase plan we offer our employees participation in our espp, under which we have reserved and may sell up to 25 million shares of our common stock to employees. the espp grants participating employees the right to acquire our stock in increments of 1% of eligible pay, with a maximum contribution of 25% of eligible pay, subject to applicable annual internal revenue service, or irs, limitations. under our espp, participating employees are limited to $25,000 of common stock annually, and a maximum of 1,250 shares of common stock each offering period. there are two offering periods each year, from january 1st (or the first trading day thereafter) through june 30th (or the last trading day prior to such date) and from july 1st (or the first trading day thereafter) through december 31st (or the last trading day prior to such date). the purchase price per share of common stock is 85% of the lesser of the fair market value of the stock on the first or the last trading day of each offering period. we recorded compensation expenses of $13 million, $13 million and $11 million during 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively, related to the discount given to our participating employees.
bakkt incentive units prior to the bakkt merger with vih (see note 3), we sponsored the bakkt equity incentive plan under which bakkt issued various bakkt preferred, common and phantom, or participation, equity unit awards. these awards were made to certain employees and board members of bakkt. the units were unvested at the issuance date, were subject to the vesting terms in the award agreements and upon vesting were converted into bakkt equity or cash.
during 2021, the merger of bakkt and vih triggered a market condition of these bakkt equity incentive awards. as a result, during 2021, we incurred $31 million of non-cash compensation expense related to these awards which we recorded as an acquisition-related cost prior to deconsolidating bakkt in 2021.
12.equity common stock we are authorized to issue 1.5 billion shares with a par value of $0.01 per share. each holder of common stock is entitled to one vote for each share of common stock held of record by such holder on all matters on which stockholders are entitled to vote, including the election and removal of directors. there were 649 million and 573 million shares of common stock issued and outstanding, respectively, as of december 31, 2023. there were 634 million and 559 million shares of common stock issued and outstanding, respectively, as of december 31, 2022.
preferred stock we are authorized to issue 100 million shares of preferred stock with a par value of $0.01 per share. the holders of a series of preferred stock shall be entitled only to such voting rights as shall expressly be granted thereto by the certificate of incorporation (including any certificate of designation relating to such series of preferred stock). as of december 31, 2023, no shares of preferred stock have been issued.
treasury stock during each of 2023, 2022 and 2021, we received 1.0 million shares of common stock from employees to satisfy tax withholdings we made on their behalf for restricted stock and stock option exercises. we recorded the receipt of the shares as treasury stock.
non-controlling interest for consolidated subsidiaries in which our ownership is less than 100%, and for which we have control over the assets, liabilities and management of the entity, the outside stockholders' interests are shown as non-controlling interests. as of december 31, 2023, our non-controlling interests included those related to the non-ice limited partners' interest in our cds clearing subsidiaries and non-controlling interest in ice futures abu dhabi.
as of december 31, 2020, we also had redeemable non-controlling interests, reflected as redeemable non-controlling interests in temporary equity within our consolidated balance sheet, related to a put option held by non-ice partners in bakkt to require us to repurchase their interests. following the october 2021 bakkt merger discussed above, we no longer consolidate bakkt and therefore did not record a redeemable non-controlling interest in bakkt as of december 31, 2023, 2022, or 2021.
stock repurchase program we periodically review whether to repurchase our stock. in making a determination regarding the timing and extent of any stock repurchases, we consider multiple factors that may include: overall stock market conditions, our common stock price performance, the remaining amount authorized for repurchases by our board, the potential impact of a stock repurchase program on our debt ratings, our expected free cash flow and working capital needs, our current and future planned strategic growth initiatives, and other potential uses of our cash and capital resources.
repurchases may be made from time to time on the open market, through established trading plans, in privately-negotiated transactions or otherwise, in accordance with all applicable securities laws, rules and regulations. we may begin or discontinue stock repurchases at any time and may amend or terminate a rule 10b5-1 trading plan at any time or enter into additional plans.
in december 2021, our board approved an aggregate of $3.15 billion for future repurchases of our common stock with no fixed expiration date that became effective january 1, 2022. in december 2021 we entered into a new rule 10b5-1 trading plan that became effective in february 2022. in connection with our acquisition of black knight, on may 4, 2022, we terminated our rule 10b5-1 trading plan and suspended share repurchases.
we did not have any share repurchases in 2023. during 2022 and 2021, we repurchased 5.0 million shares and 1.8 million shares, respectively, of our outstanding common stock at a cost of $632 million and $250 million, respectively, excluding shares withheld upon vesting of equity awards. the shares repurchased are held in treasury stock.
as of december 31, 2023, the remaining balance of board approved funds for future repurchase was $2.5 billion. the approval of our board for stock repurchases does not obligate us to acquire any particular amount of our common stock. in addition, our board may increase or decrease the amount available for repurchases from time to time.
the table below sets forth the information with respect to purchases made by or on behalf of ice or any "affiliated purchaser" (as defined in rule 10b-18(a)(3) under the exchange act) of our common stock during the periods presented as follows:

13.income taxes income before income taxes and the income tax provision consisted of the following (in millions), and our consolidated income tax provision for 2021 was elevated due to the income tax expense associated with the gains we recognized from the coinbase and bakkt transactions.
deferred tax expense/(benefit):
a reconciliation of the statutory u.s. federal income tax rate to our effective income tax rate is as follows:

the 16% effective tax rate in 2023 was below the statutory federal income tax rate primarily due to the following items: favorable audit settlements for historical years, favorable state apportionment changes and the application of the high-tax exception to global intangible low-taxed income. these tax benefits were partially offset by the impact of the u.k. corporate income tax increase from 19% to 25% effective april 1, 2023 and the tax impact of certain non-deductible black knight acquisition costs. in conjunction with the increase in the u.k. corporate income tax rate, we intend to elect the high-tax exception to global intangible low-taxed income in 2023. our 2023 tax provision includes the impacts of this election.
the 17% effective tax rate in 2022 was below the statutory federal income tax rate primarily due to the deferred income tax benefit from the impairment of equity investment in bakkt in 2022. for 2021, our effective tax rate was significantly above the statutory federal income tax rate primarily due to state taxes and the deferred income tax expenses from the u.k. corporate income tax rate increase from 19% to 25% that was enacted in 2021.
the oecd global anti-base erosion pillar two minimum tax rules, or pillar two, which generally provide for a minimum effective tax rate of 15%, are intended to apply to tax years beginning in 2024. the european union member states and many other countries, including the u.k. our most significant non-us jurisdiction, have committed to implement or have already enacted legislation adopting the pillar two rules. in july 2023, the u.k. enacted the u.k. finance act 2023, effective as of january 1, 2024, which included provisions to implement certain portions of the oecd global anti-base erosion pillar two minimum tax rules and included an election to apply a transitional safe harbor to extend certain effective dates to accounting periods ending on or before june 30, 2028. these new u.k. pillar two rules did not have a material impact on our income tax provision as of december 31, 2023.
deferred tax assets and liabilities deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes. certain unrecognized tax benefits associated with our acquisition of ellie mae are presented as a reduction to related deferred tax assets. as a result of our acquisition of black knight (see note 3), compared to the prior year, the net deferred tax liabilities as of december 31, 2023 increased significantly. the property and equipment deferred moved from a deferred tax liability to a significant deferred tax asset due to the continued impacts of the capitalized research and experimental expenditure requirements that became effective in 2022 under the tax cuts and jobs act. the following table summarizes the significant components of our deferred tax liabilities and assets as of december 31, 2023 and 2022 (in millions):
as of december 31,
total deferred tax assets, net of valuation allowance              $565                              $277
right of use asset                                                 (48)                              (62)
a reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of deferred income tax valuation allowance is as follows (in millions):
beginning balance of deferred income tax valuation allowance             $92                     $99                     $95
ending balance of deferred income tax valuation allowance               $166                     $92                     $99
we recognize valuation allowances on deferred tax assets if, based on the weight of the evidence, we believe that it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. we recorded a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets of $166 million and $92 million as of december 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. the increase of valuation allowance charged against goodwill in 2023 is primarily related to certain deferred tax assets arising from the black knight acquisition that we believe are not more likely than not to be realized in the foreseeable future. the decrease of valuation allowance in 2023 is primarily due to certain foreign subsidiaries being liquidated in the current period with associated deferred tax assets being extinguished.
the majority of our undistributed earnings of our non-u.s. subsidiaries for the period from january 1, 2018 through december 31, 2022 were subject to the global intangible low-taxed income provisions and, as such, were subject to immediate u.s. income taxation and can be distributed to the u.s. with no material additional income tax consequences in the future. in 2023, we intend to elect the high-tax exception to global intangible low-taxed income, and thus, the majority of the earnings of our non-u.s. subsidiaries are not expected to be subject to immediate u.s. income taxation. however, the majority of these 2023 foreign earnings can also be distributed to the u.s. with no material additional u.s. income tax consequences due to the availability of full dividends received deductions.
we remain indefinitely reinvested in our non-u.s. subsidiaries' cumulative undistributed earnings as of december 31, 2023 that are not subject to the global intangible low-taxed income provisions and would be subject to additional u.s. income tax consequences upon distribution to the u.s. accordingly, no provision for u.s. federal and state income taxes has been made in the accompanying consolidated financial statements. further, a determination of the unrecognized deferred tax liability is not practicable. an estimate of these indefinitely reinvested undistributed earnings as of december 31, 2023, based on post-income tax earnings under u.s. gaap, is $5.8 billion.
as of december 31, 2023 and 2022, we have gross u.s. federal net operating loss carryforwards of $88 million and $100 million, respectively, and gross state and local net operating loss carryforwards of $76 million for both 2023 and 2022. the net decrease of federal net operating loss carryforwards are primarily due to losses utilized in the current year. the net operating loss carryforwards and credit carryforwards are available to offset future taxable income until they begin to expire in 2027. in addition, as of december 31, 2023 and 2022, we have gross foreign net operating loss carryforwards of $214 million and $280 million, respectively. the decrease in foreign net operating losses is primarily due to certain foreign subsidiaries being liquidated in the current period with the associated attributes being extinguished. the majority of the remaining gross foreign net operating losses are not expected to be realizable in future periods and have related valuation allowances.
a reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of unrecognized tax benefits is as follows (in millions):
beginning balance of unrecognized tax benefits                        247                       229                      $188
reductions resulting from statute of limitation lapses                (7)                       (9)                         -
ending balance of unrecognized tax benefits                          $268                      $247                      $229
as of december 31, 2023 and 2022, the balance of unrecognized tax benefits which would, if recognized, affect our effective tax rate was $228 million and $208 million, respectively. it is reasonably possible, as a result of settlements of ongoing audits or statute of limitations expirations, that unrecognized tax benefits could increase as much as $31 million and decrease as much as $25 million within the next 12 months. of the $268 million in unrecognized tax benefits as of december 31, 2023, $244 million is recorded within other non-current liabilities and $24 million is recorded within other current liabilities.
we recognize interest and penalties accrued on income tax uncertainties as a component of income tax expense/(benefit). in 2023, 2022 and 2021, we recognized ($30 million), $12 million and $10 million, respectively, of income tax expense/(benefit) for interest and penalties. as of december 31, 2023 and 2022, accrued interest and penalties were $32 million and $61 million, respectively. of the $32 million in accrued interest and penalties as of december 31, 2023, $28 million is recorded within other non-current liabilities and $4 million is recorded within other current liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet.
we or one of our subsidiaries files income tax returns in the u.s. federal jurisdiction and various state and foreign jurisdictions. the following table summarizes open tax years by major jurisdiction:
we have filed amended u.s. federal returns for the years prior to 2020 to claim additional credits and deductions and the associated refund claims are subject to review by the u.s. taxing authorities. although the outcome of tax audits is always uncertain, we believe that adequate amounts of tax, including interest and penalties, have been provided for any adjustments expected to result from open tax years.
14.clearing operations we operate six clearing houses, each of which acts as a central counterparty that becomes the buyer to every seller and the seller to every buyer for its clearing members or participants, or members. through this central counterparty function, the clearing houses provide financial security for each transaction for the duration of the position by limiting counterparty credit risk.
our clearing houses are responsible for providing clearing services to each of our futures exchanges, and in some cases to third-party execution venues, and are as follows, referred to herein collectively as "the ice clearing houses":

original and variation margin each of the ice clearing houses generally requires all members to deposit collateral in cash or certain pledged assets. the collateral deposits are known as "original margin." in addition, the ice clearing houses may make intraday original margin calls in circumstances where market conditions require additional protection. the daily profits and losses to and from the ice clearing houses due to the marking-to-market of open contracts is known as "variation margin." the ice clearing houses mark all outstanding contracts to market, and, with the exception of ice ngx's physical natural gas and physical power products discussed separately below, pay and collect variation margin at least once daily.
the amounts that members are required to maintain are determined by proprietary risk models established by each ice clearing house and reviewed by the relevant regulators, independent model validators, risk committees and the boards of directors of the respective ice clearing house. the amounts required may fluctuate over time. each of the ice clearing houses is a separate legal entity and is not subject to the liabilities of the others, or the obligations of members of the other ice clearing houses.
should a particular member fail to deposit its original margin or fail to make a variation margin payment, when and as required, the relevant ice clearing house may liquidate or hedge the defaulting member's open positions and use their original margin and guaranty fund deposits to pay any amount owed. in the event that the defaulting member's deposits are not sufficient to pay the amount owed in full, the ice clearing houses will first use their respective contributions to the guaranty fund, often referred to as skin in the game, or sitg, to pay any remaining amount owed. in the event that the sitg is not sufficient, the ice clearing houses may utilize the respective guaranty fund deposits and default insurance, or collect limited additional funds from their respective non-defaulting members on a pro-rata basis, to pay any remaining amount owed.
as of december 31, 2023 and 2022, the ice clearing houses had received or had been pledged $175.9 billion and $273.3 billion, respectively, in cash and non-cash collateral in original margin and guaranty fund deposits to cover price movements of underlying contracts for both periods.
guaranty funds and ice contribution as described above, mechanisms have been created, called guaranty funds, to provide partial protection in the event of a member default. with the exception of ice ngx, each of the ice clearing houses requires that each member make deposits into a guaranty fund.
in addition, we have contributed our own capital that could be used if a defaulting member's original margin and guaranty fund deposits are insufficient. such amounts are recorded as long-term restricted cash and cash equivalents in our balance sheets and are as follows (in millions):
ice portion of guaranty fund contribution                                     default insurance as of december 31,                                    as of december 31, clearing house                                       2023                                      2022                    2023                          2022
(1) the decrease in the ice portion of the guaranty fund contribution from 2022 to 2023 at ice clear europe was driven by ceasing cds clearing at ice clear europe and the related requirement for ice clear europe to maintain a $50 million guaranty fund contribution related to cds clearing.
(2) the decrease in the ice portion of the guaranty fund contribution from 2022 to 2023 at ice clear u.s. was driven by the termination of our agreement with bakkt to clear bitcoin, and the related requirement for us to maintain a $15 million guaranty fund contribution.
we also maintain default insurance at ice clear europe. ice clear, u.s. and ice clear credit as an additional layer of clearing member default protection which is reflected in the table above. the default insurance was renewed in september 2022 and has a three-year term for the following clearing houses in the following amounts: ice clear europe - $100 million; ice clear u.s. - $25 million; and ice clear credit - $75 million. the default insurance layer resides after and in addition to the ice clear europe, ice clear u.s. and ice clear credit sitg contributions and before the guaranty fund contributions of the non-defaulting members.
similar to sitg, the default insurance layer is not intended to replace or reduce the position risk-based amount of the guaranty fund. as a result, the default insurance layer is not a factor that is included in the calculation of the members' guaranty fund contribution requirement. instead, it serves as an additional, distinct, and separate default resource that should serve to further protect the non-defaulting members' guaranty fund contributions from being mutualized in the event of a default.
as of december 31, 2023, ice ngx maintained a guaranty fund of $215 million, comprising $15 million in cash and a $200 million letter of credit backed by a default insurance policy of the same amount, discussed below.
below is a depiction of our default waterfall which summarizes the lines of defense and layers of protection we maintain for our mutualized clearing houses.
ice clearing house default waterfall cash and invested margin deposits we have recorded cash and invested margin and guaranty fund deposits and amounts due in our balance sheets as current assets with corresponding current liabilities to the members. as of december 31, 2023, our cash and invested margin deposits were as follows (in millions):
as of december 31, 2022, our cash and invested margin deposits, were as follows (in millions):
(1) amount is entirely related to futures/options.
(2) $97.6 billion and $7.8 billion is related to futures/options and cds, respectively.
our cash and invested margin and guaranty fund deposits are maintained in accounts with national banks and highly-rated financial institutions or secured through direct investments, primarily in u.s. treasury and other highly-rated foreign government securities, or reverse repurchase agreements with primarily overnight maturities. we primarily use level 1 inputs when evaluating the fair value of the non-cash equivalent direct investments, as highly-rated government securities are quoted in active markets. the carrying value of these deposits are deemed to approximate fair value.
to provide a tool to address the liquidity needs of our clearing houses and manage the liquidation of margin and guaranty fund deposits held in the form of cash and high quality sovereign debt, ice clear europe, ice clear credit and ice clear u.s. have entered into committed repurchase agreement facilities, or committed repo. additionally, ice clear credit and ice clear netherlands have entered into committed fx facilities to support these liquidity needs. as of december 31, 2023 the following facilities were in place:

other deposits in addition to the cash and invested deposits above, the ice clearing houses have also received other assets from members, which include government obligations, and may include other non-cash collateral such as letters of credit at ice ngx, european emission allowance certificates or gold on rare occasions at ice clear europe, to mitigate credit risk. for certain deposits, we may impose discount or "haircut" rates to ensure adequate collateral if market values fluctuate. these other deposits are not reflected in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets as the risks and rewards of these assets remain with the members unless the clearing houses have sold or re-pledged the assets or in the event of a clearing member default, where the member is no longer entitled to redeem the assets. any income, gain or loss accrues to the members. the ice clearing houses do not, in the ordinary course, rehypothecate or re-pledge these assets. these pledged assets are not reflected in our balance sheets, and are as follows (in millions):
as of december 31, 2023
letters of credit and other                           -                          -                          -                             5,006                                  5,006

ice ngx ice ngx owns a clearing house which administers the physical delivery of energy trading contracts. ice ngx is the central counterparty to members on opposite sides of its physically-settled contracts, and the balance related to delivered but unpaid contracts is recorded as a delivery contract net receivable, with an offsetting delivery contract net payable in our balance sheets. unsettled variation margin equal to the fair value of open contracts is recorded as of each balance sheet date. there is no impact on our consolidated statements of income as an equal amount is recognized as both an asset and a liability. ice ngx marks all of its outstanding physical natural gas and physical power contracts to market daily and requires full collateralization of net accrued variation losses. due to the highly liquid nature and the short period of time to maturity, the fair values of our delivery contract net payable and net receivable are determined to approximate carrying value.
ice ngx requires members to maintain cash or letters of credit to serve as collateral in the event of default. the cash is maintained in a segregated bank account for the benefit of the member, and remains the property of the member and, therefore, it is not included in our balance sheets. ice ngx maintains a committed daylight-overnight liquidity facility in the amount of $100 million with an additional $200 million uncommitted with a third-party canadian chartered bank which provides liquidity in the event of a settlement shortfall, subject to certain conditions.
as of december 31, 2023, ice ngx maintains a guaranty fund of $215 million funded by a $200 million letter of credit issued by a major canadian chartered bank and backed by default insurance underwritten by export development canada, or edc, a crown corporation operated at arm's length from the canadian government, plus $15 million held as restricted cash to fund the first loss amount the ice ngx is responsible for under the default insurance policy. in the event of a participant default where the member's collateral is depleted, the shortfall would be covered by a draw down on the letter of credit following which ice ngx would file a claim under the default insurance to recover additional losses up to $200 million beyond the $15 million first-loss amount that ice ngx is responsible for under the default insurance policy.
clearing house exposure the net notional value of unsettled contracts was $2.1 trillion as of december 31, 2023. each ice clearing house bears financial counterparty credit risk and provides a central counterparty guarantee, or performance guarantee, to its members. in its guarantor role, each ice clearing house has equal and offsetting claims to and from members on opposite sides of each contract, standing as an intermediary on every contract cleared. to reduce their exposure, the ice clearing houses have a risk management program with both initial and ongoing membership standards. with the exception of ice ngx, the ice clearing houses mark all outstanding contracts to market and pay and collect variation margin at least once daily.
excluding the effects of original and variation margin, guaranty fund and collateral requirements and default insurance, the ice clearing houses' maximum estimated exposure for this guarantee would be the intra-day or full day change in fair value if all members who have open positions with unrealized losses simultaneously defaulted which is an extremely unlikely scenario. the levels of original margin are calibrated such that a portfolio the ice clearing house may be required to liquidate post member default can be closed or auctioned without recourse to resources other than those deposited by the defaulting member, assuming an appropriate risk confidence level and liquidation period. in addition to the base margin model, each ice clearing house, depending on its products, employs a number of margin add-ons related to position concentration, clearing member capital, volatility, spread responses, recovery rate sensitivity, jump-to-default, and wrong way risk.
we also performed calculations to determine the fair value of our counterparty performance guarantee taking into consideration factors such as daily settlement of contracts, margining and collateral requirements, other elements of our risk management program, historical evidence of default payments, and estimated probability of potential default payouts by the ice clearing houses. based on these analyses, the estimated counterparty performance guarantee liability was determined to be nominal and no liability was recorded as of december 31, 2023 or 2022. the ice clearing houses have never experienced an incident of a clearing member default which has required the use of the guaranty funds of non-defaulting clearing members or the assets of the ice clearing houses.
interest on margin deposits and fees charged for non-cash margin the net interest income on cash margin and fees charged for non-cash margin retained by the ice clearing houses is recorded in our exchanges revenues and fixed income and data services revenues in our consolidated statements of income. we recognized a combined $369 million and $341 million as our revenues during the years ended december 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively,
15. leases we have lease agreements for office space and data center facilities. all of our leases are classified as operating leases and we do not have any significant leases classified as finance leases.
as of december 31, 2023, the weighted-average remaining lease term was 6.7 years and the weighted average discount rate was 5.1%. as of december 31, 2022, the weighted-average remaining lease term was 4.7 years and the weighted average discount rate was 3.0%.
we recognized $58 million, $52 million and $61 million of rent expense for office space as rent and occupancy expense in 2023, 2022, and 2021, respectively, and $32 million, $26 million and $24 million for data center facilities as technology and communication expense in 2023, 2022, and 2021, respectively, within our consolidated income statements. we do not have any significant variable lease costs related to building and maintenance costs, real estate taxes, or other charges.

16.    commitments and contingencies legal proceedings in the ordinary course of our business, from time to time we are subject to legal proceedings, lawsuits, government investigations and other claims with respect to a variety of matters. in addition, we are subject to periodic reviews, inspections, examinations and investigations by regulators in the u.s. and other jurisdictions, any of which may result in claims, legal proceedings, assessments, fines, penalties, restrictions on our business or other sanctions. we record estimated expenses and reserves for legal or regulatory matters or other claims when these matters present loss contingencies that are probable and the related amount is reasonably estimable, and gain contingencies when they become certain. any such accruals may be adjusted as circumstances change. assessments of losses are inherently subjective and involve unpredictable factors. while the outcome of legal and regulatory matters is inherently difficult to predict and/or the range of loss often cannot be reasonably estimable, we do not believe that the liabilities, if any, which may ultimately result from the resolution of the various legal and regulatory matters that arise in the ordinary course of our business, including the matters described below, are likely to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition, results of operations, or liquidity. it is possible, however, that future results of operations for any particular quarterly or annual period could be materially and adversely affected by any developments relating to these legal and regulatory matters.
black knight transaction litigation on march 9, 2023, the federal trade commission, or the ftc, filed an administrative complaint alleging that the proposed transaction between ice and black knight, if consummated, would be an unfair method of competition in violation of section 5 of the federal trade commission act, and that it would substantially lessen competition, or tend to create a monopoly, in violation of section 7 of the clayton act. the complaint sought a variety of injunctive relief, including, among other things, a prohibition on the completion of the transaction without the ftc's consent and, if the transaction is completed, a divestiture or reconstitution of assets in a manner that restores such separate and independent businesses as the parties had operated prior to the completion of the transaction. on april 10, 2023, the ftc filed a complaint in the united states district court for the northern district of california for a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction enjoining the completion of the transaction. on april 21, 2023, the court entered a temporary restraining order, or tro, enjoining the completion of the transaction until the court ruled on the ftc's motion for a preliminary injunction. in their answers to the administrative and court complaints, filed on march 20, 2023 and april 25, 2023, respectively, ice and black knight denied the ftc's substantive allegations; asserted numerous affirmative defenses; described the pro-competitive aspects and significant lender, servicer, investor, vendor and consumer benefits relating to this transaction; and denied that the combination of their respective businesses would violate any laws. additionally, the answers to the court complaint contained counterclaims by ice and black knight against the ftc seeking declaratory relief that the ftc's administrative process is unconstitutional and should be enjoined. on july 17, 2023, the district court entered an order granting a joint motion by the parties to continue the evidentiary hearing on the ftc's motion for a preliminary injunction, noting that the parties were discussing a potential resolution of the matter resulting from the announcement of the planned divestiture of the optimal blue business (note 3) and the ftc's analysis of the implications of the divestiture for this case and the administrative complaint. on july 25, 2023, the ftc granted an unopposed motion filed by ftc counsel to withdraw the administrative complaint from adjudication, and, on august 7, 2023, the parties announced a joint stipulation to dismiss the federal court complaint and dissolve the tro. ice and black knight entered into an agreement containing consent orders with the ftc's bureau of competition on august 25, 2023, which fully and finally resolved the matter upon completion of the transaction effective as of september 5, 2023.
pennymac arbitration in 2019, black knight servicing technologies, llc, or bkst, an indirect, wholly-owned subsidiary of black knight, filed a complaint and demand for jury trial, or the black knight complaint, against pennymac loan services, llc, or pennymac, in florida state court. the black knight complaint includes causes of action for breach of contract and misappropriation of msp® system trade secrets by pennymac for it to develop a mortgage servicing system (known as sse) intended to replace the msp® system. the black knight complaint seeks damages for breach of contract and misappropriation of trade secrets, injunctive relief under the florida uniform trade secrets act and a declaratory judgment that bkst owns all intellectual property and software developed by or on behalf of pennymac as a result of its wrongful use of and access to the msp® system and related trade secret and confidential information. pennymac filed a motion to compel arbitration of the action, and the trial court granted the motion in 2020. the trial court's order compelling arbitration was confirmed on appeal.
shortly after the filing of the black knight complaint, pennymac filed an antitrust complaint, or the pennymac complaint, against black knight in the united states district court for the central district of california. the pennymac complaint includes causes of action for alleged monopolization and attempted monopolization under section 2 of the sherman antitrust act, violation of california's cartwright act, violation of california's unfair competition law and common law unfair competition under california law. the pennymac complaint seeks equitable remedies, damages and other monetary relief, including treble and punitive damages. generally, pennymac alleges that black knight relies on various anticompetitive, unfair and discriminatory practices to maintain and to enhance its dominance in the mortgage servicing platform market and in an attempt to monopolize the platform software applications market. black knight moved to dismiss the pennymac complaint or have the action transferred to florida based upon a forum selection clause in the agreement with bkst. in 2020, the judge granted black knight's motion to transfer the case to florida and denied as moot the motion to dismiss, and pennymac filed a notice of dismissal of this action without prejudice and indicated that it intended to bring the claims raised in the dismissed pennymac complaint as defenses, third party claims and/or counterclaims in arbitration. following pennymac's submission of this matter in 2020 to the american arbitration association, pennymac filed an amended arbitration demand and black knight filed an answering statement. a multi-week arbitration hearing was held on black knight's and pennymac's respective claims, and the hearing concluded in june 2023.
on november 29, 2023, the arbitrator issued an interim award that, among other things, found that pennymac, in developing its sse software, engaged in the unauthorized use of black knight's confidential information; granted black knight's breach of contract claim on this basis; and awarded black knight $155.2 million in damages (reduced to $150.2 million by a subsequent order dated january 3, 2024 clarifying the period through which damages applied). the interim award denied black knight's claim for misappropriation of trade secrets and granted or denied (or denied as moot) various of the parties' respective other claims. on january 12, 2024, the arbitrator entered a final award stating that an additional $7.0 million is owed to black knight for prejudgment interest for a total award of $157.2 million. the arbitrator further found black knight is owed post-judgment interest to run beginning the day after the interim award (which, as of this filing, amounts to more than $2.5 million, and continues to accrue). we expect pennymac to pay black knight the amount owed in the first quarter of 2024.
tax audits we are engaged in ongoing discussions and audits with taxing authorities on various tax matters, the resolutions of which are uncertain. currently, there are matters that may lead to assessments involving us or one of our subsidiaries, some of which may not be resolved for several years. based on currently available information, we believe we have adequately provided for any assessments that could result from those proceedings where it is more likely than not that we will be assessed. we continuously review our positions as these matters progress.
17. pension and other benefit programs defined benefit pension plan we have a pension plan covering employees in certain of our u.s. operations whose benefit accrual has been frozen. retirement benefits are derived from a formula, which is based on length of service and compensation.
we did not make any contributions to our pension plan during 2023, 2022 or 2021. the plan's target allocation is 5% equity securities and 95% fixed income securities. the fixed income allocation includes corporate bonds of companies from diversified industries and u.s. government bonds. our long-term objective is to keep the plan at or near full funding, while minimizing the risk inherent in pension plans. as a result, we don't anticipate that there will be a strong need for contributions in future years, and the pension plan will not be required to pay the pension benefit guaranty corporation variable rate premiums. we do not expect to make contributions to the pension plan in 2024. we will continue to monitor the plan's funded status, and we will consider modifying the plan's investment policy based on the actuarial and funding characteristics of the retirement plan, the demographic profile of plan participants, and our business objectives.

we use a market-related value of plan assets when determining the estimated return on plan assets. gains/losses on plan assets are amortized over a four-year period and accumulate in other comprehensive income. we recognize deferred gains and losses in future net income based on a "corridor" approach, where the corridor is equal to 10% of the greater of the benefit obligation or the market-related value of plan assets at the beginning of the year.
supplemental executive retirement plan we have a u.s. nonqualified supplemental executive retirement plan, or serp, which provides supplemental retirement benefits for certain employees. the future benefit accrual of the serp plan is frozen. to provide for the future payments of these benefits, we have purchased insurance on the lives of certain of the participants through company-owned policies. as of both december 31, 2023 and 2022, the cash surrender value of such policies was $64 million and is included in other non-current assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. we also acquired a serp through both the ice ngx and chx acquisitions. the following table provides a summary of the changes in the serp benefit obligations (in millions):

serp plan expense in the accompanying consolidated statements of income was $1 million each year in 2023, 2022 and 2021 and primarily consisted of interest cost. the following table shows the projected payments for the serp plan based on the actuarial assumptions (in millions):
pension and serp plans assumptions the weighted-average assumptions used to develop the actuarial present value of the projected benefit obligation and net periodic pension/serp costs in 2023, 2022 and 2021 are set forth below:
weighted-average discount rate for determining benefit obligations (pension/serp plans)             4.7% / 4.6%                   4.9% / 4.8%                   2.6% / 2.1%
expected long-term rate of return on plan assets (pension/serp plans)                                4.4% / n/a                    2.5% / n/a                    2.3% / n/a rate of compensation increase                                                                               n/a                           n/a                           n/a the assumed discount rate reflects the market rates for high-quality corporate bonds currently available. the discount rate was determined by considering the average of pension yield curves constructed on a large population of high quality corporate bonds. the resulting discount rates reflect the matching of plan liability cash flows to yield curves. to develop the expected long-term rate of return on assets assumption, we considered the historical returns and the future expectations for returns for each asset class as well as the target asset allocation of the pension portfolio.
the determination of the interest cost component utilizes a full yield curve approach by applying the specific spot rates along the yield curve used in the determination of the benefit obligation to each year's discounted cash flow.
post-retirement benefit plans our defined benefit plans provide certain health care and life insurance benefits for certain eligible retired nyse u.s. employees. these post-retirement benefit plans, which may be modified in accordance with their terms, are fully frozen. the net periodic post-retirement benefit costs were $3 million, $3 million and $2 million in 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. the defined benefit plans are unfunded and we currently do not expect to fund the post-retirement benefit plans. the weighted-average discount rate for determining the benefit obligation as of december 31, 2023 and 2022 was 4.7% and 4.9%, respectively. the weighted-average discount rate for determining the interest cost as of december 31, 2023 and 2022 was 4.8% and 2.1%, respectively. the following table shows the actuarial determined benefit obligation, interest costs, employee contributions, actuarial (gain)/loss, benefits paid during the periods and the accrued employee benefits (in millions):
as of december 31,
benefit obligation at the end of year                                         $129                          $116

the following table shows the payments projected for our post-retirement benefit plans (net of expected medicare subsidy receipts of $9 million in aggregate over the next ten fiscal years) based on actuarial assumptions (in millions):
projected post-retirement benefit by year:                projected payment
for measurement purposes, we assumed a 6.5% annual rate of increase in the per capita cost of covered health care benefits in 2023 which will decrease on a graduated basis to 3.9% in the year 2047 and thereafter.
accumulated other comprehensive loss the accumulated other comprehensive loss, after tax, as of december 31, 2023, consisted of the following amounts that have not yet been recognized in net periodic benefit cost (in millions):
pension plans        serp plans        post-retirementbenefit plans        total unrecognized net actuarial losses/(gains), after tax        $77                  $3                $(14)                               $66
other benefit plans and defined contribution plans our u.s. employees are eligible to participate in 401(k) and profit sharing plans and our non-u.s. employees are eligible to participate in defined contribution pension plans. total contributions under the 401(k), profit sharing and defined contribution pension plans were $69 million, $64 million and $63 million in 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. no discretionary or profit sharing contributions were made during 2023, 2022 or 2021.
18. fair value measurements financial assets and liabilities recorded or disclosed at fair value in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets as of december 31, 2023 and 2022 were classified in their entirety based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the asset or liability's fair value measurement.
our mutual funds are equity and fixed income mutual funds held for the purpose of providing future payments for the supplemental executive savings plan and serp. these mutual funds are classified as equity investments and measured at fair value using level 1 inputs with adjustments recorded in net income (see note 17). our debt securities held at certain of our clearing houses for purposes of meeting regulatory capital requirements are primarily u.s. treasury securities or other high quality sovereign debt and are measured at fair value using level 1 inputs with adjustments recorded in net income.
excluding our equity investments without a readily determinable fair value, all other financial instruments are determined to approximate carrying value due to the short period of time to their maturities. our equity investment in d&b (note 4) was measured at fair value on a recurring basis using level 2 inputs including the directly observable d&b stock price, adjusted for a lack of marketability factor associated with the investment. we sold this investment in 2023 and no longer held it as of december 31, 2023.
as described in note 3, we measured the promissory note obtained in connection with the optimal blue sale using level 3 inputs. the valuation technique used was a discounted cash flow model using key unobservable assumptions included an estimated prepayment rate and a discount rate at the divestiture date. for subsequent measurement as of december 31, 2023, we used a combination of the level 3 inputs, a prepayment rate of 2% and discount rate of 30.8%, and indicative price points from the ongoing promissory note sale process resulting in a fair value loss of $160 million recorded in other income/(expense), net in the consolidated statements of income. increases to the prepayment rate and/or discount rate, in isolation, would result in a decrease in a fair value measurement.
prior to the divestiture date, and excluding the promissory note, we did not use level 3 inputs to determine the fair value of assets or liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of december 31, 2023 or 2022.
we measure certain assets, such as intangible assets and equity method investments, at fair value on a non-recurring basis. these assets are recognized at fair value if they are deemed to be impaired. during 2022, we evaluated these intangible assets and investments and determined that the value of our equity method investment in bakkt was impaired using a level 1 input, which was the publicly-traded closing stock price of bakkt on december 30, 2022, the last trading day of 2022. as of december 31, 2023 and 2022, no other intangible assets or equity method investments were required to be recorded at fair value since no other impairments were recorded, except for an impairment on certain trademark intangible assets which is recorded in depreciation and amortization in our consolidated statements of income.
we measure certain equity investments at fair value on a non-recurring basis using our policy election under asu 2016-01 (see note 2). no fair value adjustments were required under our accounting policy election related to these investments (see note 4) during 2023 or 2022.
the table below displays the fair value of our debt as of december 31, 2023 and december 31, 2022. the fair values of our fixed rate notes were estimated using level 2 inputs including quoted market prices for these instruments. the fair value of our commercial paper as of december 31, 2023 and 2022 includes a discount and other short-term debt approximates par value since the interest rates on this short-term debt approximate market rates as of december 31, 2023 and december 31, 2022.
as of december 31, 2023                                           as of december 31, 2022
19. segment reporting our business is conducted through three reportable business segments, comprised of the following:
•exchanges: we operate regulated marketplace technology for the listing, trading and clearing of a broad array of derivatives contracts and financial securities as well as data and connectivity services related to those venues;
•fixed income and data services: we provide fixed income pricing, reference data, indices, analytics and execution services, as well as global cds clearing and multi-asset class data delivery technology; and
•mortgage technology: we provide a technology platform that offers customers comprehensive, digital workflow tools that aim to address inefficiencies and mitigate risks that exist in the u.s. residential mortgage market life cycle, from application through closing, servicing and the secondary market.
while revenues are recorded specifically in the segment in which they are earned or to which they relate, a significant portion of our operating expenses are not solely related to a specific segment because the expenses serve functions that are necessary for the operation of more than one segment. we directly allocate expenses when reasonably possible to do so. otherwise, we use a pro-rata revenue approach as the allocation method for the expenses that do not relate solely to one segment and serve functions that are necessary for the operation of all segments.
our chief operating decision maker does not review total assets or statements of income below operating income by segments; therefore, such information is not presented below. our three segments do not engage in intersegment transactions.
during 2023, we reclassified certain revenues within our mortgage technology segment that were previously included in other revenues to closing solutions, origination technology and data and analytics revenues. closing solutions revenues now include membership dues, and origination technology revenues and data and analytics revenues now include their related professional services revenues. as of december 31, 2023, other revenues are no longer separately presented. we believe this is a more accurate reflection of the nature of these revenues. the impact of this change was not material, and the prior year periods have been adjusted for comparability. additionally, following the acquisition of black knight in the third quarter of 2023, we have added servicing software to our mortgage technology segment revenues.
financial data for our business segments is as follows for 2023, 2022 and 2021 (in millions):

basic earnings per common share is calculated using the weighted average common shares outstanding during the periods. changes in the weighted average common shares outstanding between years was primarily due to stock repurchases and the black knight acquisition in 2023.
common equivalent shares from stock options and restricted stock awards, calculated using the treasury stock method, are included in the diluted per share calculations unless the effect of their inclusion would be antidilutive. during 2023, 2022 and 2021 outstanding stock options of 791,000, 531,000 and 281,000, respectively, were not included in the computation of diluted earnings per common share because to do so would have had an antidilutive effect. as of december 31, 2023 and 2022, there were 4,000 and 50,000, respectively, restricted stock units that were vested but have not been issued that are included in the computation of diluted earnings per share. certain figures in the table above may not recalculate due to rounding.

item 7.    management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements for many reasons. see the factors set forth under the heading "forward looking statements" at the beginning of part 1 of this annual report and in item 1(a) under the heading "risk factors." for discussion related to the results of operations and changes in financial condition for 2022 compared to 2021 refer to part ii, item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in our 2022 annual report on form 10-k, which was filed with the u.s. securities and exchange commission on february 2, 2023.

•exchanges: we operate regulated marketplace technology for the listing, trading and clearing of a broad array of derivatives contracts and financial securities as well as data and connectivity services related to those venues.
•fixed income and data services: we provide fixed income pricing, reference data, indices, analytics and execution services as well as global cds clearing and multi-asset class data delivery technology.

recent developments acquisition of black knight, inc.
on september 5, 2023, we acquired black knight, inc., or black knight, a software, data and analytics company that serves the housing finance continuum, including real estate data, mortgage lending and servicing, as well as the secondary markets. pursuant to the agreement and plan of merger, dated as of may 4, 2022, among ice, sand merger sub corporation, a wholly owned subsidiary of ice, or sub, and black knight, which we refer to as the "merger agreement," sub merged with and into black knight, which we refer to as the "merger," with black knight surviving as a wholly owned subsidiary of ice.
the aggregate transaction consideration was approximately $11.8 billion, or $76 per share of black knight common stock, with cash comprising 90% of the value of the aggregate transaction consideration and shares of our common stock comprising 10% of the value of the aggregate transaction consideration. the aggregate cash component of the transaction consideration was $10.5 billion, and the number of our shares issued was based on the market price of our common stock and the average of the volume weighted averages of the trading prices of our common stock on each of the ten consecutive trading days ending three trading days prior to the closing of the merger. we expect that this transaction will build on our position as a provider of end-to-end electronic workflow solutions for the rapidly evolving u.s. residential mortgage industry. we believe the black knight ecosystem adds value for clients of all sizes across the mortgage and real estate lifecycles by helping organizations lower costs, increase efficiencies, grow their businesses, and reduce risk.
on september 14, 2023, or the divestiture date, in connection with the merger agreement, we sold black knight's optimal blue and empower loan origination system, or los, businesses, or the divestitures, to subsidiaries of constellation software, inc. the cash proceeds from the divestitures were $241 million. the structure of the optimal blue transaction also included a promissory note with a face value of $500 million issued by the purchaser to black knight, as a subsidiary of ice, at the closing of the transaction. as described in note 3 to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report, the promissory note was valued at $235 million on the divestiture date. pursuant to the agreement containing consent orders entered into between the ftc and ice and black knight, the promissory note was required to be sold within six months of the divestiture date. on february 7, 2024, the ftc approved the buyer of the promissory note and the proceeds of the promissory note sale will be paid to black knight in the near future. as we elected the fair value option for the promissory note, we are required to mark the asset to fair value each reporting period. for subsequent measurement as of december 31, 2023, we wrote down the value of the promissory note, resulting in a fair value loss of $160 million.
global market conditions our results of operations are affected by global economic conditions, including macroeconomic conditions and geopolitical events or conflicts. since 2022, macroeconomic conditions, including rising interest rates, inflation and significant market volatility, along with geopolitical concerns, including the conflicts in ukraine, israel and gaza, have created ongoing uncertainty and volatility in the global economy and resulted in a dynamic operating environment.
our business has been impacted positively and negatively by these global economic conditions. for instance, due to market volatility and rising interest rates, we have seen increased trading across a number of our products, such as interest rate and equity futures, credit default swaps and bonds. conversely, increases in mortgage interest rates in 2022 and 2023 have resulted in reduced consumer and investor demand for mortgages and adversely impacted the transaction-based revenues in our mortgage technology segment. if mortgage rates remain high or further increase, or if banks change their mortgage lending practices, our mortgage technology segment revenues may be further impacted.
from an operational perspective, our businesses, including our exchanges, clearing houses, listings venues, data services businesses and mortgage platforms, have not suffered a material negative impact as a result of these events in ukraine, israel, gaza and surrounding regions.
we expect the macroeconomic environment to remain dynamic in the near-term, and we continue to monitor macroeconomic conditions, including interest rates, the inflationary environment, geopolitical events and military conflicts, including repercussions from the conflicts in ukraine, israel and gaza and the impact that any of the foregoing may have on the global economy and on our business. throughout 2023, we have closely monitored the credit worthiness of our counterparties and investment agents during the recent banking sector events, scrutinized counterparties directly impacted and monitored for any potential contagion. we did not suffer any material negative impact from the banking sector events that occurred in early 2023. in light of the current and expected macroeconomic environment we will continue to closely monitor credit worthiness of our counterparties, clearing members and our financial service providers and take risk management measures in line with established risk management frameworks.
tax policy changes the organisation for economic cooperation and development, or oecd, global anti-base erosion pillar two minimum tax rules, or pillar two, which generally provide for a minimum effective tax rate of 15%, are intended to apply to tax years beginning in 2024. in 2023, the oecd issued administrative guidance providing transitional safe harbor rules concerning the implementation of the pillar two framework, which will apply to fiscal years ending on or before december 31, 2026. the eu member states and many other countries, including the u.k., have committed to implement or have already enacted legislation adopting the pillar two rules. we are monitoring developments and evaluating the impacts of these new rules on our tax rate, including our ability to qualify for the safe harbor rules as implemented by each jurisdiction, however, we do not expect a material impact to our effective tax rate given our current tax profile.
consolidated financial highlights the following summarizes our results and significant changes in our consolidated financial performance for the periods presented (dollars in millions, except per share amounts):

(1) we define recurring revenues as the portion of our revenues that are generally predictable, stable, and can be expected to occur at regular intervals in the future with a relatively high degree of certainty and visibility. we define transaction revenues as those associated with a more specific point-in-time service, such as a trade execution.
(2) the adjusted figures exclude items that are not reflective of our ongoing core operations and business performance. adjusted net income attributable to ice and adjusted diluted earnings per share attributable to ice common stockholders are presented net of taxes. these adjusted figures are not calculated in accordance with u.s. generally accepted accounting principles, or gaap. see "- non-gaap financial measures" below.
(3) we believe these non-gaap liquidity measures provide useful information to management and investors to analyze cash resources generated from our operations. we believe that free cash flow is useful as one of the bases for comparing our performance with our competitors and demonstrates our ability to convert the reinvestment of capital expenditures and capitalized software development costs required to maintain and grow our business. we believe that adjusted free cash flow eliminates the impact of timing differences related to the payment of section 31 fees. these figures are not calculated in accordance with u.s. gaap. see "-non-gaap liquidity measures" below.
•revenues, less transaction-based expenses, increased $696 million in 2023 from 2022. the increase in revenues includes $17 million in favorable foreign exchange effects arising from fluctuations in the u.s. dollar in 2023 as compared to 2022.

•operating expenses decreased $43 million in 2022 from 2021. the decrease in operating expenses includes $38 million in favorable foreign exchange effects arising from fluctuations in the u.s. dollar in 2022 as compared to 2021.
•other income/(expense), net, in 2023 primarily includes interest income of $319 million, interest expense of $808 million, our equity earnings in occ of $16 million, estimated equity losses in our investment in bakkt of $135 million, a fair value loss of $160 million related to the black knight promissory note, an impairment related to our cat loan receivable of $16 million, fx remeasurement losses of $12 million, and a loss on the sale of the dun &

•the 16% effective tax rate in 2023 was below the u.s. corporate income tax rate primarily driven by the following factors: favorable audit settlements for historical years, favorable state apportionment changes, and the application of the high-tax exception to global intangible low-taxed income. these benefits were partially offset by the impact of the u.k. corporate income tax increase from 19% to 25% effective april 1, 2023, and the tax impact of certain non-deductible black knight acquisition costs.
•the 17% effective tax rate in 2022 was below the u.s. corporate income tax rate primarily driven by the deferred income tax benefit from the impairment of our equity method investment in bakkt.
•the 29% effective tax rate in 2021 is significantly above the u.s corporate income tax rate primarily due to the deferred income tax expense resulting from the u.k. tax law changes enacted in 2021. in 2021, the u.k. enacted a corporate income tax rate increase from 19% to 25% effective april 1, 2023.
business environment and market trends our business environment has been characterized by:
•globalization of marketplaces, customers and competitors;
•growing customer demand for workflow efficiency and automation;
•commodity, interest rate, inflation rate and financial markets volatility and uncertainty;
•growing demand for data to inform customers' risk management and investment decisions;
•price volatility increasing customers' demand for risk management services;
•increasing focus on capital and cost efficiencies;
•customers' preference to manage risk in markets demonstrating the greatest depth of liquidity and product diversity;
•the evolution of existing products and new product innovation to serve emerging customer needs and changing industry agreements;
•rising demand for speed, data, data capacity and connectivity by market participants, necessitating increased investment in technology; and
•consolidation and increasing competition among global markets for trading, clearing and listings.
recent changes with regard to global financial reform have emphasized the importance of transparent markets, centralized clearing and access to data, all of which are important aspects of our product offering. however, some of the proposed rules have yet to be implemented and some rules that have already been partially implemented are being reconsidered. in addition, some of the global regulations have not been fully harmonized and several non-u.s. regulations are inconsistent with u.s. rules. as the evolution continues, legislative and regulatory actions may change the way we conduct our business and may create uncertainty for market participants, which could affect trading volumes or demand for market data. as a result, it is difficult to predict all of the effects that the legislation and its implementing regulations will have on us. as discussed more fully in item 1 "- business - regulation" included in this annual report, brexit, mifid ii and other regulations have resulted in operational, regulatory and/or business risk.
we have diversified our business so that we are not dependent on volatility or transaction activity in any one asset class. in addition, we have increased our portion of recurring revenues from 34% in 2014 to 52% in 2023. these recurring revenues include data services, listings and various mortgage technology solutions.
many of the data products we sell and services we provide are required for our clients' business operations regardless of market volatility or shifts in business profitability levels. we anticipate that there will continue to be growth in the financial information services sector driven by a number of global trends, including the following:
•increasing global regulatory demands;
•greater use of fair value accounting standards and reliance on independent valuations;
•greater emphasis on risk management;
•market fragmentation driven by regulatory changes;
•ongoing growth in the size and diversity of financial markets;
•increased automation of fixed income, mortgage and other less automated markets;
•the development of new data products;
•the demand for greater data capacity and connectivity;
•increasing demand for outsourced services by financial institutions.
we continue to focus on our strategy to grow each of our revenue streams, and prudently manage expenses, in order to mitigate these uncertainties and to build on our growth opportunities by leveraging our proprietary data, clearing, markets and technology solutions.
segment results our business is conducted through three reportable business segments: exchanges, fixed income and data services and mortgage technology. segments are discussed more in detail in "item 1- business". while revenues are recorded specifically in the segment in which they are earned or to which they relate, a significant portion of our operating expenses are not solely related to a specific segment because the expenses serve functions that are necessary for the operation of more than one segment. we directly allocate expenses when reasonably possible to do so. otherwise, we use a pro-rata revenue approach as the allocation method for the expenses that do not relate solely to one segment and serve functions that are necessary for the operation of all segments. our segments do not engage in intersegment transactions.
exchanges segment the following presents selected statements of income data for our exchanges segment (dollars in millions):

(1) transaction-based expenses are largely attributable to our cash equities and options business.
exchanges revenues our exchanges segment includes transaction and clearing revenues from our futures and nyse exchanges, related data and connectivity services, and our listings business. transaction and clearing revenues consist of fees collected from derivatives, cash equities and equity options trading and derivatives clearing, and are reported on a net basis, except for the nyse transaction-based expenses discussed below. rates per-contract, or rpc, are driven by the number of contracts or securities traded and the fees charged per contract, net of certain rebates. our per-contract transaction and clearing revenues will depend upon many factors, including, but not limited to, market conditions, transaction and clearing volume, product mix, pricing, applicable revenue sharing and market making agreements, and new product introductions.
transaction and clearing revenues are generally assessed on a per-contract basis and revenues and profitability fluctuate with changes in contract volume and product mix. we consider data and connectivity services revenues and listings revenues to be recurring revenues. our data and connectivity services revenues are recurring subscription fees related to the various data and connectivity services that we provide which are directly attributable to our exchange venues. our listings revenues are also recurring subscription fees that we earn for the provision of nyse listings services for public companies and etfs, and related corporate actions for listed companies.
in 2023 and 2022, 20% and 18%, respectively, of our exchanges segment revenues, less transaction-based expenses, were billed in pounds sterling or euros. due to the fluctuations of the pound sterling and euro compared to the u.s. dollar, our exchanges segment revenues, less transaction-based expenses, were higher by $14 million in 2023 from 2022.
our exchange transaction and clearing revenues are presented net of rebates. we recorded rebates of $989 million and $869 million in 2023 and 2022, respectively. we offer rebates in certain of our markets primarily to support market liquidity and trading volume by providing qualified participants in those markets a discount to the applicable commission rate. such rebates are calculated based on volumes traded. the increase in rebates is primarily due to higher volumes traded as compared to 2022.
•energy futures and options: total energy volume increased 17% and revenues increased 29% in 2023 from 2022.
-total oil futures and options volume increased 19% in 2023 from 2022 driven, in part, by price volatility related to oil supply/demand dynamics and geopolitical risk, coupled with increased focus on brent with midland wti now deliverable into the brent basket, providing additional physical liquidity and exposure.
-our global natural gas futures and options volume increased 16% in 2023 from 2022 primarily due to strength in our dutch ttf complex as natural gas continues to globalize, coupled with price volatility related to geopolitical events in late 2023.
-our environmentals and other futures and options volume were flat in 2023 from 2022.
•agricultural and metals futures and options: total volume in our agricultural and metals futures and options markets increased 16% and revenues increased 15% in 2023 from 2022. the overall increase in agricultural volumes was primarily due to 2023 benefiting from elevated price volatility as a result of weather-related supply and demand dynamics, such as el nino, driving an increased need to manage risk across our commodity markets.
-sugar futures and options volumes increased 20% in 2023 from 2022.
-other agricultural and metal futures and options volumes increased 13% in 2023 from 2022.
•financial futures and options: total volume in our financial futures and options markets was flat and revenues decreased 3% in 2023 from 2022, including the impacts of foreign exchange effects.
-interest rate futures and options volume increased 4% and revenue increased 2% in 2023 from 2022 driven by interest rate volatility and speculation regarding central bank activity in late 2023. interest rate futures and options revenues were $299 million and $292 million in 2023 and 2022, respectively.
-other financial futures and options volume, which includes our msci®, ftse® and nyse fang+ equity index products, decreased 15% and revenue decreased 12% in 2023 from 2022. other financial futures and options volume decreased as 2022 benefited from elevated volatility across global equity markets driven by geopolitical events, central bank activity and inflationary concerns. other financial futures and options revenues were $161 million and $183 million in 2023 and 2022, respectively.
•cash equities and equity options: cash equities volume decreased 7% in 2023 from 2022 due to lower total market volumes as 2022 benefited from elevated volatility related to inflationary, recessionary and geopolitical concerns. cash equities revenues, net of transaction-based expenses, were $268 million and $275 million in 2023 and 2022, respectively. equity options volume increased 4% in 2023 from 2022 driven by increased participation. equity options revenues, net of transaction-based expenses, were $115 million and $103 million in 2023 and 2022, respectively.
•otc and other: otc and other transactions include revenues from our otc energy business and other trade confirmation services, as well as interest income on certain clearing margin deposits, regulatory penalties and fines, fees for use of our facilities, regulatory fees charged to member organizations of our u.s. securities exchanges, designated market maker service fees, exchange membership fees and agricultural grading and certification fees. our otc and other revenues decreased 7% in 2023 from 2022 primarily due to a decrease in interest income on clearing margin deposits.
•data and connectivity services: our data and connectivity services revenues increased 6% in 2023 from 2022. the increase in revenue was driven by the strong retention rate of existing customers, the addition of new customers and increased purchases by existing customers.
•listings revenues: through nyse, nyse american and nyse arca, we generate listings revenue related to the provision of listings services for public companies and etfs, and related corporate actions for listed companies. listings revenues decreased 4% in 2023 from 2022, driven by market volatility causing delays in initial public offerings, or ipos.
listings revenues in our securities markets arise from fees applicable to companies listed on our cash equities exchanges- original listing fees and annual listing fees. original listing fees consist of two components: initial listing fees and fees related to corporate actions. initial listing fees, subject to a minimum and maximum amount, are based on the number of shares that a company initially lists. all listings fees are billed upfront and the identified performance obligations are satisfied over time. revenue related to the investor relations performance obligation is recognized ratably over the period these services are provided, with the remaining revenue recognized ratably over time as customers continue to list on our exchanges.
in addition, we earn corporate actions-related listing fees in connection with actions involving the issuance of new shares, such as stock splits, rights issues and sales of additional securities, as well as mergers and acquisitions.
listings fees related to other corporate actions are considered contract modifications of our listing contracts and are recognized ratably over time as customers continue to list on our exchanges.
additionally, in 2023, nyse reported 32 listing transfers from competing exchanges, the second-highest total since 2002, bringing $120 billion in new market capitalization to the exchange and also listed two of the year's three largest ipos.
selected operating data volume of contracts traded, futures and options rate per contract and open interest are measures that we use in analyzing the performance of our futures and options contracts. handled volume, matched volume and cash equities and equity options rate per contract are measures that we use in analyzing our nyse cash equities and equity options performance. we believe each of these measures provides useful information for management and investors in understanding our performance. management considers these metrics when making financial and operating decisions. our calculation of these metrics may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies.

open interest is the aggregate number of contracts (long or short) that clearing members hold either for their own account or on behalf of their clients. open interest refers to the total number of contracts that are currently "open," - in other words, contracts that have been entered into but not yet liquidated by either an offsetting trade, exercise, expiration or assignment. open interest is also a measure of the future activity remaining to be closed out in terms of the number of contracts that members and their clients continue to hold in the particular contract and by the number of contracts held for each contract month listed by the exchange. the following charts and table present our year-end open interest for our futures and options contracts (in thousands, except for percentages):

transaction-based expenses our equities and equity options markets pay fees to the sec pursuant to section 31 of the exchange act. section 31 fees are recorded on a gross basis as a component of transaction and clearing fee revenue. these section 31 fees are assessed to recover the government's costs of supervising and regulating the securities markets and professionals and are subject to change. we, in turn, collect corresponding activity assessment fees from member organizations clearing or settling trades on the equities and options exchanges, and recognize these amounts in our transaction and clearing revenues when invoiced. the activity assessment fees are designed to equal the section 31 fees. as a result, activity assessment fees and the corresponding section 31 fees do not have an impact on our net income, although the timing of payment by us will vary from collections. section 31 fees were $293 million and $499 million in 2023 and 2022, respectively. the decrease in section 31 fees was primarily due to a decrease in rates. the fees we collect are included in cash at the time of receipt and we remit the amounts to the sec semi-annually as required. the total amount is included in current liabilities and was $79 million as of december 31, 2023.
we make liquidity payments to cash and options trading customers, as well as routing charges made to other exchanges which are included in transaction-based expenses. we incur routing charges when we do not have the best bid or offer in the market for a security that a customer is trying to buy or sell on one of our securities exchanges. in that case, we route the customer's order to the external market center that displays the best bid or offer. the external market center charges us a fee per share (denominated in tenths of a cent per share) for routing to its system. we record routing charges on a gross basis as a component of transaction and clearing fee revenue. cash liquidity payments, routing and clearing fees were $1.6 billion and $1.8 billion in 2023 and 2022, respectively.

in the table above, we consider fixed income data and analytics revenues and other data and network services revenues to be recurring revenues.
in both 2023 and 2022, 11%, of our fixed income and data services segment revenues were billed in pounds sterling or euros. as the pound sterling or euro exchange rate changes, the u.s. equivalent of revenues denominated in foreign currencies changes accordingly. due to the fluctuations of the pound sterling and euro compared to the u.s. dollar during 2023, our fixed income and data services revenues were higher by $3 million in 2023 than in 2022.
fixed income and data services revenues our fixed income and data services revenues increased 7% in 2023 from 2022 due to growth in our other data and network services and our fixed income data and analytics products, coupled with strength in cds clearing.
•fixed income execution: fixed income execution includes revenues from ice bonds. execution fees are reported net of rebates, which were nominal in 2023 and 2022. our fixed income execution revenues increased 23% in 2023 from 2022 due to increased activity as a result of continued interest rate volatility.
•cds clearing: cds clearing revenues increased 18% in 2023 from 2022. the notional value of cds cleared was $18.8 trillion and $23.8 trillion in 2023 and 2022, respectively. the increase in revenues was primarily due to net interest income on collateral balances.
•fixed income data and analytics: our fixed income data and analytics revenues increased 2% in 2023 from 2022 primarily due to strength in our index business and growth in our pricing and reference data business.
•other data and network services: our other data and network services revenues increased 7% in 2023 from 2022. the increase in revenues was driven by growth in our ice global network offering, coupled with strength in our desktops, feeds and derivatives analytics revenues.
annual subscription value, or asv, represents, at a point in time, the data services revenues, which includes fixed income data and analytics as well as other data and network services, subscribed for the succeeding 12 months. asv does not include new sales, contract terminations or price changes that may occur during that 12-month period. however, while it is an indicative forward-looking metric, it does not provide a precise growth forecast of the next 12 months of data services revenues. management considers asv metrics when making financial and operating decisions, and believes asv is useful for management and investors in understanding our data services business performance.
as of december 31, 2023, asv was $1.752 billion, which increased 4.2% compared to the asv as of december 31, 2022. asv represents nearly 100% of total data services revenues for this segment. this does not adjust for year-over-year foreign exchange fluctuations.

*percentage changes in the table above deemed "n/a" are not meaningful.
in the table above, we consider subscription fee and certain other revenues to be recurring revenues. each revenue classification above contains a mix of recurring and transaction revenues, based on the various service offerings described in more detail below.
during 2023, we reclassified certain revenues within our mortgage technology segment that were previously included in other revenues to closing solutions, origination technology and data and analytics revenues. closing solutions revenues now include membership dues, and origination technology revenues and data and analytics revenues now include mortgage-related professional services revenues. as of december 31, 2023, other revenues are no longer separately presented. we believe this is a more accurate reflection of the nature of these revenues. the impact of this change was not material, and the prior year periods have been adjusted for comparability. additionally, following the acquisition of black knight and beginning in the third quarter of 2023, we have added servicing software to our mortgage technology segment revenues. the comparable periods in 2022 results do not include a contribution from the black knight acquisition.
mortgage technology revenues our mortgage technology revenues are derived from our comprehensive, end-to-end u.s. residential mortgage platform. our mortgage technology business is intended to enable greater workflow efficiency and mitigate risks for customers throughout the mortgage life cycle. black knight contributed $363 million of revenues in 2023 following completion of the acquisition. excluding the revenue contributed by black knight, mortgage technology revenues decreased $175 million or 15% in 2023 from 2022, primarily due to lower mortgage origination volumes driven by rising interest rates.
•origination technology: our origination technology revenues decreased 13% in 2023 from 2022 due to lower transaction-based revenues as mortgage origination volumes declined during 2023, offset by $11 million of origination technology revenue from black knight following completion of our acquisition in september 2023. our origination technology acts as a system of record for the mortgage transaction, automating the gathering, reviewing, and verifying of mortgage-related information and enabling automated enforcement of rules and business practices designed to help ensure that each completed loan transaction is of high quality and adheres to secondary market standards. these revenues are based on recurring software as a service, or saas, subscription fees, with an additive transaction-based or success-based pricing fee as lenders exceed the number of loans closed that are included with their monthly base subscription, as well as professional services.
in addition, the ice mortgage technology network provides originators connectivity to the mortgage supply chain and facilitates the secure exchange of information between our customers and a broad ecosystem of third-party service providers, as well as lenders and investors that are critical to consummating the millions of loan transactions that occur on our origination network each year. revenue from the ice mortgage technology network is largely transaction-based.
•closing solutions: our closing solutions revenues decreased 25% in 2023 from 2022 due to lower mortgage origination volumes. our closing solutions connect key participants, such as lenders, title and settlement agents and individual county recorders, to digitize the closing and recording process. closing solutions also include revenues from our merscorp holdings, inc., or mers database, which provides a system of record for recording and tracking changes, servicing rights and beneficial ownership interests in loans secured by u.s. residential real estate. revenues from closing solutions are largely transaction-based and are based on the volume of loans closed.
•servicing software: our servicing software revenues include integrated mortgage servicing solutions, which help automate all areas of the servicing process, from loan boarding to final payment or default, to help lower costs, reduce risk and improve financial performance. our servicing solutions support first lien mortgages, home equity loans and lines of credit on a single platform to manage all servicing processes, including loan setup and maintenance, escrow administration, investor reporting, and regulatory requirements. we also provide solutions that provide consumers with access to customized, timely information about their mortgages and allow our clients' customer service representatives to access the same customer information, which is key to increasing borrower retention. another servicing solution provides clients, third-party providers and their developers access to our growing catalog of apis across the mortgage life cycle.
our default servicing solutions help simplify the complex process for loans that move into default, while supporting servicers with their compliance requirements and to facilitate more efficient loss mitigation processes.
we also offer advanced technology to support the bankruptcy and foreclosure process, and more efficiently manage claims related to properties in foreclosure, as well as tools to support loss analysis, to help servicers make the right decisions at the right time.
•data and analytics: our data and analytics revenues increased 69% in 2023 from 2022 primarily due to $63 million of revenue from black knight following completion of our acquisition in september 2023. data and analytics revenues include those related to ice mortgage technology's data & document automation and mortgage analyzer solutions, or analyzer (formerly known as aiq), which offers customers greater efficiency by streamlining data collection and validation through our automated document recognition and data extraction capabilities. analyzer revenues can be both recurring and transaction-based in nature. in addition, our data offerings include near real-time industry and peer benchmarking tools, which provide originators a granular view into the real-time trends of the u.s. residential mortgage market, as well as credit and prepayment models, custom and proprietary analytics, valuation, and mls solutions. we also provide a data as a service, or daas, for lenders and industry participants to access industry data and origination information. the data and insights from these solutions inform, support and enhance our other solutions to help lenders and servicers make more informed decisions, improve performance, identify and predict risk and generate more qualified leads. revenues related to our data products are largely subscription-based and recurring in nature.
our data and analytics offerings include property ownership data, lien data, servicing data, automated valuation models and collateral risk scores, among others, provided to clients in the mortgage, real estate and capital markets verticals.
operating expenses, operating income and operating margin the following chart summarizes our mortgage technology segment's operating expenses, operating income and operating margin (dollars in millions). the primary driver of the increase in operating expenses is related to the impact of the black knight acquisition and the corresponding black knight related operating expenses. the resulting operating loss and negative margin is primarily related to the acquisition-related transaction and integration costs incurred during the year. see "- consolidated operating expenses" below for a discussion of the significant changes in our operating expenses.

consolidated operating expenses the following presents our consolidated operating expenses (dollars in millions):
2023                                                                                             2022                  change                     2022                        2021                  change compensation and benefits                                      $1,595                      $1,407                     13    %               $1,407                      $1,462                    (4)    %
professional services                                             123                             131                (6)                       131                         159                   (17)
total operating expenses                                       $4,294                      $3,654                     18    %               $3,654                      $3,697                    (1)    %
the majority of our operating expenses do not vary directly with changes in our volume and revenues, except for certain technology and communication expenses, including data acquisition costs, licensing and other fee-related arrangements and a portion of our compensation expense that is tied directly to our data sales or overall financial performance.
we expect our operating expenses to increase in absolute terms in future periods in connection with the growth of our business, and to vary from year-to-year based on the type and level of our acquisitions, integration of acquisitions, and other investments.
in both 2023 and 2022, 9% of our operating expenses were billed in pounds sterling or euros. due to fluctuations in the u.s. dollar compared to the pound sterling and euro, our consolidated operating expenses were $4 million higher in 2023 than in 2022. see item 7(a) "- quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk - foreign currency exchange rate risk" below for additional information.
compensation and benefits expenses compensation and benefits expense is our most significant operating expense and includes non-capitalized employee wages, bonuses, non-cash or stock compensation, certain severance costs, benefits and employer taxes. the bonus component of our compensation and benefits expense is based on both our financial performance and individual employee performance. the performance-based restricted stock compensation expense is also based on our financial performance. therefore, our compensation and benefits expense will vary year-to-year based on our financial performance and fluctuations in our number of employees. the below chart summarizes the significant drivers of our compensation and benefits expense results for the periods presented (dollars in millions, except employee headcount).
2023                                                       2022                                         change employee headcount                           13,222                         8,911                      48    %
employee headcount increased in 2023 from 2022 primarily due to our acquisition of black knight.
compensation and benefits expense increased $188 million in 2023 from 2022 primarily due to $155 million attributable to our acquisition of black knight and an increase in our bonus and noncash performance-based restricted stock compensation accruals, partially offset by higher capitalized labor and lower payroll. the stock-based compensation expenses in the table above relate to employee stock option and restricted stock awards and exclude stock-based compensation related to acquisition-related transaction and integration costs.
professional services expenses professional services expense includes fees for consulting services received on strategic and technology initiatives, temporary labor, as well as regulatory, legal and accounting fees, and may fluctuate as a result of changes in our use of these services in our business.
professional services expenses decreased $8 million in 2023 from 2022 primarily due to lower consulting expenses related to bringing certain mortgage technology-related costs in-house, partially offset by higher legal expenses primarily related to the black knight acquisition.
acquisition-related transaction and integration costs in 2023, we incurred $269 million in acquisition-related transaction and integration costs primarily due to legal, consulting and integration expenses related to our acquisition and integration of black knight and our integration of ellie mae. included in the acquisition-related transaction and integration costs was $55 million of black knight replacement restricted stock awards that accelerated due to the divestitures and certain terminations.
we expect to continue to explore and pursue various potential acquisitions and other strategic opportunities to strengthen our competitive position and support our growth. as a result, we may incur acquisition-related transaction costs in future periods.
technology and communication expenses technology support services consist of costs for running our wholly-owned data centers, hosting costs paid to third-party data centers, and maintenance of our computer hardware and software required to support our technology and cybersecurity. these costs are driven by system capacity, functionality and redundancy requirements. communication expenses consist of costs for network connections for our electronic platforms and telecommunications costs.
technology and communications expense also includes fees paid for access to external market data, licensing and other fee agreement expenses. technology and communications expenses may be impacted by growth in electronic contract volume, our capacity requirements, changes in the number of telecommunications hubs and connections with customers to access our electronic platforms directly.
technology and communications expenses increased by $51 million in 2023 from 2022, primarily due to $40 million related to black knight and increased hardware and software support costs, partially offset by a decrease in license expense.
rent and occupancy expenses rent and occupancy expense relates to leased and owned property and includes rent, maintenance, real estate taxes, utilities and other related costs. we have significant operations located in the u.s., u.k., and india, with smaller offices located throughout the world.
rent and occupancy expenses increased $9 million in 2023 from 2022, primarily due to $5 million related to black knight and other increases in rent and utility costs. see item 2 "- properties" above for additional information regarding our leased and owned property.
selling, general and administrative expenses selling, general and administrative expenses include marketing, advertising, public relations, insurance, bank service charges, dues and subscriptions, travel and entertainment, non-income taxes and other general and administrative costs.
selling, general and administrative expenses increased $40 million in 2023 from 2022, primarily due to $8 million attributable to black knight, payments of claims made following a nyse system outage that occurred in january 2023, accruals for regulatory matters, an increase in travel and entertainment expenses and increased bad debt expense.
depreciation and amortization expenses depreciation and amortization expense results from depreciation of long-lived assets such as buildings, leasehold improvements, aircraft, hardware and networking equipment, software, furniture, fixtures and equipment over their estimated useful lives. this expense includes amortization of intangible assets obtained in our acquisitions of businesses, as well as on various licensing agreements, over their estimated useful lives. intangible assets subject to amortization consist primarily of customer relationships, trading products with finite lives and technology. this expense also includes amortization of internally-developed and purchased software over its estimated useful life.
we recorded amortization expenses on intangible assets acquired as part of our acquisitions, as well as on other intangible assets, of $749 million and $610 million in 2023 and 2022, respectively. during 2023, $141 million in amortization expense was related to intangible assets acquired in connection with our black knight acquisition.
we recorded depreciation expenses on our fixed assets of $466 million and $421 million in 2023 and 2022, respectively. the increase in 2023 over 2022 was primarily due to an increase in internally developed software assets in our mortgage technology segment.
consolidated non-operating income/(expense)
income and expenses incurred through activities outside of our core operations are considered non-operating. the following tables present our non-operating income/(expenses) (dollars in millions):
2023                                                                        2022                                         change                       2022   2021                                      change*
*percentage changes in the table above deemed "n/a" are not meaningful.
interest income interest income increased in 2023 from 2022 primarily due to an increase in short-term interest rates combined with larger investment balances. interest income primarily represents interest earned on our short-term investments, and in 2023 and 2022 included $213 million and $83 million, respectively, in interest income recognized in connection with the short-term investments related to both the $5 billion of the notes (as defined in "liquidity and capital resources- debt") issued and the operating cash accumulated for the black knight acquisition. in addition, our clearing houses also earned interest income of $88 million in 2023 and $22 million in 2022. the remainder primarily relates to interest earned on various unrestricted and restricted cash balances held within our group entities.
interest expense interest expense on our outstanding debt increased $192 million in 2023 driven primarily by the debt raised to fund the black knight acquisition. interest expense on the $5 billion of senior notes issued in may 2022 to partially fund the black knight acquisition resulted in an incremental increase in interest expense of $87 million. in addition, in 2023 we incurred interest expense of $88 million on borrowings under our term loan facility and issuances under our commercial paper program (each as defined in "liquidity and capital resources-debt"), both of which partially funded the black knight acquisition. we also assumed a $1 billion senior note in connection with our black knight acquisition which resulted in $17 million of interest expense during 2023. see "- debt" below.
other income/(expense), net our equity method investments include occ and bakkt, among others. we recognized losses of $122 million and $1.3 billion during 2023 and 2022, respectively, of our share of estimated equity method investment losses, net, and impairment charges, which are included in other income/(expense), net. the estimated losses and impairment during 2023 and 2022 are primarily related to our investment in bakkt. these are partially offset by the estimated profits related to our investment in occ. both 2023 and 2022 include adjustments to reflect the difference between reported prior period actual results from our original estimates.
in 2022, after recording our share of bakkt's equity method losses, which included bakkt's impairment charge, we recorded an impairment charge on our investment in bakkt to its fair value as other expense. this was based on what we consider to be an other-than-temporary decline in fair value as a result of several factors, including consideration of the impairment charge recorded by bakkt (see notes 3 and 4 to our consolidated financial statements).
in connection with our acquisition of black knight, we acquired an investment in dun & bradstreet, which we classified as an equity investment. subsequent to the black knight acquisition and prior to december 31, 2023, we sold the entire investment for a total of $187 million and realized a total loss of $3 million on the sales, net of dividends received, which is included in other income/(expense), net in 2023.
in connection with our sale of black knight's optimal blue and empower los businesses we received a promissory note as part of the sale proceeds that was originally valued at $235 million on the divestiture date. as we elected the fair value option for the promissory note, we are required to mark the asset to fair value each reporting period. for subsequent measurement as of december 31, 2023, we wrote down the value of the promissory note, resulting in a fair value loss of $160 million, which is included in other income/(expense), net in 2023.
during 2023, we recorded an impairment related to our cat loan receivable of $16 million. during 2022, we recorded a $9 million accrual for legal settlements.
we completed the sale of our euroclear stake on may 20, 2022. the carrying value of our investment was $700 million at the time of the sale. we recorded a net gain of $41 million on the sale, which was included in other income during 2022. we did not receive a euroclear dividend during the 2022 prior to the sale of our investment.
we incurred foreign currency transaction losses of $12 million and $9 million in 2023 and 2022, respectively. this was primarily attributable to the fluctuations of the pound sterling and euro relative to the u.s. dollar. foreign currency transaction gains and losses are recorded in other income/(expense), net, when the settlement of foreign currency assets, liabilities and payables occur in non-functional currencies and there is an increase or decrease in the period-end foreign currency exchange rates between periods. see item 7a "- quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk -foreign currency exchange rate risk" included elsewhere in this annual report for more information on these items.
in connection with accounting standards update, or asu, 2017-07, compensation retirement benefits: improving the presentation of net periodic pension cost and net periodic postretirement benefit cost, or asu 2017-07, we are recognizing the other components of net benefit cost of our defined benefit plans in the income statement as non-operating income on a full retrospective basis. the combined net periodic expense/(benefit) of these plans was ($2 million) and $2 million in 2023 and 2022, respectively.
non-controlling interest for consolidated subsidiaries in which our ownership is less than 100%, and for which we have control over the assets, liabilities and management of the entity, the outside stockholders' interests are shown as non-controlling interests. as of december 31, 2023, our non-controlling interests include those related to the non-ice limited partners' interest in our cds clearing subsidiaries and non-controlling interest in ice futures abu dhabi.
consolidated income tax provision consolidated income tax expense was $456 million and $310 million in 2023 and 2022, respectively. the change in consolidated income tax expense between years is primarily due to the tax impact of changes in our pre-tax income and the changes in our effective tax rate.
our effective tax rate was 16% and 17% in 2023 and 2022, respectively. the 16% effective tax rate for the current year was below the statutory u.s. federal corporate income tax rate primarily driven by the following factors: favorable audit settlements for historical years, favorable state apportionment changes and the application of the high-tax exception to global intangible low-taxed income. these 2023 tax benefits were partially offset by the impact of the u.k. corporate income tax increase from 19% to 25% effective april 1, 2023 and the tax impact of certain non-deductible black knight acquisition costs. in conjunction with the increase in the u.k. corporate income tax rate in 2023, we intend to elect the high-tax exception to global intangible low-taxed income in 2023 in our federal income tax return to be filed in 2024. our 2023 tax provision includes the impacts of this election. the 17% effective tax rate for 2022 was below the statutory u.s. federal corporate income tax rate as well, primarily driven by the deferred income tax benefit from the impairment to our equity investment in bakkt in 2022.
the oecd global anti-base erosion pillar two minimum tax rules, or pillar two, which generally provide for a minimum effective tax rate of 15%, are intended to apply to tax years beginning in 2024. the eu member states and many other countries, including the u.k., our most significant non-us jurisdiction, have committed to implement or have already enacted legislation adopting the pillar two rules. in july 2023, the u.k. enacted the u.k. finance act 2023, effective as of january 1, 2024, which included provisions to implement certain portions of the oecd global anti-base erosion pillar two minimum tax rules and included an election to apply a transitional safe harbor to extend certain effective dates to accounting periods ending on or before june 30, 2028. these new u.k. pillar two rules did not have a material impact on our income tax provision as of december 31, 2023.
see note 13 to our consolidated financial statements and related notes, which are included in this annual report, for additional information on these tax items.
liquidity and capital resources below are charts that reflect our outstanding debt and capital allocation. the acquisition and integration costs in the chart below include cash paid for acquisitions, net of cash acquired and cash received for divestitures, cash paid for equity and equity method investments, and acquisition-related transaction and integration costs, in each year.
(1) 2021, 2022, and 2023 acquisition and integration costs, net of divestitures excludes $1.2 billion, $741 million, and $187 million of proceeds from sales of our coinbase, euroclear, and dun & bradstreet investments, respectively.
we have financed our operations, growth and cash needs primarily through income from operations and borrowings under our various debt facilities. our principal capital requirements have been to fund capital expenditures, working capital, strategic acquisitions and investments, stock repurchases, dividends and the development of our technology platforms. we believe that our cash on hand and cash flows from operations will be sufficient to repay our outstanding debt, but we may also incur additional debt or issue additional equity securities in the future to satisfy our liquidity needs. see "- future capital requirements" below.
see "- cash flow" below for a discussion of our capital expenditures and capitalized software development costs.
consolidated cash and cash equivalents were $899 million and $1.8 billion as of december 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. we had $871 million and $6.6 billion in short-term and long-term restricted cash and cash equivalents as of december 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. we had $680 million in restricted short-term investments as of december 31, 2023. we had $79.0 billion and $142.0 billion of cash and cash equivalent margin deposits and guaranty funds as of december 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.
as of december 31, 2023, the amount of unrestricted cash held by our non-u.s. subsidiaries was $374 million. due to the application of global intangible low-taxed income as of january 1, 2018, the majority of our foreign earnings for the period january 1, 2018 through december 31, 2022 have been subject to immediate u.s. income taxation, and can be distributed to the u.s. in the future with no material additional u.s. income tax consequences. we intend to apply the high tax exception to global intangible low-taxed income in 2023, and thus the majority of our foreign earnings in the current year are not expected to be subject to immediate u.s. income taxation. however, these foreign earnings can also generally be distributed to the u.s. with no additional u.s. income tax consequences.
our cash and cash equivalents and financial investments are managed as a global treasury portfolio of non-speculative financial instruments that are readily convertible into cash, such as overnight deposits, term deposits, money market funds, mutual funds for treasury investments, short duration fixed income investments and other money market instruments, thus ensuring high liquidity of financial assets. we may invest a portion of our cash in excess of short-term operating needs in investment-grade marketable debt securities, including government or government-sponsored agencies and corporate debt securities.
cash flow the following table presents the major components of net changes in cash and cash equivalents, and restricted cash and cash equivalents (in millions):

as of december 31, 2022, we had $18.1 billion in outstanding debt, all of which related to our senior notes. we also had $4.0 million outstanding under credit lines at our ice india subsidiaries. as of december 31, 2022, our senior notes had a weighted average maturity of 16 years and a weighted average cost of 3.6% per annum. we did not have any commercial paper notes or term loan balances outstanding as of december 31, 2022.
we have a $3.9 billion senior unsecured revolving credit facility, or the credit facility, with a maturity date of may 25, 2027. as of december 31, 2023, of the $3.9 billion that was available for borrowing under the credit facility, $2.0 billion was required to backstop the amount outstanding under the commercial paper program and $172 million was required to support certain broker-dealer and other subsidiary commitments. amounts required to backstop notes outstanding under the commercial paper program will fluctuate as we increase or decrease our commercial paper borrowings. the remaining $1.8 billion is available for working capital and general corporate purposes, including, but not limited to, acting as a backstop to future increases in the amounts outstanding under the commercial paper program.
on may 23, 2022, we issued $8.0 billion in aggregate principal amount of new senior notes, comprised of the following:
•$1.25 billion in aggregate principal amount of 3.65% senior notes due in 2025, or the 2025 notes;
•$1.5 billion in aggregate principal amount of 4.00% senior notes due in 2027, or the 2027 notes;
•$1.25 billion in aggregate principal amount of 4.35% senior notes due in 2029, or the 2029 notes;
•$1.5 billion in aggregate principal amount of 4.60% senior notes due in 2033, or the 2033 notes;
•$1.5 billion in aggregate principal amount of 4.95% senior notes due in 2052, or the 2052 notes; and
•$1.0 billion in aggregate principal amount of 5.20% senior notes due in 2062, or the 2062 notes.
we used the net proceeds of our senior notes due in 2025, 2027, 2029 and 2062, or collectively, the notes, together with the issuance of commercial paper, cash on hand and borrowings under the term loan, to finance the cash portion of the purchase price for black knight. for additional information regarding this transaction, refer to note 3 to our consolidated unaudited financial statements, included in this annual report.
we used the $3.0 billion of net proceeds from the offering of the 2033 notes and the 2052 notes to redeem $2.7 billion aggregate principal amount of four series of senior notes that would have matured in 2022 and 2023. the balance of the net proceeds was used for general corporate purposes, which included paying down a portion of the amounts outstanding under our commercial paper program. we recorded $30 million in costs associated with the extinguishment and re-financing of our existing debt in connection with our may 2022 debt refinancing. these costs are included in interest expense in our consolidated statements of income for 2022. for additional information regarding this transaction, refer to note 3 to our consolidated unaudited financial statements, included in this annual report.
in november 2023, we commenced a private exchange offer and related consent solicitation with respect to the outstanding black knight notes, pursuant to which we offered to issue, in a private offering to eligible holders, new notes in exchange for any and all of the black knight notes held by eligible holders. we also solicited consents from eligible holders to amend the black knight notes and the related indenture under which they were issued to eliminate certain of the covenants, restrictive provisions and events of default from such indenture. the private exchange offer and related consent solicitation expired in december 2023 as the condition that ice receive the consents of the holders of at least a majority in aggregate principal amount of the black knight notes to adopt certain proposed amendments to the black knight notes and the related indenture under which they were issued was not satisfied. in the future, we may consider alternatives to restructure the black knight notes, which may include one or more consent solicitations and private exchange offers with eligible holders. however, we are not required to restructure the black knight notes and may or may not pursue any alternatives to do so. any such transaction will only be made in compliance with applicable laws.
on may 25, 2022, we entered into a $2.4 billion two-year senior unsecured delayed draw term loan facility, or the term loan. we drew down on the term loan in full on august 31, 2023 in connection with the closing of the black knight acquisition. on both september 29, 2023 and december 29, 2023, we repaid $400 million, reducing the principal outstanding balance at december 31, 2023, to $1.6 billion. draws under the term loan bear interest on the principal amount outstanding at term sofr plus an applicable margin, currently 5.46%, plus a credit spread adjustment. the proceeds from borrowings under the term loan were used to fund a portion of the purchase price for the black knight acquisition. we have the option to prepay outstanding amounts under the term loan in whole or in part at any time.
our commercial paper program enables us to borrow efficiently at reasonable short-term interest rates and provides us with the flexibility to de-lever using our strong annual cash flows from operating activities whenever our leverage becomes elevated as a result of investment or acquisition activities.
upon maturity of our commercial paper and to the extent old issuances are not repaid by cash on hand, we are exposed to the rollover risk of not being able to issue new commercial paper. to mitigate this risk, we maintain the credit facility for an aggregate amount which meets or exceeds the amount issued under our commercial paper program at any time. if we were not able to issue new commercial paper, we have the option of drawing on the backstop revolving facility. however, electing to do so would result in higher interest expense.
for additional details of our debt instruments, refer to note 10 to our consolidated financial statements, included in this annual report.
capital return in december 2021, our board approved an aggregate of $3.15 billion for future repurchases of our common stock with no fixed expiration date that became effective january 1, 2022. the approval of our board for stock repurchases does not obligate us to acquire any particular amount of our common stock. in addition, our board may increase or decrease the amount available for repurchases from time to time.
we did not have any share repurchases in 2023. during 2022, we repurchased 5.0 million shares of our outstanding common stock at a cost of $632 million, including 4.6 million shares at a cost of $582 million under our rule 10b5-1
trading plan and 0.4 million shares at a cost of $50 million on the open market. open market repurchases are only made during an open trading period and all shares repurchased are held in treasury stock.
we discontinued stock repurchases and terminated our rule 10b5-1 trading plan in august 2020 in connection with our ellie mae acquisition and in november 2021, we resumed repurchases. in december 2021, we entered into a new rule 10b5-1 trading plan that became effective in february 2022. in connection with our acquisition of black knight, on may 4, 2022, we terminated our rule 10b5-1 trading plan and suspended share repurchases. the remaining balance of board approved funds for future repurchases as of december 31, 2023 was $2.5 billion.
from time to time, we enter into rule 10b5-1 trading plans, as authorized by our board, to govern some or all of the repurchases of our shares of common stock. we may discontinue stock repurchases at any time and may amend or terminate a rule 10b5-1 trading plan at any time, subject to applicable rules. we expect funding for any stock repurchases to come from our operating cash flow or borrowings under our commercial paper program or our debt facilities. the timing and extent of future repurchases that are not made pursuant to a rule 10b5-1 trading plan will be at our discretion and will depend upon many conditions. in making a determination regarding any stock repurchases, management considers multiple factors, including overall stock market conditions, our common stock price performance, the remaining amount authorized for repurchases by our board, the potential impact of a stock repurchase program on our corporate debt ratings, our expected free cash flow and working capital needs, our current and future planned strategic growth initiatives, and other potential uses of our cash and capital resources.
during 2023, we paid cash dividends of $1.68 per share of our common stock in the aggregate, including quarterly dividends of $0.42 per share, for an aggregate payout of $955 million, which includes the payment of dividend equivalents on unvested employee restricted stock units. refer to note 12 to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report, for details on the amounts of our quarterly dividend payouts for the last three years.
future capital requirements our future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including the rate of growth across our segments, strategic plans and acquisitions, available sources for financing activities, required and discretionary technology and clearing initiatives, regulatory requirements, the timing and introduction of new products and enhancements to existing products, the geographic mix of our business and potential stock repurchases.
we currently expect to incur capital expenditures (including operational and real estate capital expenditures) and to incur software development costs that are eligible for capitalization ranging in the aggregate between $600 million and $650 million in 2024, which we believe will support the enhancement of our technology, business integration and the continued growth of our businesses.
as of december 31, 2023, we had $2.5 billion authorized for future repurchases of our common stock. we may resume repurchases of our common stock subject to achieving certain debt leverage ratio targets. refer to note 12 to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report for additional details on our stock repurchase program.
our board has adopted a quarterly dividend policy providing that dividends will be approved quarterly by the board or the audit committee taking into account factors such as our evolving business model, prevailing business conditions, our current and future planned strategic growth initiatives and our financial results and capital requirements, without a predetermined net income payout ratio. on february 8, 2024, we announced a $0.45 per share dividend for the first quarter of 2024 payable on march 29, 2024 to stockholders of record as of march 15, 2024.
other than the facilities for the ice clearing houses, our credit facility, our term loan and our commercial paper program are currently the only significant agreements or arrangements that we have for liquidity and capital resources with third parties. see notes 10 and 14 to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion. in the event of any strategic acquisitions, mergers or investments, or if we are required to raise capital for any reason or desire to return capital to our stockholders, we may incur additional debt, issue additional equity to raise necessary funds, repurchase additional shares of our common stock or pay a dividend. however, we cannot provide assurance that such financing or transactions will be available or successful, or that the terms of such financing or transactions will be favorable to us. see "-risk factors" and note 10 to our consolidated financial statements, included in this annual report.
non-gaap measures we use certain financial measures internally to evaluate our performance and make financial and operational decisions that are presented in a manner that adjusts from their equivalent gaap measures or that supplement the information provided by our gaap measures. we use these adjusted results because we believe they more clearly highlight trends in our business that may not otherwise be apparent when relying solely on gaap financial measures, since these measures eliminate from our results specific financial items that have less bearing on our core operating performance.
we use these measures in communicating certain aspects of our results and performance, including in this annual report, and believe that these measures, when viewed in conjunction with our gaap results and the accompanying reconciliation, can provide investors with greater transparency and a greater understanding of factors affecting our financial condition and results of operations than gaap measures alone. in addition, we believe the presentation of these measures is useful to investors for making period-to-period comparisons of results because the adjustments to gaap are not reflective of our core business performance.
these financial measures are not presented in accordance with, or as an alternative to, gaap financial measures and may be different from non-gaap measures used by other companies. we encourage investors to review the gaap financial measures included in this annual report, including our consolidated financial statements, to aid in their analysis and understanding of our performance and in making comparisons.
the table below outlines our adjusted operating expenses, adjusted operating income, adjusted operating margin, adjusted net income attributable to ice common stockholders and adjusted diluted earnings per share, which are non-gaap measures that are calculated by making adjustments for items we view as not reflective of our cash operations and core business performance. these measures, including the adjustments and their related income tax effect and other tax adjustments (in millions, except for percentages and per share amounts), are as follows:

amortization of acquisition-related intangibles are included in non-gaap adjustments as excluding these non-cash expenses provides greater clarity regarding our financial strength and stability of cash operating results.
transaction and integration costs are included as part of our core business expenses, except for those that are directly related to the announcement, closing, financing or termination of a transaction. however, we adjust for the acquisition-related transaction and integration costs relating to acquisitions such as black knight and ellie mae given the magnitude of the $11.8 and $11.4 billion, respectively, purchase prices of the acquisitions. we also adjusted for the acquisition-related transaction costs related to the merger of bakkt and vih in 2021 due to the significance of the transaction.
we adjust for gains and losses on investment transactions and changes in the fair value of our investments. our investments are not considered to be a part of our core business operations and the impacts of changes in our investments are often non-cash in nature.
the following non-gaap adjustments are reported in the table above related to investments:
•during 2023, we excluded the combined realized loss of $3 million related to our sales of the dun & bradstreet investment, net of dividends;
•during 2022, we excluded the $41 million gain on the sale of our euroclear investment;
•during 2021, we excluded a $34 million fair value gain on our euroclear equity investment and euroclear dividends received of $60 million;
•in 2021, we excluded the $1.4 billion gain on the deconsolidation of bakkt and the $1.2 billion gain on the sale of our coinbase equity investment.
similarly, and as included in the table above, we adjust for our share of net income/(losses) and impairment charges related to our equity method investments, which primarily include occ and bakkt. our share of 2021 net losses from unconsolidated investees includes the period from the bakkt merger on october 15, 2021 through december 31, 2021. in 2023, our share of total bakkt net losses was $135 million and our share of occ net income was $16 million. during 2022, after recording our share of bakkt's equity method losses, which included an impairment charge recorded by bakkt, we recorded an impairment in our investment in bakkt to its fair value as other expense. in 2022, the total bakkt net losses and impairment was $1.4 billion and our share of occ net income was $15 million. in 2021, our share of bakkt losses was $92 million and our share of occ income was $51 million. we believe these adjustments provide greater clarity of our performance given that equity method investments are non-cash and not a part of our core operations.
we adjust for certain items related to our debt. certain debt activities, such as the early termination of notes, pre-acquisition interest and expense and accelerated amortization of debt costs are not considered to be a part of our core business operations and the impacts of changes in our investments are often non-cash in nature. the following non-gaap adjustments are reported in the table above related to our debt:
•in 2023, we excluded $170 million of interest income earned on investments from the pre-acquisition debt proceeds. this adjustment was net of $158 million of interest expense on pre-acquisition-related debt from our may 2022 debt refinancing related to the black knight acquisition.
•in 2022, we excluded $59 million of net interest expense on pre-acquisition-related debt from our may 2022 debt refinancing related to the black knight acquisition. this adjustment was net of interest income earnings on investments from the pre-acquisition debt proceeds.
•in 2022, we adjusted for costs of $30 million associated with the may and june 2022 extinguishment of four series of senior notes that would have matured in 2022 and 2023 using proceeds from our may 2022 issuance of new senior notes.
•in 2021, we adjusted for the acceleration of unamortized costs of $4 million related to the september 2021 early redemption of our floating rate notes.
other adjustments not considered to be a part of our core business operations include:
•we adjust for the 2023 fair value loss of $160 million related to the black knight promissory note as this not believed to be part of our core operations.
•a $6 million expense for claims made following a nyse system outage that occurred in january 2023;
•2023 accruals related to regulatory matters of $11 million;
•the 2023 impairment related to our cat loan receivable of $16 million. the cat was approved by the sec in 2016 to improve regulators' ability to monitor trading activity;
•in 2021 we excluded a gain of $7 million related to the settlement of an acquisition-related indemnification claim and $16 million related to a legal settlement.
non-gaap tax adjustments include the tax impacts of the pre-tax non-gaap adjustments, deferred tax adjustments on acquisition-related intangibles and other tax adjustments. other tax adjustments of $79 million in 2023 are primarily related to audit settlements for pre-acquisition tax matters as well as state apportionment changes in prior years. deferred tax adjustments on acquisition-related intangibles include the impact of tax law changes and apportionment updates resulting in deferred tax (benefit)/expense of ($126 million), $9 million and $183 million in 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively, related to the following:
•deferred tax adjustments in in 2023 and 2022 related primarily to u.s. state apportionment changes; and
•deferred tax adjustments in 2021 related primarily to the u.k. tax law changes enacted in june 2021, which increased the u.k. corporate income tax rate from 19% to 25% effective april 1, 2023.
•other tax adjustments in 2023 are primarily related to audit settlements for pre-acquisition tax matters as well as state apportionment charges in prior years.

non-gaap liquidity measures we consider free cash flow and adjusted free cash flow to be non-gaap liquidity measures that provide useful information to management and investors to analyze cash resources generated from our operations. we believe that free cash flow and adjusted free cash flow are useful as the bases for comparing our performance with our competitors and demonstrate our ability to convert the reinvestment of capital expenditures and capitalized software development costs required to maintain and grow our business, as well as adjust for timing differences related to the payment of section 31 fees. these non-gaap liquidity measures are not presented in accordance with, or as an alternative to, gaap liquidity measures and may be different from non-gaap measures used by other companies. free cash flow and adjusted free cash flow, including the related adjustments are as follows (in millions):
net cash provided by operating activities                      $3,542                      $3,554                      $3,123

off-balance sheet arrangements as described in note 14 to our consolidated financial statements, which are included elsewhere in this annual report, certain clearing house collateral is reported off-balance sheet. we do not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities.
contractual obligations and commercial commitments we intend to fund our contractual obligations and commercial commitments from existing cash and cash flow from operations. as of december 31, 2023, our primary cash requirements include the following contractual and other obligations.
as of december 31, 2023, we had $22.6 billion in outstanding debt, including $2.0 billion of short-term debt. our outstanding debt consists of $19.0 billion of fixed rate senior notes, $1.6 billion under our term loan and $2.0 billion in commercial paper.
our operating leases primarily relate to our leased office space and data center facilities, and as of december 31, 2023, we had fixed lease payment obligations of $442 million, with $73 million payable within one-year.
we have other purchase obligations to purchase various goods and services that we believe are enforceable and legally binding.
in addition, we have $80.8 billion in cash and cash equivalent margin deposits and guaranty funds, invested deposits, delivery contracts payable and unsettled variation margin. clearing members of our clearing houses are required to deposit original margin and variation margin and to make deposits to a guaranty fund. the cash and cash equivalent deposits made to these margin accounts and to the guaranty fund are recorded in the consolidated balance sheets as current assets with corresponding current liabilities to the clearing members that deposited them. ice ngx administers the physical delivery of energy trading contracts. it has an equal and offsetting claim to and from its respective participants on opposite sides of the physically-settled contract, each of which is reflected as a delivery contract receivable with an offsetting delivery contract payable. see note 14 to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report for additional information on our clearing houses and the margin deposits, guaranty funds, invested deposits, delivery contracts payable and unsettled variation margin.
we also have unrecognized tax benefits, or utbs. as of december 31, 2023, our cumulative utbs were $268 million, and accrued interest and penalties related to utbs were $32 million. we are under examination by various tax authorities. we are unable to make a reasonable estimate of the periods of cash settlement because it is not possible to reasonably predict the amount of tax, interest and penalties, if any, that might be assessed by a tax authority or the timing of an assessment or payment. it is also not possible to reasonably predict whether or not the applicable statutes of limitations might expire without us being examined by any particular tax authority. see note 13 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information on our utbs.
as of december 31, 2023, we, through nyse, have net obligations of $102 million related to our pension and other benefit programs. the date of payment under these net obligations cannot be determined. see note 17 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information on our pension and other benefit programs.
in addition, the future funding of the implementation and operation of the cat is ultimately expected to be provided by both the sros and broker-dealers. to date, however, funding has been provided solely by the sros, and future funding is expected to be repaid if industry member fees are approved by the sec and subsequently collected by industry members.
new and recently adopted accounting pronouncements refer to note 2 to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report for information on the new and recently adopted accounting pronouncements that are applicable to us.
critical accounting policies we have identified the policies below as critical to our business operations and the understanding of our results of operations. the impact of, and any associated risks related to, these policies on our business operations is discussed throughout "- management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations." for a detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies, see note 2 to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report.
our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with u.s. gaap. the preparation of financial statements in conformity with these accounting principles requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities, and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities, at the date of our financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
we base our estimates and judgments on our historical experience and other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances when we make these estimates and judgments and re-evaluate them on a periodic basis. based on these factors, we make estimates and judgments about, among other things, the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from market prices or other independent sources and about the recognition and characterization of our revenues and expenses. the values and results based on these estimates and judgments could differ significantly under different assumptions or conditions and could change materially in the future.
we believe that the following critical accounting policies, among others, affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements and could materially increase or decrease our reported results, assets and liabilities.
goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets assets acquired and liabilities assumed in connection with our acquisitions are recorded at their estimated fair values. goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price of an acquired company over the fair value of its identifiable net assets, including identified intangible assets. we recognize specifically identifiable intangibles, such as customer relationships, trademarks, technology, trading products, data, exchange registrations, backlog, trade names and licenses when a specific right or contract is acquired. our determination of the fair value of the intangible assets and whether or not these assets may be impaired following their acquisition requires us to apply significant judgments and make significant estimates and assumptions regarding future cash flows. if we change our strategy or if market conditions shift, our judgments and estimates may change, which may result in adjustments to recorded asset balances. intangible assets with finite useful lives are amortized over their estimated useful lives whereas goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are not.
in performing the allocation of the acquisitions' purchase price to assets and liabilities, we consider, among other factors, the intended use of the acquired assets, analysis of past financial performance and estimates of future performance of the acquired business. at the acquisition date, a preliminary allocation of the purchase price is recorded based upon a preliminary valuation performed with the assistance of a third-party valuation specialist. we continue to review and assess our estimates, assumptions and valuation methodologies during the measurement period provided by gaap, which ends as soon as we receive the information about facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date or we learn that more information is not obtainable, which usually does not exceed one year from the date of acquisition. accordingly, these estimates and assumptions are subject to change, which could have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. estimation uncertainty may exist due to the sensitivity of the respective fair value to underlying assumptions about the future performance of an acquired business in our discounted cash flow models. significant assumptions typically include revenue growth rates and expense synergies that form the basis of the forecasted results and the discount rate.
our goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets are evaluated for impairment annually in our fiscal fourth quarter or more frequently if conditions exist that indicate that the value may be impaired. we test our goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level, and we have identified four reporting units. our reporting units identified for our goodwill testing are the nyse, other exchanges, fixed income and data services, and mortgage technology reporting units. these impairment evaluations are performed by comparing the carrying value of the goodwill or other indefinite-lived intangibles to its estimated fair value.
in accordance with asu 2017-04, simplifying the test for goodwill impairment, for both goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible impairment testing, we have the option to first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit or indefinite-lived intangible asset is less than its carrying amount. if the fair value of the goodwill or indefinite-lived intangible asset is less than its carrying value, an impairment loss is recognized in earnings in an amount equal to the difference. alternatively, we may choose to bypass the qualitative option and perform quantitative testing to determine if the fair value is less than the carrying value. for our goodwill impairment testing, we have elected to bypass the qualitative assessment and apply the quantitative approach. for our testing of indefinite-lived intangible assets, we apply qualitative and quantitative approaches.
application of the impairment test requires judgment, including the identification of reporting units, assignment of assets and liabilities to reporting units, assignment of goodwill to reporting units, and determination of the fair value of each reporting unit. we have historically determined the fair value of our reporting units based on various valuation techniques, including discounted cash flow analysis and a multiple of earnings approach. in assessing whether goodwill and other intangible assets are impaired, we must make estimates and assumptions regarding future cash flows, long-term growth rates of our business, operating margins, discount rates, weighted average cost of capital and other factors to determine the fair value of our assets. these estimates and assumptions require management's judgment, and changes to these estimates and assumptions, as a result of changing economic and competitive conditions, could materially affect the determination of fair value and/or impairment. we considered potential indicators of impairment to goodwill and other intangible assets for each of our reporting units, which included continued global inflation concerns and changing interest rates, including their effect on our forecasts and discount rates, among other things. other than an impairment in 2023 of certain trademark intangible assets, we did not record any impairments in 2023, 2022 or 2021 as a result of our goodwill or indefinite-lived impairment testing.
we are also required to evaluate other finite-lived intangible assets for impairment by first determining whether events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of these assets to be held and used may not be recoverable. if impairment indicators are present, then an estimate of undiscounted future cash flows produced by these long-lived assets is compared to the carrying value of those assets to determine if the asset is recoverable. if an asset is not recoverable, the loss is measured as the difference between fair value and carrying value of the impaired asset. fair value of these assets is based on various valuation techniques, including discounted cash flow analysis, which are assessed and conducted in accordance with our internal impairment analysis policies.
income taxes we are subject to income taxes in the u.s., u.k. and other foreign jurisdictions where we operate. the determination of our provision for income taxes and related accruals, deferred tax assets and liabilities requires the use of significant judgment, estimates, and the interpretation and application of complex tax laws. we recognize a current tax liability or tax asset for the estimated taxes payable or refundable on tax returns for the current year. we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax bases of our assets and liabilities. we establish valuation allowances if we believe that it is more likely than not that some or all of our deferred tax assets will not be realized. deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using current enacted tax rates in effect for the years in which those temporary differences and carryforwards are expected to reverse.
the financial accounting standards board, or fasb, staff has provided additional guidance to address the accounting for the effects of the provisions related to the taxation of global intangible low-taxed income noting that companies should make an accounting policy election to recognize deferred taxes for temporary basis differences expected to reverse in future years or to include the tax expense in the year it is incurred. we have made a policy election to recognize such taxes as current period expenses when incurred.
we do not recognize a tax benefit unless we conclude that it is more likely than not that the benefit will be sustained on audit by the taxing authority based solely on the technical merits of the associated tax position. if the recognition threshold is met, we recognize a tax benefit measured at the largest amount of the tax benefit that, in our judgment, is greater than 50 percent likely to be realized. we recognize accrued interest and penalties related to uncertain income tax positions as income tax expense in the consolidated statements of income.
we operate within multiple domestic and foreign taxing jurisdictions and are subject to audit in these jurisdictions by domestic and foreign tax authorities. these audits include questions regarding our tax filing positions, including the timing and amount of deductions taken and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions. we record accruals for the estimated outcomes of these audits, and the accruals may change in the future due to new developments in each matter. at any point in time, many tax years are subject to or in the process of being audited by various taxing authorities. to the extent our estimates of settlements change or the final tax outcome of these matters is different from the amounts recorded, such differences will impact the income tax provision in the period in which such determinations are made. our income tax expense includes changes in our estimated liability for exposures associated with our various tax filing positions. determining the income tax expense for these potential assessments requires management to make assumptions that are subject to factors such as proposed assessments by tax authorities, changes in facts and circumstances, issuance of new regulations, and resolution of tax audits.
item 7 (a).     quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk as a result of our operating and financing activities, we are exposed to market risks such as interest rate risk, foreign currency exchange rate risk and credit risk. we have implemented policies and procedures designed to measure, manage, monitor and report risk exposures, which are regularly reviewed by the appropriate management and supervisory bodies.
interest rate risk we have exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relating to our cash and cash equivalents, short-term and long-term restricted cash and cash equivalents, short-term and long-term investments and indebtedness. as of december 31, 2023 and 2022, our cash and cash equivalents and short-term and long-term restricted cash and cash equivalents and investments were $2.5 billion and $8.4 billion, respectively, of which $270 million and $346 million, respectively, were denominated in pounds sterling, euros or canadian dollars, and the remaining amounts are denominated in u.s. dollars. we do not use our investment portfolio for trading or other speculative purposes. a hypothetical 50% decrease in short-term interest rates would decrease our annual pre-tax earnings by $15 million as of december 31, 2023, assuming no change in the amount or composition of our cash and cash equivalents and short-term and long-term restricted cash and cash equivalents.
as of december 31, 2023, we had $22.6 billion in outstanding debt, consisting of $19.0 billion related to our senior notes, $1.6 billion under our term loan and $2.0 billion in commercial paper. see part ii, item 7, "management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations - debt," and note 10 to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report.
the interest rates on our commercial paper program are currently evaluated based upon current maturities and market conditions. the weighted average interest rate on notes outstanding under our commercial paper program was 5.70% as of december 31, 2023, and we did not have any notes outstanding under our commercial paper program as of december 31, 2022. the effective interest rate of issuances under our commercial paper program will continue to fluctuate based on the movement in short-term interest rates along with shifts in supply and demand within the commercial paper market.
foreign currency exchange rate risk as an international business, we are subject to foreign currency exchange rate risk. we may experience gains or losses from foreign currency transactions in the future given that a significant part of our assets and liabilities are recorded in pounds sterling, canadian dollars or euros, and a significant portion of our revenues and expenses are recorded in pounds sterling or euros. certain assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses of foreign subsidiaries are denominated in the local functional currency of such subsidiaries. our exposure to foreign denominated earnings in 2023 and 2022 is presented by primary foreign currency in the following table (dollars in millions, except exchange rates):

we have a significant part of our assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses recorded in pounds sterling or euros. in 2023 and 2022, 14% and 13%, respectively, of our consolidated revenues, less transaction-based expenses, were denominated in pounds sterling or euros, and in both 2023 and 2022, 9% of our consolidated operating expenses were denominated in pounds sterling or euros. as the pound sterling or euro exchange rate changes, the u.s. equivalent of revenues and expenses denominated in foreign currencies changes accordingly.
foreign currency transaction risk related to the settlement of foreign currency denominated assets, liabilities and payables occurs through our operations, which are received in or paid in pounds sterling, canadian dollars, or euros, due to the increase or decrease in the foreign currency exchange rates between periods. we incurred foreign currency transaction losses of $12 million and $9 million in 2023 and 2022, respectively, inclusive of the impact of foreign currency hedging transactions. the foreign currency transaction losses were primarily attributable to the fluctuations of the pound sterling and euro relative to the u.s. dollar. a 10% adverse change in the underlying foreign currency exchange rates as of december 31, 2023, assuming no change in the composition of the foreign currency denominated assets, liabilities and payables and assuming no hedging activity, would result in a foreign currency loss of $1 million.
we entered into foreign currency hedging transactions during 2023 and 2022 as economic hedges to help mitigate a portion of our foreign exchange risk exposure and may enter into additional hedging transactions in the future to help mitigate our foreign exchange risk exposure. although we may enter into additional hedging transactions in the future, these hedging arrangements may not be effective, particularly in the event of imprecise forecasts of the levels of our non-u.s. denominated assets and liabilities.
we have foreign currency translation risk equal to our net investment in our foreign subsidiaries. the financial statements of these subsidiaries are translated into u.s. dollars using a current rate of exchange, with gains or losses included in the cumulative translation adjustment account, a component of equity. our exposure to the net investment in foreign currencies is presented by primary foreign currencies in the table below (in millions):

foreign currency translation adjustments are included as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income/(loss) within our balance sheet. see the table below for the portion of equity attributable to foreign currency translation adjustments as well as the activity by year included within our statement of other comprehensive income. the impact of the foreign currency exchange rate differences in the table below were primarily driven by fluctuations of the pound sterling as compared to the u.s. dollar which were 1.2732, 1.2093 and 1.3524 as of december 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021, respectively.

the future impact on our business relating to the u.k. leaving the eu and the corresponding regulatory changes are uncertain at this time, including future impacts on currency exchange rates.
credit risk we are exposed to credit risk in our operations in the event of a counterparty default. we limit our exposure to credit risk by rigorously selecting the counterparties with which we make our investments, monitoring them on an ongoing basis and executing agreements to protect our interests.
clearing house cash deposit risks the ice clearing houses hold material amounts of clearing member margin deposits which are held or invested primarily to provide security of capital while minimizing credit, market and liquidity risks. refer to note 14 to our consolidated financial statements for more information on the ice clearing houses' cash and cash equivalent margin deposits and guaranty funds, invested deposits, delivery contracts receivable and unsettled variation margin which were $80.8 billion as of december 31, 2023. while we seek to achieve a reasonable rate of return which may generate interest income for our clearing members, we are primarily concerned with preservation of capital and managing the risks associated with these deposits. as the ice clearing houses may pass on interest revenues (minus costs) to the clearing members, this could include negative or reduced yield due to market conditions. the following is a summary of the risks associated with these deposits and how these risks are mitigated:
•credit risk: when a clearing house has the ability to hold cash collateral at a central bank, the clearing house utilizes its access to the central bank system to minimize credit risk exposures. credit risk is managed by using exposure limits depending on the credit profile of the counterparty as well as the nature and maturity of transactions. our investment objective is to invest in securities that preserve principal while maximizing yields, without significantly increasing risk. we seek to substantially mitigate the credit risk associated with investments by placing them with governments, well-capitalized financial institutions and other creditworthy counterparties.
an ongoing review is performed to evaluate changes in the financial status of counterparties. in addition to the intrinsic creditworthiness of counterparties, our policies require diversification of counterparties (banks, financial institutions, bond issuers and funds) so as to avoid a concentration of risk.
•liquidity risk: liquidity risk is the risk a clearing house may not be able to meet its payment obligations in the right currency, in the right place and at the right time. to mitigate this risk, the clearing houses monitor liquidity requirements closely and maintain funds and assets in a manner which minimizes the risk of loss or delay in the access by the clearing house to such funds and assets. for example, holding funds with a central bank where possible or making only short term investments such as overnight reverse repurchase agreements serves to reduce liquidity risks.
•interest rate risk: interest rate risk is the risk that interest rates rise and cause the value of securities we hold or invest in to decline. if we were required to sell securities prior to maturity, and interest rates had risen, the sale might be made at a loss relative to the carrying value. our clearing houses seek to manage this risk by making short term investments. for example, where possible and in accordance with regulatory requirements, the clearing houses invest cash pursuant to overnight reverse repurchase agreements or term reverse repurchase agreements with short dated maturities. in addition, the clearing house investment guidelines allow for direct purchases of high quality sovereign debt (for example, u.s. treasury securities) and supranational debt instruments (euro cash deposits only) with short dated maturities.
•security issuer risk: security issuer risk is the risk that an issuer of a security defaults on the payment when the security matures or debt is serviced. this risk is mitigated by limiting allowable investments under the reverse repurchase agreements to high quality sovereign or government agency debt and limiting any direct investments to high quality sovereign debt instruments.
•investment counterparty risk: investment counterparty risk is the risk that a reverse repurchase agreement counterparty might become insolvent and, thus, fail to meet its obligations to our clearing houses. we mitigate this risk by only engaging in transactions with high credit quality counterparties and by limiting the acceptable collateral to securities of high quality issuers. when engaging in reverse repurchase agreements, our clearing houses take delivery of the securities underlying the reverse repurchase arrangement in custody accounts under clearing house control. additionally, the securities purchased subject to reverse repurchase have a market value greater than the reverse repurchase amount. thus, in the event that a reverse repurchase counterparty defaults on its obligation to repurchase the underlying reverse repurchase securities, our clearing house will have possession of a security with a value potentially greater than the counterparty's obligation.
the ice clearing houses may use third-party investment advisors who make investments subject to the guidelines provided by each clearing house. clearing house property is held in custody accounts under clearing house control with credit worthy custodians. the ice clearing houses employ (or may employ) multiple investment advisors and custodians to ensure that in the event a single advisor or custodian is unable to fulfill its role, additional advisors or custodians are available as alternatives.
•cross-currency margin deposit risk: each of the ice clearing houses may permit posting of cross-currency collateral to satisfy margin requirements (for example, accepting margin deposits denominated in u.s. dollars to secure a euro margin obligation). the ice clearing houses mitigate the risk of a currency value exposure by applying a "haircut" to the currency posted as margin at a level viewed as sufficient to provide financial protection during periods of currency volatility. cross-currency balances are marked-to-market on a daily basis. should the currency posted to satisfy margin requirements decline in value, the clearing member is required to increase its margin deposit on a same-day basis.
impact of inflation we have not been materially adversely affected by inflation as technological advances and competition have generally caused prices for the hardware and software that we use for our electronic platforms to remain constant. in the event of continued inflation, we believe that we will be able to pass on any price increases to our participants, as the prices that we charge are not governed by long-term contracts.

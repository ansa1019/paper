our success depends on our ability to attract, develop, engage, and retain employees with the skills necessary to our business. competitive labor market conditions have resulted in increased demand for qualified personnel, which makes it difficult to attract, hire, and retain employees with specialized technical experience. in addition, the increasing number of experienced employees becoming retirement-eligible and our company headcount growth further amplify this challenge. the number of our employees has grown both internationally and in the united states, with our total headcount increasing from approximately 16,300 at the end of fiscal 2018 to approximately 23,000 at the end of fiscal 2023. our results of operations have been and in the future could be adversely affected by increased costs due to increased competition for skilled talent in the market. in addition, increased turnover and decreased tenure of employees may impact productivity, costs, and organizational culture. we undertake significant efforts to hire, engage, and retain our employees and to effectively manage workforce costs, even with rapid political, social, and economic shifts in our markets. if these efforts are unsuccessful, our growth may be limited and we may suffer financial or reputational harm that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations.

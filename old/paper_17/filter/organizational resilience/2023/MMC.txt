item 1a.    risk factors.
you should consider the risks described below in conjunction with the other information presented in this report. these risks have the potential to materially adversely affect the company's business, results of operations or financial condition.
summary risk factors some of the factors that could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations or prospects, include the following:
•our results of operations and investments could be adversely affected by geopolitical or macroeconomic conditions;
•we are subject to significant uninsured exposures arising from errors and omissions, breach of fiduciary duty and other claims;
•we cannot guarantee that we are or will be in compliance with all current and potentially applicable u.s. federal and state or foreign laws and regulations, and actions by regulatory authorities or changes in legislation and regulation in the jurisdictions in which we operate could have a material adverse effect on our business;
•our business or reputation could be harmed by our reliance on third-party providers or introducers;
•we may not be able to effectively identify and manage actual and apparent conflicts of interest;
•we could incur significant liability or our reputation could be damaged if our information systems are breached or we otherwise fail to protect client or company data or information systems;
•the costs to comply with, or our failure to comply with, u.s. and foreign laws related to privacy, data security and data protection, such as the eu's general data protection regulation (gdpr) and the california consumer privacy act, as amended by the california privacy rights act, (ccpa), could adversely affect our financial condition, operating results and our reputation;
•our business performance and growth plans could be negatively affected if we are not able to develop and implement improvements in technology or respond effectively to the threat of digital disruption and other technological change such as ai;
•the loss of members of our senior management team or other key colleagues, or if we are unsuccessful in our efforts to attract, retain and develop talent, could have a material adverse effect on our business;
•failure to maintain our corporate culture, particularly in a hybrid work environment, could damage our reputation;
•increasing scrutiny and changing laws and expectations from regulators, investors, clients and our colleagues with respect to our environmental, social and governance (esg) practices and disclosure may impose additional costs on us or expose us to new or additional risks;
•we face significant competitive pressures in each of our businesses, including from disintermediation, as our competitive landscape continues to evolve;
•we rely on a large number of vendors and other third parties to perform key functions of our business operations and to provide services to our clients. these vendors and third parties may act or fail to act in ways that could harm our business;
•our inability to successfully recover should we experience a disaster or other business continuity or data recovery problem could cause material financial loss, loss of human capital, regulatory actions, reputational harm or legal liability;
•we face risks when we acquire or dispose of businesses;
•if we are unable to collect our receivables, our results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected;
•our defined benefit pension plan obligations could cause the company's financial position, earnings and cash flows to fluctuate;
•our significant non-u.s. operations expose us to exchange rate fluctuations and various risks that could impact our business;
•our quarterly revenues and profitability may fluctuate significantly;
•credit rating downgrades would increase our financing costs and could subject us to operational risk;
•our current debt level could adversely affect our financial flexibility;
•the current u.s. tax regime has provisions which have unintended consequences and may also impact our tax rate in varying degrees based on where our global income is earned;
•we are exposed to multiple risks associated with the global nature of our operations;
•results in our risk and insurance services segment may be adversely affected by a general decline in economic activity;
•volatility or declines in premiums and other market trends may significantly impede our ability to grow revenues and profitability;
•adverse legal developments and future regulations concerning how intermediaries are compensated by insurers or clients, as well as allegations of anti-competitive behavior or conflicts of interest, could have a material adverse effect on marsh's business, results of operations and financial condition;
•mercer's wealth business is subject to a number of risks, including risks related to public and private capital market fluctuations, third-party asset managers and custodians, operations and technology risks, conflicts of interest, esg and greenwashing, asset performance and regulatory compliance, that, if realized, could result in significant damage to our business;
•revenues for the services provided by our consulting segment may decline for various reasons, including as a result of changes in economic conditions, the value of equity, debt and other asset classes, our clients' or an industry's financial condition or government regulation or an accelerated trend away from actively managed investments to passively managed investments;
•factors affecting defined benefit pension plans and the services we provide relating to those plans could adversely affect mercer; and
•the profitability of our consulting segment may decline if we are unable to achieve or maintain adequate utilization and pricing rates for our consultants.
risks relating to the company generally macroeconomic risks our results of operations and investments could be adversely affected by geopolitical or macroeconomic conditions.
geopolitical and macroeconomic conditions, including from multiple major wars, escalating conflict throughout the middle east and rising tension in the south china sea, slower gdp growth or recession, lower interest rates, capital markets volatility and inflation affect our clients' businesses and the markets they serve. these conditions, including inflationary expense pressure with our clients, may reduce demand for our services or depress pricing for those services, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.
for example, the war in ukraine and the escalating conflict throughout the middle east have resulted in worldwide geopolitical and macroeconomic uncertainty and may negatively impact other regional and global economic markets (including europe, the middle east and the u.s.), companies in other countries (particularly those that have done business with russia or have substantial exposure to, or operations in, impacted countries) and various sectors, industries and markets for securities and commodities globally, such as oil and natural gas, and may increase financial market volatility and adversely impact regional and global economic markets, industries and companies. moreover, the covid-19 pandemic impacted businesses, including our clients, third-party vendors and business partners, globally in every geography in which we operate. in addition, the potentially divergent laws and regulations as a result of brexit may continue to lead to economic and legal uncertainty, causing increased economic volatility or disrupting the markets and clients we serve.
changes in macroeconomic and geopolitical conditions could also shift demand to services for which we do not have a competitive advantage, and this could negatively affect the amount of business that we are able to obtain.
more generally, our investments, including our minority investments in other companies as well as our cash investments and those held in a fiduciary capacity, are subject to general credit, liquidity, counterparty, foreign exchange, market and interest rate risks. for example, fluctuations in interest rates and foreign exchange rates between the u.s. dollar and foreign currencies may adversely affect our results of operations. lower interest rates may lead to a decline in our fiduciary income.
these risks may be exacerbated by global macroeconomic conditions, market volatility and regulatory, financial and other difficulties affecting the companies in which we have invested or that may be faced by financial institution counterparties. during times of stress in the banking industry, counterparty risk can quickly escalate, potentially resulting in substantial trading and investment losses for corporate and other investors. in addition, we may incur investment losses as a result of unusual and unpredictable market developments, and we may experience lower earnings if the yields on investments begin to decline. if the banking system or the fixed income, interest rate, credit or equity markets deteriorate, the value and liquidity of our investments could be adversely affected. finally, the value of the company's assets held in other jurisdictions, including cash holdings, may decline due to foreign exchange fluctuations.
legal and regulatory risks we are subject to significant uninsured exposures arising from errors and omissions, breach of fiduciary duty and other claims.
our businesses provide numerous professional services, including the placement of insurance and the provision of consulting, investment advisory, investment management and actuarial services, to clients around the world. as a result, the company and its subsidiaries are subject to a significant number of errors and omissions, breach of fiduciary duty, breach of contract and similar claims, which we refer to collectively as "e&o claims." in our risk and insurance services segment, such claims include allegations of damages arising from our failure to assess clients' risks, advise clients, place coverage, or notify insurers of potential claims on behalf of clients in accordance with our obligations to them. for example, these claims could include allegations related to losses from cyberattacks associated with policies where cyber risk was not specifically included or excluded in policies, commonly referred to as "silent cyber." in our consulting segment, where we increasingly act in a fiduciary capacity through our investments business, such claims could include allegations of damages arising from the provision of consulting, investment management (including, for example, from trading or other operational errors), actuarial, pension administration and other services. we may also be exposed to claims related to services or solutions offered by the consulting segment in addition to consulting services. these consulting segment services frequently involve complex calculations and services, including (i) making assumptions about, and preparing estimates concerning, contingent future events, (ii) drafting and interpreting complex documentation governing pension plans, (iii) calculating benefits within complex pension structures, (iv) providing individual financial planning advice including investment advice and advice relating to cashing out of defined benefit pension plans, (v) providing investment advice, including guidance on asset allocation and investment strategy, and (vi) managing client assets, including the selection of investment managers and implementation of the client's investment policy. we provide these services to a broad client base, including clients in the public sector. matters may relate to services provided by the company dating back many years. such claims may subject us to significant liability for monetary damages, including punitive and treble damages, negative publicity and reputational harm, and may divert personnel and management resources. we may be unable to effectively limit our potential liability in certain jurisdictions, including through insurance, or in connection with certain types of claims, particularly those concerning claims of a breach of fiduciary duty.
in establishing liabilities for e&o claims in accordance with u.s. generally accepted accounting principles ("u.s. gaap"), the company uses case level reviews by inside and outside counsel, actuarial analysis by oliver wyman, a subsidiary of the company, and other methods to estimate potential losses. a liability is established when a loss is both probable and reasonably estimable. the liability is assessed quarterly and adjusted as developments warrant. in many cases, the company has not recorded a liability, other than for legal fees to defend a claim, because we are unable, at the present time, to make a determination that a loss is both probable and reasonably estimable. given the judgment involved in estimating and establishing such liabilities, as well as the unpredictability of e&o claims and the litigation that can flow from them, it is possible that an adverse outcome in a particular matter could have a material adverse effect on the company's business, results of operations or financial condition.
we cannot guarantee that we are or will be in compliance with all current and potentially applicable u.s. federal and state or foreign laws and regulations, and actions by regulatory authorities or changes in legislation and regulation in the jurisdictions in which we operate could have a material adverse effect on our business.
our activities are subject to extensive regulation under the laws of the u.s. and its various states, the united kingdom, the european union and its member states, australia and the other jurisdictions in which we operate. we are also subject to trade sanctions laws relating to countries such as afghanistan, belarus, cuba, iran, north korea, russia, syria, ukraine (russia-controlled territories) and venezuela, and anti-corruption laws such as the u.s. foreign corrupt practices act and the u.k. bribery act. we are subject to numerous other laws on matters as diverse as internal control over financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures, securities regulation, data privacy and protection, cybersecurity, taxation, anti-trust and competition, immigration, wage-and-hour standards and employment and labor relations.
the u.s. and foreign laws and regulations that apply to our operations are complex and may change rapidly, and our efforts to comply and keep up with them require significant resources. in some cases, these laws and regulations may decrease the need for our services, increase our costs, negatively impact our revenues or impose operational limitations on our business, including on the products and services we may offer or on the amount or type of compensation we may collect. in addition, the financial and operational impact of complying with laws and regulations has increased in the current environment of increased regulatory activity and enforcement. changes with respect to the applicable laws and regulations may impose additional and unforeseen costs on us or pose new or previously immaterial risks to us. there can be no assurance that current and future government regulations will not adversely affect our business, and we cannot predict new regulatory priorities, the form, content or timing of regulatory actions, and their impact on our business and operations. in addition, geopolitical conflict, such as the war in ukraine and the escalating conflict throughout the middle east, has resulted in, and may continue to result in, new and rapidly evolving trade sanctions, which may increase our costs, negatively impact our revenues or impose additional operational limitations on our businesses.
while we attempt to comply with applicable laws and regulations, there can be no assurance that we, our employees, our consultants and our contractors and other agents are in full compliance with such laws and regulations or interpretations at all times, or that we will be able to comply with any future laws or regulations. if we fail to comply or are accused of failing to comply with applicable laws and regulations, including those referred to above, or new and evolving regulations regarding cybersecurity, ai or environmental, social and governance matters, we may become subject to investigations, criminal penalties, civil remedies or other consequences, including fines, injunctions, loss of an operating license or approval, increased scrutiny or oversight by regulatory authorities, the suspension of individual employees, limitations on engaging in a particular business or redress to clients or other parties, and we may become exposed to negative publicity or reputational damage. moreover, our failure to comply with laws or regulations in one jurisdiction may result in increased regulatory scrutiny by other regulatory agencies in that jurisdiction or regulatory agencies in other jurisdictions. these inquiries consume significant management attention, and the cost of compliance and the consequences of failing to be in compliance could therefore have a material adverse effect on our business.
in most jurisdictions, government regulatory authorities have the power to interpret and amend or repeal applicable laws and regulations, and have discretion to grant, renew and revoke the various licenses and approvals we need to conduct our activities. such authorities may require the company to incur substantial costs in order to comply with such laws and regulations. in some areas of our businesses, we act on the basis of our own or the industry's interpretations of applicable laws or regulations, which may conflict from state to state or country to country. in the event those interpretations eventually prove different from the interpretations of regulatory authorities, we may be penalized or precluded from carrying on our previous activities. moreover, the laws and regulations to which we are subject may conflict among the various jurisdictions and countries in which we operate, which increases the likelihood of our businesses being non-compliant in one or more jurisdictions.
in addition, we may be responsible for the legal and regulatory liabilities of companies that we acquire.
additional information regarding certain ongoing investigations and certain other legal and regulatory proceedings is set forth in note 16, claims, lawsuits and other contingencies, in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included under part ii, item 8 of this report.
our business or reputation could be harmed by our reliance on third-party providers or introducers.
we currently utilize the services of hundreds of third-party providers to meet the needs of our clients around the world.
there is a risk that our third-party providers or introducers engage in business practices that are prohibited by our internal policies or violate applicable laws and regulations, such as the u.s. foreign corrupt practices act and the u.k. anti-bribery act.
we may not be able to effectively identify and manage actual and apparent conflicts of interest.
given the significant volume of our engagements, potential conflicts of interest may arise across our businesses. there is a risk that we may not effectively identify and manage potential conflicts of interest, including but not limited to where our services to a client conflict, or are perceived to conflict, with the interests of another client or our own interests, where we receive revenue or benefits from third-parties with whom we conduct business (including but not limited to insurers, investment managers and vendors) and where our colleagues have personal interests.
cybersecurity, data protection and technology risks we could incur significant liability or our reputation could be damaged if our information systems are breached or we otherwise fail to protect client or company data or information systems.
in operating our business and providing services and solutions to clients, we collect, use, store, transmit and otherwise process certain electronic information, including personal, confidential, proprietary and sensitive data such as financial records, health care, mergers and acquisitions and personal data of our clients, colleagues and vendors. we rely on the efficient, uninterrupted and secure operation of complex information technology systems and networks to operate our business and securely process, transmit and store electronic information. in the normal course of business, we also share electronic information with our vendors and other third parties. this electronic information comprises sensitive and confidential data, including information related to financial records, health care, mergers and acquisitions and clients' personal data. our information technology systems and information security control systems, and those of our numerous third-party providers, as well as the control systems of critical infrastructure they rely on, such as power grids, and undersea cables, are potentially vulnerable to unauthorized access, damage or interruption from a variety of external threats, including software bugs, physical attack, cyberattacks, computer viruses and other malware, malicious or destructive code, ransomware, social engineering attacks (including phising and digital or telephonic impersonation), hacking, denial-of-service attacks and other types of data and systems-related modes of attack. the techniques used to achieve such unauthorized access, damage or interruption change frequently and new techniques may not be identified until they are launched against a target, and we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or implement adequate preventative or remedial measures, resulting in potential data loss, data unavailability, data corruption or other damage to information technology systems. in addition, remote and hybrid work arrangements have increased the risk of phishing and other cybersecurity attacks, unauthorized dissemination of personal, confidential, proprietary or sensitive data, and unauthorized access to company computing assets. further, a disruption of physical infrastructure could impact our ability to conduct business and service clients. this may include deliberate or unintentional disruption of service to electrical systems, satellite communications, undersea or terrestrial cable systems, internet services, or other systems our colleagues or third parties rely on us to conduct business in a multitude of jurisdictions across the globe. disruptions may be the result of weather, natural disaster, war, terrorism, pandemic, or other natural or geopolitical events. our systems are also subject to compromise from internal threats such as fraud, mistake, misconduct or other improper action by employees, vendors and other third parties with otherwise legitimate access to our systems. moreover, we face the ongoing challenge of managing access controls in a complex environment. the latency of a compromise is often measured in months but could be years, and we may not be able to detect a compromise in a timely manner, and even if detected, there can be no assurance that we can mitigate or remediate such compromise in an adequate or timely manner. we could experience significant financial and reputational harm if our information systems are breached, sensitive client or company data are compromised, surreptitiously modified, rendered inaccessible for any period of time or maliciously made public, or if we fail to make adequate or timely disclosures to the public, law enforcement agencies or regulators following any such event, whether due to delayed discovery or a failure to follow existing protocols.
cyberattacks are increasing in frequency and evolving in nature. we are at risk of attack by a variety of adversaries, including nation states, state-sponsored organizations, organized crime and hackers, through use of increasingly sophisticated methods of attack, including the deployment of ai to find and exploit vulnerabilities, "deep fakes", long-term, persistent attacks (referred to as advanced persistent threats) and the use of the it supply chain to introduce malware through software updates or compromised suppliers accounts or hardware. in particular, the advance of ai and large language models has given rise to additional vulnerabilities and potential entry points for cyber threats. with generative ai tools, threat actors may have additional tools to automate breaches or persistent attacks, evade detection, or generate sophisticated phishing emails or other forms of digital impersonation. in addition, increasing use of generative ai models in our internal systems may create new attack methods for adversaries. because generative ai is a new field, understanding of cybersecurity risks and protection methods continues to develop, and features that rely on generative ai, including in services provided to us by third parties, may be susceptible to unanticipated cybersecurity threats from sophisticated adversaries and other cybersecurity incidents. further, we are at increased risk of a cyberattack during periods of heightened geopolitical conflict, such as the war in ukraine and the escalating conflict throughout the middle east, as diplomatic events and economic policies may trigger espionage or retaliatory cyber incidents. despite our efforts to comply with applicable cybersecurity requirements and mitigate risks of cybersecurity threats, we cannot be certain that our security measures will definitively prevent, contain, detect, or remediate all cybersecurity threats or incidents or other instructions from malware currently in existence or developed in the future.
as the breadth and complexity of the technologies we use and the software and platforms we develop continue to grow, including as a result of the use of mobile devices, cloud services, "open source" software, social media tools and the increased reliance on devices connected to the internet (known as the "internet of things"), the potential risk of security breaches and cyber-attacks also increases. despite ongoing efforts to improve our ability to protect data from compromise, we may not be able to protect all of our data across our diverse systems. our efforts to improve and protect data from compromise may also identify previously undiscovered instances of security breaches or other cyber incidents. our policies, employee training (including phishing prevention training), procedures and technical safeguards may also be insufficient to prevent, detect or remediate improper access to confidential, personal or proprietary information. in addition, the competition for talent in the data privacy and cybersecurity space is intense, and we may also be unable to hire, develop or retain suitable talent capable of adequately detecting, mitigating or remediating these risks.
should an attacker gain access to our network using compromised credentials of an authorized user, we are at risk that the attacker might successfully leverage that access to compromise additional systems and data. certain measures that could increase the security of our systems, such as data encryption (including encryption of data at rest), heightened monitoring and logging, scanning for source code errors or deployment of multi-factor authentication, take significant time and resources to deploy broadly, and such measures may not be deployed in a timely manner or be effective against an attack. the inability to implement, maintain and upgrade adequate safeguards could have a material adverse effect on our business.
our information systems must be continually updated, patched, and upgraded to protect against known vulnerabilities. the volume of new software vulnerabilities has increased markedly, as has the criticality of patches and other mitigation and remedial measures. in addition to mitigating and remediating newly identified vulnerabilities, previously identified vulnerabilities must also be continuously addressed. accordingly, we are at risk that cyberattackers exploit these known vulnerabilities before they have been communicated by vendors or addressed. due to the large number and age of the systems and platforms that we operate, the increased frequency at which vendors are issuing security patches to their products, the need to test patches and, in some cases coordinate with clients and vendors, before they can be deployed, we perpetually face the substantial risk that we cannot deploy patches in a timely manner. we are also dependent on third party vendors to keep their systems patched and secure in order to protect our data. any failure related to these activities could have a material adverse effect on our business.
we have numerous vendors and other third parties who receive personal information from us in connection with the services we offer our clients and our employees. we also use hundreds of it vendors and software providers to maintain and secure our global information systems infrastructure. in addition, we have migrated certain data, and may increasingly migrate data, to the cloud where it is hosted by third-party providers. some of these vendors and third parties also have direct access to our systems or data. we are at risk of a cyberattack involving a vendor or other third party, which could result in a breakdown of such third party's data protection processes or the cyberattackers gaining access to our infrastructure or data through a supply chain attack. highly publicized data security breaches, such as the october 2023 attack on okta may embolden malicious actors to target the it supply chain and providers of business software. our control over and ability to monitor the cybersecurity practices of our third-party vendors and service providers, and other third parties with whom we do business, remains limited, and there can be no assurance that we can prevent, mitigate, or remediate the risk of any compromise or failure in the cybersecurity infrastructure owned or controlled by such third parties. additionally, any contractual protections with such third parties, including our right to indemnification, if any, may be limited or insufficient to prevent a negative impact on our business from such compromise or failure.
we have a history of making acquisitions and investments. the process of integrating the information systems of any businesses we acquire is complex and exposes us to additional risk. for instance, we may not adequately identify weaknesses and vulnerabilities in an acquired entity's information systems, either before or after the acquisition, which could affect the value we are able to derive from the acquisition, expose us to unexpected liabilities or make our own systems more vulnerable to a cyberattack. in addition, if we discover a historical compromise, security breach or other cyber incident related to the target's information systems following the close of the acquisition, we may be liable and exposed to significant costs and other unforeseen liabilities. we may also be unable to integrate the systems of the businesses we acquire into our environment in a timely manner, which could further increase these risks until such integration takes place.
we have experienced data incidents and cybersecurity breaches, such as malware incursions (including computer viruses and ransomware), vulnerabilities in the software on which we rely, users exceeding their data access authorization, employee misconduct and incidents resulting from human error, such as emails sent to the wrong recipient, loss of portable and other data storage devices or misconfiguration of software or hardware resulting in inadvertent exposure of personal, sensitive, confidential or proprietary information. in april 2021, an unauthorized actor leveraged a vulnerability in a third party's software and gained access to a limited set of data in our environment. like many companies, we are also subject to social engineering attacks such as whatsapp scams and regular phishing email campaigns directed at our employees that can result in malware infections, fraud and data loss. although these incidents have resulted in data loss and other damages, to date, they have not had a material adverse effect on our business or operations. in the future, these types of incidents could result in personal, sensitive, confidential or proprietary information, including client, employee or company data, being lost or stolen, surreptitiously modified, rendered inaccessible for any period of time, or maliciously made public, which could have a material adverse effect on our business. in the event of a cyberattack, we might have to take our systems offline, which could interfere with services to our clients or damage our reputation. a cyberattack may also result in systems or data being encrypted or otherwise unavailable due to ransomware or other malware. we also may be unable to detect an incident, assess its severity or impact, or appropriately respond in a timely or adequate manner. in addition, our liability insurance, which includes cyber insurance, may not be sufficient in type or amount to cover us against claims related to security breaches, cyberattacks and other related data and system incidents. further, we cannot be sure that our existing coverage will continue to be available on acceptable terms or at all or that our insurers will not deny coverage as to any future claim.
the costs to comply with, or our failure to comply with, u.s. and foreign laws related to privacy, data security and data protection, such as the eu's general data protection regulation (gdpr) and the california consumer privacy act, as amended by the california privacy rights act, (ccpa), could adversely affect our financial condition, operating results and our reputation.
improper collection, use, disclosure, cross border transfer, retention and other processing of confidential, personal, or proprietary data could result in regulatory scrutiny, legal and financial liability, or harm to our reputation. in operating our business and providing services and solutions to clients, we store and transfer sensitive employee and client data, including personal data, in and across multiple jurisdictions. we collect data from client and individuals located all over the world and leverage systems and teams to process it. as a result, we are subject to a variety of laws and regulations in the u.s., europe and around the world regarding privacy, data protection, data security and cyber security. these laws and regulations are continuously evolving and developing. some of these laws and regulations are increasing the level of data handling restrictions, including rules on data localization, all of which could affect our operations and result in regulatory liability and high fines. in particular, high-profile data breaches at major companies continue to be disclosed regularly, which is leading to even greater regulatory scrutiny and fines at the highest levels they have ever been. these fines are not limited to data breaches and regulators are increasingly focusing on other data processing activities including those related to ad-tech and "data subject" rights. the number of laws that apply to us keeps increasing and the interpretation of such laws is often uncertain and may be conflicting.
at the international level, we are subject to an increasing number of comprehensive privacy laws including, for example, those passed in indonesia, the kingdom of saudi arabia and india. many of these laws, which are modeled after the gdpr, have greatly increased the jurisdictional reach of privacy laws and added a broad array of requirements for handling personal data, such as the public disclosure of data breaches, data protection impact assessments, data portability and the appointment of data protection officers in some cases. following the uk's withdrawal from the eu, we are also subject to the uk general data protection regulation ("uk gdpr"), a version of the gdpr as implemented into uk law, and this law may not mirror the gdpr, thereby adding operational complexity and legal risk. given the breadth and depth of changes in data protection obligations, including classifying data and committing to a range of administrative, technical and physical controls to protect data and enable data transfers across borders, our compliance with such laws will continue to require time, resources and review of the technology and systems we use. despite a proliferation of regulatory guidance papers, there remains uncertainty in key areas related to these laws, and that uncertainty could result in potential liability for our failure to meet our obligations, including the possibility of significant fines some of which can amount to 4% or more of our global revenue. further, despite recent developments, including a new u.s.- eu data privacy framework and the u.s.-uk data bridge, there remains a high level of uncertainty concerning the future of the flow of personal information between the u.s. and eu, between the u.s. and the uk and between the uk and the eu, and that uncertainty may impair our ability to offer our existing and planned products and services or increase our cost of doing business. some of the global laws enacted in recent years, including those in china and the kingdom of saudi arabia, also include data localization elements that will require that certain personal data stay within their borders. these requirements are complex and our efforts to comply with them require significant resources, and we cannot guarantee we are or will be in full compliance with such laws at all times.
at the u.s. federal level, we are subject to various privacy laws and regulations, including those promulgated under the authority of the u.s. federal trade commission, which has the authority to regulate and enforce against unfair or deceptive acts or practices in or affecting commerce, including with respect to data privacy and cybersecurity. at the u.s. state level, we are subject to laws and regulations related to privacy, such as the ccpa which introduced concepts such as transparency and rights like access and deletion, that have been enacted by over a dozen states with many more on the verge of enacting such laws. these laws establish a privacy framework for covered businesses, including various obligations imposed on them related to the personal information they collect and use, and offer various rights for their state residents. some of these laws provide a private right of action for violations and in some cases damages may be significant. many of these laws diverge from the ccpa and create their own set of rules and this proliferation of inconsistent state level privacy laws will add operational complexity and increased risk of noncompliance or violations which could trigger enforcement action or litigation.
in addition to data protection and data privacy laws, foreign countries and u.s. states are enacting ai and cybersecurity laws and regulations. for example, in late 2023 the new york state department of financial services (nydfs) issued amendments to its previous cybersecurity regulations which imposed obligations on companies such as marsh mclennan, including for example, requiring companies to provide evidence of how they are implementing their data retention, data governance and data classifications policies and procedures. a number of states have also adopted laws covering data collected by insurance licensees that include security and breach notification requirements. all of these evolving compliance and operational requirements impose significant costs that are likely to increase over time, may divert resources from other initiatives and projects and could restrict the way services involving data are offered, all of which may adversely affect our results of operations.
many statutory requirements, both in the u.s. and abroad, include obligations for companies to notify individuals of security breaches involving certain personal information, which could result from breaches experienced by us or our vendors. for example, laws in all 50 u.s. states generally require businesses to provide notice under certain circumstances to consumers whose personal information has been disclosed as a result of a breach. in addition to government regulation, our agreements with certain third parties may require us to notify them in the event of a security breach. further, privacy advocates and industry groups have and may in the future propose self-regulatory standards. these laws, rules and industry standards may legally or contractually apply to us, or we may elect to comply with them. we expect that there will continue to be new proposed laws and regulations concerning data privacy and security, and we cannot yet determine the impact such future laws, regulations and standards may have on our business. many of these laws and rules also include strict notification requirements for organizations related to confirmed or suspected breaches. this narrow notification window is often too short to fully validate the facts, and there is an increased risk of reporting a false alarm or immaterial breach, which may lead to reputational damage despite there not being an actual data breach.
we post public privacy policies and other documentation regarding our collection, use, disclosure, cross-border transfer, retention, and other processing of personal information. although we endeavor to comply with our published policies and other documentation, we may at times fail to do so or may be perceived to have failed to do so. moreover, despite our efforts, we may not be successful in achieving compliance if our employees, contractors, service providers, vendors or other third parties with whom we do business fail to comply with our published policies and documentation. such failures could carry similar consequences or subject us to potential enforcement actions or investigations if they are found to be deceptive, unfair or misrepresentative of our actual practices.
furthermore, enforcement actions and investigations by regulatory authorities related to data security incidents and privacy violations, including an ongoing focus on compliance related to website "cookies" and other online trackers, as well as the use of online session recording tools in some countries or u.s. states, continue to increase. privacy violations, including unauthorized use disclosure or transfer of sensitive, personal or confidential client or company data, whether through systems failure, employee negligence, fraud or misappropriation, by the company, our vendors or other parties with whom we do business (if they fail to meet the standards we impose) could damage our reputation and subject us to significant litigation, monetary damages, regulatory enforcement actions, fines and criminal prosecution in one or more jurisdictions. given the complexity of operationalizing the various privacy laws mentioned above, the maturity level of proposed compliance frameworks and the continued lack of certainty on how to implement their requirements, we and our clients are at risk of enforcement actions taken by data protection authorities around the world or litigation from consumer advocacy groups acting on behalf of data subjects. we may not be able to respond quickly or effectively to regulatory, legislative and other developments, and these changes may in turn impair our ability to offer our existing or planned products and services and increase our cost of doing business.
our business performance and growth plans could be negatively affected if we are not able to develop and implement improvements in technology or respond effectively to the threat of digital disruption and other technological change such as ai.
we depend in large part on our technology systems for conducting business, as well as for providing the data and analytics we use to manage our business. as a result, our business success is dependent on maintaining the effectiveness of existing technology systems and on continuing to develop and enhance technology systems that support our business processes and strategic initiatives in a cost and resource efficient manner, particularly as our business processes become more digital. we have a number of strategic initiatives involving investments in or partnerships with technology companies as part of our growth strategy, as well as investments in technology, including generative ai, and infrastructure to support our own systems.
these investments may be costly and require significant capital expenditures, may not be profitable or may be less profitable than what we have experienced historically. in addition, investments in technology systems may not deliver the benefits or perform as expected, or may be replaced or become obsolete more quickly than expected, which could result in operational difficulties or additional costs. in some cases, we also depend on key vendors and partners to provide technology and other support for our strategic initiatives. if these vendors or partners fail to perform their obligations or otherwise cease to work with us, our ability to execute on our strategic initiatives could be adversely affected. if we do not keep up with technological changes or execute effectively on our strategic initiatives, our business and results of operations could be adversely impacted.
in addition, to remain competitive in many of our business areas, we must anticipate and respond effectively to the threat of digital disruption and other technological change such as generative ai. the threat comes from traditional players, such as insurers, through disintermediation as well as from new entrants, such as technology companies, "insurtech" start-up companies and others. in the past few years, there has been a substantial increase in private equity investments into these insurtech companies. these players are focused on using technology and innovation, including ai, digital platforms, data analytics, robotics and blockchain, to simplify and improve the client experience, increase efficiencies, alter business models and effect other potentially disruptive changes in the industries in which we operate.
we are actively investing in generative ai tools. while our internal generative ai tool, lenai, was designed to meet our standards for data security and to address and mitigate the risks associated with this new technology, our use of generative ai in certain products and services may present risks and challenges that remain uncertain due to the relative novelty of this technology. these risks may include enhanced governmental or regulatory scrutiny, litigation or ethical concerns. while we are implementing certain mitigation measures and governance to the proliferation of ai tools, these measures may be inadequate or may not meet a growing number of legal and regulatory requirements related to ai.
competitive risks the loss of members of our senior management team or other key colleagues, or if we are unsuccessful in our efforts to attract, retain and develop talent, could have a material adverse effect on our business.
we rely upon the contributions of our senior management team to establish and implement our business strategy and to manage the future growth of our business. we may be unable to retain them, particularly if we do not offer employment terms that are competitive with the rest of the labor market. the loss of any of the senior management team could limit our ability to successfully execute our business strategy or adversely affect our ability to retain existing and attract new clients. moreover, we could be adversely affected if we fail to adequately plan for the succession of members of our senior management team or if our succession plans do not operate effectively.
across all of our businesses, our colleagues are critical to developing and retaining client relationships as well as performing the services on which our revenues are earned. it is therefore important for us to attract, incentivize and retain significant revenue-producing employees and the key managerial and other professionals who support them. we face numerous challenges in this regard, including the intense competition for talent, which has accelerated in recent years. such challenges include the increased mobility of colleagues in light of more flexible working models, market dislocation resulting from proposed and actual combinations in the industry, raids by competitors, and fostering an inclusive and diverse workplace.
losing colleagues who manage or support substantial client relationships or possess substantial experience or expertise could adversely affect our ability to secure and complete client engagements, which could adversely affect our results of operations. if a key employee were to join an existing competitor or form a competing company, some of our clients could choose to use the services of that competitor instead of our services. if a colleague joins us from a competitor and is subject to enforceable restrictive covenants, we may not be able to secure client engagements or maximize the colleague's potential. in addition, regulation or legislation impacting the workforce, such as the proposed u.s. federal trade commission rule regarding noncompete clauses, may lead to increased uncertainty and competition for talent.
failure to maintain our corporate culture, particularly in a hybrid work environment, could damage our reputation.
we strive to foster a culture in which our colleagues act with integrity and feel comfortable speaking up about potential misconduct. we are a people business, and our ability to attract and retain colleagues and clients is dependent upon our commitment to an inclusive and diverse workplace, trustworthiness, ethical business practices and other qualities. our colleagues are the cornerstone of this culture, and acts of misconduct by any colleague, and particularly by senior management, could erode trust and confidence and damage our reputation among existing and potential clients and other stakeholders. remote and hybrid work arrangements, particularly following the covid-19 pandemic, may also negatively impact our ability to maintain and promote our culture, as we believe being together is integral to promoting our culture.
increasing scrutiny and changing laws and expectations from regulators, investors, clients and our colleagues with respect to our environmental, social and governance (esg) practices and disclosure may impose additional costs on us or expose us to new or additional risks.
there is increased focus, including from governmental organizations, regulators (including the sec in the u.s.), investors, colleagues and clients, on esg issues such as environmental stewardship, climate change, greenhouse gas emissions, inclusion and diversity, human rights, racial justice, pay equity, workplace conduct, cybersecurity and data privacy. negative public perception, adverse publicity or negative comments in social media could damage our reputation if we do not, or are not perceived to, adequately address these issues. any harm to our reputation could impact colleague engagement and retention and the willingness of clients and our partners to do business with us.
additionally, there has been increased regulatory focus on esg and sustainability. for example, laws and regulations related to esg issues continue to evolve, including in the u.s., the u.k., the eu and australia, and these regulations may impose additional compliance or disclosure obligations on us. in particular, heightened demand for, and scrutiny of, esg and sustainable-related products, funds, investment strategies and advice has increased the risk that we could be perceived as, or accused of, making inaccurate or misleading statements, commonly referred to as "greenwashing" or that we have otherwise run afoul of regulation. such perceptions or accusations could damage our reputation, result in litigation or regulatory enforcement actions, and adversely affect our business. furthermore, perceptions of our efforts to achieve esg goals or advance esg and sustainable-related products, funds, investment strategies or advice may differ widely among stakeholders and could present risks to our reputation and business, including litigation risk. for example, in the u.s. there has been increased legal scrutiny on inclusion and diversity-related programs and initiatives.
moreover, as esg reporting standards continue to evolve, including with guidance from the international sustainability standards board (issb) and the european sustainability reporting standards (esrs) under the corporate sustainability reporting directive (csrd), we continue to evaluate and update our public disclosures in these areas, including refining our disclosure of metrics and goals in accordance with the guidance and our own esg assessments and priorities. these disclosures, metrics and goals and any failure to accurately report or comply with federal, state or international esg laws and regulations, or to achieve progress on our metrics and goals on a timely basis, or at all, may result in legal and regulatory proceedings against us and negatively impact our reputation.
implementation of our esg initiatives also depends in part on third-party performance or data that is outside the company's control.
in addition, organizations that provide information to investors on corporate governance and related matters have developed ratings processes for evaluating companies on their approach to esg matters, and unfavorable ratings of our company or our industries may lead to negative investor sentiment and the diversion of investment to other companies or industries, exclusion of our stock from esg-oriented indices or investment funds or harm our relationships with regulators and the communities in which we operate.
we face significant competitive pressures in each of our businesses, including from disintermediation, as our competitive landscape continues to evolve.
as a global professional services firm, the company faces competition in each of its businesses, and the competitive landscape continues to change and evolve. our ability to compete successfully depends on a variety of factors, including the quality and expertise of our colleagues, our geographic reach, the sophistication and quality of our services, our pricing relative to competitors, our clients' ability to self-insure or use internal resources instead of consultants, and our ability to respond to changes in client demand and industry conditions. any failure by us to design and execute operating model changes that capture opportunities and efficiencies at the intersections of our businesses and maximize the value we deliver to clients and stakeholders could have an adverse impact on our business. additionally, some of our competitors may have greater financial resources, or may be better positioned to respond to technological and other changes in the industries we serve, and they may be able to compete more effectively. furthermore, the competition for talent continues to accelerate.
across our risk and insurance services segment, we operate in a variety of markets and face different competitive landscapes. in addition to the challenges posed by capital market alternatives to traditional insurance and reinsurance, we compete against a wide range of other insurance and reinsurance brokerage and risk advisory firms that operate on a global, regional, national or local scale for both client business and employee talent. in recent years, private equity sponsors have invested tens of billions of dollars into the insurance brokerage sector, transforming existing players and creating new ones to compete with large brokers. we also compete with insurance companies that market and service their insurance products directly to consumers and reinsurance companies that market and service their products directly to insurance companies, in each case without the assistance of brokers or other market intermediaries, and with various other companies that provide risk-related services or alternatives to traditional brokerage services, including those that rely almost exclusively on technological solutions or platforms. this competition is intensified by an often "syndicated" or "distributed" approach to the purchase of insurance and reinsurance brokerage services, where a client engages multiple brokers to service different portions of the client's account. in addition, third party capital providers have entered the insurance and reinsurance risk transfer market offering products and capital directly to our clients that serve as substitutes for traditional insurance.
in our consulting segment, we compete for business with numerous consulting firms and similar organizations, many of which also provide, or are affiliated with firms that provide, accounting, information systems, technology and financial services. such competitors may be able to offer more comprehensive products and services to potential clients, which may give them a competitive advantage. some of our competitors also may be able to invest more significant capital in technology and digital solutions. in certain sub-segments, we compete in highly fragmented markets or with start-ups that may be able to offer solutions at a lower price or on more favorable conditions.
in addition, companies in the industries that we serve may seek to achieve economies of scale and other synergies by combining with or acquiring other companies. if two or more of our current clients merge, or consolidate or combine their operations, it may decrease the amount of work that we perform for these clients.
we rely on a large number of vendors and other third parties to perform key functions of our business operations and to provide services to our clients. these vendors and third parties may act or fail to act in ways that could harm our business.
we rely on a large number of vendors and other third parties, and in some cases subcontractors, to provide services, data and information such as technology, information security, funds transfers, business process management, and administration and support functions that are critical to the operations of our business. these third parties include correspondents, agents and other brokers and intermediaries, insurance markets, data providers, plan trustees, payroll service providers, software and system vendors, health plan providers, investment managers, custodians, risk modeling providers, and providers of human resource functions, such as recruiters. many of these providers are located outside the u.s., which exposes us to business disruptions and political risks inherent when conducting business outside of the u.s. as we do not control many of the actions of these third parties, we are subject to the risk that their decisions or operations may adversely impact us and replacing these service providers could create significant delay in services or operations and additional expense.
a failure by the third parties to (i) comply with service level agreements in a high quality and timely manner, particularly during periods of our peak demand for their services, (ii) maintain adequate internal controls that may impact our own financial reporting, or (iii) adequately maintain the confidentiality of any of our data or trade secrets or adequately protect or properly use other intellectual property to which they may have access, could result in economic and reputational harm to us. these third parties also face their own technology, operating, business and economic risks, and any significant failures by them, including the improper use or disclosure of our confidential client, employee, or company information or failure to comply with applicable law, could cause harm to our reputation or otherwise expose us to liability. an interruption in or the cessation of service by any service provider as a result of systems failures, capacity constraints, non-compliance with legal, regulatory or contractual obligations, financial difficulties or for any other reason could disrupt our operations, impact our ability to offer certain products and services, and result in contractual or regulatory penalties, liability claims from clients or employees, damage to our reputation and harm to our business.
business resiliency risks our inability to successfully recover should we experience a disaster or other business continuity or data recovery problem could cause material financial loss, loss of human capital, regulatory actions, reputational harm or legal liability.
if we experience a local or regional disaster or other business continuity event, such as an earthquake, hurricane, flood, terrorist attack, pandemic, war or other geopolitical tensions, protests or riots, security breach, cyberattack (including manipulating the control systems of critical infrastructure), power loss or telecommunications failure, our ability to operate will depend, in part, on the continued availability of our personnel, our office facilities and the proper functioning of our computer, telecommunication and other related systems and operations. in such an event, we could experience operational challenges that could have a material adverse effect on our business. the risk of business disruption is more pronounced in certain geographic areas, including major metropolitan centers, like new york or london, where we have significant operations and approximately 3,700 and 5,700 colleagues in those respective locations, and in certain countries and regions in which we operate that are subject to higher potential threat of terrorist attacks or military conflicts.
our operations depend in particular upon our ability to protect our technology infrastructure against damage. if a business continuity event occurs, we could lose client or company data or experience interruptions to our operations or delivery of services to our clients, which could have a material adverse effect. such risks have increased significantly due to hybrid and remote work environments. a cyberattack or other business continuity event affecting us or a key vendor or other third party could result in a significant and extended disruption in the functioning of our information technology systems or operations or our ability to recover data, requiring us to incur significant expense to address and remediate or otherwise resolve such issues. for example, hackers have increasingly targeted companies by attacking internet-connected industrial control and safety control systems. an extended outage could result in the loss of clients and a decline in our revenues. in the worst case, any manipulation of the control systems of critical infrastructure may even result in the loss of life.
we regularly assess and take steps to improve our existing business continuity, disaster recovery and data recovery plans and key management succession. however, a disaster or other continuity event on a significant scale or affecting certain of our key operating areas within or across regions, or our inability to successfully recover from such an event, could materially interrupt our business operations and result in material financial loss, loss of human capital, regulatory actions, reputational harm, damaged client relationships and legal liability. our business disruption insurance may also not fully cover, in type or amount, the cost of a successful recovery in the event of such a disruption.
acquisitions and dispositions risks we face risks when we acquire or dispose of businesses.
we have a history of making acquisitions and investments, including a total of 80 in the period from 2019 to 2023. we may not be able to successfully integrate the businesses that we acquire into our own business, or achieve any expected cost savings or synergies from the integration of such businesses. subject to standard contractual protections, we may also be responsible for legacy liabilities of companies that we acquire.
in addition, if in the future the performance of our reporting units or an acquired business varies from our projections or assumptions, or estimates about future profitability of our reporting units or an acquired business change, the estimated fair value of our reporting units or an acquired business could change materially and could result in an impairment of goodwill and other acquisition-related intangible assets recorded on our balance sheet or in adjustments in contingent payment amounts. given the significant size of the company's goodwill and intangible assets, an impairment could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in any given period.
we expect that acquisitions will continue to be a key part of our business strategy. our success in this regard will depend on our ability to identify and compete for appropriate acquisition candidates and to finance and complete the transactions we decide to pursue on favorable terms with positive results.
when we dispose of businesses, we may continue to be subject to certain liabilities of that business after its disposition relating to the prior period of our ownership and may not be able to negotiate for limitations on those liabilities. we are also subject to the risk that the sales price is less than the amount reflected on our balance sheet.
financial risks if we are unable to collect our receivables, our results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected.
our business depends on our ability to obtain payment from our clients of the amounts they owe us for the work we perform. as of december 31, 2023, our receivables for our commissions and fees were approximately $5.8 billion, or approximately one-quarter of our total annual revenues, and portions of our receivables are increasingly concentrated in certain businesses and geographies.
macroeconomic or geopolitical conditions, such as a slower economic growth or recession, the war in ukraine and the escalating conflict throughout the middle east, inflationary pressures or supply chain challenges, could result in financial difficulties for our clients, which could cause clients to delay payments to us, request modifications to their payment arrangements that could increase our receivables balance or default on their payment obligations to us.
the maintenance and growth of our business, including our ability to finance acquisitions, the payment of dividends and our ability to make share repurchases rely on our access to capital, which depends in large part on cash flow generated by our business and the availability of equity and debt financing. certain of our businesses also rely on financings by the company to fund the underwriting of their client's debt and equity capital raising transactions. there can be no assurance that our operations will generate sufficient positive cash flow to finance all of our capital needs or that we will be able to obtain equity or debt financing on favorable terms, particularly in an environment of rising interest rates. in addition, our ability to obtain financing will depend in part upon prevailing conditions in credit and capital markets, which are beyond our control.
our defined benefit pension plan obligations could cause the company's financial position, earnings and cash flows to fluctuate.
our defined benefit pension obligations and the assets set aside to fund those obligations are sensitive to certain changes in the financial markets. any such changes may result in increased pension expense or additional cash payments to fund these plans.
the company has significant defined benefit pension obligations to its current and former employees, totaling approximately $12.2 billion, and related plan assets of approximately $13.5 billion, at december 31, 2023 on a u.s. gaap basis. the company's policy for funding its defined benefit pension plans is to contribute amounts at least sufficient to meet the funding requirements set forth by law. in the u.s., contributions to these plans are based on erisa guidelines. outside the united states, contributions are generally based on statutory requirements and local funding practices, which may differ from measurements in accordance with u.s. gaap. in the u.k., for example, the assumptions used to determine pension contributions are the result of legally-prescribed negotiations between the company and the plan trustees. currently, the use of these assumptions results in a lower funded status than determined in accordance with u.s. gaap and may result in contributions irrespective of the u.s. gaap funded status.
the financial calculations relating to our defined benefit pension plans are complex. pension plan assets could decrease as the result of poor future asset performance. in addition, the estimated return on plan assets would likely be impacted by changes in the interest rate environment and other factors, including equity valuations, since these factors reflect the starting point used in the company's projection models. for example, a reduction in interest rates may result in a reduction in the estimated return on plan assets. also, pension plan liabilities, periodic pension expense and future funding amounts could increase as a result of a decline in the interest rates we use to discount our pension liabilities, longer lifespans than those reflected in our mortality assumptions, changes in investment markets that result in lower expected returns on assets, actual investment return that is less than the expected return on assets, adverse changes in laws or regulations and other variables. finally, changes in the aggregated, smoothed asset returns as future years replace prior years, has an impact on both the level and the volatility of pension expense.
while we have taken steps to mitigate the impact of pension volatility on our earnings and cash funding requirements, these strategies may not be successful. accordingly, given the magnitude of our worldwide pension plans, variations in or reassessment of the preceding or other factors or potential miscalculations relating to our defined benefit pension plans could cause significant fluctuation from year to year in our earnings and cash flow, as well as our pension plan assets and liabilities, and may result in increased levels of contributions to our pension plans.
our significant non-u.s. operations expose us to exchange rate fluctuations and various risks that could impact our business.
approximately 53% of our total revenue reported in 2023 was from business outside of the u.s. we are subject to exchange rate movement because we must translate the financial results of our foreign subsidiaries into u.s. dollars and also because some of our subsidiaries receive revenue other than in their functional currencies. exchange rate movements may change over time, and they could have a material adverse impact on our financial results and cash flows reported in u.s. dollars. for additional discussion, see "market risk and credit risk-foreign currency risk" in part ii, item 7a ("quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk") of this report.
our quarterly revenues and profitability may fluctuate significantly.
quarterly variations in revenues and operating results may occur due to several factors. these include:
•the number of client engagements during a quarter;
•the possibility that clients may decide to delay or terminate a current or anticipated project as a result of factors unrelated to our work product or progress;
•fluctuations in capacity and utilization rates and clients' ability to terminate engagements without penalty;
•our net colleague hires and related compensation and benefits expense;
•potential limitations on the clients or industries we serve resulting from increased regulation or changing stakeholder expectations on esg issues;
•the impact of changes in accounting standards or in our accounting estimates or assumptions;
•the impact on us or our clients of changes in legislation, regulation and legal guidance or interpretations in the jurisdictions in which we operate, in particular as a result of increased regulatory activity and enforcement;
•seasonality due to the impact of regulatory deadlines, policy renewals and other timing factors to which our clients are subject;
•the success of our acquisitions or investments;
•macroeconomic factors such as changes in foreign exchange rates, interest rates and global public and private capital markets, particularly in the case of mercer, where fees in its investments business and certain other business lines are derived from the value of assets under management, advisement or administration; and
•general economic conditions, including factors beyond our control affecting economic conditions such as global health crises or pandemics, severe weather, climate change, geopolitical unrest such as the war in ukraine and the escalating conflict throughout the middle east, protests and riots or other catastrophic events, since our results of operations are directly affected by the levels of business activity of our clients, which in turn are affected by the level of economic activity in the industries and markets that they serve.
a significant portion of our total operating expenses is relatively fixed in the short term. therefore, a variation in the number of client assignments or in the timing of the initiation or the completion of client assignments can cause significant variations in quarterly operating results for these businesses.
credit rating downgrades would increase our financing costs and could subject us to operational risk.
if we need to raise capital in the future (for example, in order to maintain adequate liquidity, fund maturing debt obligations or finance acquisitions or other initiatives), credit rating downgrades would increase our financing costs, and could limit our access to financing sources. a downgrade to a rating below investment-grade could result in greater operational risks through increased operating costs and increased competitive pressures.
our current debt level could adversely affect our financial flexibility.
as of december 31, 2023, we had total consolidated debt outstanding of approximately $13.5 billion.
the level of debt outstanding could adversely affect our financial flexibility by reducing our cash flows and our ability to use cash from operations for other purposes, including working capital, dividends to shareholders, share repurchases, acquisitions, capital expenditures and general corporate purposes. in addition, we are subject to risks that, at the time any of our outstanding debt matures, we will not be able to retire or refinance the debt on terms that are acceptable to us.
the current u.s. tax regime has provisions which have unintended consequences and may also impact our tax rate in varying degrees based on where our global income is earned.
our effective tax rate may fluctuate in the future as a result of the current u.s. tax regime and the continuing issuance of interpretive guidance related to the operations of u.s.-based multinational corporations. these include significant provisions in u.s. income tax law that may have a meaningful impact on our income tax expense and require significant judgments and estimates in interpretation and calculations. current tax legislation includes, among other provisions, limitations on the deductibility of net interest expense, a minimum tax on most non-u.s. income called global intangible low-taxed income ("gilti"), and the base erosion and anti-abuse tax ("beat"). in addition, a recently enacted book minimum tax could increase the impact of these provisions on our income tax expense. given the significant complexity of the rules, and the potential for additional guidance from the u.s. treasury, the securities and exchange commission, the financial accounting standards board or other regulatory authorities, recognized impacts in future periods could be significantly different from our current estimates. such uncertainty may also result in increased scrutiny from, or disagreements with, tax authorities. as a u.s.-domiciled company, any such increases would likely have a disproportionate impact on us compared to our foreign-based competitors.
global operations we are exposed to multiple risks associated with the global nature of our operations.
we conduct business globally. in 2023, approximately 53% of the company's total revenue was generated from operations outside the u.s., and over one-half of our employees were located outside the u.s. in addition, we conduct our operations through four separate businesses. potential conflicts of interest may arise across our businesses given the significant volume of our engagements.
the geographic breadth of our activities also subjects us to significant legal, economic, operational, market, compliance and reputational risks. these include, among others, risks relating to:
•economic and political conditions in the countries in which we operate;
•client concentration in certain high-growth countries in which we operate;
•the length of payment cycles and potential difficulties in collecting accounts receivable;
•unexpected increases in taxes or changes in u.s. or foreign tax laws, rulings, policies or related legal and regulatory interpretations, including recent changes to the u.k. statutory rate;
•the implementation of the organization for economic cooperation and development (oecd) international tax framework, including the implementation of the pillar 2 minimum tax regime by key jurisdictions in 2024 and the pillar 1 profit reallocation regime, which could have an adverse effect on our effective tax rate, tax payments and results of operations;
•international initiatives to require multinational enterprises, like ours, to calculate and report profitability on a country-by-country basis, which could increase scrutiny by, or cause disagreements with, foreign tax authorities;
•potential transfer pricing-related tax exposures that may result from the flow of funds among our subsidiaries and affiliates in the various jurisdictions in which we operate;
•unexpected reassessment by tax authorities of interpretations of existing rules which may require companies to defend previously accepted positions and may create both new and prior-year exposures;
•litigation arising from ongoing and future controversies with tax authorities;
•our ability to obtain dividends or repatriate funds from our non-u.s. subsidiaries, including as a result of the imposition of currency controls and other government restrictions on repatriation in the jurisdictions in which our subsidiaries operate, fluctuations in foreign exchange rates and the imposition of withholding and other taxes on such payments;
•geopolitical tensions, such as the war in ukraine and the escalating conflict throughout the middle east, in countries where we operate, international hostilities, international trade disputes, terrorist activities, natural disasters, pandemics, and infrastructure disruptions;
•local investment or other financial restrictions that foreign governments may impose;
•potential lawsuits, investigations, market studies, reviews or other activity by foreign regulatory or law enforcement authorities or legislatively appointed commissions, which may result in potential modifications to our businesses, related private litigation or increased scrutiny from u.s. or other regulators;
•potential costs and difficulties in complying with a wide variety of foreign laws and regulations (including tax systems) administered by foreign government agencies, some of which may conflict with u.s. or other sources of law;
•potential costs and difficulties in complying, or monitoring compliance, with foreign and u.s. laws and regulations that are applicable to our operations abroad, including trade sanctions laws relating to countries such as afghanistan, belarus, cuba, iran, north korea, russia, syria, ukraine (russia-controlled territories) and venezuela, anti-corruption laws such as the u.s. foreign corrupt practices act and the u.k. bribery act 2010;
•limitations or restrictions that foreign or u.s. governments and regulators may impose on the products or services we sell, the methods by which we sell our products and services and the manner in which and the amounts we are compensated;
•limitations that foreign governments may impose on the conversion of currency or the payment of dividends or other remittances to us from our non-u.s. subsidiaries;
•engaging and relying on third parties to perform services on behalf of the company; and
risks relating to our risk and insurance services segment our risk and insurance services segment, conducted through marsh and guy carpenter, represented 62% of the company's total revenue in 2023. our business in this segment is subject to particular risks.
results in our risk and insurance services segment may be adversely affected by a general decline in economic activity.
demand for many types of insurance and reinsurance generally rises or falls as economic growth expands or slows. this dynamic affects the level of commissions and fees generated by marsh and guy carpenter. to the extent our clients become adversely affected by declining business conditions, they may choose to limit their purchases of risk services and insurance and reinsurance coverage, as applicable, which would adversely impact our commission revenue and other revenue based on premiums placed and services provided by us. also, the insurance they seek to obtain through us may be impacted by changes in their assets, property values, sales or number of employees, which may reduce our commission revenue, and they may decide not to purchase our risk advisory or other services, which would inhibit our ability to generate fee revenue. moreover, insolvencies and combinations associated with an economic downturn, especially insolvencies and combinations in the insurance industry, could adversely affect our brokerage business through the loss of clients or by limiting our ability to place insurance and reinsurance business, as well as our revenues from insurers. guy carpenter is especially susceptible to this risk given the limited number of insurance company clients and reinsurers in the marketplace.
volatility or declines in premiums and other market trends may significantly impede our ability to grow revenues and profitability.
a significant portion of our risk and insurance services revenue consists of commissions paid to us out of the premiums that insurers and reinsurers charge our clients for coverage. we do not determine the insurance premiums on which our commissions are generally based. our revenues and profitability are subject to change to the extent that premium rates fluctuate or trend in a particular direction. the potential for changes in premium rates is significant, due to the normal cycles of pricing in the commercial insurance and reinsurance markets.
as traditional insurance companies continue to rely on non-affiliated brokers or agents to generate premium, those insurance companies may seek to reduce their expenses by lowering their commission rates. the reduction of these commission rates, along with general volatility or declines in premiums, may significantly affect our revenue and profitability. because we do not determine the timing or extent of premium pricing changes, it is difficult to accurately forecast our commission revenues, including whether they will significantly decline. as a result, we may have to adjust our plans for future acquisitions, capital expenditures, dividend payments, loan repayments and other expenditures to account for unexpected changes in revenues, and any decreases in premium rates may adversely affect the results of our operations.
in addition to movements in premium rates, our (and mercer's health business's) ability to generate premium-based commission revenue may be challenged by disintermediation and the growing availability of alternative methods for clients to meet their risk-protection needs. this trend includes a greater willingness on the part of corporations to self-insure, the expanded use of captive insurers, and the presence of capital markets-based solutions for traditional insurance and reinsurance needs. further, the profitability of our risk and insurance services segment depends in part on our ability to be compensated for the analytical services and other advice that we provide, including the consulting and analytics services that we provide to insurers. if we are unable to achieve and maintain adequate billing rates for all of our services, our margins and profitability could decline.
adverse legal developments and future regulations concerning how intermediaries are compensated by insurers or clients, as well as allegations of anti-competitive behavior or conflicts of interest, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.
the ways in which insurance intermediaries are compensated receive scrutiny from regulators in part because of the potential for anti-competitive behavior and conflicts of interest. the vast majority of the compensation that marsh receives is in the form of retail fees and commissions that are paid by the client or paid from premium that is paid by the client. the amount of other compensation that we receive from insurance companies, separate from retail fees and commissions, has increased in the last several years, both on an underlying basis and through acquisition and represented approximately 6% of marsh's revenue in 2023. this other compensation includes payment for (i) consulting and analytics services provided to insurers; (ii) administrative and other services provided to insurers (including underwriting services and services relating to the administration and management of quota shares, panels and other facilities); and (iii) contingent commissions, primarily at mma and outside the u.s., paid by insurers based on factors such as volume or profitability. these other revenue streams present potential regulatory, litigation and reputational risks that may arise from alleged anti-competitive behavior or conflicts of interest, (including those arising from guy carpenter's role as intermediary and advisor for insurance companies), and future changes in the regulatory environment may impact our ability to collect such revenue. adverse regulatory, legal or other developments could have a material adverse effect on our business and expose the company to negative publicity and reputational harm.
risks relating to our consulting segment our consulting segment, conducted through mercer and oliver wyman group, represented 38% of our total revenue in 2023. our businesses in this segment are subject to particular risks.
mercer's wealth business is subject to a number of risks, including risks related to public and private capital market fluctuations, third-party asset managers and custodians, operations and technology risks, conflicts of interest, esg and greenwashing, asset performance and regulatory compliance, that, if realized, could result in significant damage to our business.
mercer's investments business provides clients with digital tools, investment consulting and investment management services. mercer's investments business is subject to a number of risks, including risks related to litigation (both by clients and by plan participants, particularly as we increasingly act in a fiduciary capacity), liquidity and market volatility, an inability to obtain contractual limitations of liability for errors & omissions in certain jurisdictions or parts of our business, third-parties, our operations and technology (including the use of ai), trading errors, conflicts of interest, asset performance and regulatory compliance and scrutiny, which could arise in connection with these offerings. for example, mercer's manager research or due diligence on an asset manager may fail to uncover material deficiencies or fraud that could result in investment losses to a client. there is a risk that mercer will fail to properly or timely implement a client's investment policy or direction, which could cause an incorrect or untimely allocation of client assets among asset classes, asset managers, or strategies. mercer may also be perceived as making inaccurate or misleading statements regarding the investment strategies of our offerings or investments with respect to esg or sustainability, commonly referred to as "greenwashing," or recommending certain asset managers to clients or offering delegated solutions to an investment consulting client, solely to enhance its own compensation or due to other perceived conflicts of interest. asset classes may perform poorly, or asset managers may underperform their benchmarks, due to poor market performance, a downturn in the global markets, negligence or other reasons, resulting in poor returns or loss of client assets. changes in the value of equity, debt, currency, real estate, commodities, alternatives or other asset classes, in particular as a result of a downturn in the global markets, could cause the value of assets under management or advisement, and the fees earned by mercer to decline. mercer or its clients may be subject to claims or class action litigation relating to advice given or investment decisions made by plan sponsors and plan fiduciaries, particularly relating to 401(k) plans in the u.s. or pension schemes in the u.k. these risks, if realized, could result in significant liability and damage our business.
revenues for the services provided by our consulting segment may decline for various reasons, including as a result of changes in economic conditions, the value of equity, debt and other asset classes, our clients' or an industry's financial condition or government regulation or an accelerated trend away from actively managed investments to passively managed investments.
global economic conditions, including slower gdp growth or recession, inflationary pressure and foreign exchange rate volatility, may negatively impact businesses and financial institutions. many of our clients, including financial institutions, corporations, government entities and pension plans, have reduced expenses, including amounts spent on consulting services, and used internal resources instead of consultants during difficult economic periods. the evolving needs and financial circumstances of our clients may reduce demand for our consulting services and could adversely affect our revenues and profitability. if the economy or markets in which we operate experience weakness or deteriorate, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. if our clients reduce their headcounts, they will have fewer employee lives covered under their health plans, which may reduce premiums and the commission or supplemental compensation mercer may receive.
in addition, some of mercer's investments business generate fees based upon the value of the clients' assets under management, advisement or administration. changes in the value of equity, debt, currency, real estate, commodities, alternatives or other asset classes could cause the value of assets under management, advisement or administration, and the fees received by mercer, to decline. such changes could also cause clients to withdraw funds from mercer's investments business in favor of other investment service providers. in either case, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected. mercer's investments business also could be adversely affected by an accelerated shift away from actively managed investments to passively managed investments with associated lower fees. further, revenue received by mercer as investment manager to the majority of the mercer-managed investment funds is reported in accordance with u.s. gaap on a gross basis rather than a net basis, with sub-advisor fees reflected as an expense. therefore, the reported revenue for these offerings does not fully reflect the amount of net revenue ultimately attributable to mercer.
demand for many of mercer's benefits services is affected by government regulation and tax laws, rulings, policies and interpretations, which drive our clients' needs for benefits-related services. significant changes in government regulations affecting the value, use or delivery of benefits and human resources programs, including changes in regulations relating to health and welfare plans, defined contribution plans or defined benefit plans, may adversely affect the demand for or profitability of mercer's services.
factors affecting defined benefit pension plans and the services we provide relating to those plans could adversely affect mercer.
mercer currently provides plan sponsors, plan trustees, multi-employer and public entity clients with actuarial, consulting and administration services relating to defined benefit pension plans. the nature of our work is complex. many clients, particularly in the public sector, have sizeable pension deficits and are subject to impact from volatility in the global markets and interest rate fluctuations. a number of mercer's clients have frozen or curtailed their defined benefit plans and have moved to defined contribution plans resulting in reduced revenue for mercer's retirement business. these developments, fee compression pressures, and a continued or accelerated rate of decline in revenues for our defined benefit pension plans business could adversely affect mercer's business and operating results. in addition, our actuarial services involve numerous assumptions and estimates regarding future and contingent events, including interest rates used to discount future liabilities, estimated rates of return for a plan's assets, healthcare cost trends, salary projections and participants' life expectancies. mercer's consulting services involve the drafting and interpretation of trust deeds and other complex documentation governing pension plans. mercer's administration services include calculating benefits within complicated pension plan structures. mercer's investments services include investment advice and management relating to defined benefit pension plan assets intended to fund present and future benefit obligations. clients dissatisfied with our services have brought, and may bring, significant claims against us, particularly in the u.s. and the united kingdom.
additionally, a rapid rise in interest rates could result in higher defined benefit pension plan funding levels. in some markets, this could accelerate clients' desire to conduct a buyout or third-party risk transfer. such a transaction could result in additional short-term revenue for mercer to the extent we advise the client on the transaction, but a loss in longer term recurring revenue related to the plan.
the profitability of our consulting segment may decline if we are unable to achieve or maintain adequate utilization and pricing rates for our consultants.
the profitability of our consulting businesses depends in part on ensuring that our consultants maintain adequate utilization rates (i.e., the percentage of our consultants' working hours devoted to billable activities). our utilization rates are affected by a number of factors, including:
•general economic conditions;
•our ability to continually secure new business engagements, particularly because a portion of our work is project-based rather than recurring in nature;
•our ability to forecast demand for our services and thereby maintain appropriate headcount in each of our geographies and workforces;
•our ability to retain key colleagues and consulting professionals;
•unanticipated changes in the scope of client engagements;
•the potential for conflicts of interest that might require us to decline client engagements that we otherwise would have accepted;
•our need to devote time and resources to sales, training, professional development and other non-billable activities; and
•the potential disruptive impact of acquisitions and dispositions.
if the utilization rate for our consulting professionals declines, our revenues, profit margin and profitability could decline.
in addition, the profitability of our consulting businesses depends in part on the prices we are able to charge for our services. the prices we charge are affected by a number of factors, including:
•general economic conditions;
•clients' perception of our ability to add value through our services;
•market demand for the services we provide;
•our ability to develop new services and the introduction of new services by competitors;
•the pricing policies of our competitors; and
•the extent to which our clients develop in-house or other capabilities to perform the services that they might otherwise purchase from us.
if we are unable to achieve and maintain adequate billing rates for our services, our profit margin and profitability could decline.

the results of operations in the management discussion & analysis ("md&a") include an overview of the company's consolidated 2023 results compared to the 2022 results, and should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes. this section also includes a discussion of the key drivers impacting the company's financial results of operations both on a consolidated basis and by reportable segments.
we describe the primary sources of revenue and categories of expense for each segment in the discussion of segment financial results. a reconciliation of segment operating income to total operating income is included in note 17, segment information, in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii, item 8, of this report.
for information and comparability of the company's results of operations and liquidity and capital resources for fiscal year 2021, refer to "item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations" of the company's form 10-k for the fiscal year ended december 31, 2022.
this md&a contains forward-looking statements as defined in the private securities litigation reform act of 1995. refer to "information concerning forward-looking statements" at the outset of this report.
non-gaap measures the company reports its financial results in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states (u.s.), referred to as in accordance with "gaap" or "reported" results. the company also refers to and presents a non-gaap financial measure in non-gaap revenue, within the meaning of regulation g and item 10(e) of regulation s-k in accordance with the securities exchange act of 1934. the company has included a reconciliation of this non-gaap financial measure to the most directly comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with gaap as part of the consolidated revenue and expense discussion. percentage changes, referred to as non-gaap underlying revenue, are calculated by dividing the period over period change in non-gaap revenue by the prior period non-gaap revenue.
the company believes this non-gaap financial measure provides useful supplemental information that enables investors to better compare the company's performance across periods. management also uses this measure internally to assess the operating performance of its businesses and to decide how to allocate resources. however, investors should not consider this non-gaap measure in isolation from, or as a substitute for, the financial information that the company reports in accordance with gaap. the company's non-gaap measure includes adjustments that reflect how management views its businesses and may differ from similarly titled non-gaap measures presented by other companies.

average number of shares outstanding:
consolidated operating income increased $1.0 billion, or 23% to $5.3 billion in 2023, compared to $4.3 billion in the prior year, reflecting a 10% increase in revenue and a 6% increase in expenses. revenue growth was driven by increases in the risk and insurance services and consulting segments of 11% and 7%, respectively.
the increase in revenue in 2023 reflects the continued demand for our advice and solutions, growth in new business and renewals, and investments in talent and capabilities. results also benefited from growth in the global economy, inflation, higher insurance and reinsurance pricing, and an increase in fiduciary income due to higher interest rates.
expenses increased in 2023 primarily due to compensation and benefits, driven by increased headcount, and higher base salary and incentive compensation. other operating expenses decreased due to lower restructuring and facility costs, partially offset by higher travel and entertainment costs compared to 2022. expenses in 2023 also include $51 million of insurance and indemnity recoveries for a legacy jardine lloyd thompson group plc ("jlt") errors and omissions ("e&o") matter relating to suitability of advice provided to individuals for defined benefit pension transfers in the united kingdom (u.k).
diluted earnings per share increased to $7.53 from $6.04, or 25% from the prior year. the increase is primarily the result of higher operating income in 2023, compared to the prior year.
consolidated revenue and expense revenue - non-gaap revenue and components of change the company advises clients in over 130 countries. as a result, foreign exchange rate movements may impact period over period comparisons of revenue. similarly, certain other items such as acquisitions and dispositions, including transfers among businesses, may impact period over period comparisons of revenue. non-gaap revenue measures the change in revenue from one period to the next by isolating these impacts on an underlying revenue basis. percentage changes, referred to as non-gaap underlying revenue, are calculated by dividing the period over period change in non-gaap revenue by the prior period non-gaap revenue.
the non-gaap revenue measure is presented on a constant currency basis excluding the impact of foreign currency fluctuations. the company isolates the impact of foreign exchange rate movements period over period, by translating the current period foreign currency gaap revenue into u.s. dollars based on the difference in the current and corresponding prior period exchange rates.
the percentage change for acquisitions, dispositions, and other includes the impact of current and prior year items excluded from the calculation of non-gaap underlying revenue for comparability purposes. details on these items are provided in the reconciliation of non-gaap revenue to gaap revenue tables.

(d)in the first quarter of 2023, the company began reporting the marsh india operations in emea. prior year results for india have been reclassified from asia pacific to emea for comparative purposes.
consolidated revenue consolidated revenue increased $2.0 billion, or 10%, to $22.7 billion in 2023, compared to $20.7 billion in 2022. consolidated revenue increased 9% on an underlying basis and 1% from acquisitions. on an underlying basis, revenue increased 11% and 7% in 2023, in the risk and insurance services and consulting segments, respectively.
underlying revenue growth in the risk and insurance services and consulting segments in 2023 reflect the continued demand for our advice and solutions. in risk and insurance services, the increase in underlying revenue was primarily due to growth in new business and renewals. results also benefited from growth in the global economy, inflation, higher insurance and reinsurance pricing, and an increase in fiduciary income due to higher interest rates. in consulting, revenue growth reflects continued demand for our health, wealth, and career solutions and products, and consulting services.
consolidated operating expenses consolidated operating expenses increased $1.0 billion, or 6%, to $17.5 billion in 2023, compared to $16.4 billion in 2022. expenses reflect a 2% increase from acquisitions. expenses excluding the impact from acquisitions, increased 5% in 2023, with increases of 5% in both the risk and insurance services and consulting segments.
expenses increased in 2023 primarily due to compensation and benefits driven by increased headcount, and higher base salary and incentive compensation. other operating expenses decreased due to lower restructuring and facility costs, partially offset by higher travel and entertainment costs compared to 2022. the company incurred a total of $301 million for restructuring activities in 2023, compared to $427 million in 2022. expenses in 2023 also include $51 million of insurance and indemnity recoveries for a legacy jlt e&o matter relating to suitability of advice provided to individuals for defined benefit pension transfers in the u.k.
restructuring activities in the fourth quarter of 2022, the company initiated activities focused on workforce actions, rationalization of technology and functional services, and reductions in real estate. the company anticipates total charges related to these activities to be approximately $475 million. through december 31, 2023, the company has incurred $441 million of these restructuring costs, primarily related to severance and lease exit charges, of which $222 million were incurred in 2023. any remaining costs are expected to be incurred by the end of 2024. related estimated savings are expected to be approximately $400 million, with $230 million realized in 2023. the majority of the remaining savings are expected to be realized in 2024. the company continues to refine its detailed plans for each business and location, which may change the expected timing, estimates of expected costs and related savings.
restructuring activities also reflect jlt integration and restructuring costs in 2023 of $31 million, compared to $115 million in 2022, primarily related to lease exit charges for a legacy jlt u.k. location. for additional details, refer to note 14, restructuring costs, in the notes to the consolidated financial statements.
risk and insurance services in the risk and insurance services segment, the company's subsidiaries and other affiliated entities act as brokers, agents or consultants for insureds, insurance underwriters and other brokers in the areas of risk management, insurance broking, insurance program management, risk consulting, analytical modeling and alternative risk financing services, primarily under the brand of marsh, and engage in specialized reinsurance broking expertise, strategic advisory services and analytics solutions, primarily under the brand of guy carpenter.
marsh and guy carpenter are compensated for brokerage and consulting services through commissions and fees. commission rates and fees vary in amount and can depend on a number of factors, including the type of insurance or reinsurance coverage provided, the particular insurer or reinsurer selected, and the capacity in which the broker acts and negotiates with clients. revenues can be affected by premium rate levels in the insurance/reinsurance markets, the amount of risk retained by insurance and reinsurance clients, and by the value of the risks that have been insured since commission-based compensation is frequently related to the premiums paid by insureds and reinsureds. in many cases, fee compensation may be negotiated in advance, based on the type of risk, coverage required and service provided by the company and ultimately, the extent of the risk placed into the insurance market or retained by the client. the trends and comparisons of revenue from one period to the next can be affected by changes in premium rate levels, fluctuations in client risk retention and increases or decreases in the value of risks that have been insured, as well as new and lost business, and the volume of business from new and existing clients.
in addition to compensation from its clients, marsh also receives other compensation, separate from retail fees and commissions, from insurance companies. this other compensation includes, among other things, payment for consulting and analytics services provided to insurers; compensation for administrative and other services (including fees for underwriting services and services provided to or on behalf of insurers relating to the administration and management of quota shares, panels and other facilities in which insurers participate); and contingent commissions, which are paid by insurers based on factors such as volume or profitability of marsh's placements, primarily driven by marsh mclennan agency ("mma") and parts of marsh's international operations.
marsh and guy carpenter receive interest income on certain funds (such as premiums and claims proceeds) held in a fiduciary capacity for others. the investment of fiduciary funds is regulated by state and other insurance authorities. these regulations typically require segregation of fiduciary funds and limit the types of investments that may be made. interest income from these investments varies depending on the amount of funds invested and applicable interest rates, both of which vary from time to time. for presentation purposes, fiduciary interest income is segregated from the other revenues of marsh and guy carpenter and separately presented within the segment, as shown in the previous revenue by segments tables.
the results of operations for the risk and insurance services segment are as follows:

(a)in 2023, the company reclassified certain amounts between compensation and benefits and other operating expenses for each reporting segment. the reclassification had no impact on consolidated or reporting segment total expenses. prior period amounts were reclassified for comparability purposes.
revenue revenue in the risk and insurance services segment increased $1.4 billion, or 11%, to $14.1 billion in 2023, compared to $12.6 billion in 2022. revenue increased 11% on an underlying basis and 1% from acquisitions, partially offset by a decrease of 1% from the impact of foreign currency translation. interest earned on fiduciary funds increased by $333 million to $453 million in 2023, compared to $120 million in the prior year.
the increase in revenue on an underlying basis in the risk and insurance services segment in 2023 was primarily due to growth in new business and renewals. results also benefited from growth in the global economy, inflation, higher insurance and reinsurance pricing, and an increase in fiduciary income due to higher interest rates.
marsh's revenue increased $873 million, or 8%, to $11.4 billion in 2023, compared to $10.5 billion in 2022. this reflects increases of 8% on an underlying basis and 1% from acquisitions, partially offset by a decrease of 1% from the impact of foreign currency translation. u.s./canada rose 7% on an underlying basis. total international operations produced underlying revenue growth of 9%, reflecting growth of 13% in latin america and 9% in each of emea and asia pacific.
revenue in 2022 also included a loss of $27 million related to the deconsolidation of the company's russian businesses.
guy carpenter's revenue increased $238 million, or 12%, to $2.3 billion in 2023, compared to $2.0 billion in 2022. this reflects increases of 10% on an underlying basis and 3% from acquisitions, partially offset by a decrease of 1% from the impact of foreign currency translation. revenue in 2023 also includes a gain from a legal settlement with a competitor for $58 million, excluding legal fees.
risk and insurance services segment completed 9 acquisitions in 2023. information regarding these acquisitions is included in note 5, acquisitions and dispositions, in the notes to the consolidated financial statements.
operating expenses expenses in the risk and insurance services segment increased $588 million, or 6%, to $10.1 billion in 2023, compared to $9.6 billion in 2022. expenses reflect a 1% increase from acquisitions.
expenses in 2023 increased primarily due to compensation and benefits driven by increased headcount, and higher base salary and incentive compensation. other operating expenses decreased due to lower restructuring and facility costs, partially offset by higher travel and entertainment costs compared to 2022. in 2023, the company incurred a total of $177 million restructuring costs in risk and insurance services, compared to $254 million in 2022, primarily related to activities initiated in the fourth quarter of 2022, focused on workforce actions, rationalization of technology and functional services, and reductions in real estate and lease exit charges for a legacy jlt u.k. location. expenses in 2022, also included settlement charges and legal costs related to strategic recruiting of $30 million.
consulting the company conducts business in its consulting segment through mercer and oliver wyman group. mercer delivers advice and technology-driven solutions that help organizations redefine the world of work, reshape retirement and investment outcomes, and unlock health and well-being for a changing workforce. oliver wyman group serves as critical strategic, economic and brand advisor to private sector and governmental clients.
the major component of revenue in the consulting business is fees paid by clients for advice and services. mercer, principally through its health line of business, also earns revenue in the form of commissions received from insurance companies for the placement of group (and occasionally individual) insurance contracts, primarily life, health and accident coverages. revenue for mercer's investment management business and certain of mercer's defined benefit and contribution administration services consists principally of fees based on assets under management or administration. for a majority of the mercer managed investment funds, revenue is recorded on a gross basis with sub-advisor fees included in other operating expenses.
revenue in the consulting segment is affected by, among other things, global economic conditions, including changes in clients' particular industries and markets. revenue is also affected by competition due to the introduction of new products and services, broad trends in employee demographics, including levels of employment and the effect of government policies and regulations. revenues from investment management services and retirement trust and administrative services are significantly affected by the level of assets under management or administration, which is impacted by securities market performance.
the results of operations for the consulting segment are as follows:
compensation and benefits (a)                    5,249                   4,827                   4,632
other operating expenses (a)                     1,794                   1,759                   1,653

(a)in 2023 the company reclassified certain amounts between compensation and benefits and other operating expenses for each reporting segment. the reclassification had no impact on consolidated or reporting segment total expenses. prior period amounts were reclassified for comparability purposes.
on january 1, 2024, the company sold its mercer u.s. health and benefits and u.k. pension administration businesses for approximately $110 million. the company expects the gain on sale and the impact on consulting segment revenues and operating income not to be material.
revenue consulting revenue increased $570 million, or 7%, to $8.7 billion in 2023, compared to $8.1 billion in 2022. this reflects an increase of 7% on an underlying basis.
mercer's revenue increased $242 million, or 5%, to $5.6 billion in 2023, compared to $5.3 billion in 2022. this reflects an increase of 7% on an underlying basis, partially offset by a decrease of 1% primarily from the disposition of businesses. on an underlying basis, revenue for health, career and wealth increased 10%, 6%, and 4%, respectively, as compared to the prior year.
the increase in revenue on an underlying basis at mercer in 2023 was primarily due to the continued demand for our health, wealth, and career solutions and products. health continued to benefit from growth in new business, higher retention, increased enrolled lives, and medical inflation. the increase in career products and services was due to continued demand in rewards and talent strategy. revenue in wealth on an underlying basis grew in defined benefit consulting and investment management fees due to the westpac transaction, a rebound in capital markets, and positive net flows.
revenue in 2023 included a loss of $17 million related to the sale of an individual financial advisory business in canada. results in 2022 also included a gain of $112 million from the sale of the mercer u.s. affinity business.
oliver wyman group's revenue increased $328 million, or 12%, to $3.1 billion in 2023, compared to $2.8 billion in 2022. this reflects increases of 8% on an underlying basis, 3% from acquisitions, and 1% from the impact of foreign currency translation.
the increase in underlying revenue at oliver wyman group in 2023 reflects broad-based growth across capabilities led by growth in the middle east and europe. revenue in 2022 also included a loss of $12 million related to the deconsolidation of the company's russian businesses.
the consulting segment completed 5 acquisitions in 2023. information regarding these acquisitions is included in note 5, acquisitions and dispositions, in the notes to the consolidated financial statements.
operating expenses expenses in the consulting segment increased $457 million, or 7%, to $7.0 billion in 2023, compared to $6.6 billion in 2022. expenses reflect an increase of 2% from acquisitions.
expenses in 2023 increased primarily due to compensation and benefits driven by increased headcount and higher base salary. the increase in expenses is partially offset by $51 million of insurance recoveries for a legacy jlt e&o matter relating to suitability of advice provided to individuals for defined pension transfers in the u.k.
in 2023, the company incurred $62 million of total restructuring cost in the consulting segment, compared to $77 million in the prior year, primarily related to the company's activities initiated in the fourth quarter of 2022, focused on workforce actions, rationalization of technology and functional services, and reductions in real estate.
expenses also reflect acquisition and integration related costs for the westpac transaction of $39 million, compared to $21 million in 2022.
corporate and other corporate expenses decreased $33 million, or 9%, to $329 million in 2023, compared to $362 million in 2022. the decrease in expenses reflects a 1% impact from foreign currency translation and lower facility and equipment costs in the current year.
investment income the caption "investment income" in the consolidated statements of income comprises realized and unrealized gains and losses from investments. it includes, when applicable, other than temporary declines in the value of securities, mark-to-market increases or decreases in equity investments with readily determinable fair values and equity method gains or losses on its investments in private equity funds. the company's investments may include direct investments in insurance, consulting or other strategically linked companies and investments in private equity funds. the company recorded net investment income of $5 million in 2023, compared to $21 million in 2022. the decrease in 2023 is primarily driven by lower mark-to-market gains from the company's private equity investments compared to the prior year.
the tax rates in both years reflect the impact of discrete tax matters such as excess tax benefits related to share-based compensation, enacted tax legislation, changes in uncertain tax positions, deferred tax adjustments, non-taxable adjustments related to contingent consideration for acquisitions, and valuation allowances for certain tax credits. the 2023 effective tax rate reflects the previously-enacted change in the u.k. corporate income tax rate from 19% to 25%, which was effective april 1, 2023. the blended u.k. statutory tax rate for 2023 is 23.5%. the 2022 effective tax rate also reflects tax benefits from planning that postponed the utilization of u.k. tax losses to future years when the u.k. statutory tax rate will be 25%.
in 2023, the company released valuation allowances related to its non-u.s. operations. management determined that there is sufficient positive evidence to conclude that it is more likely than not that deferred tax assets are realizable, primarily due to the sustained profitability of its operations. the valuation allowance release resulted in a decrease to tax expense of $94 million in the current year.
the effective tax rate may vary significantly from period to period. the effective tax rate is sensitive to the geographic mix of earnings and the cost to repatriate the company's earnings, which may result in higher or lower effective tax rates. therefore, a shift in the mix of profits among jurisdictions, or changes in the company's repatriation strategy to access offshore cash, can affect the effective tax rate. in 2023, pre-tax income in the u.k., canada, barbados, ireland, bermuda, india, united arab emirates, japan, and australia accounted for approximately 65% of the company's total non-u.s. pre-tax income, with effective rates in those countries of 20.0%, 27.3%, 1.2%, 23.2%, (18.8)%, 26.0%, 17.3%, 37.6%, and 26.0%, respectively.
in addition, losses in certain jurisdictions cannot be offset by earnings from other operations and may require valuation allowances that affect the rate in a particular period, depending on estimates of the value of associated deferred tax assets which can be realized. a valuation allowance was recorded to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that the company believes is more likely than not to be realized. details are provided in note 7, income taxes, in the notes to the consolidated financial statements. the effective tax rate is also sensitive to changes in unrecognized tax benefits, including the impact of settled tax audits and expired statutes of limitations.
changes in tax laws, rulings, policies or related legal and regulatory interpretations occur frequently and may also have significant favorable or adverse impacts on our effective tax rate. in july 2023, the u.k. enacted legislation to implement pillar 2 of the organization for economic cooperation and development's ("oecd") framework, effective from january 1, 2024. this minimum tax will be treated as a period cost in future years and does not impact operating results for 2023. other countries in the european union (e.u.) and elsewhere have similarly adopted legislation. the company is continuing to monitor legislative developments, especially in the e.u. countries, and is in the process of evaluating the potential impact of the u.k. and other enacted legislation on its results of future operations. currently, the company does not expect the impact of pillar 2 related legislation to be material in 2024.
on august 16, 2022, the inflation reduction act of 2022 ("ira") was enacted into law. the company evaluated the provisions of the ira, the most significant of which are the corporate alternative minimum tax and the share repurchase tax. the ira was effective as of january 1, 2023, and does not have a significant impact on the company's financial results of operations for the current year.
as a u.s.-domiciled parent holding company, the company is the issuer of essentially all of the company's external indebtedness, and incurs the related interest expense in the u.s. the company's interest expense deductions are not currently limited. further, most senior executive and oversight functions are conducted in the u.s. and the associated costs are incurred primarily in the u.s. some of these expenses may not be deductible in the u.s., which may impact the effective tax rate.
changes to the u.s. tax law in recent years have allowed the company to repatriate foreign earnings without incurring additional u.s. federal income tax costs as foreign income is generally already taxed in the u.s. however, permanent reinvestment continues to be a component of the company's global capital strategy. the company continues to evaluate its global investment and repatriation strategy in light of our capital requirements and potential costs of repatriation, which are generally limited to local country withholding taxes.
liquidity and capital resources the company is organized as a legal entity separate and distinct from its operating subsidiaries. as the company does not have significant operations of its own, the company is dependent upon dividends and other payments from its operating subsidiaries to pay principal and interest on its outstanding debt obligations, pay dividends to shareholders, repurchase its shares and pay corporate expenses. the company can also provide financial support to its operating subsidiaries for acquisitions, investments and certain parts of their business that require liquidity, such as the capital markets business of guy carpenter. other sources of liquidity include borrowing facilities in financing cash flows.
the company derives a significant portion of its revenue and operating profit from operating subsidiaries located outside of the u.s. funds from those operating subsidiaries are regularly repatriated to the u.s. out of annual earnings. at december 31, 2023, the company had approximately $1.2 billion of cash and cash equivalents in its foreign operations, which includes $462 million of operating funds required to be maintained for regulatory requirements or as collateral under certain captive insurance arrangements. the company expects to continue its practice of repatriating available funds from its non-u.s. operating subsidiaries out of current annual earnings. where appropriate, a portion of the current year earnings will continue to be permanently reinvested.
in 2023, the company recorded foreign currency translation adjustments which increased net equity by $274 million. continued weakening of the u.s. dollar against foreign currencies would further increase the translated u.s. dollar value of the company's net investments in its non-u.s. subsidiaries, as well as the translated u.s. dollar value of cash repatriations from those subsidiaries.
cash and cash equivalents on our consolidated balance sheets includes funds available for general corporate purposes. fiduciary assets are shown separately in the consolidated balance sheets as cash and cash equivalents held in a fiduciary capacity, with a corresponding amount in current liabilities. fiduciary assets cannot be used for general corporate purposes, and should not be considered as a source of liquidity for the company.
operating cash flows the company provided $4.3 billion of cash from operations in 2023, compared to $3.5 billion provided by operations in 2022. these amounts reflect the net income of the company during those periods, excluding gains or losses from investments, adjusted for non-cash charges and changes in working capital which relate primarily to the timing of payments of accrued liabilities, including incentive compensation, or receipts of receivables and pension contributions. the company used cash of $271 million and $193 million related to its restructuring activities in 2023 and 2022, respectively.
pension related items contributions the company's policy for funding its tax-qualified defined benefit plans is to contribute amounts at least sufficient to meet the funding requirements set forth in accordance with applicable law. in 2023, the company contributed $33 million to its u.s. defined benefit pension plans and $78 million to its non-u.s. defined benefit pension plans. in 2022, the company contributed $30 million to its u.s. defined benefit pension plans and $139 million to its non-u.s. defined benefit pension plans.
in the u.s., contributions to the tax-qualified defined benefit plans are based on employee retirement income security act ("erisa") guidelines and the company generally expects to maintain a funded status of 80% or more of the liability determined in accordance with the erisa guidelines. in 2023, the company made contributions of $33 million to its non-qualified plans and expects to contribute approximately $31 million in 2024. the company was not required to and made no contributions to its u.s. qualified plans in 2023. in 2024, the company is required to make contributions totaling $2 million to its u.s. qualified plans.
outside the u.s., the company has a large number of defined benefit pension plans, the largest of which are in the u.k., which comprise approximately 79% of non-u.s. plan assets at december 31, 2023. contribution rates for non-u.s. plans are generally based on local funding practices and statutory requirements, which may differ significantly from measurements in accordance with u.s. gaap.
in the u.k., the assumptions used to determine pension contributions are the result of legally-prescribed negotiations between the company and the plans' trustee that typically occur every three years in conjunction with the actuarial valuation of the plans. currently, this results in a lower funded status compared to u.s. gaap and may result in contributions irrespective of the u.s. gaap funded status.
the company contributed $42 million to its u.k. plans, including the jlt section, in 2023. the company's contributions to its u.k. plans, including the jlt section, for 2024 are expected to be approximately $39 million. the company made deficit contributions of $41 million to the jlt section in 2023, and is expected to make contributions totaling approximately $38 million in 2024.
for the mmc u.k. pension fund, excluding the jlt section, an agreement was reached with the trustee in the fourth quarter of 2022, based on the surplus funding position at december 31, 2021. in accordance with the agreement, no deficit funding is required at the earliest until 2026. the funding level will be re-assessed during 2025 as part of the december 31, 2024 actuarial valuation to determine if contributions are required in 2026. in december 2022, the company renewed its agreement to support annual deficit contributions that may be required by the u.k. operating companies under certain circumstances, up to £450 million (or $576 million) over a seven-year period. this is part of an agreement which gives the company greater influence over asset allocation and overall investment decisions.
the company expects to contribute approximately $78 million to its non-u.s. defined benefit plans in 2024, comprising approximately of $39 million to the u.k. plans and $39 million to plans outside of the u.k.
changes in funded status and expense the year-over-year change in the funded status of the company's pension plans is impacted by the difference between actual and assumed results, particularly with regard to return on assets, and changes in the discount rate, as well as the amount of company contributions, if any. unrecognized actuarial losses as of december 31, 2023, were approximately $1.3 billion and $3.2 billion for the u.s. plans and non-u.s. plans, respectively, compared with losses of $1.4 billion and $2.6 billion as of december 31, 2022. the decrease in the u.s. is primarily due to greater than expected returns on plan assets. the increase in the non-u.s. plans is primarily due to decreases in the discount rates used to measure plan liabilities, lower than expected returns on plan assets and the impact of foreign exchange. in the past several years, the amount of unamortized losses has been significantly impacted, both positively and negatively, by actual asset performance and changes in discount rates. the discount rate used to measure plan liabilities for the company's u.s. and u.k. plans decreased in 2023 and increased in 2022 and 2021. an increase in the discount rate decreases the measured plan benefit obligation, resulting in actuarial gains, while a decrease in the discount rate increases the measured plan obligation, resulting in actuarial losses. in 2023, the company's defined benefit pension plan assets had gains of 9.3% and 4.1% in the u.s. and u.k., respectively, as compared to losses of 18.3% and 29.2% in the u.s. and u.k., respectively, in 2022.
overall, based on the measurement at december 31, 2023, net benefit credits related to the company's defined benefit plans are not expected to be materially different in 2024, compared to 2023, for both the u.s. and non-u.s. plans.
the company's accounting policies for its defined benefit pension plans, including the selection of and sensitivity to assumptions, are discussed in management's discussion of critical accounting estimates. for additional information regarding the company's retirement plans, refer to note 1, summary of significant accounting policies, and note 8, retirement benefits, in the notes to the consolidated financial statements.
credit facilities in october 2023, the company increased its multi-currency unsecured five-year revolving credit facility (the "credit facility") capacity to $3.5 billion from $2.8 billion and extended the expiration to october 2028. the interest rate on the credit facility was initially based on libor plus a fixed margin which varied with the company's credit rating. in the second quarter of 2023, the credit facility was amended that borrowings under the credit facility bear interest at a rate per annum equal, at the company's option, either at (a) sofr benchmark rate for u.s. dollar borrowings, or (b) a currency specific benchmark rate, plus an applicable margin which varies with the company's credit ratings. the company is required to maintain certain coverage and leverage ratios for the credit facility, which are evaluated quarterly.
the credit facility includes provisions for determining a benchmark replacement rate in the event existing benchmark rates are no longer available or in certain other circumstances, in which an alternative rate may be required. at december 31, 2023 and 2022, the company had no borrowings under this facility.
in october 2023, the company terminated its one-year uncommitted revolving credit facility ("uncommitted credit facility"). there were no borrowings outstanding under the uncommitted credit facility at december 31, 2022.
the company also maintains other credit and overdraft facilities with various financial institutions aggregating $113 million at december 31, 2023, and $362 million at december 31, 2022. there were no outstanding borrowings under these facilities at december 31, 2023 and 2022.
the company has outstanding guarantees and letters of credit with various banks aggregating $139 million and $152 million at december 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.
debt in november 2023, the company increased its short-term commercial paper financing program (the "program") to $3.5 billion from $2.8 billion. the company had previously increased the program's capacity in october 2022 to $2.8 billion from $2.0 billion. the company did not have any commercial paper outstanding at december 31, 2023 and 2022.
in october 2023, the company repaid $250 million of 4.05% senior notes that matured.
in september 2023, the company issued $600 million of 5.400% senior notes due 2033 and $1 billion of 5.700% senior notes due 2053. in march 2023, the company issued $600 million of 5.450% senior notes due 2053. the company used the net proceeds from these issuances for general corporate purposes.
in october 2022, the company issued $500 million of 5.75% senior notes due 2032 and $500 million of 6.25% senior notes due 2052. the company used the net proceeds from these issuances for general corporate purposes, and repaid $350 million of 3.30% senior notes in november 2022, with an original maturity date of march 2023.
share repurchases in 2023, the company repurchased 6.4 million shares of its common stock for $1.15 billion. at december 31, 2023, the company remained authorized to repurchase up to approximately $3.2 billion in shares of its common stock. there is no time limit on this authorization. in 2022, the company repurchased 12.2 million shares of its common stock for $1.9 billion.
in march 2022, the board of directors of the company authorized an additional $5 billion in share repurchases. this was in addition to the company's existing share repurchase program, which had approximately $1.3 billion of remaining authorization at december 31, 2021.
dividends the company paid dividends on its common stock shares of $1.3 billion ($2.60 per share) in 2023, as compared with $1.1 billion ($2.25 per share) in 2022.
in january 2024, the board of directors of the company declared a quarterly dividend of $0.710 per share on outstanding common stock, payable in february 2024.
contingent payments related to acquisitions the classification of contingent consideration in the consolidated statements of cash flows is dependent upon whether the receipt, payment or adjustment was part of the initial liability established on the acquisition date (financing) or an adjustment to the acquisition date liability (operating).
the following amounts are included in the consolidated statements of cash flows as operating and financing activities:
operating:
receipt of contingent consideration for dispositions                                           1                           -                          19
acquisition/disposition related net charges for adjustments                                   29                          49                          57
adjustments and payments related to contingent consideration                               $(11)                         $11                         $27
payments of deferred and contingent consideration for acquisitions                        $(202)                      $(158)                      $(117)
receipt of contingent consideration for dispositions                                          $2                          $3                         $71
for acquisitions completed in 2023, and in prior years, remaining estimated future contingent payments of $252 million and deferred consideration payments of $92 million, are recorded in accounts payable and accrued liabilities or other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets at december 31, 2023.
derivatives - net investment hedge the company has investments in various subsidiaries with euro functional currencies. as a result, the company is exposed to the risk of fluctuations between the euro and u.s. dollar exchange rates. as part of its risk management program, the company issued €1.1 billion senior notes, and designated the debt instruments as a net investment hedge of its euro denominated subsidiaries. the hedge is re-assessed each quarter to confirm that the designated equity balance at the beginning of each period continues to equal or exceed 80% of the outstanding balance of the euro debt instrument and that all the critical terms of the hedging instrument and the hedged net investment continue to match. if the hedge is highly effective, the change in the debt balance related to foreign exchange fluctuations is recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss in the consolidated balance sheets.
the u.s. dollar value of the euro notes increased by $54 million in 2023 due to change in foreign exchange rates. the company concluded that the hedge was highly effective and recorded an increase to accumulated other comprehensive loss for the year ended december 31, 2023.
purchase of remaining non-controlling interest in the second quarter of 2023, the company purchased the remaining interest in a subsidiary for $139 million.
fiduciary liabilities since fiduciary assets are not available for corporate use, fiduciary assets are shown separately in the consolidated balance sheets as cash and cash equivalents held in a fiduciary capacity, with a corresponding amount in current liabilities. financing cash flows reflect an increase of $255 million and $1.7 billion in 2023 and 2022, respectively, related to fiduciary liabilities.
the company paid $976 million and $572 million, net of cash, cash equivalents and cash and cash equivalents held in a fiduciary capacity acquired, for acquisitions in 2023 and 2022, respectively. the outflow of funds in 2023 related primarily to the acquisitions of honan insurance group, graham company and the westpac transaction for $358 million, $307 million, and $232 million, respectively.
in connection with the disposition of mercer's u.s. affinity business in 2022, the company transferred to the buyer an additional $24 million of cash and cash equivalents held in a fiduciary capacity in 2023.
in 2022, the company sold certain businesses, primarily mercer's u.s. affinity business, for cash proceeds of approximately $155 million, partially offset by $36 million primarily related to cash and cash equivalents held in a fiduciary capacity in the disposed businesses.
in the third quarter of 2022, the company sold the remaining investment in the common stock of alexander forbes ("af"), for cash proceeds of approximately $62 million.
the company's additions to fixed assets and capitalized software, which amounted to $416 million in 2023 and $470 million in 2022, related primarily to software development costs, the refurbishing and modernizing of office facilities, and technology equipment purchases.
cash used for long-term investments in 2023 is due to investments in private equity funds. at december 31, 2023, the company has commitments for potential future investments of approximately $121 million in private equity funds that invest primarily in financial services companies.
commitments and obligations the following sets forth the company's future contractual obligations by type at december 31, 2023:
years                    years            years current portion of long-term debt                     $1,619                     $1,619                          $-                       $-                $-
net operating leases                                   2,237                        372                         664                      479       722
service agreements                                       637                        316                         237                       84                -
(a) primarily reflects future payments of deferred and contingent purchase consideration.
the table does not include the liability for unrecognized tax benefits of $124 million as the company is unable to reasonably predict the timing of settlement of these liabilities, other than approximately $49 million that may become payable within one year. the table also does not include the remaining transitional tax payments related to the tax cuts and jobs act ("tcja") of $58 million, which will be paid in installments from 2024 through 2026.
management's discussion of critical accounting estimates management makes estimates and judgments that affect reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. management considers the following policies to be critical to understanding the company's financial statements because their application places the most significant demands on management's judgment, and requires management to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. actual results may differ from those estimates.
revenue recognition in the risk and insurance services segment, management makes judgments related to the amount of variable revenue consideration to ultimately be received on placement of quota share reinsurance treaties and contingent commission from insurers. management also makes judgments and estimates to measure the progress toward completing performance obligations and realization rates for consideration related to contracts as well as potential performance-based fees in the consulting segment.
the company capitalizes the incremental costs to obtain contracts primarily related to commissions or sales bonus payments. these deferred costs are amortized over the expected life of the underlying customer relationships. the company also capitalizes certain pre-placement costs that are considered fulfillment costs that are amortized at a point in time when the associated revenue is recognized.
refer to note 2, revenue, in the notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.
legal and other loss contingencies the company and its subsidiaries are subject to numerous claims, lawsuits and proceedings including claims for errors and omissions ("e&o"). the company records a liability when a loss is both probable and reasonably estimable which requires significant management judgment. the company utilizes case level reviews by inside and outside counsel, an internal actuarial analysis by oliver wyman group, a subsidiary of the company, and other methods to estimate potential losses. the liability is reviewed quarterly and adjusted based on claims developments. in many cases, the company has not recorded a liability, other than for legal fees to defend the claim, because the company is unable, at present time, to make a determination that a loss is both probable and reasonably estimable. given the unpredictability of e&o claims and of litigation that could arise from such claims, it is possible that an adverse outcome in a particular matter could have a material adverse effect on the company's businesses, results of operations, financial condition or cash flows in a given quarterly or annual period.
in addition, to the extent that insurance coverage is available, significant management judgment is required to determine the amount of recoveries that are probable of collection under the company's various insurance programs.
retirement benefits the company maintains qualified and non-qualified defined benefit pension and defined contribution plans for its eligible u.s. employees and a variety of defined benefit and defined contribution plans for its eligible non-u.s. employees. the company's policy for funding its tax-qualified defined benefit retirement plans is to contribute amounts at least sufficient to meet the funding requirements set forth in the u.s. and applicable foreign laws.
the company recognizes the funded status of its over-funded defined benefit pension and retiree medical plans as a net benefit plan asset and its unfunded and underfunded plans as a net benefit plan liability. the gains or losses and prior service costs or credits that have not been recognized as components of net benefit (credit) cost are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income ("aoci"), net of tax, in the company's consolidated balance sheets. the gains and losses that exceed specified corridors in accordance with accounting guidance, of the greater of the projected benefit obligation or the market-related value of plan assets, are amortized prospectively out of aoci over a period that approximates the remaining life expectancy of participants in plans where substantially all participants are inactive or the average remaining service period of active participants for plans with active participants. the vast majority of unrecognized losses relate to inactive plans and are amortized over the remaining life expectancy of the participants.
the determination of net periodic benefit (credit) cost is based on a number of assumptions, including an expected long-term rate of return on plan assets, the discount rate, mortality and assumed rate of salary increase. the assumptions used in the calculation of net periodic benefit (credit) cost and pension liabilities are disclosed in note 8, retirement benefits, in the notes to the consolidated financial statements.
the long-term rate of return on plan assets assumption is determined for each plan based on the facts and circumstances that exist as of the measurement date, and the specific portfolio mix of each plan's assets. the company utilizes a model developed by mercer, a subsidiary of the company, to assist in the determination of this assumption. the model takes into account several factors, including: target portfolio allocation, investment, administrative and trading expenses incurred directly by the plan trust, historical portfolio performance, relevant forward-looking economic analysis, and expected returns, variances and correlations for different asset classes. these measures are used to determine probabilities using standard statistical techniques to calculate a range of expected returns on the portfolio.
the target asset allocation for the u.s. plans is 50% equities and equity alternatives and 50% fixed income. at the end of 2023, the actual allocation for the u.s. plans was 49% equities and equity alternatives and 51% fixed income. the target asset allocation for the u.k. plans, which comprise approximately 79% of non-u.s. plan assets, is 14% equities and equity alternatives and 86% fixed income. at the end of 2023, the actual allocation for the u.k. plans was 13% equities and equity alternatives and 87% fixed income.
the following table shows the weighted average assumed rate of return and the discount rate at the december 31, 2023 measurement date used to measure pension expense in 2024 for the total company, the u.s. and the rest of world ("row").
total company                 u.s.                  row assumed rate of return on plan assets                        5.44      %             6.49   %             4.96   %
holding all other assumptions constant, a 0.5 percentage point change in the rate of return on plan assets and discount rate assumptions would affect net periodic benefit (credit) cost for the u.s. and u.k. plans, which together comprise approximately 83% of total pension plan liabilities, as follows:
assumed rate of return on plan assets        $(23)                     $(46)         $23                     $46
the impact of discount rate changes relates to the increase or decrease in actuarial gains or losses being amortized through net periodic benefit (credit) cost, as well as the increase or decrease in interest expense, with all other facts and assumptions held constant. it does not contemplate nor include potential future impacts a change in the interest rate environment and discount rates might cause, such as the impact on the market value of the plans' assets. in addition, the assumed return on plan assets would likely be impacted by changes in the interest rate environment and other factors, including equity valuations, since these factors reflect the starting point used in the company's projection models. for example, a reduction in interest rates may result in a reduction in the assumed return on plan assets. changing the discount rate and leaving the other assumptions constant, may also not be representative of the impact on expense, because the long-term rates of inflation and salary increases are often correlated with the discount rate. changes in these assumptions will not necessarily have a linear impact on the net periodic benefit (credit) cost.
the company contributes to certain health care and life insurance benefits provided to its retired employees. the cost of these post-retirement benefits for employees in the u.s. is accrued during the period up to the date employees are eligible to retire but is funded by the company as incurred. the key assumptions and sensitivity to changes in the assumed health care cost trend rate are discussed in note 8, retirement benefits, in the notes to the consolidated financial statements.
income taxes significant judgment is required in determining the annual effective tax rate and in evaluating uncertain tax positions. the company reports a liability for unrecognized tax benefits resulting from uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. the evaluation of a tax position is a two-step process:
•first, the company determines whether it is more-likely-than-not a tax position will be sustained upon tax examination, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation, based on only the technical merits of the position. if a tax position does not meet the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold, the benefit of that position is not recognized in the financial statements.
•the second step is measurement. a tax position that meets the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold is measured to determine the amount of benefit to recognize in the financial statements. the tax position is measured as the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50% likely to be realized upon ultimate resolution with a taxing authority. uncertain tax positions are evaluated based upon the facts and circumstances that exist at each reporting period and involve significant management judgment. subsequent changes in judgment based upon new information may lead to changes in recognition, de-recognition, and measurement. adjustments may result, for example, upon resolution of an issue with the taxing authorities, or expiration of a statute of limitations barring an assessment for an issue.
the company recognizes interest and penalties, if any, related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense. the company's accounting policy follows the portfolio approach that leaves stranded income tax effects in accumulated other comprehensive income.
certain items are included in the company's tax returns at different times than the items are reflected in the financial statements. as a result, the annual tax expense reflected in the consolidated statements of income is different than that reported in the tax returns. some of these differences are permanent, such as non-deductible expenses, and some differences are temporary and reverse over time, such as depreciation expense.
temporary differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities, which are measured using the enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the periods in which the deferred tax asset or liability is expected to be settled or realized. deferred tax liabilities generally represent tax expense recognized in the financial statements for which cash tax payments have been deferred, or expense for which a deduction has been taken already in the tax return but the expense has not yet been recognized in the financial statements. deferred tax assets generally represent items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in tax returns in future years for which a benefit has already been recorded in the financial statements.
the company evaluates all significant available positive and negative evidence, including the existence of losses in recent years and its forecast of future taxable income by jurisdiction, in assessing the need for a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets. the company also considers tax planning strategies that would result in realization of deferred tax assets, and the presence of taxable income in prior period tax filings in jurisdictions that allow for the carry back of tax attributes pursuant to the applicable tax law. the underlying assumptions the company uses in forecasting future taxable income require significant judgment and take into account the company's recent performance. the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent on the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which temporary differences or carry-forwards are deductible or creditable. valuation allowances are established for deferred tax assets when it is estimated that it is more-likely-than-not that future taxable income will be insufficient to fully use a deduction or credit in that jurisdiction.
fair value determinations goodwill impairment testing - the company is required to assess goodwill and any indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment annually, or more frequently if circumstances indicate impairment may have occurred. the company performs the annual impairment assessment for each of its reporting units during the third quarter of each year. the reporting unit level is defined as the same level as the company's operating segments. in accordance with applicable accounting guidance, a company can assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform a quantitative goodwill impairment test. alternatively, the company may elect to proceed directly to the quantitative goodwill impairment test.
in 2023, the company performed a quantitative impairment assessment. fair values for the reporting units were estimated using both an income and market valuation approach. carrying values were based on balances at june 30, 2023 and included directly identified assets and liabilities, as well as an allocation of those assets and liabilities not recorded at the reporting unit level.
the company completed its 2023 annual review in the third quarter and concluded that goodwill was not impaired, as the fair value of each reporting unit exceeded the carrying value.
purchase price allocation assets acquired and liabilities assumed, including contingent consideration, as part of a business acquisition are generally recorded at their fair value at the date of acquisition. the excess of purchase price over the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed is recorded as goodwill. determining fair value of identifiable assets, particularly intangibles, and liabilities acquired also requires management to make estimates, which are based on all available information and in some cases assumptions with respect to the timing and amount of future revenues and expenses associated with an asset. these estimates directly impact the amount of identified intangible assets recognized and the related amortization expense in future periods.

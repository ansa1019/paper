item 1a. risk factors you should carefully consider each of the following risks and all of the other information set forth in this annual report on form 10-k or incorporated by reference herein. based on the information currently known to us, we believe that the following information identifies the most significant factors affecting our company. however, additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial may also adversely affect our business.
if any of the following risks and uncertainties develop into actual events, they could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations.
our clients are subject to complex laws and regulations, and new laws or regulations and/or changes to existing laws or regulations could impact our clients and, in turn, adversely impact our business or may reduce our profitability.
we provide technology solutions to financial services firms that are generally subject to extensive regulation in the u.s. and in other jurisdictions. as a provider of products and services to financial institutions and issuers of securities, our products and services are provided in a manner designed to assist our clients in complying with the laws and regulations to which they are subject. therefore, our services, such as our proxy, shareholder report and prospectus distribution, and customer communications services, are particularly sensitive to changes in laws and regulations, including those governing the financial services industry and the securities markets. changes in laws and regulations could require changes in the services we provide or the manner in which we provide our services, or they could result in a reduction or elimination of the demand for our services.
our investor communications services and the fees we charge our clients for certain services are subject to change if applicable sec or stock exchange rules or regulations are amended, or new laws or regulations are adopted, which could result in a material negative impact on our business and financial results. for example, the sec's recently adopted modifications to the mutual fund and exchange-traded fund shareholder report disclosure framework could have an impact on our services, business and financial results.
in addition, new regulations governing our clients could result in significant expenditures that could cause them to reduce their use of our services, seek to renegotiate existing agreements, or cease or curtail their operations, all of which could adversely impact our business. further, an adverse regulatory action that changes a client's business or adversely affects its financial condition, could decrease their ability to purchase, or their demand for, our products and services. the loss of business from any of our larger clients could have a material adverse effect on our revenues and results of operations.
consolidation in the financial services industry could adversely affect our revenues by eliminating some of our existing and potential clients and could make us increasingly dependent on a more limited number of clients.
there has been and may continue to be consolidation activity in the financial services industry. these mergers or consolidations of financial institutions could reduce the number of our clients and potential clients. for example, in the past few years alone there have been several major consolidations involving our clients. when our clients merge with or are acquired by other firms that are not our clients, or firms that use fewer of our services, they may discontinue or reduce the use of our services. in addition, it is possible that the larger financial institutions resulting from mergers or consolidations could decide to perform in-house some or all of the services that we currently provide or could provide. if we are unable to mitigate the impact of a loss or reduction of business resulting from a client consolidation, we could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.
a large percentage of our revenues are derived from a small number of clients in the financial services industry and the loss of any of such clients, a reduction of their demand for our services, or change in the method of delivery of our services could have a material impact on our financial results.
in fiscal year 2023, our largest client accounted for approximately 7% of our consolidated revenues. while our clients generally work with multiple business segments, the loss of business from any of our larger clients due to merger or consolidation, financial difficulties or bankruptcy, or the termination or non-renewal of contracts could have a material adverse effect on our revenues and results of operations. also, a delay in onboarding a client onto our technology would result in a delay in our recognition of revenue from that client. further, in the event of the loss of a client's business, a reduction of a client's demand for our services, or a change in the method of delivery of our services, then in addition to losing the revenue from that client, we could be required to write-off all or a portion of the related client investments or accelerate the amortization of certain costs, including costs incurred to onboard a client or convert a client's systems to function with our technology. such costs for all clients represented approximately 11% of our total assets as of june 30, 2023, with one client representing a large portion of this amount. see note 3, "revenue recognition" and note 11, "deferred client conversion and start-up costs" to our consolidated financial statements for more information.
security breaches or cybersecurity attacks could adversely affect our ability to operate, could result in personal, confidential or proprietary information being misappropriated, and may cause us to be held liable or suffer harm to our reputation.
we process and transfer sensitive data, including personal information, valuable intellectual property and other proprietary or confidential data provided to us by our clients, which include financial institutions, public companies, mutual funds, and healthcare companies. we also handle personal information of our employees in connection with their employment. we maintain systems and procedures including encryption, authentication technology, data loss prevention technology, entitlement management, access control and anti-malware software, and transmission of data over private networks to protect against unauthorized access to physical and electronic information, including by cybersecurity attacks. however, information security threats continue to evolve resulting in increased risk and exposure and increased costs to protect against the threat of information security breaches or to respond to or alleviate problems caused by such breaches.
in certain circumstances, our third-party vendors may have access to sensitive data including personal information. it is also possible that a third-party vendor could intentionally or inadvertently disclose sensitive data, including personal information. we require our third-party vendors to have appropriate security controls if they have access to the personal information of our clients' customers or our employees. however, despite those safeguards, it is possible that unauthorized individuals could improperly access our systems or those of our vendors, or improperly obtain or disclose the sensitive data including personal information that we or our vendors process or handle.
many of our services are provided through the internet, which increases our exposure to potential cybersecurity attacks. we have experienced cybersecurity threats to our information technology infrastructure and have experienced non-material cybersecurity attacks, attempts to breach our systems and other similar incidents. future threats could cause harm to our business and our reputation and challenge our ability to provide reliable service, as well as negatively impact our results of operations materially. our insurance coverage may not be adequate to cover all the costs related to cybersecurity attacks or disruptions resulting from such events.
any unauthorized use or disclosure of certain personal information could put individuals at risk of identity theft and financial or other harm and result in costs to us in investigation, remediation, legal defense and in liability to parties who are financially harmed. we may incur significant costs to protect against the threat of information security breaches or to respond to or alleviate problems caused by such breaches. for example, laws may require notification to regulators, clients or employees and enlisting credit monitoring or identity theft protection in the event of a privacy breach. a cybersecurity attack could also be directed at our systems and result in interruptions in our operations or delivery of services to our clients and their customers. furthermore, a security breach could cause us to lose revenues, lose clients or cause damage to our reputation.
our business and results of operations may be adversely affected if we do not comply with legal and regulatory requirements that apply to our services or businesses, and new laws or regulations and/or changes to existing laws or regulations to which we are subject may adversely affect our ability to conduct our business or may reduce our profitability.
the legislative and regulatory environment of the financial services industry is continuously changing. the sec, finra, dol, various stock exchanges and other u.s. and foreign governmental or regulatory authorities continuously review legislative and regulatory initiatives and may adopt new or revised laws and regulations or provide revised interpretations or they may change the enforcement priorities with respect to existing laws and regulations. these legislative and regulatory initiatives impact the way in which we conduct our business, requiring changes to the way we provide our services or additional investment which may make our business more or less profitable. further, as a provider of technology services to financial institutions, certain aspects of our u.s. operations are subject to regulatory oversight and examination by the ffiec. a sufficiently unfavorable review from the ffiec could have a material adverse effect on our business. with an increased focus on cybersecurity and vendor risk management, the ffiec and other regulatory agencies provide guidelines for overseeing technology service providers, increasing the contractual requirements with our clients and the cost of providing our services.
our business process outsourcing, mutual fund processing and transfer agency solutions as well as the entities providing those services are subject to regulatory oversight. our provision of these services must comply with applicable rules and regulations of the sec, finra, dol, various stock exchanges and other regulatory bodies charged with safeguarding the integrity of the securities markets and other financial markets and protecting the interests of investors participating in these markets. if we fail to comply with any applicable regulations in performing these services, we could be subject to suits for breach of contract or to governmental proceedings, censures and fines. in addition, we could lose clients and our reputation could be harmed, negatively impacting our ability to attract new clients.
as a provider of data and business processing solutions, our systems contain a significant amount of sensitive data, including personal information, related to our clients, customers of our clients, and our employees. we are, therefore, subject to compliance obligations under federal, state and foreign privacy and information security laws, including in the u.s., the glba, hipaa, and the cpra, and the gdpr in the european union, and we are subject to compliance with various client industry standards such as pci dss as well as medicare and medicaid programs related to our clients. we are subject to penalties for failure to comply with such regulations and requirements, and such penalties could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows. there has been increased public attention regarding the use of personal information, accompanied by legislation and regulations intended to strengthen data protection, information security and consumer and personal privacy. the law in these areas continues to develop, the number of jurisdictions adopting such laws continues to increase and these laws may be inconsistent from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. furthermore, the changing nature of privacy laws in the u.s., the european union and elsewhere could impact our processing of personal information of our employees and on behalf of our clients.
our ability to comply with applicable laws and regulations depends largely upon the maintenance of an effective compliance system which can be time consuming and costly, as well as our ability to attract and retain qualified compliance personnel. any failure by our employees to comply with our policies and any laws and regulations applicable to our business, even if inadvertent, could have a negative impact on our business.
our revenues may decrease due to declines in the levels of participation and activity in the securities markets.
we generate significant revenues from the transaction processing fees we earn from our services. these revenue sources are substantially dependent on the levels of participation and activity in the securities markets. the number of unique securities positions held by investors through our clients and our clients' customer trading volumes reflect the levels of participation and activity in the markets, which are impacted by market prices, and the liquidity of the securities markets, among other factors. volatility in the securities markets and sudden sharp or gradual but sustained declines in market participation and activity can result in reduced investor communications activity, including reduced proxy and event-driven communications processing such as mutual fund proxy, mergers and acquisitions and other special corporate event communications processing, and reduced trading volumes. in addition, our event-driven fee revenues are based on the number of special corporate events and transactions we process. event-driven activity is impacted by financial market conditions and changes in regulatory compliance requirements, resulting in fluctuations in the timing and levels of event-driven fee revenues. as such, the timing and level of event-driven activity and its potential impact on our revenues and earnings are difficult to forecast. the occurrence of any of these events would likely result in reduced revenues and decreased profitability from our business operations.
we may be adversely impacted by a failure of third-party service providers to perform their functions.
we rely on relationships with third parties, including our service providers and other vendors for certain functions. if we are unable to effectively manage our third-party relationships and the agreements under which our third-party vendors operate, our financial results or reputation could suffer. we rely on these third parties, including for the provision of certain data center and cloud services, to provide services in a timely and accurate manner and to adequately address their own risks, including those related to cybersecurity. failure by these third parties to adequately perform their services as expected could result in material interruptions in our operations, and negatively impact our services resulting in a material adverse effect on our business and financial results.
certain of our businesses rely on a single or a limited number of service providers or vendors. changes in the business condition (financial or otherwise) of these service providers or vendors could impact their provision of services to us or they may no longer be able to provide services to us at all, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results. in such circumstances, we cannot be certain that we will be able to replace our key third-party vendors in a timely manner or on terms commercially reasonable to us given, among other reasons, the scope of responsibilities undertaken by some of our service providers, the depth of their experience and their familiarity with our operations generally.
if we change a significant vendor, an existing service provider makes significant changes to the way it conducts its operations, or is acquired, or we seek to bring in-house certain services performed today by third parties, we may experience unexpected disruptions in the provision of our solutions and increased expenses, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, profitability, and financial results. furthermore, certain third-party service providers or vendors may have access to sensitive data including personal information, valuable intellectual property and other proprietary or confidential data, including that provided to us by our clients. it is possible that a third-party vendor could intentionally or inadvertently disclose sensitive data including personal information, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results and damage our reputation.
we rely on the united states postal service ("usps") and other third-party carriers to deliver communications and changes in our relationships with these carriers or an increase in postal rates or shipping costs may adversely impact demand for our products and services and could have an adverse impact on our business and results of operations.
we rely upon the usps and third-party carriers, including the united parcel service, for timely delivery of communications on behalf of our clients. as a result, we are subject to carrier disruptions due to factors that are beyond our control, including employee strikes, inclement weather, and increased fuel costs. any failure to deliver communications to or on behalf of our clients in a timely and accurate manner may damage our reputation and brand and could cause us to lose clients. in addition, the usps has incurred significant financial losses in recent years and may, as a result, implement significant changes to the breadth or frequency of its mail delivery, causing disruptions in the service. if our relationship with any of these third-party carriers is terminated or impaired, or if any of these third parties are unable to distribute communications, we would be required to use alternative, and possibly more expensive, carriers to complete our distributions on behalf of our clients. we may be unable to engage alternative carriers on a timely basis or on acceptable terms, if at all, which could have an adverse effect on our business. in addition, future increases in postal rates or shipping costs, as well as changes in customer preferences, may result in decreased demand for our traditional printed and mailed communications resulting in an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
in the event of a disaster, our disaster recovery and business continuity plans may fail, which could result in the loss of client data and adversely interrupt operations.
our operations are dependent on our ability to protect our infrastructure against damage from catastrophe, natural disaster, or severe weather, as well as events resulting from unauthorized security breach, power loss, telecommunications failure, terrorist attack, pandemic, or other events that could have a significant disruptive effect on our operations. we have disaster recovery and business continuity plans in place in the event of system failure due to any of these events and we test our plans regularly. in addition, our data center services provider also has disaster recovery plans and procedures in place. however, we cannot be certain that our plans, or those of our data center services provider, will be successful in the event of a disaster. if our disaster recovery or business continuity plans are unsuccessful in a disaster recovery scenario, we could potentially lose client data or experience material adverse interruptions to our operations or delivery of services to our clients, and we could be liable to parties who are financially harmed by those failures. in addition, such failures could cause us to lose revenues, lose clients or damage our reputation.
any slowdown or failure of our computer or communications systems could impact our ability to provide services to our clients and support our internal operations and could subject us to liability for losses suffered by our clients or their customers.
our services depend on our ability to store, retrieve, process, and manage significant databases, and to receive and process transactions and investor communications through a variety of electronic systems. our systems, those of our data center and cloud services providers, or any other systems with which our systems interact could slow down significantly or fail for a variety of reasons, including:
•malware or undetected errors in internal software programs or computer systems;
•direct or indirect hacking or denial of service cybersecurity attacks;
•inability to rapidly monitor all system activity;
•inability to effectively resolve any errors in internal software programs or computer systems once they are detected;
•failure to maintain adequate operational systems and infrastructure;
•heavy stress placed on systems during peak times or due to high volumes or volatility; or
while we monitor system loads and performance and implement system upgrades to handle predicted increases in trading volume and volatility, we may not be able to predict future volume increases or volatility accurately or that our systems and those of our data center services and cloud services providers will be able to accommodate these volume increases or volatility without failure or degradation. in addition, we may not be able to prevent cybersecurity attacks on our systems.
moreover, because we have outsourced our data center operations and use third-party cloud services providers for storage of certain data, the operation, performance and security functions of the data center and the cloud system involve factors beyond our control, and we cannot guarantee that our third-party providers will be able to provide their services at a satisfactory level. any significant degradation or failure of our or our third-party providers' computer systems, communications systems or any other systems in the performance of our services could cause our clients or their customers to suffer delays in their receipt of our services. these delays could cause substantial losses for our clients or their customers, and we could be liable to parties who are financially harmed by those failures. in addition, such failures could cause us to lose revenues, lose clients or damage our reputation.
the inability to properly perform our services or operational errors in the performance of our services could lead to liability for claims, client loss and result in reputational damage.
the inability or the failure to properly perform our services could result in our clients and/or certain of our subsidiaries that operate regulated businesses being subjected to losses including censures, fines, or other sanctions by applicable regulatory authorities, and we could be liable to parties who are financially harmed by those errors. in addition, the inability to properly perform our services or errors in the performance of our services could result in a decline in confidence in our products and services and cause us to incur expenses including service penalties, lose revenues, lose clients or damage our reputation.
global economic and political conditions, including global health crises and geopolitical instability, broad trends in business and finance that are beyond our control have had and may have a material impact on our business operations and those of our clients and contribute to reduced levels of activity in the securities markets, which could adversely impact our business and results of operations.
as a multinational company, our operations and our ability to deliver our services to our clients could be adversely impacted by general global economic and political conditions. our business is highly dependent on the global financial services industry and exchanges and market centers around the world. also, in recent years, we have expanded our operations, entered strategic alliances, and acquired businesses outside the u.s. compliance with foreign and u.s. laws and regulations that are applicable to our international operations could cause us to incur higher than anticipated costs, and inadequate enforcement of laws or policies such as those protecting intellectual property, could affect our business and the company's overall results of operations.
these factors may include:
•economic, political and market conditions;
•legislative and regulatory changes;
•social and health conditions, including widespread outbreak of an illness or pandemic such as the covid-19 pandemic;
•acts of war or terrorism and international conflict, such as the conflict between russia and ukraine;
•extreme or unusual weather patterns caused by climate change;
•the availability of short-term and long-term funding and capital;
•the level and volatility of interest rates;
•financial well-being of our clients; and
•taxation levels affecting securities transactions.
these factors are beyond our control and may negatively impact our ability to perform our services or the demand for our services or may increase our costs resulting in an adverse impact on our business and results of operations. for example, our services are impacted by the number of unique securities positions held by investors through our clients, the level of investor communications activity we process on behalf of our clients, trading volumes, market prices, and liquidity of the securities markets, which are in turn affected by general national and international economic and political conditions, and broad trends in business and finance that could result in changes in participation and activity in the securities markets. accordingly, any significant reduction in participation and activity in the securities markets would likely adversely impact our business and results of operations.
if the operational systems and infrastructure that we depend on fail to keep pace with our growth, we may experience operating inefficiencies, client dissatisfaction and lost revenue opportunities.
the growth of our business and expansion of our client base may place a strain on our management and operations. we believe that our current and anticipated future growth will require the implementation of new and enhanced communications and information systems, the training of personnel to operate these systems, and the expansion and upgrade of core technologies. while many of our systems are designed to accommodate additional growth without redesign or replacement, we may nevertheless need to make significant investments in additional hardware and software to accommodate growth, which may impact our profitability and business operations. in addition, we may not be able to predict the timing or rate of this growth accurately or expand and upgrade our systems and infrastructure on a timely basis.
our growth has required and will continue to require increased investments in management personnel and systems, financial systems and controls, and office facilities. we cannot assure you that we will be able to manage or continue to manage our future growth successfully. if we fail to manage our growth, we may experience operating inefficiencies, dissatisfaction among our client base, and lost revenue opportunities.
if we are unable to respond to the demands of our existing and new clients, or adapt to technological changes or advances, our business and future growth could be impacted.
the global financial services industry is characterized by increasingly complex and integrated infrastructures and products, new and changing business models and rapid technological and regulatory changes. our clients' needs and demands for our products and services evolve with these changes. our future success will depend, in part, on our ability to respond to our clients' demands for new services, capabilities and technologies on a timely and cost-effective basis. we also need to adapt to technological advancements such as artificial intelligence, machine learning, quantum computing, digital and distributed ledger and cloud computing and keep pace with changing regulatory standards to address our clients' increasingly sophisticated requirements. transitioning to these new technologies may require close coordination with our clients, be disruptive to our resources and the services we provide and may increase our reliance on third-party service providers such as our cloud services provider.
in addition, we run the risk of disintermediation due to emerging technologies, fintech start-ups and new market entrants. if we fail to adapt or keep pace with new technologies in a timely manner, it could harm our ability to compete, decrease the value of our products and services to our clients, and harm our business and impact our future growth.
intense competition could negatively affect our ability to maintain or increase our business, financial condition, and results of operations.
the markets for our products and services continue to evolve and are highly competitive. we compete with a number of firms that provide similar products and services. in addition, our securities processing solutions compete with our clients' in-house capabilities to perform comparable functions. our competitors may be able to respond more quickly to new or changing opportunities, technologies, and client requirements and may be able to undertake more extensive promotional activities, offer more attractive terms to clients and adopt more aggressive pricing policies than we will be able to offer or adopt. in addition, we expect that the markets in which we compete will continue to attract new competitors and new technologies. there can be no assurances that we will be able to compete effectively with current or future competitors. if we fail to compete effectively, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be materially harmed.
our continued success depends on our ability to attract and retain key personnel such as our senior management and other qualified personnel including highly skilled technical employees to conduct our business. skilled and experienced personnel in the areas where we compete are in high demand, and competition for their talents is intense. there can be no assurance that we will be successful in our efforts to recruit and retain the required key personnel. if we are unable to attract and retain qualified individuals or our recruiting and retention costs increase significantly, our operations and financial results could be materially adversely affected.
the inability to identify, obtain, retain, enforce and protect important intellectual property rights could harm our business.
third parties may infringe or misappropriate our intellectual property, which includes a combination of patents, trademarks, service marks, copyrights, domain names and trade secrets. our inability to protect our intellectual property and marks could adversely affect our business. in an effort to protect our intellectual property, we enter into confidentiality and invention assignment agreements with our employees, consultants and other third parties, and control access to our services, software and proprietary information. moreover, we license or acquire technology that we incorporate into our services and products. additional actions may be required to protect our intellectual property, including legal action, which could be time consuming and expensive and may negatively impact our business, financial condition, and results of operations.
despite our efforts to identify, obtain, retain, enforce and protect our intellectual property rights and proprietary information, we cannot be certain that they will be effective or sufficient to prevent the unauthorized access, use, copying, theft or the reverse engineering of our intellectual property and proprietary information for a variety of reasons, including: (a) our inability to detect misappropriation by third parties of our intellectual property; (b) disparate legal protections for intellectual property across different countries; (c) constantly evolving intellectual property legal standards as to the scope of protection, validity, non-infringement, enforceability and infringement defenses; (d) failure to maintain appropriate contractual restrictions and other measures to protect our know- how and trade secrets, or contract breaches by others; (e) failure to identify and obtain patents on patentable innovations; (f) potential invalidation, unenforceability, scope narrowing, dilution and opposition, through litigation and administrative processes both in the u.s. and abroad, of our intellectual property rights; and (g) other business or resource limitations on intellectual property enforcement against third parties.
our products and services, and the products and services provided to us by third parties, may infringe upon intellectual property rights of third parties, and any infringement claims, whether initiated by or against us, could require us to incur substantial costs, distract our management, or prevent us from conducting our business.
costly, complex, time-consuming and unpredictable litigation may be necessary to enforce our intellectual property rights, or challenge the purported validity or scope of third-party intellectual property. further, although we attempt to avoid infringing upon known proprietary rights of third parties, we are subject to the risk of claims alleging infringement of third-party proprietary rights. all intellectual property litigations, even baseless claims, result in significant expense and diversion of resources, our management and time. any adverse outcome in an intellectual property litigation could prevent us from selling our products or services or require us to license the technology of others on unfavorable terms, which may materially and adversely affect our brand, business, operations and financial condition. additionally, third parties that provide us with products or services that are integral to the conduct of our business may also be subject to similar infringement allegations from others, which could prevent such third parties from continuing to provide these products or services to us. as a result, we may need to undertake work-arounds or substantial reengineering of our products or services in order to continue offering them, and we may not succeed in doing so. furthermore, a party asserting such an infringement claim could secure a judgment against us that requires us to pay substantial damages, grant such party injunctive relief, or grant other court ordered remedies that could prevent us from conducting our business.
we use third-party open source software in our products and services. though we have a policy, review board, and review process in place governing the use of open source software, there is a risk that we incorporate into our products and services open source software with onerous licensing terms that purportedly require us to make the source code of our proprietary code, combined with such open source software, available under such license. furthermore, u.s. courts have not interpreted the terms of various open source licenses, but could interpret them in a manner that imposes unanticipated conditions or restrictions on our products and services. usage of open source software can lead to greater risks than use of third-party commercial software, given that licensors generally disclaim all warranties on their open source software, and hackers frequently exploit vulnerabilities in open source software. any use of open source software inconsistent with its license or our policy could harm our business, operations and financial position.
acquisitions and integrating such acquisitions create certain risks and may affect operating results.
as part of our overall business strategy, we may make acquisitions and strategic investments in companies, technologies or products, or enter joint ventures. in fact, over the last three fiscal years we have completed 4 acquisitions and made strategic investments in seven firms. these transactions and the integration of acquisitions involve a number of risks. the core risks are in the areas of:
•valuation: finding suitable businesses to acquire at affordable valuations or on other acceptable terms; competition for acquisitions from other potential acquirors, and negotiating a fair price for the business based on inherently limited due diligence reviews;
•integration: managing the complex process of integrating the acquired company's people, products, technology, and other assets, and converting their financial, information security, privacy and other systems and controls to meet our standards, so as to achieve intended strategic objectives and realize the projected value, synergies and other benefits in connection with the acquisition; and
•legacy issues: protecting against actions, claims, regulatory investigations, losses, and other liabilities related to the predecessor business.
also, the process of integrating these businesses may be difficult and expensive, disrupt our business and divert our resources. these risks may arise for a number of reasons including, for example:
•incurring unforeseen obligations or liabilities in connection with such acquisitions;
•devoting unanticipated financial and management resources to an acquired business;
•borrowing money from lenders or selling equity or debt securities to the public to finance future acquisitions on terms that may be adverse to us;
•additional debt incurred to finance an acquisition could impact our liquidity and may cause a credit downgrade;
•loss of clients of the acquired business;
•entering markets where we have minimal prior experience; and
•experiencing decreases in earnings as a result of non-cash impairment charges.
in addition, international acquisitions, such as our 2021 acquisition of itiviti, often involve additional or increased risks including, for example:
•geographically separated organizations, systems, and facilities;
•integrating personnel with diverse business backgrounds and organizational cultures;
•general economic and political conditions.
our existing and future debt levels, and compliance with our debt service obligations, could have a negative impact on our financing options and liquidity position, which could adversely affect our business.
as of june 30, 2023, we had $3,413.3 million in aggregate principal amount of total debt. additionally, our revolving credit facility has a remaining borrowing capacity of $1,500.0 million as of june 30, 2023. our overall leverage and the terms of our financing arrangements could:
•limit our ability to obtain additional financing in the future for working capital, capital expenditures or acquisitions, to fund growth or for general corporate purposes, even when necessary to maintain adequate liquidity;
•make it more difficult for us to satisfy the terms of our debt obligations;
•limit our flexibility to plan for and to adjust to changing business and market conditions and implement business strategies;
•require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to make interest and principal payments on our debt, thereby limiting the availability of our cash flow to fund future investments, capital expenditures, working capital, business activities and other general corporate requirements; and
•increase our vulnerability to adverse economic or industry conditions.
our liquidity position may be negatively affected by changes in general economic conditions, regulatory requirements and access to the capital markets, which may be limited if we were to fail to renew any of the credit facilities on their renewal dates or if we were to fail to meet certain ratios. our ability to meet expenses and debt service obligations will depend on our future performance, which could be affected by financial, business, economic and other factors. if we are not able to pay our debt service obligations or comply with the financial or other restrictive covenants contained in the indenture governing our senior notes, or our credit facility, we may be required to immediately repay or refinance all or part of our debt, sell assets, borrow additional funds or raise additional equity capital, which could also result in a credit rating downgrade. in addition, if the credit ratings of our outstanding indebtedness are downgraded, or if rating agencies indicate that a downgrade may occur, our business, financial position, and results of operations could be adversely affected, and perceptions of our financial strength could be damaged. a downgrade would also have the effect of increasing our borrowing costs and could decrease the availability of funds we are able to borrow, adversely affecting our business, financial position, and results of operations. further, a downgrade could adversely affect our relationships with our clients.
we may incur non-cash impairment charges in the future associated with our portfolio of intangible assets, including goodwill.
as a result of past acquisitions, we carry a significant goodwill and other acquired intangible assets on our balance sheet. in addition, we also defer certain costs to onboard a client or convert a client's systems to function with our technology. goodwill, intangible assets, net, and deferred client conversion and start-up costs accounted for approximately 71% of the total assets on our balance sheet as of june 30, 2023. we test goodwill for impairment annually as of march 31st and we test goodwill, intangible assets, net, and deferred client conversion and start-up costs for impairment at other times if events have occurred or circumstances exist that indicate the carrying value of such assets may no longer be recoverable. it is possible we may incur impairment charges in the future, particularly in the event of a prolonged economic recession or loss of a key client or clients. a significant non-cash impairment could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.
certain of our services may be exposed to risk from our counterparties and third parties.
our mutual fund and exchange-traded fund processing services and our transfer agency services involve the settlement of transactions on behalf of our clients and third parties. with these activities, we may be exposed to risk in the event our clients, or broker-dealers, banks, clearing organizations, or depositories are unable to fulfill contractual obligations. failure to settle a transaction may affect our ability to conduct these services or may reduce their profitability as a result of the reputational risk associated with failure to settle.

description of the company and business segments broadridge, a delaware corporation and a part of the s&p 500® index, is a global financial technology leader providing investor communications and technology-driven solutions to banks, broker-dealers, asset and wealth managers, public companies, investors and mutual funds. our services include investor communications, securities processing, data and analytics, and customer communications solutions. with over 60 years of experience, including over 15 years as an independent public company, we provide integrated solutions and an important infrastructure that powers the financial services industry. our solutions enable better financial lives by powering investing, governance and communications and help reduce the need for our clients to make significant capital investments in operations infrastructure, thereby allowing them to increase their focus on core business activities. our businesses operate in two reportable segments: investor communication solutions and global technology and operations.
acquisitions assets acquired and liabilities assumed in business combinations are recorded on the company's consolidated balance sheets as of the respective acquisition date based upon the estimated fair values at such date. the results of operations of the business acquired by the company are included in the company's consolidated statements of earnings since the respective date of acquisition. the excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair values of the underlying assets acquired and liabilities assumed is allocated to goodwill.
basis of presentation the consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with u.s. generally accepted accounting principles ("gaap") and in accordance with the sec requirements for annual reports on form 10-k. these financial statements present the consolidated position of the company and include the entities in which the company directly or indirectly has a controlling financial interest as well as various entities in which the company has investments recorded under the equity method of accounting as well as certain marketable and non-marketable securities. intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated. amounts presented may not sum due to rounding. certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation where applicable.
in presenting the consolidated financial statements, management makes estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported and related disclosures. management continually evaluates the accounting policies and estimates used to prepare the consolidated financial statements. the estimates, by their nature, are based on judgment, available information, and historical experience and are believed to be reasonable. however, actual amounts and results could differ from those estimates made by management. in management's opinion, the consolidated financial statements contain all normal recurring adjustments necessary for a fair presentation of results reported. the results of operations reported for the periods presented are not necessarily indicative of the results of operations for subsequent periods.
beginning with the first quarter of fiscal year 2023, the company changed reporting for segment revenues, segment earnings (loss) before income taxes, and segment amortization of acquired intangibles and purchased intellectual property to reflect the impact of actual foreign exchange rates applicable to the individual periods presented. the presentation of these metrics for the prior periods provided in this form 10-k has been changed to conform to the current period presentation. total consolidated revenues and earnings before income taxes were not impacted. please refer to note 3, "revenue recognition" and note 21, "financial data by segment" to our consolidated financial statements under item 8 of part ii of this annual report on form 10-k.
seasonality processing and distributing proxy materials and annual reports to investors comprises a large portion of our investor communication solutions business. we process and distribute the greatest number of proxy materials and annual reports during our third and fourth fiscal quarters. the recurring periodic activity of this business is linked to significant filing deadlines imposed by law on public reporting companies. this has caused our revenues, operating income, net earnings, and cash flows from operating activities to be higher in our third and fourth fiscal quarters. the seasonality of our revenues makes it difficult to estimate future operating results based on the results of any specific fiscal quarter and could affect an investor's ability to compare our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows on a fiscal quarter-by-quarter basis.
critical accounting estimates we continually evaluate the accounting policies and estimates used to prepare the consolidated financial statements. the estimates, by their nature, are based on judgment, available information, and historical experience and are believed to be reasonable. however, actual amounts and results could differ from these estimates made by management. certain accounting policies that require significant management estimates and are deemed critical to our results of operations or financial position are discussed below.
goodwill. we review the carrying value of all our goodwill by comparing the carrying value of our reporting units to their fair values. we are required to perform this comparison at least annually or more frequently if circumstances indicate a possible impairment. when determining fair value of a reporting unit, we utilize the income approach which considers a discounted future cash flow analysis using various assumptions, including projections of revenues based on assumed long-term growth rates, estimated costs and appropriate discount rates based on the particular reporting unit's weighted-average cost of capital. the principal factors used in the discounted cash flow analysis requiring judgment are the projected future operating cash flows based on forecasted earnings before interest and taxes, and the selection of the terminal value growth rate and discount rate assumptions. the weighted-average cost of capital takes into account the relative weight of each component of our consolidated capital structure (equity and long-term debt). our estimates of long-term growth and costs are based on historical data, various internal estimates and a variety of external sources, and are developed as part of our routine, long-range planning process. changes in economic and operating conditions impacting these assumptions could result in goodwill impairments in future periods. if the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss shall be recognized in an amount equal to that excess, not to exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. we had $3,461.6 million of goodwill as of june 30, 2023. given the significance of our goodwill, an adverse change to the fair value of one of our reporting units could result in an impairment charge, which could be material to our earnings.
the company performs a sensitivity analysis under the goodwill impairment test assuming hypothetical reductions in the fair values of our reporting units. a 10% change in our estimates of projected future operating cash flows, discount rates, or terminal value growth rates used in our calculations of the fair values of the reporting units would not result in an impairment of our goodwill.
income taxes. the objectives of accounting for income taxes are to recognize the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in an entity's financial statements or tax returns. judgment is required in addressing the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our consolidated financial statements or tax returns (e.g., realization of deferred tax assets, changes in tax laws or interpretations thereof). the company is subject to regular examination of its income tax returns by the u.s. federal, state and foreign tax authorities. a change in the assessment of the outcomes of such matters could materially impact our consolidated financial statements. the company has estimated foreign net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $45.1 million as of june 30, 2023 of which $7.6 million are subject to expiration in the june 30, 2026 through june 30, 2042 period. the remaining $37.5 million of carryforwards has an indefinite utilization period. in addition, the company has estimated u.s. federal net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $35.3 million of which $15.5 million are subject to expiration in the june 30, 2024 through june 30, 2037 period with the balance of $19.8 million having an indefinite utilization period. u.s. federal net operating loss carryforwards resulting from tax losses beginning with the fiscal year ended june 30, 2019 have an indefinite carryforward under the u.s. tax cuts and jobs act (the "tax act"). the company did not generate federal net operating losses for the fiscal year ended june 30, 2023.
valuation allowances are recognized to reduce deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that the company will not be able to utilize the deferred tax assets of certain subsidiaries to offset future taxable earnings. the company has recorded valuation allowances of $10.3 million and $10.7 million at june 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively. the determination as to whether a deferred tax asset will be recognized is made on a jurisdictional basis and is based on the evaluation of historical taxable income or loss, projected future taxable income, carryforward periods, scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities and tax planning strategies. projected future taxable income is based on expected results and assumptions as to the jurisdiction in which the income will be earned. the assumptions used to project future taxable income requires significant judgment and are consistent with the plans and estimates used to manage the underlying businesses.
share-based payments. accounting for stock-based compensation requires the measurement of stock-based compensation expense based on the fair value of the award on the date of grant. we determine the fair value of stock options issued by using a binomial option-pricing model. the binomial option-pricing model considers a range of assumptions related to volatility, dividend yield, risk-free interest rate and employee exercise behavior. expected volatilities utilized in the binomial option-pricing model are based on a combination of implied market volatilities, historical volatility of our stock price and other factors. similarly, the dividend yield is based on historical experience and expected future changes. the risk-free rate is derived from the u.s. treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant. the binomial option-pricing model also incorporates exercise and forfeiture assumptions based on an analysis of historical data. the expected life of the stock option grants is derived from the output of the binomial model and represents the period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding. determining these assumptions are subjective and complex, and therefore, a change in the assumptions utilized could impact the calculation of the fair value of our stock options. a hypothetical change of five percentage points applied to the volatility assumption used to determine the fair value of the fiscal year 2023 stock option grants would result in an approximate $3.1 million change in total pre-tax stock-based compensation expense for the fiscal year 2023 grants, which would be amortized over the vesting period. a hypothetical change of one year in the expected life assumption used to determine the fair value of the fiscal year 2023 stock option grants would result in an approximate $1.7 million change in the total pre-tax stock-based compensation expense for the fiscal year 2023 grants, which would be amortized over the vesting period. a hypothetical change of one percentage point in the forfeiture rate assumption used for the fiscal year 2023 stock option grants would result in an approximate $0.2 million change in the total pre-tax stock-based compensation expense for the fiscal year 2023 grants, which would be amortized over the vesting period. a hypothetical one-half percentage point change in the dividend yield assumption used to determine the fair value of the fiscal year 2023 stock option grants would result in an approximate $1.4 million change in the total pre-tax stock-based compensation expense for the fiscal year 2023 grants, which would be amortized over the vesting period.
key performance indicators management focuses on a variety of key indicators to plan, measure and evaluate the company's business and financial performance. these performance indicators include revenue and recurring revenue as well as not generally accepted accounting principles measures ("non-gaap") of adjusted operating income, adjusted net earnings, adjusted earnings per share, free cash flow, recurring revenue growth constant currency, and closed sales. in addition, management focuses on select operating metrics specific to broadridge of record growth and internal trade growth, as defined below.
refer to the section "explanation and reconciliation of the company's use of non-gaap financial measures" for a reconciliation of adjusted operating income, adjusted net earnings, adjusted earnings per share, free cash flow, and recurring revenue growth constant currency to the most directly comparable gaap measures, and an explanation for why these non-gaap metrics provide useful information to investors and how management uses these non-gaap metrics for operational and financial decision-making. refer to the section "results of operations" for a description of closed sales and an explanation of why closed sales is a useful performance metric for management and investors.
revenues revenues are primarily generated from fees for processing and distributing investor communications and fees for technology-enabled services and solutions. the company monitors revenue in each of our two reportable segments as a key measure of success in addressing our clients' needs. revenues from fees are derived from both recurring and event-driven activity. the level of recurring and event-driven activity the company processes directly impacts distribution revenues. while event-driven activity is highly repeatable, it may not recur on an annual basis. event-driven revenues are based on the number of special events and corporate transactions the company processes. event-driven activity is impacted by financial market conditions and changes in regulatory compliance requirements, resulting in fluctuations in the timing and levels of event-driven revenues. distribution revenues primarily include revenues related to the physical mailing of proxy materials, interim communications, transaction reporting, customer communications and fulfillment services as well as broadridge retirement and workplace administrative services.
recurring revenue growth represents the company's total annual revenue growth, less growth from event-driven and distribution revenues. we distinguish recurring revenue growth between organic and acquired:
•organic - we define organic revenue as the recurring revenue generated from net new business and internal growth.
•acquired - we define acquired revenue as the recurring revenue generated from acquired services in the first twelve months following the date of acquisition. this type of growth comes as a result of our strategy to purchase, integrate, and leverage the value of assets we acquire.
revenues and recurring revenue are useful metrics for investors in understanding how management measures and evaluates the company's ongoing operational performance. see "results of operations" as well as note 2, "summary of significant accounting policies" and note 3, "revenue recognition" to our consolidated financial statements under item 8 of part ii of this annual report on form 10-k.
record growth and internal trade growth the company uses select operating metrics specific to broadridge of record growth and internal trade growth in evaluating its business results and identifying trends affecting its business. record growth is comprised of stock record growth and interim record growth. stock record growth (also referred to as "srg" or "equity position growth") measures the estimated annual change in positions eligible for equity proxy materials. interim record growth (also referred to as "irg" or "mutual fund/etf position growth") measures the estimated change in mutual fund and exchange traded fund positions eligible for interim communications. these metrics are calculated from equity proxy and mutual fund/etf position data reported to broadridge for the same issuers or funds in both the current and prior year periods.
internal trade growth represents the estimated change in daily average trade volumes for broadridge securities processing clients whose contracts are linked to trade volumes and who were on broadridge's trading platforms in both the current and prior year periods. record growth and internal trade growth are useful non-financial metrics for investors in understanding how management measures and evaluates broadridge's ongoing operational performance within its investor communication solutions and global technology and operations reportable segments, respectively.
the key performance indicators for the fiscal years ended june 30, 2023, and 2022, are as follows:
select operating metrics years ended june 30,
record growth equity positions (stock records)                            9    %                       18    %
internal trade growth                                       4    %                        1    %
results of operations the following discussions of analysis of consolidated statements of earnings and analysis of reportable segments refer to the fiscal year ended june 30, 2023 compared to the fiscal year ended june 30, 2022. the analysis of consolidated statements of earnings should be read in conjunction with the analysis of reportable segments, which provides a more detailed discussion concerning certain components of the consolidated statements of earnings. discussions of analysis of consolidated statements of earnings and analysis of reportable segments for the fiscal year ended june 30, 2022 compared to the fiscal year ended june 30, 2021 is disclosed in part ii, "item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations" of the 2022 annual report.
the following references are utilized in the discussions of analysis of consolidated statements of earnings and analysis of reportable segments:
"amortization of acquired intangibles and purchased intellectual property" and "acquisition and integration costs" represent certain non-cash amortization expenses associated with acquired intangible assets and purchased intellectual property assets, as well as certain transaction and integration costs associated with the company's acquisition activities, respectively.
"investment gains" represent non-operating, non-cash gains on privately held investments.
"real estate realignment and covid-19 related expenses" are comprised of two major components: real estate realignment expenses, and covid-19 related expenses. real estate realignment expenses are expenses associated with the exit of certain of the company's leased facilities in response to the covid-19 pandemic, which consist of the impairment of certain right of use assets, leasehold improvements and equipment, as well as other related facility exit expenses directly resulting from, and attributable to, the exit of these leased facilities. covid-19 related expenses are direct and incremental expenses incurred by the company to protect the health and safety of broadridge associates during the covid-19 outbreak, including expenses associated with monitoring the temperatures for associates entering our facilities, enhancing the safety of our office environment in preparation for workers to return to company facilities on a more regular basis, ensuring proper social distancing in our production facilities, personal protective equipment, enhanced cleaning measures in our facilities, and other safety related expenses.
"restructuring charges" represent severance costs associated with the company's initiative to streamline our management structure, reallocate work to lower cost locations, and reduce headcount in deprioritized areas.
"russia-related exit costs" are direct and incremental costs associated with the company's wind down of business activities in russia in response to russia's invasion of ukraine, including relocation-related expenses of impacted associates.
"net new business" refers to recurring revenue from closed sales for the initial twelve-month contract period after which the client goes live with the company's service(s), less recurring revenue from client losses.
"internal growth" is a component of recurring revenue and generally reflects year over year changes in existing services to our existing customers' multi-year contracts beyond the initial twelve-month period in which it was included in net new business.
"recurring revenue growth constant currency" refers to our recurring revenue growth presented on a constant currency basis to exclude the impact of foreign currency exchange fluctuations.
revenues in the investor communication solutions segment are derived from both recurring and event-driven activity, in addition to distribution revenues. the level of recurring and event-driven activity we process directly impacts revenues. while event-driven activity is highly repeatable, it may not recur on an annual basis. the types of services we provide that comprise event-driven activity are:
•mutual fund proxy: the proxy and related services we provide to mutual funds when certain events occur requiring a shareholder vote including changes in directors, sub-advisors, fee structures, investment restrictions, and mergers of funds.
•mutual fund communications: mutual fund communications services consist primarily of the distribution on behalf of mutual funds of supplemental information required to be provided to the annual mutual fund prospectus as a result of certain triggering events such as a change in portfolio managers. in addition, mutual fund communications consist of notices and marketing materials such as newsletters.
•equity proxy contests and specials, corporate actions, and other: the proxy services we provide in connection with shareholder meetings driven by special events such as proxy contests, mergers and acquisitions, and tender/exchange offers.
event-driven revenues are based on the number of special events and corporate transactions we process. event-driven activity is impacted by financial market conditions and changes in regulatory compliance requirements, resulting in fluctuations in the timing and levels of event-driven revenues. as such, the timing and level of event-driven activity and its potential impact on revenues and earnings are difficult to forecast.
generally, mutual fund proxy activity has been subject to a greater level of volatility than the other components of event-driven activity. during fiscal year 2023, mutual fund proxy revenues were 51% lower than the prior fiscal year. during fiscal year 2022, mutual fund proxy revenues were 57% greater than the prior fiscal year. although it is difficult to forecast the levels of event-driven activity, we expect that the portion of revenues derived from mutual fund proxy activity may continue to experience volatility in the future.
distribution revenues primarily include revenues related to the physical mailing of proxy materials, interim communications, transaction reporting, customer communications and fulfillment services, as well as broadridge retirement and workplace administrative services.
distribution cost of revenues consists primarily of postage-related expenses incurred in connection with our investor communication solutions segment, as well as broadridge retirement and workplace administrative services expenses. these costs are reflected in cost of revenues.
closed sales represent an estimate of the expected annual recurring revenue for new client contracts that were signed by broadridge in the current reporting period. closed sales does not include event-driven or distribution activity. we consider contract terms, expected client volumes or activity, knowledge of the marketplace and experience with our clients, among other factors, when determining the estimate. management uses closed sales to measure the effectiveness of our sales and marketing programs, as an indicator of expected future revenues and as a performance metric in determining incentive compensation.
closed sales is not a measure of financial performance under gaap, and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for revenue or other income statement data prepared in accordance with gaap. closed sales is a useful metric for investors in understanding how management measures and evaluates our ongoing operational performance.
the inherent variability of transaction volumes and activity levels can result in some variability of amounts reported as actual achieved closed sales. larger closed sales can take up to 12 to 24 months or longer to convert to revenues, particularly for the services provided by our global technology and operations segment. for the fiscal years ended june 30, 2023 and june 30, 2022, we reported closed sales net of a 5.0% allowance adjustment. consequently, our reported closed sales amounts will not be adjusted for actual revenues achieved because these adjustments are estimated in the period the sale is reported. we assess this allowance amount at the end of each fiscal year to establish the appropriate allowance for the subsequent year using the trailing five years actual data as the starting point, normalized for outlying factors, if any, to enhance the accuracy of the allowance.
for the fiscal years ended june 30, 2023 and 2022, closed sales were $245.8 million and $279.5 million, respectively. the fiscal years ended june 30, 2023 and 2022, are net of an allowance adjustment of $12.9 million and $14.8 million, respectively.
recent developments new sec rule on tailored shareholder reports on october 26, 2022, the sec adopted a rule modifying mutual fund and exchange-traded fund investor communications. the sec rule requires that shorter summary documents, referred to as tailored shareholder reports, be distributed in lieu of long-form annual and semi-annual fund reports or notices of the availability of such reports, which the sec had permitted under rule 30e-3. the rule went into effect on january 24, 2023 and includes an 18-month transition period for implementation by mutual funds and exchange-traded funds, with a final compliance date of july 24, 2024. we are reviewing the full impact of the new rule, however we currently estimate a reduction in our annual recurring revenues of approximately $30 million phasing in over fiscal years 2025 and 2026, assuming no offset from new services. see the risk factor titled "our clients are subject to complex laws and regulations, and new laws or regulations and/or changes to existing laws or regulations could impact our clients and, in turn, adversely impact our business or may reduce our profitability." in part i, item 1a. "risk factors" in this annual report.
conflict in ukraine we are monitoring the events related to russia's invasion of ukraine and have been actively managing any exposure we may have through a cross-functional taskforce that includes members of our senior management. we have historically had a limited presence in russia, and we have no presence in ukraine. we do not store any client data in russia. prior to the conflict, we had approximately 280 associates in st. petersburg, russia who provided software development and support services for several of our gto products, less than 2% of our total associates. as of june 30, 2023, we do not have any associates remaining in russia. we have historically provided services to a very small number of russian entities and subsidiaries of russian entities. the revenues from those services represented less than 0.1% of our total revenues in fiscal year 2022 and 2023 and our outstanding accounts receivable from these entities is de minimis. we are in the process of terminating and winding down these relationships and have closed our operations in russia. we have moved the services provided in russia to other locations in europe and asia. we are monitoring and believe we are in compliance with all global sanctions arising out of russia's invasion of ukraine. we have taken actions to enhance our information security defenses in response to the ukraine conflict. at present, we do not expect the ukraine conflict and the actions we are taking in response to have a material impact on our core operations or financial results.
analysis of consolidated statements of earnings fiscal year 2023 compared to fiscal year 2022
the table below presents consolidated statements of earnings data for the fiscal years ended june 30, 2023 and 2022, and the dollar and percentage changes between periods:

•recurring revenues increased $264.0 million, or 7%, to $3,986.7 million. recurring revenue growth constant currency (non-gaap) was 9%, all organic, driven by net new business growth and internal growth in both ics and gto.
•event-driven revenues decreased $58.3 million, or 22%, primarily due to the decrease in volume of mutual fund proxy communications.
•distribution revenues increased $146.2 million, or 9%, driven by the impact of postage rate increases of $120.8 million and the impact of modestly higher mail volumes, primarily in customer communications solutions.
total operating expenses. operating expenses increased $175.3 million, or 4%, to $5,124.5 million from $4,949.2 million primarily as a result of the increase in cost of revenues:
•cost of revenues - the increase of $158.6 million in cost of revenues primarily reflects the impact of higher postage and distribution expenses in our investor communication solutions segment of $169.4 million, offset by lower acquisition amortization of $35.8 million.
•selling, general and administrative expenses - the increase of $16.7 million in selling, general, and administrative expenses primarily reflects higher compensation expenses of $21.8 million and higher technology related expenses of $4.3 million, offset by lower external labor costs.
interest expense, net. interest expense, net, was $135.5 million, an increase of $50.9 million from $84.7 million in the fiscal year ended june 30, 2022 primarily due to an increase in interest expense from higher borrowing costs.
other non-operating income (expenses), net. other non-operating expense, net for the fiscal year ended june 30, 2023 was $6.0 million, compared to $3.0 million of other non-operating expense, net for the fiscal year ended june 30, 2022. the increased expense was primarily due to higher net gains on investments in the prior year period.
the increase in the effective tax rate for the fiscal year ended june 30, 2023 compared to the fiscal year ended june 30, 2022 was driven by the lower excess tax benefit related to equity compensation as compared to the prior year.
analysis of reportable segments broadridge has two reportable segments: (1) investor communication solutions and (2) global technology and operations.
the primary component of "other" are certain gains, losses, corporate overhead expenses and non-operating expenses that have not been allocated to the reportable segments, such as interest expense.
certain corporate expenses, as well as certain centrally managed expenses, are allocated based upon budgeted amounts in a reasonable manner. because the company compensates the management of its various businesses on, among other factors, segment profit, the company may elect to record certain segment-related operating and non-operating expense items in other rather than reflect such items in segment profit.

explanation and reconciliation of the company's use of non-gaap financial measures the company's results in this annual report on form 10-k are presented in accordance with u.s. gaap except where otherwise noted. in certain circumstances, non-gaap results have been presented. these non-gaap measures are adjusted operating income, adjusted operating income margin, adjusted net earnings, adjusted earnings per share, free cash flow, and recurring revenue growth constant currency. these non-gaap financial measures should be viewed in addition to, and not as a substitute for, the company's reported results.
the company believes our non-gaap financial measures help investors understand how management plans, measures and evaluates the company's business performance. management believes that non-gaap measures provide consistency in its financial reporting and facilitates investors' understanding of the company's operating results and trends by providing an additional basis for comparison. management uses these non-gaap financial measures to, among other things, evaluate our ongoing operations and for internal planning and forecasting purposes. in addition, and as a consequence of the importance of these non-gaap financial measures in managing our business, the company's compensation committee of the board of directors incorporates non-gaap financial measures in the evaluation process for determining management compensation.
adjusted operating income, adjusted operating income margin, adjusted net earnings and adjusted earnings per share these non-gaap measures reflect operating income, operating income margin, net earnings, and diluted earnings per share, as adjusted to exclude the impact of certain costs, expenses, gains and losses and other specified items the exclusion of which management believes provides insight regarding our ongoing operating performance. depending on the period presented, these adjusted measures exclude the impact of certain of the following items: (i) amortization of acquired intangibles and purchased intellectual property, (ii) acquisition and integration costs, (iii) restructuring charges, (iv) real estate realignment and covid-19 related expenses, (v) russia-related exit costs, and (vi) investment gain. amortization of acquired intangibles and purchased intellectual property represents non-cash amortization expenses associated with the company's acquisition activities. acquisition and integration costs represent certain transaction and integration costs associated with the company's acquisition activities. restructuring charges represent severance costs associated with the company's initiative to streamline our management structure, reallocate work to lower cost locations, and reduce headcount in deprioritized areas. real estate realignment and covid-19 related expenses are comprised of two major components: real estate realignment expenses, and covid-19 related expenses. real estate realignment expenses are expenses associated with the exit of certain of the company's leased facilities in response to the covid-19 pandemic, which consist of the impairment of certain right of use assets, leasehold improvements and equipment, as well as other related facility exit expenses directly resulting from, and attributable to, the exit of these leased facilities. covid-19 related expense are direct and incremental expenses incurred by the company to protect the health and safety of broadridge associates during the covid-19 outbreak, including expenses associated with monitoring the temperatures for associates entering our facilities, enhancing the safety of our office environment in preparation for workers to return to company facilities on a more regular basis, ensuring proper social distancing in our production facilities, personal protective equipment, enhanced cleaning measures in our facilities, and other safety related expenses. russia-related exit costs are direct and incremental costs associated with the company's wind down of business activities in russia in response to russia's invasion of ukraine, including relocation-related expenses of impacted associates. investment gain represents a non-operating, non-cash gain on a privately held investment.
we exclude acquisition and integration costs, restructuring charges, real estate realignment and covid-19 related expenses, russia-related exit costs, and investment gain from our adjusted operating income (as applicable) and other adjusted earnings measures because excluding such information provides us with an understanding of the results from the primary operations of our business and enhances comparability across fiscal reporting periods, as these items are not reflective of our underlying operations or performance. we also exclude the impact of amortization of acquired intangibles and purchased intellectual property, as these non-cash amounts are significantly impacted by the timing and size of individual acquisitions and do not factor into the company's capital allocation decisions, management compensation metrics or multi-year objectives. furthermore, management believes that this adjustment enables better comparison of our results as amortization of acquired intangibles and purchased intellectual property will not recur in future periods once such intangible assets have been fully amortized. although we exclude amortization of acquired intangibles and purchased intellectual property from our adjusted earnings measures, our management believes that it is important for investors to understand that these intangible assets contribute to revenue generation. amortization of intangible assets that relate to past acquisitions will recur in future periods until such intangible assets have been fully amortized. any future acquisitions may result in the amortization of additional intangible assets.
free cash flow in addition to the non-gaap financial measures discussed above, we provide free cash flow information because we consider free cash flow to be a liquidity measure that provides useful information to management and investors about the amount of cash generated that could be used for dividends, share repurchases, strategic acquisitions, other investments, as well as debt servicing. free cash flow is a non-gaap financial measure and is defined by the company as net cash flows provided by operating activities less capital expenditures as well as software purchases and capitalized internal use software.
recurring revenue growth constant currency as a multi-national company, we are subject to variability of our reported u.s. dollar results due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. the exclusion of the impact of foreign currency exchange fluctuations from our recurring revenue growth, or what we refer to as amounts expressed "on a constant currency basis," is a non-gaap measure. we believe that excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange fluctuations from our recurring revenue growth provides additional information that enables enhanced comparison to prior periods.
changes in recurring revenue growth expressed on a constant currency basis are presented excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange fluctuations. to present this information, current period results for entities reporting in currencies other than the u.s. dollar are translated into u.s. dollars at the average exchange rates in effect during the corresponding period of the comparative year, rather than at the actual average exchange rates in effect during the current fiscal year.

the increase in cash provided by operating activities of $379.9 million was primarily due to an increase in advance client billings as well as a decrease in client-related platform implementation and development, partially offset by higher cash used in working capital.
the decrease in cash used in investing activities of $30.0 million primarily reflects lower acquisition spend in the current fiscal year compared to the prior year period.
the increase in cash used in financing activities of $344.0 million primarily reflects higher repayments net of borrowing.
income taxes the company, headquartered in the u.s., is routinely examined by the irs and is also routinely examined by the tax authorities in the u.s. states and foreign countries in which it conducts business. the tax years under audit examination vary by tax jurisdiction. the company regularly considers the likelihood of assessments in each of the jurisdictions resulting from examinations. to the extent the company determines it has potential tax assessments in particular tax jurisdictions, the company has established tax reserves which it believes are adequate in relation to the potential assessments. once established, reserves are adjusted when there is more information available, when an event occurs necessitating a change to the reserves or the statute of limitations for the relevant taxing authority to examine the tax position has expired. the resolution of tax matters should not have a material effect on the financial condition of the company or on the company's consolidated statements of earnings for a particular future period.
employee benefit plans the company sponsors a supplemental officer retirement plan (the "sorp"), a supplemental executive retirement plan (the "serp"), an executive retiree health insurance plan, and certain non-us benefits-related plans. please refer to note 17, "employee benefit plans" to our consolidated financial statements under item 8 of part ii of this annual report on form 10-k for a discussion on the company's employee benefit plans.

off-balance sheet arrangements it is not our business practice to enter into off-balance sheet arrangements. however, we are exposed to market risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates that could impact our financial position, results of operations, and cash flows. we manage our exposure to these market risks through regular operating and financing activities and, when deemed appropriate, through the use of derivative financial instruments.
in january 2022, we executed a series of cross-currency swap derivative contracts with an aggregate notional amount of eur 880 million which are designated as net investment hedges to hedge a portion of our net investment in our subsidiaries whose functional currency is the euro. the cross-currency swap derivative contracts are agreements to pay fixed-rate interest in euros and receive fixed-rate interest in u.s. dollars, thereby effectively converting a portion of our u.s. dollar denominated fixed-rate debt into euro denominated fixed-rate debt. the cross-currency swaps mature in may 2031 to coincide with the maturity of the fiscal 2021 senior notes. accordingly, foreign currency transaction gains or losses on the qualifying net investment hedge instruments are recorded as foreign currency translation within other comprehensive income (loss), net in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income and will remain in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in the consolidated balance sheets until the sale or complete liquidation of the underlying foreign subsidiary. at june 30, 2023, our position on the cross-currency swaps was an asset of $66.7 million, and is recorded as part of other non-current assets on the consolidated balance sheets with the offsetting amount recorded as part of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax. we have elected the spot method of accounting whereby the net interest savings from the cross-currency swaps is recognized as a reduction in interest expense in our consolidated statements of earnings.
in connection with the acquisition of itiviti in march 2021 the company entered into two derivative instruments designed to mitigate the company's exposure to the impact of (i) changes in foreign exchange rates on the acquisition of itiviti purchase consideration, and (ii) changes in interest rates on the fiscal 2021 senior notes.
in march 2021, the company executed a forward foreign exchange derivative instrument ("forward") with an aggregate notional amount of eur 1.955 billion. the forward acted as an economic hedge against the impact of changes in the euro on the company's purchase consideration for the acquisition of itiviti. the company recorded changes in fair value of the forward as part of other non-operating income (expenses), net in the consolidated statement of earnings. in may 2021, the company settled the forward derivative for a cumulative pre-tax gain of $66.7 million.
in may 2021, we settled a forward treasury lock agreement that was designated as a cash flow hedge, for a pre-tax loss of $11.0 million, after which the final settlement loss is being amortized into interest expense, net ratably over the ten year term of the fiscal 2021 senior notes. the expected amount of the existing loss that will be amortized into earnings before income taxes within the next twelve months is approximately $1.1 million.
in the normal course of business, we also enter into contracts in which it makes representations and warranties that relate to the performance of our products and services. we do not expect any material losses related to such representations and warranties, or collateral arrangements.

reits are subject to a range of complex organizational and operational requirements. a qualifying reit does not generally incur u.s. federal corporate income tax on its "reit taxable income" (generally, taxable income subject to specified adjustments, including a deduction for dividends paid and excluding net capital gain) that it distributes to its shareholders. our reit status is also dependent upon the reit qualification of ps business parks, inc. ("psb") through the end of its taxable year ended december 31, 2022, as a result of our substantial ownership interest in it prior to the closing of the psb merger with an unaffiliated third party. we believe we have qualified as a reit and we intend to continue to maintain our reit status.

disruptions, failures or slowdowns that could occur with respect to our operations, including to our information technology systems, networks and platforms, our electronic delivery systems or the internet, could reduce confidence in our products and services, damage our brand and reputation, result in litigation and negatively affect our ability to distribute our products effectively and to service our clients, including delivering managed services or delivering real-time index data. to the extent we grow through acquisitions, newly acquired businesses may not have invested in technology and resilience to the same extent as we have. as their systems are integrated into ours, a vulnerability could be introduced that could impact us.

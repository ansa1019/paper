members of the investment community are also increasing their focus on environmental and social (e&s) matters, including practices related to ghg emissions, climate change, business resilience, diversity and inclusion, environmental justice and other e&s matters. as a result, we may face increasing pressure regarding our e&s disclosures and practices. additionally, members of the investment community may screen companies such as ours for e&s performance before investing in our stock or participating in our financing activities. if we are unable to meet the e&s standards set by these investors, we may lose investors, our stock price may be negatively impacted, our access to capital markets and lenders may be curtailed, and our reputation may be negatively affected.

our results provided another proof point of the strength and resilience of our value creation model, which supported another year of strong free cash flow and adjusted net earnings per diluted share growth, excluding the 53rd week in fiscal year 2023 (the "extra week"). this was the result of continued momentum across several margin expansion initiatives, strong our brands performance, strong growth in alternative profit businesses, our ability to effectively manage product cost through strong sourcing practices, lower supply chain costs and a lower year-over-year lifo charge. during the year, we continued to invest in wages and the associate experience as a way to support the delivery of a full, fresh and friendly customer experience. in 2023, we increased associate wages resulting in an average hourly rate of nearly $19, and a rate of nearly $25 with comprehensive benefits factored in, which is a 33% increase in rate in the last five years.

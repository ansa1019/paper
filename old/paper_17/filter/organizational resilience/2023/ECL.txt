we may experience business disruption if we fail to execute organizational change and management transitions.
our continued success will depend on the efforts and abilities of our executive officers and certain other key employees, particularly those with sales and sales management responsibilities, to drive business growth, development and profitability. our operations could be materially and adversely affected if for any reason we are unable to successfully execute organizational change and management transitions at leadership levels.
during 2018, we formally commenced a restructuring plan accelerate 2020 ("the a2020 plan"), to leverage technology and system investments and organizational changes. the goals of the a2020 plan were to further simplify and automate processes and tasks, reduce complexity and management layers, consolidate facilities and focus on key long-term growth areas by further leveraging technology and structural improvements. we recorded restructuring charges of $9.9 million ($8.4 million after tax) or $0.03 per diluted share and $5.3 million ($6.2 million after tax) or $0.02 per diluted share in 2022 and 2021, respectively. the restructuring activities were completed at the end of 2022, with total costs of $254.4 million ($198.4 million after tax), or $0.69 per diluted share.

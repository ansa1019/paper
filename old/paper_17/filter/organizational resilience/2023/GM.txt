in addition, many of our operations, primarily in china and korea as well as certain of our battery manufacturing and raw material sourcing operations in the u.s. and canada, are carried out by joint ventures. in joint ventures, we share ownership and management of a company with one or more parties who may not have the same goals, strategies, priorities, business incentives or resources as we do and may compete with us outside the joint venture. joint ventures are intended to be operated for the benefit of all co-owners, rather than for our exclusive benefit. operating a business as a joint venture often requires additional organizational formalities as well as time-consuming procedures for sharing information and making decisions that must further take into consideration our partners' interests. in joint ventures, we are required to foster our relationships with our co-owners as well as promote the overall success of the joint venture, and if a co-owner changes, relationships deteriorate or strategic objectives diverge, our success in the joint venture may be materially adversely affected. further, because most of the benefits general motors company and subsidiaries from a successful joint venture are shared among the co-owners, we do not receive all the benefits from our successful joint ventures.

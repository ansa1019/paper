in addition, we unveiled an organizational simplification and cost savings plan in september 2023 aimed at limiting expenses in 2024 and beyond and simplifying our organization to gain efficiencies that will improve the client experience. our transformation is centered on improving efficiency as an organization and realigning certain aspects of our leadership and operating model within our operating segments to increase efficiency and drive revenue opportunities. we made strong progress on our plan in the second half of 2023 as evidenced by a reduction in our headcount and the consolidation of several key business lines.
our cybersecurity framework is also designed to help oversee, identify, and mitigate cybersecurity risks associated with our use of third-party service providers. following an initial assessment of the level of enterprise risk potentially posed by use of the third-party, the service provider is then subject to further risk-based assessments on its operational resilience and cybersecurity practices, including disaster recovery and business continuity plans that specify the time frame to resume activities and recover data. in its agreements with third-party service providers, truist then requires service providers to adhere to truist's relevant cybersecurity and operational resilience standards, subject to certain exceptions that are managed on a case-by-case basis.
in addition, truist continues to strengthen its cross-functional, holistic approach to enterprise resilience by addressing potential amplification of risks from significant technology, cybersecurity and data incidents. as part of these efforts, truist is deepening capabilities for both disaster recovery and restoration, along with the implementation of other resilience measures.
truist is committed to operating in a manner that reflects the company's stated purpose, mission, and values and seeks to protect its reputation, public confidence, and resilience by identifying and evaluating associated risks that conflict with the expectations of the company's internal and external stakeholders, including clients, teammates, investors, regulators, and communities.

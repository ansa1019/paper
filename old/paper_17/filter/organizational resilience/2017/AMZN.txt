item 1a.   risk factors please carefully consider the following risk factors. if any of the following risks occur, our business, financial condition, operating results, and cash flows could be materially adversely affected. in addition, the current global economic climate amplifies many of these risks.
we face intense competition our businesses are rapidly evolving and intensely competitive, and we have many competitors in different industries, including retail, e-commerce services, digital content and electronic devices, and web and infrastructure computing services. some of our current and potential competitors have greater resources, longer histories, more customers, and/or greater brand recognition, particularly with our newly-launched products and services and in our newer geographic regions. they may secure better terms from vendors, adopt more aggressive pricing, and devote more resources to technology, infrastructure, fulfillment, and marketing.
competition may intensify, including with the development of new business models and the entry of new and well-funded competitors, and as our competitors enter into business combinations or alliances and established companies in other market segments expand to become competitive with our business. in addition, new and enhanced technologies, including search, web and infrastructure computing services, digital content, and electronic devices, may increase our competition. the internet facilitates competitive entry and comparison shopping, and increased competition may reduce our sales and profits.
our expansion places a significant strain on our management, operational, financial, and other resources we are rapidly and significantly expanding our global operations, including increasing our product and service offerings and scaling our infrastructure to support our retail and services businesses. this expansion increases the complexity of our business and places significant strain on our management, personnel, operations, systems, technical performance, financial resources, and internal financial control and reporting functions. we may not be able to manage growth effectively, which could damage our reputation, limit our growth, and negatively affect our operating results.
our expansion into new products, services, technologies, and geographic regions subjects us to additional business, legal, financial, and competitive risks we may have limited or no experience in our newer market segments, and our customers may not adopt our new offerings. these offerings may present new and difficult technology challenges, and we may be subject to claims if customers of these offerings experience service disruptions or failures or other quality issues. in addition, profitability, if any, in our newer activities may be lower than in our older activities, and we may not be successful enough in these newer activities to recoup our investments in them. if any of this were to occur, it could damage our reputation, limit our growth, and negatively affect our operating results.
we may experience significant fluctuations in our operating results and growth rate we may not be able to accurately forecast our growth rate. we base our expense levels and investment plans on sales estimates. a significant portion of our expenses and investments is fixed, and we may not be able to adjust our spending quickly enough if our sales are less than expected.
our revenue growth may not be sustainable, and our percentage growth rates may decrease. our revenue and operating profit growth depends on the continued growth of demand for the products and services offered by us or our sellers, and our business is affected by general economic and business conditions worldwide. a softening of demand, whether caused by changes in customer preferences or a weakening of the u.s. or global economies, may result in decreased revenue or growth.
our sales and operating results will also fluctuate for many other reasons, including due to risks described elsewhere in this section and the following:
•   our ability to retain and increase sales to existing customers, attract new customers, and satisfy our customers' demands;
•   our ability to retain and expand our network of sellers;
•   our ability to offer products on favorable terms, manage inventory, and fulfill orders;
•   the introduction of competitive websites, products, services, price decreases, or improvements;
•   changes in usage or adoption rates of the internet, e-commerce, electronic devices, and web services, including outside the u.s.;
•   timing, effectiveness, and costs of expansion and upgrades of our systems and infrastructure;
•   the success of our geographic, service, and product line expansions;
•   the extent to which we finance, and the terms of any such financing for, our current operations and future growth;
•   the outcomes of legal proceedings and claims, which may include significant monetary damages or injunctive relief and could have a material adverse impact on our operating results;
•   variations in the mix of products and services we sell;
•   variations in our level of merchandise and vendor returns;
•   the extent to which we offer free shipping, continue to reduce prices worldwide, and provide additional benefits to our customers;
•   increases in the prices of fuel and gasoline, as well as increases in the prices of other energy products and commodities like paper and packing supplies;
•   the extent to which our equity-method investees record significant operating and non-operating items;
•   the extent to which operators of the networks between our customers and our websites successfully charge fees to grant our customers unimpaired and unconstrained access to our online services;
•   the extent to which use of our services is affected by spyware, viruses, phishing and other spam emails, denial of service attacks, data theft, computer intrusions, outages, and similar events; and
our international operations expose us to a number of risks our international activities are significant to our revenues and profits, and we plan to further expand internationally. in certain international market segments, we have relatively little operating experience and may not benefit from any first-to-market advantages or otherwise succeed. it is costly to establish, develop, and maintain international operations and websites, and promote our brand internationally. our international operations may not be profitable on a sustained basis.
in addition to risks described elsewhere in this section, our international sales and operations are subject to a number of risks, including:
•   local economic and political conditions;
•   government regulation of e-commerce and other services, electronic devices, and competition, and restrictive governmental actions (such as trade protection measures, including export duties and quotas and custom duties and tariffs), nationalization, and restrictions on foreign ownership;
•   restrictions on sales or distribution of certain products or services and uncertainty regarding liability for products, services, and content, including uncertainty as a result of less internet-friendly legal systems, local laws, lack of legal precedent, and varying rules, regulations, and practices regarding the physical and digital distribution of media products and enforcement of intellectual property rights;
•   business licensing or certification requirements, such as for imports, exports, web services, and electronic devices;
•   limitations on the repatriation and investment of funds and foreign currency exchange restrictions;
•   shorter payable and longer receivable cycles and the resultant negative impact on cash flow;
•   lower levels of use of the internet;
•   lower levels of consumer spending and fewer opportunities for growth compared to the u.s.;
•   lower levels of credit card usage and increased payment risk;
•   difficulty in staffing, developing, and managing foreign operations as a result of distance, language, and cultural differences;
•   different employee/employer relationships and the existence of works councils and labor unions;
•   compliance with the u.s. foreign corrupt practices act and other applicable u.s. and foreign laws prohibiting corrupt payments to government officials and other third parties;
•   laws and policies of the u.s. and other jurisdictions affecting trade, foreign investment, loans, and taxes; and
•   geopolitical events, including war and terrorism.
as international e-commerce and other online and web services grow, competition will intensify. local companies may have a substantial competitive advantage because of their greater understanding of, and focus on, the local customer, as well as their more established local brand names. we may not be able to hire, train, retain, and manage required personnel, which may limit our international growth.
the people's republic of china ("prc") and india regulate amazon's and its affiliates' businesses and operations in country through regulations and license requirements that may restrict (i) foreign investment in and operation of the internet, it infrastructure, data centers, retail, delivery, and other sectors, (ii) internet content, and (iii) the sale of media and other products and services. for example, in order to meet local ownership and regulatory licensing requirements, www.amazon.cn is operated by prc companies that are indirectly owned, either wholly or partially, by prc nationals. in addition, we provide certain technology services in china in conjunction with third parties that hold prc licenses to provide services. in india, the government restricts the ownership or control of indian companies by foreign entities involved in online multi-brand retail trading activities. for www.amazon.in, we provide certain marketing tools and logistics services to third-party sellers to enable them to sell online and deliver to customers, and we hold indirect minority interests in entities that are third-party sellers on the www.amazon.in marketplace. although we believe these structures and activities comply with existing laws, they involve unique risks, and the prc is actively considering changes in its foreign investment rules that could impact these structures and activities. there are substantial uncertainties regarding the interpretation of prc and indian laws and regulations, and it is possible that these governments will ultimately take a view contrary to ours. in addition, our chinese and indian businesses and operations may be unable to continue to operate if we or our affiliates are unable to access sufficient funding or in china enforce contractual relationships with respect to management and control of such businesses. if our international activities were found to be in violation of any existing or future prc, indian or other laws or regulations or if interpretations of those laws and regulations were to change, our businesses in those countries could be subject to fines and other financial penalties, have licenses revoked, or be forced to shut down entirely.
if we do not successfully optimize and operate our fulfillment network and data centers, our business could be harmed if we do not adequately predict customer demand or otherwise optimize and operate our fulfillment network and data centers successfully, it could result in excess or insufficient fulfillment or data center capacity, or result in increased costs, impairment charges, or both, or harm our business in other ways. as we continue to add fulfillment and data center capability or add new businesses with different requirements, our fulfillment and data center networks become increasingly complex and operating them becomes more challenging. there can be no assurance that we will be able to operate our networks effectively.
in addition, a failure to optimize inventory in our fulfillment network will increase our net shipping cost by requiring long-zone or partial shipments. we and our co-sourcers may be unable to adequately staff our fulfillment network and customer service centers. if the other businesses on whose behalf we perform inventory fulfillment services deliver product to our fulfillment centers in excess of forecasts, we may be unable to secure sufficient storage space and may be unable to optimize our fulfillment network.
we rely on a limited number of shipping companies to deliver inventory to us and completed orders to our customers. if we are not able to negotiate acceptable terms with these companies or they experience performance problems or other difficulties, it could negatively impact our operating results and customer experience. in addition, our ability to receive inbound inventory efficiently and ship completed orders to customers also may be negatively affected by inclement weather, fire, flood, power loss, earthquakes, labor disputes, acts of war or terrorism, acts of god, and similar factors.
under some of our commercial agreements, we maintain the inventory of other companies, thereby increasing the complexity of tracking inventory and operating our fulfillment network. our failure to properly handle such inventory or the inability of these other companies to accurately forecast product demand would result in unexpected costs and other harm to our business and reputation.
the seasonality of our business places increased strain on our operations we expect a disproportionate amount of our net sales to occur during our fourth quarter. if we do not stock or restock popular products in sufficient amounts such that we fail to meet customer demand, it could significantly affect our revenue and our future growth. if we overstock products, we may be required to take significant inventory markdowns or write-offs and incur commitment costs, which could reduce profitability. we may experience an increase in our net shipping cost due to complimentary upgrades, split-shipments, and additional long-zone shipments necessary to ensure timely delivery for the holiday season. if too many customers access our websites within a short period of time due to increased holiday demand, we may experience system interruptions that make our websites unavailable or prevent us from efficiently fulfilling orders, which may reduce the volume of goods we sell and the attractiveness of our products and services. in addition, we may be unable to adequately staff our fulfillment network and customer service centers during these peak periods and delivery and other fulfillment companies and customer service co-sourcers may be unable to meet the seasonal demand. we also face risks described elsewhere in this item 1a relating to fulfillment network optimization and inventory.
we generally have payment terms with our retail vendors that extend beyond the amount of time necessary to collect proceeds from our consumer customers. as a result of holiday sales, as of december 31 of each year, our cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities balances typically reach their highest level (other than as a result of cash flows provided by or used in investing and financing activities). this operating cycle results in a corresponding increase in accounts payable as of december 31. our accounts payable balance generally declines during the first three months of the year, resulting in a corresponding decline in our cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities balances.
our business could suffer if we are unsuccessful in making, integrating, and maintaining commercial agreements, strategic alliances, and other business relationships we provide e-commerce and other services to businesses through commercial agreements, strategic alliances, and business relationships. under these agreements, we provide web services, technology, fulfillment, computing, digital storage, and other services, as well as enable sellers to offer products or services through our websites. these arrangements are complex and require substantial infrastructure capacity, personnel, and other resource commitments, which may limit the amount of business we can service. we may not be able to implement, maintain, and develop the components of these commercial relationships, which may include web services, fulfillment, customer service, inventory management, tax collection, payment processing, hardware, content, and third-party software, and engaging third parties to perform services. the amount of compensation we receive under certain of our commercial agreements is partially dependent on the volume of the other company's sales. therefore, if the other company's offering is not successful, the compensation we receive may be lower than expected or the agreement may be terminated. moreover, we may not be able to enter into additional commercial relationships and strategic alliances on favorable terms. we also may be subject to claims from businesses to which we provide these services if we are unsuccessful in implementing, maintaining, or developing these services.
as our agreements terminate, we may be unable to renew or replace these agreements on comparable terms, or at all. we may in the future enter into amendments on less favorable terms or encounter parties that have difficulty meeting their contractual obligations to us, which could adversely affect our operating results.
our present and future e-commerce services agreements, other commercial agreements, and strategic alliances create additional risks such as:
•   disruption of our ongoing business, including loss of management focus on existing businesses;
•   impairment of other relationships;
•   variability in revenue and income from entering into, amending, or terminating such agreements or relationships; and
•   difficulty integrating under the commercial agreements.
our business could suffer if we are unsuccessful in making, integrating, and maintaining acquisitions and investments we have acquired and invested in a number of companies, and we may acquire or invest in or enter into joint ventures with additional companies. these transactions (such as our acquisition of whole foods market, inc.) create risks such as:
•   disruption of our ongoing business, including loss of management focus on existing businesses;
•   additional operating losses and expenses of the businesses we acquired or in which we invested;
•   the potential impairment of tangible and intangible assets and goodwill, including as a result of acquisitions;
•   the potential impairment of customer and other relationships of the company we acquired or in which we invested or our own customers as a result of any integration of operations;
•   the difficulty of completing such transactions and achieving anticipated benefits within expected timeframes, or at all;
•   the difficulty of incorporating acquired operations, technology, and rights into our offerings, and unanticipated expenses related to such integration;
•   the difficulty of integrating a new company's accounting, financial reporting, management, information and information security, human resource, and other administrative systems to permit effective management, and the lack of control if such integration is delayed or not implemented;
•   for investments in which an investee's financial performance is incorporated into our financial results, either in full or in part, the dependence on the investee's accounting, financial reporting, and similar systems, controls, and processes;
•   the difficulty of implementing at companies we acquire the controls, procedures, and policies appropriate for a larger public company;
•   the risks associated with businesses we acquire or invest in, which may differ from or be more significant than the risks our other businesses face;
•   for foreign transactions, additional risks related to the integration of operations across different cultures and languages, and the economic, political, and regulatory risks associated with specific countries.
as a result of future acquisitions or mergers, we might need to issue additional equity securities, spend our cash, or incur debt, contingent liabilities, or amortization expenses related to intangible assets, any of which could reduce our profitability and harm our business or only be available on unfavorable terms, if at all. in addition, valuations supporting our acquisitions and strategic investments could change rapidly given the current global economic climate. we could determine that such valuations have experienced impairments or other-than-temporary declines in fair value which could adversely impact our financial results.
we have foreign exchange risk the results of operations of, and certain of our intercompany balances associated with, our international websites and product and service offerings are exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations. upon translation, operating results may differ materially from expectations, and we may record significant gains or losses on the remeasurement of intercompany balances. as we have expanded our international operations, our exposure to exchange rate fluctuations has increased. we also hold cash equivalents and/or marketable securities in foreign currencies including british pounds, euros, and japanese yen. if the u.s. dollar strengthens compared to these currencies, cash equivalents, and marketable securities balances, when translated, may be materially less than expected and vice versa.
the loss of key senior management personnel could negatively affect our business we depend on our senior management and other key personnel, particularly jeffrey p. bezos, our president, ceo, and chairman. we do not have "key person" life insurance policies. the loss of any of our executive officers or other key employees could harm our business.
we could be harmed by data loss or other security breaches as a result of our services being web-based and the fact that we process, store, and transmit large amounts of data, including personal information, for our customers, failure to prevent or mitigate data loss or other security breaches, including breaches of our vendors' technology and systems, could expose us or our customers to a risk of loss or misuse of such information, adversely affect our operating results, result in litigation or potential liability for us, and otherwise harm our business. we use third-party technology and systems for a variety of reasons, including, without limitation, encryption and authentication technology, employee email, content delivery to customers, back-office support, and other functions. some subsidiaries had past security breaches, and, although they did not have a material adverse effect on our operating results, there can be no assurance of a similar result in the future. although we have developed systems and processes that are designed to protect customer information and prevent data loss and other security breaches, including systems and processes designed to reduce the impact of a security breach at a third-party vendor, such measures cannot provide absolute security.
we face risks related to system interruption and lack of redundancy we experience occasional system interruptions and delays that make our websites and services unavailable or slow to respond and prevent us from efficiently fulfilling orders or providing services to third parties, which may reduce our net sales and the attractiveness of our products and services. if we are unable to continually add software and hardware, effectively upgrade our systems and network infrastructure, and take other steps to improve the efficiency of our systems, it could cause system interruptions or delays and adversely affect our operating results.
our computer and communications systems and operations could be damaged or interrupted by fire, flood, power loss, telecommunications failure, earthquakes, acts of war or terrorism, acts of god, computer viruses, physical or electronic break-ins, and similar events or disruptions. any of these events could cause system interruption, delays, and loss of critical data, and could prevent us from accepting and fulfilling customer orders and providing services, which could make our product and service offerings less attractive and subject us to liability. our systems are not fully redundant and our disaster recovery planning may not be sufficient. in addition, we may have inadequate insurance coverage to compensate for any related losses. any of these events could damage our reputation and be expensive to remedy.
we face significant inventory risk in addition to risks described elsewhere in this item 1a relating to fulfillment network and inventory optimization by us and third parties, we are exposed to significant inventory risks that may adversely affect our operating results as a result of seasonality, new product launches, rapid changes in product cycles and pricing, defective merchandise, changes in consumer demand and consumer spending patterns, changes in consumer tastes with respect to our products, spoilage, and other factors. we endeavor to accurately predict these trends and avoid overstocking or understocking products we manufacture and/or sell. demand for products, however, can change significantly between the time inventory or components are ordered and the date of sale. in addition, when we begin selling or manufacturing a new product, it may be difficult to establish vendor relationships, determine appropriate product or component selection, and accurately forecast demand. the acquisition of certain types of inventory or components may require significant lead-time and prepayment and they may not be returnable. we carry a broad selection and significant inventory levels of certain products, such as consumer electronics, and we may be unable to sell products in sufficient quantities or during the relevant selling seasons. any one of the inventory risk factors set forth above may adversely affect our operating results.
we may not be able to adequately protect our intellectual property rights or may be accused of infringing intellectual property rights of third parties we regard our trademarks, service marks, copyrights, patents, trade dress, trade secrets, proprietary technology, and similar intellectual property as critical to our success, and we rely on trademark, copyright, and patent law, trade secret protection, and confidentiality and/or license agreements with our employees, customers, and others to protect our proprietary rights. effective intellectual property protection may not be available in every country in which our products and services are made available. we also may not be able to acquire or maintain appropriate domain names in all countries in which we do business. furthermore, regulations governing domain names may not protect our trademarks and similar proprietary rights. we may be unable to prevent third parties from acquiring domain names that are similar to, infringe upon, or diminish the value of our trademarks and other proprietary rights.
we may not be able to discover or determine the extent of any unauthorized use of our proprietary rights. third parties that license our proprietary rights also may take actions that diminish the value of our proprietary rights or reputation. the protection of our intellectual property may require the expenditure of significant financial and managerial resources. moreover, the steps we take to protect our intellectual property may not adequately protect our rights or prevent third parties from infringing or misappropriating our proprietary rights. we also cannot be certain that others will not independently develop or otherwise acquire equivalent or superior technology or other intellectual property rights.
other parties also may claim that we infringe their proprietary rights. we have been subject to, and expect to continue to be subject to, claims and legal proceedings regarding alleged infringement by us of the intellectual property rights of third parties. such claims, whether or not meritorious, may result in the expenditure of significant financial and managerial resources, injunctions against us, or the payment of damages, including to satisfy indemnification obligations. we may need to obtain licenses from third parties who allege that we have infringed their rights, but such licenses may not be available on terms acceptable to us or at all. in addition, we may not be able to obtain or utilize on terms that are favorable to us, or at all, licenses or other rights with respect to intellectual property we do not own. these risks have been amplified by the increase in third parties whose sole or primary business is to assert such claims.
our digital content offerings depend in part on effective digital rights management technology to control access to digital content. if the digital rights management technology that we use is compromised or otherwise malfunctions, we could be subject to claims, and content providers may be unwilling to include their content in our service.
we have a rapidly evolving business model and our stock price is highly volatile we have a rapidly evolving business model. the trading price of our common stock fluctuates significantly in response to, among other risks, the risks described elsewhere in this item 1a, as well as:
•   changes in interest rates;
•   conditions or trends in the internet and the industry segments we operate in;
•   quarterly variations in operating results;
•   fluctuations in the stock market in general and market prices for internet-related companies in particular;
•   changes in financial estimates by us or securities analysts and recommendations by securities analysts;
•   changes in our capital structure, including issuance of additional debt or equity to the public;
•   changes in the valuation methodology of, or performance by, other e-commerce or technology companies; and
•   transactions in our common stock by major investors and certain analyst reports, news, and speculation.
volatility in our stock price could adversely affect our business and financing opportunities and force us to increase our cash compensation to employees or grant larger stock awards than we have historically, which could hurt our operating results or reduce the percentage ownership of our existing stockholders, or both.
government regulation is evolving and unfavorable changes could harm our business we are subject to general business regulations and laws, as well as regulations and laws specifically governing the internet, e-commerce, electronic devices, and other services. existing and future laws and regulations may impede our growth. these regulations and laws may cover taxation, privacy, data protection, pricing, content, copyrights, distribution, transportation, mobile communications, electronic device certification, electronic waste, energy consumption, environmental regulation, electronic contracts and other communications, competition, consumer protection, employment, trade and protectionist measures, web services, the provision of online payment services, information reporting requirements, unencumbered internet access to our services or access to our facilities, the design and operation of websites, health and sanitation standards, the characteristics and quality of products and services, product labeling, and the commercial operation of unmanned aircraft systems. it is not clear how existing laws governing issues such as property ownership, libel, and personal privacy apply to the internet, e-commerce, digital content, and web services. jurisdictions may regulate consumer-to-consumer online businesses, including certain aspects of our seller programs. unfavorable regulations and laws could diminish the demand for, or availability of, our products and services and increase our cost of doing business.
we could be subject to additional sales tax or other tax liabilities an increasing number of states and foreign jurisdictions have considered or adopted laws or administrative practices, with or without notice, that impose new taxes on all or a portion of gross revenue or other similar amounts or impose additional obligations on remote sellers and online marketplaces to collect transaction taxes such as sales, consumption, value added, or similar taxes. we may not have sufficient lead time to build systems and processes to collect these taxes properly, or at all. failure to comply with such laws or administrative practices, or a successful assertion by such states or foreign jurisdictions requiring us to collect taxes where we do not, could result in substantial tax liabilities, including for past sales, as well as penalties and interest. in addition, if the tax authorities in jurisdictions where we are already subject to sales tax or other indirect tax obligations were successfully to challenge our positions, our tax liability could increase substantially. in the u.s., although supreme court decisions restrict states' rights to require remote sellers to collect state and local sales taxes, the supreme court has recently agreed to hear a case that could overturn prior precedent. we support a federal law that would allow states to require sales tax collection by remote sellers under a nationwide system.
we are also subject to u.s. (federal and state) and foreign laws, regulations, and administrative practices that require us to collect information from our customers, vendors, merchants, and other third parties for tax reporting purposes and report such information to various government agencies. the scope of such requirements continues to expand, requiring us to develop and implement new compliance systems. failure to comply with such laws and regulations could result in significant penalties.
we could be subject to additional income tax liabilities we are subject to income taxes in the u.s. (federal and state) and numerous foreign jurisdictions. tax laws, regulations, and administrative practices in various jurisdictions may be subject to significant change, with or without notice, due to economic, political, and other conditions, and significant judgment is required in evaluating and estimating our provision and accruals for these taxes. there are many transactions that occur during the ordinary course of business for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. our effective tax rates could be affected by numerous factors, such as intercompany
transactions, the relative amount of our foreign earnings, including earnings being lower than anticipated in jurisdictions where we have lower statutory rates and higher than anticipated in jurisdictions where we have higher statutory rates, the applicability of special tax regimes, losses incurred in jurisdictions for which we are not able to realize the related tax benefit, changes in foreign currency exchange rates, entry into new businesses and geographies, changes to our existing businesses and operations, acquisitions (including integrations) and investments and how they are financed, changes in our stock price, changes in our deferred tax assets and liabilities and their valuation, and changes in the relevant tax, accounting, and other laws, regulations, administrative practices, principles, and interpretations. in addition, a number of countries are actively pursuing changes to their tax laws applicable to corporate multinationals, such as the recently enacted u.s. tax reform legislation commonly referred to as the u.s. tax cuts and jobs act of 2017 (the "2017 tax act"). finally, foreign governments may enact tax laws in response to the 2017 tax act that could result in further changes to global taxation and materially affect our financial position and results of operations.
the 2017 tax act significantly changes how the u.s. taxes corporations. the 2017 tax act requires complex computations to be performed that were not previously required in u.s. tax law, significant judgments to be made in interpretation of the provisions of the 2017 tax act and significant estimates in calculations, and the preparation and analysis of information not previously relevant or regularly produced. the u.s. treasury department, the irs, and other standard-setting bodies could interpret or issue guidance on how provisions of the 2017 tax act will be applied or otherwise administered that is different from our interpretation. as we complete our analysis of the 2017 tax act, collect and prepare necessary data, and interpret any additional guidance, we may make adjustments to provisional amounts that we have recorded that may materially impact our provision for income taxes in the period in which the adjustments are made.
we are also currently subject to audit in various jurisdictions, and these jurisdictions may assess additional income tax liabilities against us. developments in an audit, litigation, or the relevant laws, regulations, administrative practices, principles, and interpretations could have a material effect on our operating results or cash flows in the period or periods for which that development occurs, as well as for prior and subsequent periods. for instance, we have received notices of proposed adjustment ("nopas") from the irs for transactions undertaken in the 2005 and 2006 calendar years relating to transfer pricing with our foreign subsidiaries and we have been contesting the matter in u.s. tax court. on march 23, 2017, the u.s. tax court issued its decision regarding the issues raised in the irs nopas. the tax court rejected the approach from the irs nopas in determining transfer pricing adjustments in 2005 and 2006 for the transactions undertaken with our foreign subsidiaries and adopted, with adjustments, our suggested approach. on september 29, 2017, the irs filed a notice of appeal to the u.s. court of appeals for the ninth circuit. we will continue to defend ourselves vigorously in this matter. if the tax court decision were reversed on appeal or if the irs were to successfully assert transfer pricing adjustments of a similar nature to the nopas for transactions in subsequent years, we could be subject to significant additional tax liabilities. in addition, in october 2014, the european commission opened a formal investigation to examine whether decisions by the tax authorities in luxembourg with regard to the corporate income tax paid by certain of our subsidiaries comply with european union rules on state aid. on october 4, 2017, the european commission announced its decision that determinations by the tax authorities in luxembourg did not comply with european union rules on state aid. this decision orders luxembourg to calculate and recover additional taxes from us for the period may 2006 through june 2014. we believe this decision to be without merit and will consider our legal options, including an appeal. in december 2017, luxembourg appealed the european commission's decision. while the european commission announced an estimated recovery amount of approximately €250 million, plus interest, the actual amount of additional taxes subject to recovery is to be calculated by the luxembourg tax authorities in accordance with the european commission's guidance. although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, the final outcome of tax audits, investigations, and any related litigation could be materially different from our historical income tax provisions and accruals.
our supplier relationships subject us to a number of risks we have significant suppliers, including licensors, and in some cases, limited or single-sources of supply, that are important to our sourcing, services, manufacturing, and any related ongoing servicing of merchandise and content. we do not have long-term arrangements with most of our suppliers to guarantee availability of merchandise, content, components, or services, particular payment terms, or the extension of credit limits. if our current suppliers were to stop selling or licensing merchandise, content, components, or services to us on acceptable terms, or delay delivery, including as a result of one or more supplier bankruptcies due to poor economic conditions, as a result of natural disasters, or for other reasons, we may be unable to procure alternatives from other suppliers in a timely and efficient manner and on acceptable terms, or at all. in addition, if our suppliers or other vendors violate applicable laws, regulations, our code of standards and responsibilities, or implement practices regarded as unethical, unsafe, or hazardous to the environment, it could damage our reputation, limit our growth, and negatively affect our operating results.
we may be subject to risks related to government contracts and related procurement regulations our contracts with u.s., as well as state, local, and foreign, government entities are subject to various procurement regulations and other requirements relating to their formation, administration, and performance. we may be subject to audits and investigations relating to our government contracts, and any violations could result in various civil and criminal penalties and administrative sanctions, including termination of contract, refunding or suspending of payments, forfeiture of profits, payment of fines, and suspension or debarment from future government business. in addition, such contracts may provide for termination by the government at any time, without cause.
we may be subject to product liability claims if people or property are harmed by the products we sell or manufacture some of the products we sell or manufacture may expose us to product liability or food safety claims relating to personal injury or illness, death, or environmental or property damage, and may require product recalls or other actions. certain third parties also sell products using our e-commerce services that may increase our exposure to product liability claims, such as if these sellers do not have sufficient protection from such claims. although we maintain liability insurance, we cannot be certain that our coverage will be adequate for liabilities actually incurred or that insurance will continue to be available to us on economically reasonable terms, or at all. in addition, some of our agreements with our vendors and sellers do not indemnify us from product liability.
we are subject to payments-related risks we accept payments using a variety of methods, including credit card, debit card, credit accounts (including promotional financing), gift cards, direct debit from a customer's bank account, consumer invoicing, physical bank check, and payment upon delivery. for existing and future payment options we offer to our customers, we may become subject to additional regulations and compliance requirements (including obligations to implement enhanced authentication processes that could result in significant costs and reduce the ease of use of our payments products), as well as fraud. for certain payment methods, including credit and debit cards, we pay interchange and other fees, which may increase over time and raise our operating costs and lower profitability. we rely on third parties to provide certain amazon-branded payment methods and payment processing services, including the processing of credit cards, debit cards, electronic checks, and promotional financing. in each case, it could disrupt our business if these companies become unwilling or unable to provide these services to us. we also offer co-branded credit card programs, which could adversely affect our operating results if terminated. we are also subject to payment card association operating rules, including data security rules, certification requirements, and rules governing electronic funds transfers, which could change or be reinterpreted to make it difficult or impossible for us to comply. if we fail to comply with these rules or requirements, or if our data security systems are breached or compromised, we may be liable for card issuing banks' costs, subject to fines and higher transaction fees, and lose our ability to accept credit and debit card payments from our customers, process electronic funds transfers, or facilitate other types of online payments, and our business and operating results could be adversely affected.
in addition, we provide regulated services in certain jurisdictions because we enable customers to keep account balances with us and transfer money to third parties, and because we provide services to third parties to facilitate payments on their behalf. in these jurisdictions, we may be subject to requirements for licensing, regulatory inspection, bonding and capital maintenance, the use, handling, and segregation of transferred funds, consumer disclosures, and authentication. we are also subject to or voluntarily comply with a number of other laws and regulations relating to payments, money laundering, international money transfers, privacy and information security, and electronic fund transfers. if we were found to be in violation of applicable laws or regulations, we could be subject to additional requirements and civil and criminal penalties, or forced to cease providing certain services.
we could be liable for fraudulent or unlawful activities of sellers the law relating to the liability of providers of online payment services is currently unsettled. in addition, governmental agencies could require changes in the way this business is conducted. under our seller programs, we may be unable to prevent sellers from collecting payments, fraudulently or otherwise, when buyers never receive the products they ordered or when the products received are materially different from the sellers' descriptions. under our a2z guarantee, we reimburse buyers for payments up to certain limits in these situations, and as our third-party seller sales grow, the cost of this program will increase and could negatively affect our operating results. we also may be unable to prevent sellers on our sites or through other seller sites from selling unlawful goods, selling goods in an unlawful manner, or violating the proprietary rights of others, and could face civil or criminal liability for unlawful activities by our sellers.
item 7.   management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations forward-looking statements this annual report on form 10-k includes forward-looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of 1995. all statements other than statements of historical fact, including statements regarding guidance, industry prospects, or future results of operations or financial position, made in this annual report on form 10-k are forward-looking. we use words such as anticipates, believes, expects, future, intends, and similar expressions to identify forward-looking statements. forward-looking statements reflect management's current expectations and are inherently uncertain. actual results could differ materially for a variety of reasons, including, among others, fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, changes in global economic conditions and customer spending, world events, the rate of growth of the internet, online commerce, and cloud services, the amount that amazon.com invests in new business opportunities and the timing of those investments, the mix of products and services sold to customers, the mix of net sales derived from products as compared with services, the extent to which we owe income or other taxes, competition, management of growth, potential fluctuations in operating results, international growth and expansion, the outcomes of legal proceedings and claims, fulfillment, sortation, delivery, and data center optimization, risks of inventory management, seasonality, the degree to which we enter into, maintain, and develop commercial agreements, proposed and completed acquisitions and strategic transactions, payments risks, and risks of fulfillment throughput and productivity. in addition, the current global economic climate amplifies many of these risks. these risks and uncertainties, as well as other risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ significantly from management's expectations, are described in greater detail in item 1a of part i, "risk factors."
overview our primary source of revenue is the sale of a wide range of products and services to customers. the products offered through our consumer-facing websites and physical stores primarily include merchandise and content we have purchased for resale from vendors and products offered by third-party sellers, and we also manufacture and sell electronic devices. generally, we recognize gross revenue from items we sell from our inventory as product sales and recognize our net share of revenue of items sold by third-party sellers as service sales. we seek to increase unit sales across our businesses, through increased product selection, across numerous product categories. we also offer other services such as compute, storage, and database offerings, fulfillment, publishing, certain digital content subscriptions, advertising, and co-branded credit cards.
our financial focus is on long-term, sustainable growth in free cash flows1. free cash flows are driven primarily by increasing operating income and efficiently managing working capital2 and cash capital expenditures, including our decision to purchase or lease property and equipment. increases in operating income primarily result from increases in sales of products and services and efficiently managing our operating costs, partially offset by investments we make in longer-term strategic initiatives. to increase sales of products and services, we focus on improving all aspects of the customer experience, including lowering prices, improving availability, offering faster delivery and performance times, increasing selection, increasing product categories and service offerings, expanding product information, improving ease of use, improving reliability, and earning customer trust.
we seek to reduce our variable costs per unit and work to leverage our fixed costs. our variable costs include product and content costs, payment processing and related transaction costs, picking, packaging, and preparing orders for shipment, transportation, customer service support, costs necessary to run aws, and a portion of our marketing costs. our fixed costs include the costs necessary to build and run our technology infrastructure; to build, enhance, and add features to our websites and web services, our electronic devices, and digital offerings; and to build and optimize our fulfillment centers and physical stores. variable costs generally change directly with sales volume, while fixed costs generally are dependent on the timing of capacity needs, geographic expansion, category expansion, and other factors. to decrease our variable costs on a per unit basis and enable us to lower prices for customers, we seek to increase our direct sourcing, increase discounts from suppliers, and reduce defects in our processes. to minimize growth in fixed costs, we seek to improve process efficiencies and maintain a lean culture.
(1)   see "results of operations-non-gaap financial measures" below for additional information on our non-gaap free cash flows financial measures.
(2)   working capital consists of accounts receivable, inventory, and accounts payable.
because of our model we are able to turn our inventory quickly and have a cash-generating operating cycle3. on average, our high inventory velocity means we generally collect from consumers before our payments to suppliers come due. we expect variability in inventory turnover over time since it is affected by numerous factors, including our product mix, the mix of sales by us and by third-party sellers, our continuing focus on in-stock inventory availability and selection of product offerings, our investment in new geographies and product lines, and the extent to which we choose to utilize third-party fulfillment providers. we also expect some variability in accounts payable days over time since they are affected by several factors, including the mix of product sales, the mix of sales by third-party sellers, the mix of suppliers, seasonality, and changes in payment terms over time, including the effect of balancing pricing and timing of payment terms with suppliers.
we expect spending in technology and content will increase over time as we add computer scientists, designers, software and hardware engineers, and merchandising employees. our technology and content investment and capital spending projects often support a variety of product and service offerings due to geographic expansion and the cross-functionality of our systems and operations. we seek to invest efficiently in several areas of technology and content, including aws, and expansion of new and existing product categories and service offerings, as well as in technology infrastructure to enhance the customer experience and improve our process efficiencies. we believe that advances in technology, specifically the speed and reduced cost of processing power and the advances of wireless connectivity, will continue to improve the consumer experience on the internet and increase its ubiquity in people's lives. to best take advantage of these continued advances in technology, we are investing in initiatives to build and deploy innovative and efficient software and electronic devices. we are also investing in aws, which offers a broad set of global compute, storage, database, and other service offerings to developers and enterprises of all sizes.
we seek to efficiently manage shareholder dilution while maintaining the flexibility to issue shares for strategic purposes, such as financings, acquisitions, and aligning employee compensation with shareholders' interests. we utilize restricted stock units as our primary vehicle for equity compensation because we believe this compensation model aligns the long-term interests of our shareholders and employees. in measuring shareholder dilution, we include all vested and unvested stock awards outstanding, without regard to estimated forfeitures. total shares outstanding plus outstanding stock awards were 497 million and 504 million as of december 31, 2016 and 2017.
our financial reporting currency is the u.s. dollar and changes in foreign exchange rates significantly affect our reported results and consolidated trends. for example, if the u.s. dollar weakens year-over-year relative to currencies in our international locations, our consolidated net sales and operating expenses will be higher than if currencies had remained constant. likewise, if the u.s. dollar strengthens year-over-year relative to currencies in our international locations, our consolidated net sales and operating expenses will be lower than if currencies had remained constant. we believe that our increasing diversification beyond the u.s. economy through our growing international businesses benefits our shareholders over the long-term. we also believe it is useful to evaluate our operating results and growth rates before and after the effect of currency changes.
in addition, the remeasurement of our intercompany balances can result in significant gains and losses associated with the effect of movements in foreign currency exchange rates. currency volatilities may continue, which may significantly impact (either positively or negatively) our reported results and consolidated trends and comparisons.
for additional information about each line item summarized above, refer to item 8 of part ii, "financial statements and supplementary data-note 1-description of business and accounting policies."
(3)   the operating cycle is the number of days of sales in inventory plus the number of days of sales in accounts receivable minus accounts payable days.
critical accounting judgments the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles of the united states ("gaap") requires estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. the sec has defined a company's critical accounting policies as the ones that are most important to the portrayal of the company's financial condition and results of operations, and which require the company to make its most difficult and subjective judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain. based on this definition, we have identified the critical accounting policies and judgments addressed below. we also have other key accounting policies, which involve the use of estimates, judgments, and assumptions that are significant to understanding our results. for additional information, see item 8 of part ii, "financial statements and supplementary data-note 1-description of business and accounting policies." although we believe that our estimates, assumptions, and judgments are reasonable, they are based upon information presently available. actual results may differ significantly from these estimates under different assumptions, judgments, or conditions.
inventories inventories, consisting of products available for sale, are primarily accounted for using the first-in first-out method, and are valued at the lower of cost and net realizable value. this valuation requires us to make judgments, based on currently available information, about the likely method of disposition, such as through sales to individual customers, returns to product vendors, or liquidations, and expected recoverable values of each disposition category. these assumptions about future disposition of inventory are inherently uncertain and changes in our estimates and assumptions may cause us to realize material write-downs in the future. as a measure of sensitivity, for every 1% of additional inventory valuation allowance as of december 31, 2017, we would have recorded an additional cost of sales of approximately $180 million.
in addition, we enter into supplier commitments for certain electronic device components and certain products offered in our whole foods market stores. these commitments are based on forecasted customer demand. if we reduce these commitments, we may incur additional costs.
income taxes we are subject to income taxes in the u.s. (federal and state) and numerous foreign jurisdictions. tax laws, regulations, and administrative practices in various jurisdictions may be subject to significant change, with or without notice, due to economic, political, and other conditions, and significant judgment is required in evaluating and estimating our provision and accruals for these taxes. there are many transactions that occur during the ordinary course of business for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. our effective tax rates could be affected by numerous factors, such as intercompany transactions, the relative amount of our foreign earnings, including earnings being lower than anticipated in jurisdictions where we have lower statutory rates and higher than anticipated in jurisdictions where we have higher statutory rates, the applicability of special tax regimes, losses incurred in jurisdictions for which we are not able to realize the related tax benefit, changes in foreign currency exchange rates, entry into new businesses and geographies, changes to our existing businesses and operations, acquisitions (including integrations) and investments and how they are financed, changes in our stock price, changes in our deferred tax assets and liabilities and their valuation, and changes in the relevant tax, accounting, and other laws, regulations, administrative practices, principles, and interpretations. in addition, a number of countries are actively pursuing changes to their tax laws applicable to corporate multinationals, such as the recently enacted u.s. tax reform legislation commonly referred to as the u.s. tax cuts and jobs act of 2017 (the "2017 tax act"). finally, foreign governments may enact tax laws in response to the 2017 tax act that could result in further changes to global taxation and materially affect our financial position and results of operations.
the 2017 tax act significantly changes how the u.s. taxes corporations. the 2017 tax act requires complex computations to be performed that were not previously required in u.s. tax law, significant judgments to be made in interpretation of the provisions of the 2017 tax act and significant estimates in calculations, and the preparation and analysis of information not previously relevant or regularly produced. the u.s. treasury department, the irs, and other standard-setting bodies could interpret or issue guidance on how provisions of the 2017 tax act will be applied or otherwise administered that is different from our interpretation. as we complete our analysis of the 2017 tax act, collect and prepare necessary data, and interpret any additional guidance, we may make adjustments to provisional amounts that we have recorded that may materially impact our provision for income taxes in the period in which the adjustments are made.
we are also currently subject to audit in various jurisdictions, and these jurisdictions may assess additional income tax liabilities against us. developments in an audit, litigation, or the relevant laws, regulations, administrative practices, principles, and interpretations could have a material effect on our operating results or cash flows in the period or periods for which that development occurs, as well as for prior and subsequent periods. for instance, we have received notices of proposed adjustment ("nopas") from the irs for transactions undertaken in the 2005 and 2006 calendar years relating to transfer
pricing with our foreign subsidiaries and we have been contesting the matter in u.s. tax court. on march 23, 2017, the u.s. tax court issued its decision regarding the issues raised in the irs nopas. the tax court rejected the approach from the irs nopas in determining transfer pricing adjustments in 2005 and 2006 for the transactions undertaken with our foreign subsidiaries and adopted, with adjustments, our suggested approach. on september 29, 2017, the irs filed a notice of appeal to the u.s. court of appeals for the ninth circuit. we will continue to defend ourselves vigorously in this matter. if the tax court decision were reversed on appeal or if the irs were to successfully assert transfer pricing adjustments of a similar nature to the nopas for transactions in subsequent years, we could be subject to significant additional tax liabilities. in addition, in october 2014, the european commission opened a formal investigation to examine whether decisions by the tax authorities in luxembourg with regard to the corporate income tax paid by certain of our subsidiaries comply with european union rules on state aid. on october 4, 2017, the european commission announced its decision that determinations by the tax authorities in luxembourg did not comply with european union rules on state aid. this decision orders luxembourg to calculate and recover additional taxes from us for the period may 2006 through june 2014. we believe this decision to be without merit and will consider our legal options, including an appeal. in december 2017, luxembourg appealed the european commission's decision. while the european commission announced an estimated recovery amount of approximately €250 million, plus interest, the actual amount of additional taxes subject to recovery is to be calculated by the luxembourg tax authorities in accordance with the european commission's guidance. although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, the final outcome of tax audits, investigations, and any related litigation could be materially different from our historical income tax provisions and accruals.
recent accounting pronouncements see item 8 of part ii, "financial statements and supplementary data-note 1-description of business and accounting policies."
liquidity and capital resources cash flow information, which reflects retrospective adjustments to our consolidated statements of cash flows as described in item 8 of part ii, "financial statements and supplementary data - note 1 - description of business and accounting policies - accounting pronouncements recently adopted," is as follows (in millions):
operating activities            $12,039               $17,272               $18,434
our principal sources of liquidity are cash flows generated from operations and our cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities balances, which, at fair value, were $19.8 billion, $26.0 billion, and $31.0 billion as of december 31, 2015, 2016, and 2017. amounts held in foreign currencies were $7.3 billion, $9.1 billion, and $11.1 billion, as of december 31, 2015, 2016, and 2017, and were primarily euros, japanese yen, and british pounds.
cash provided by (used in) operating activities was $12.0 billion, $17.3 billion, and $18.4 billion in 2015, 2016, and 2017. our operating cash flows result primarily from cash received from our consumer, seller, developer, enterprise, and content creator customers, advertising agreements, and our co-branded credit card agreements, offset by cash payments we make for products and services, employee compensation (less amounts capitalized related to internal-use software that are reflected as cash used in investing activities), payment processing and related transaction costs, operating leases, and interest payments on our long-term obligations. cash received from our customers and other activities generally corresponds to our net sales. because consumers primarily use credit cards to buy from us, our receivables from consumers settle quickly. the increase in operating cash flow in 2016, compared to the comparable prior year period, was primarily due to the increase in net income, excluding non-cash charges such as depreciation, amortization, and stock-based compensation. the increase in operating cash flow in 2017, compared to the comparable prior year period, was primarily due to the increase in net income, excluding non-cash charges such as depreciation, amortization, and stock-based compensation. cash provided by (used in) operating activities is also subject to changes in working capital. working capital at any specific point in time is subject to many variables, including seasonality, inventory management and category expansion, the timing of cash receipts and payments, vendor payment terms, and fluctuations in foreign exchange rates.
cash provided by (used in) investing activities corresponds with cash capital expenditures, including leasehold improvements, internal-use software and website development costs, incentives received from property and equipment vendors, cash outlays for acquisitions, investments in other companies and intellectual property rights, and purchases, sales, and maturities of marketable securities. cash provided by (used in) investing activities was $(6.5) billion, $(9.9) billion, and $(27.8) billion in 2015, 2016, and 2017, with the variability caused primarily by cash paid for acquisitions, our decision to purchase or lease property and equipment, and purchases, maturities, and sales of marketable securities. cash capital expenditures were $4.6 billion, $6.7 billion, and $10.1 billion in 2015, 2016, and 2017, which primarily reflect additional capacity to support our fulfillment operations and additional investments in support of continued business growth in technology infrastructure (the majority of which is to support aws), during all three periods. capital expenditures included $528 million, $417 million, and $311 million for internal-use software and website development in 2015, 2016, and 2017. stock-based compensation capitalized for internal-use software and website development costs does not affect cash flows. in 2015, 2016, and 2017, we made cash payments, net of acquired cash, related to acquisition and other investment activity of $795 million, $116 million, and $14.0 billion.
cash provided by (used in) financing activities was $(3.9) billion, $(3.7) billion, and $9.9 billion in 2015, 2016, and 2017. cash outflows from financing activities result from principal repayments on obligations related to capital leases and finance leases and repayments of long-term debt and other. principal repayments on obligations related to capital leases and finance leases and repayments of long-term debt and other were $4.2 billion, $4.4 billion, and $6.4 billion in 2015, 2016, and 2017. property and equipment acquired under capital leases were $4.7 billion, $5.7 billion, and $9.6 billion in 2015, 2016, and 2017, with the increase reflecting investments in support of continued business growth primarily due to investments in technology infrastructure for aws, which investments we expect to continue over time. cash inflows from financing activities primarily result from proceeds from long-term debt. proceeds from long-term debt and other were $353 million, $621 million, and $16.2 billion in 2015, 2016, and 2017. during 2017, cash inflows from financing activities consisted primarily of net proceeds from the issuance of $16.0 billion of senior unsecured notes in seven tranches maturing in 2020 through 2057. the proceeds from notes issued in august 2017 (the "august 2017 notes") were used to fund the consideration for the acquisition of whole foods market, to repay the 1.200% notes due november 2017, and for general corporate purposes. see item 8 of part ii, "financial statements and supplementary data-note 5-long-term debt" for additional discussion of the notes.
we had no borrowings outstanding under our $3.0 billion unsecured revolving credit facility (the "credit agreement") and $592 million of borrowings outstanding under our $600 million secured revolving credit facility (the "credit facility") as of december 31, 2017. see item 8 of part ii, "financial statements and supplementary data-note 5-long-term debt" for additional information.
in 2015, 2016, and 2017, we recorded net tax provisions of $950 million, $1.4 billion, and $769 million. the 2017 tax act includes a mandatory one-time tax on accumulated earnings of foreign subsidiaries, and as a result, all previously unremitted earnings for which no u.s. deferred tax liability had been accrued have now been subject to u.s. tax. notwithstanding the u.s. taxation of these amounts, we intend to continue to invest most or all of these earnings, as well as our capital in these subsidiaries, indefinitely outside of the u.s. and do not expect to incur any significant, additional taxes related to such amounts. as of december 31, 2017, cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities held by foreign subsidiaries was $9.6 billion.
we have tax benefits relating to excess stock-based compensation deductions and accelerated depreciation deductions that are being utilized to reduce our u.s. taxable income. the 2017 tax act extended through 2026 and enhanced the option to claim accelerated depreciation deductions on qualifying property. cash taxes paid (net of refunds) were $273 million, $412 million, and $957 million for 2015, 2016, and 2017. as of december 31, 2017, our federal net operating loss carryforward was approximately $226 million and we had approximately $855 million of federal tax credits potentially available to offset future tax liabilities. our federal tax credits are primarily related to the u.s. federal research and development credit. as we utilize our federal net operating losses and tax credits we expect cash paid for taxes to increase. we endeavor to manage our global taxes on a cash basis, rather than on a financial reporting basis. in connection with its october 2017 decision against us on state aid, the european commission announced an estimated recovery amount of approximately €250 million, plus interest. the actual amount of additional taxes subject to recovery is to be calculated by the luxembourg tax authorities in accordance with the european commission's guidance. once the recovery amount is computed by luxembourg, we anticipate funding it, including interest, into escrow, where it will remain pending conclusion of all appeals. we may be required to fund into escrow an amount in excess of the estimated recovery amount announced by the european commission.
our liquidity is also affected by restricted cash balances that are pledged as collateral for real estate leases, workers' compensation obligations, amounts due to third-party sellers in certain jurisdictions, debt, and standby and trade letters of credit. to the extent we process payments for third-party sellers or offer certain types of stored value to our customers, some jurisdictions may restrict our use of those funds. these restrictions would result in the reclassification of a portion of our cash and cash equivalents from "cash and cash equivalents" to restricted cash, which is classified within "accounts receivable, net and other" on our consolidated balance sheets. as of december 31, 2016 and 2017, restricted cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities were $600 million and $1.3 billion. see item 8 of part ii, "financial statements and supplementary data
-note 7-commitments and contingencies" for additional discussion of our principal contractual commitments, as well as our pledged assets. additionally, purchase obligations and open purchase orders, consisting of inventory and significant non-inventory commitments, were $13.0 billion as of december 31, 2017. these purchase obligations and open purchase orders are generally cancellable in full or in part through the contractual provisions.
we believe that cash flows generated from operations and our cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities balances, as well as borrowing available under our credit agreements, will be sufficient to meet our anticipated operating cash needs for at least the next 12 months. however, any projections of future cash needs and cash flows are subject to substantial uncertainty. see item 1a of part i, "risk factors." we continually evaluate opportunities to sell additional equity or debt securities, obtain credit facilities, obtain capital, finance, and operating lease arrangements, repurchase common stock, pay dividends, or repurchase, refinance, or otherwise restructure our debt for strategic reasons or to further strengthen our financial position.
the sale of additional equity or convertible debt securities would likely be dilutive to our shareholders. in addition, we will, from time to time, consider the acquisition of, or investment in, complementary businesses, products, services, capital infrastructure, and technologies, which might affect our liquidity requirements or cause us to secure additional financing, or issue additional equity or debt securities. there can be no assurance that additional credit lines or financing instruments will be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to us, if at all.
results of operations we have organized our operations into three segments: north america, international, and aws. our results reflect the operations of whole foods market from the date of acquisition. in q1 2017, we combined stock-based compensation and "other operating expense, net" with operating expenses in our presentation of segment results. these segments reflect the way the company evaluates its business performance and manages its operations. see item 8 of part ii, "financial statements and supplementary data-note 11-segment information."
net sales net sales include product and service sales. product sales represent revenue from the sale of products and related shipping fees and digital media content where we record revenue gross. service sales represent third-party seller fees earned (including commissions) and related shipping fees, aws sales, certain digital content subscriptions, certain advertising services, and our co-branded credit card agreements. amazon prime membership fees are allocated between product sales and service sales and amortized over the life of the membership according to the estimated delivery of services. net sales information is as follows (in millions):
year-over-year percentage growth:
year-over-year percentage growth, excluding the effect of foreign exchange rates:
sales increased 27% and 31% in 2016 and 2017, compared to the comparable prior year periods. changes in foreign currency exchange rates impacted net sales by $(5.2) billion, $(550) million, and $210 million for 2015, 2016, and 2017. for a discussion of the effect on sales growth of foreign exchange rates, see "effect of foreign exchange rates" below.
north america sales increased 25% and 33% in 2016 and 2017, compared to the comparable prior year periods. the sales growth in each year primarily reflects increased unit sales, including sales by third-party sellers, and, in 2017, the impact of the acquisition of whole foods market. increased unit sales were driven largely by our continued efforts to reduce prices for our customers, including from our shipping offers, increased in-stock inventory availability, and increased selection.
international sales increased 24% and 23% in 2016, and 2017, compared to the comparable prior year periods. the sales growth in each year primarily reflects increased unit sales, including sales by third-party sellers. increased unit sales were driven largely by our continued efforts to reduce prices for our customers, including from our shipping offers, increased in-stock inventory availability, and increased selection. changes in foreign currency exchange rates impacted international net sales by $(5.0) billion, $(489) million, and $138 million in 2015, 2016, and 2017.
aws sales increased 55% and 43% in 2016 and 2017, compared to the comparable prior year periods. the sales growth primarily reflects increased customer usage, partially offset by pricing changes. pricing changes were driven largely by our continued efforts to reduce prices for our customers.
operating income (loss)
operating income (loss) by segment is as follows (in millions):
operating income (loss):
operating income was $2.2 billion, $4.2 billion, and $4.1 billion for 2015, 2016, and 2017. we believe that operating income (loss) is a more meaningful measure than gross profit and gross margin due to the diversity of our product categories and services.
the increase in north america operating income in absolute dollars in 2016 and 2017, compared to the comparable prior year periods, is primarily due to increased unit sales, including sales by third-party sellers, partially offset by increased levels of operating expenses to expand our fulfillment network and spending on technology and content and marketing efforts. changes in foreign exchange rates impacted operating income by $30 million, $27 million, and $(4) million for 2015, 2016, and 2017.
the increase in international operating loss in absolute dollars in 2016 and 2017, compared to the comparable prior year periods, is primarily due to increased levels of operating expenses to expand our fulfillment network and spending on technology and content and marketing efforts, partially offset by increased unit sales, including sales by third-party sellers. changes in foreign exchange rates impacted operating loss by $(278) million, $89 million, and $(85) million for 2015, 2016, and 2017.
the increase in aws operating income in absolute dollars in 2016 and 2017, compared to the comparable prior year periods, is primarily due to increased customer usage and cost structure productivity, partially offset by pricing changes and increased spending on technology infrastructure and sales and marketing expenses and related payroll, which was primarily driven by additional investments to support the business growth. changes in foreign exchange rates impacted operating income by $264 million, $(5) million, and $(53) million for 2015, 2016, and 2017.
operating expenses information about operating expenses is as follows (in millions):
operating expenses:
cost of sales                           $71,651                 $88,265                $111,934

cost of sales cost of sales primarily consists of the purchase price of consumer products, digital media content costs where we record revenue gross, including video and music, packaging supplies, sortation and delivery center and related equipment costs, and inbound and outbound shipping costs, including where we are the transportation service provider.
the increase in cost of sales in absolute dollars in 2016 and 2017, compared to the comparable prior year periods, is primarily due to increased product and shipping costs resulting from increased sales.
shipping costs to receive products from our suppliers are included in our inventory and recognized as cost of sales upon sale of products to our customers. shipping costs, which include sortation and delivery center and transportation costs, were $11.5 billion, $16.2 billion, and $21.7 billion in 2015, 2016, and 2017. we expect our cost of shipping to continue to increase to the extent our customers accept and use our shipping offers at an increasing rate, we reduce shipping rates, we use more expensive shipping methods, and we offer additional services. we seek to mitigate costs of shipping over time in part through achieving higher sales volumes, optimizing our fulfillment network, negotiating better terms with our suppliers, and achieving better operating efficiencies. we believe that offering low prices to our customers is fundamental to our future success, and one way we offer lower prices is through shipping offers.
costs to operate our aws segment are primarily classified as "technology and content" as we leverage a shared infrastructure that supports both our internal technology requirements and external sales to aws customers.
fulfillment fulfillment costs primarily consist of those costs incurred in operating and staffing our north america and international fulfillment centers, customer service centers, and physical stores and payment processing costs. while aws payment processing and related transaction costs are included in fulfillment, aws costs are primarily classified as "technology and content." fulfillment costs as a percentage of net sales may vary due to several factors, such as payment processing and related transaction costs, our level of productivity and accuracy, changes in volume, size, and weight of units received and fulfilled, timing of fulfillment network and physical store expansion, the extent we utilize fulfillment services provided by third parties, mix of products and services sold, and our ability to affect customer service contacts per unit by implementing improvements in our operations and enhancements to our customer self-service features. additionally, because payment processing and fulfillment costs associated with seller transactions are based on the gross purchase price of underlying transactions, and payment processing and related transaction and fulfillment costs are higher as a percentage of sales versus our retail sales, sales by our sellers have higher fulfillment costs as a percent of net sales.
the increase in fulfillment costs in absolute dollars in 2016 and 2017, compared to the comparable prior year periods, is primarily due to variable costs corresponding with increased product and service sales volume and inventory levels, and costs from expanding our fulfillment network, which includes physical stores.
we seek to expand our fulfillment network to accommodate a greater selection and in-stock inventory levels and to meet anticipated shipment volumes from sales of our own products as well as sales by third parties for which we provide the fulfillment services. we regularly evaluate our facility requirements.
marketing we direct customers to our websites primarily through a number of targeted online marketing channels, such as our sponsored search, associates program, social and online advertising, television advertising, and other initiatives. our marketing costs are largely variable, based on growth in sales and changes in rates. to the extent there is increased or decreased competition for these traffic sources, or to the extent our mix of these channels shifts, we would expect to see a corresponding change in our marketing costs.
the increase in marketing costs in absolute dollars in 2016 and 2017, compared to the comparable prior year periods, is primarily due to payroll and related expenses, as well as increased spending on online marketing channels.
while costs associated with amazon prime memberships and other shipping offers are not included in marketing expense, we view these offers as effective worldwide marketing tools, and intend to continue offering them indefinitely.
technology and content technology and content costs include payroll and related expenses for employees involved in the research and development of new and existing products and services, development, design, and maintenance of our websites, curation and display of products and services made available on our websites, and infrastructure costs. infrastructure costs include servers, networking equipment, and data center related depreciation, rent, utilities, and other expenses necessary to support aws, as well as these and other efforts. collectively, these costs reflect the investments we make in order to offer a wide variety of products and services to our customers.
we seek to invest efficiently in numerous areas of technology and content so we may continue to enhance the customer experience and improve our process efficiency through rapid technology developments, while operating at an ever increasing scale. our technology and content investment and capital spending projects often support a variety of product and service offerings due to geographic expansion and the cross-functionality of our systems and operations. we expect spending in technology and content to increase over time as we continue to add employees and technology infrastructure. these costs are allocated to segments based on usage. the increase in technology and content costs in absolute dollars in 2016 and 2017, compared to the comparable prior year periods, is primarily due to increased payroll and related costs associated with technical teams responsible for expanding our existing products and services and initiatives to introduce new products and service offerings, and an increase in spending on technology infrastructure.
for 2015, 2016, and 2017, we capitalized $642 million (including $114 million of stock-based compensation), $511 million (including $94 million of stock-based compensation), and $395 million (including $84 million of stock-based compensation) of costs associated with internal-use software and website development. amortization of previously capitalized amounts was $635 million, $634 million, and $545 million for 2015, 2016, and 2017.
general and administrative the increase in general and administrative costs in absolute dollars in 2016 and 2017, compared to the comparable prior year periods, is primarily due to increases in payroll and related expenses and professional service fees.
other operating expense, net other operating expense, net was $171 million, $167 million, and $214 million during 2015, 2016, and 2017, and was primarily related to the amortization of intangible assets.
interest income and expense our interest income was $50 million, $100 million, and $202 million during 2015, 2016, and 2017. we generally invest our excess cash in investment grade short- to intermediate-term fixed income securities and aaa-rated money market funds. our interest income corresponds with the average balance of invested funds based on the prevailing rates, which vary depending on the geographies and currencies in which they are invested.
interest expense was $459 million, $484 million, and $848 million in 2015, 2016, and 2017. the increase is primarily due to increases in our capital and finance lease arrangements and long-term debt.
our long-term debt was $7.7 billion and $24.7 billion as of december 31, 2016 and 2017. our other long-term liabilities were $12.6 billion and $21.0 billion as of december 31, 2016 and 2017. see item 8 of part ii, "financial statements and supplementary data-note 5-long-term debt and note 6-other long-term liabilities" for additional information.
other income (expense), net other income (expense), net was $(256) million, $90 million, and $346 million during 2015, 2016, and 2017. the primary component of other income (expense), net is related to foreign currency and equity warrant valuation.
income taxes our effective tax rate is subject to significant variation due to several factors, including variability in our pre-tax and taxable income and loss and the mix of jurisdictions to which they relate, changes in how we do business, acquisitions (including integrations) and investments, audit-related developments, changes in our stock price, foreign currency gains (losses), tax law developments (including changes in statutes, regulations, case law, and administrative practices), and relative changes of expenses or losses for which tax benefits are not recognized. additionally, our effective tax rate can be more or less volatile based on the amount of pre-tax income or loss. for example, the impact of discrete items and non-deductible expenses on our effective tax rate is greater when our pre-tax income is lower.
the 2017 tax act was signed into law on december 22, 2017. the 2017 tax act significantly revises the u.s. corporate income tax by, among other things, lowering the statutory corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%, eliminating certain deductions, imposing a mandatory one-time tax on accumulated earnings of foreign subsidiaries as of 2017, introducing new tax regimes, and changing how foreign earnings are subject to u.s. tax. the 2017 tax act also enhanced and extended through 2026 the option to claim accelerated depreciation deductions on qualified property. we have not completed our determination of the accounting implications of the 2017 tax act on our tax accruals. however, we have reasonably estimated the effects of the 2017 tax act and recorded provisional amounts in our financial statements as of december 31, 2017. we recorded a provisional tax benefit for the impact of the 2017 tax act of approximately $789 million. this amount is primarily comprised of the remeasurement of federal net deferred tax liabilities resulting from the permanent reduction in the u.s. statutory corporate tax rate to 21% from 35%, after taking into account the mandatory one-time tax on the accumulated earnings of our foreign subsidiaries. the amount of this one-time tax is not material. as we complete our analysis of the 2017 tax act, collect and prepare necessary data, and interpret any additional guidance issued by the u.s. treasury department, the irs, and other standard-setting bodies, we may make adjustments to the provisional amounts. those adjustments may materially impact our provision for income taxes in the period in which the adjustments are made.
we recorded a provision for income taxes of $950 million, $1.4 billion, and $769 million in 2015, 2016, and 2017. our provision for income taxes in 2016 was higher than in 2015 primarily due to an increase in u.s. pre-tax income, partially offset by an increase in the proportion of foreign losses for which we may realize a tax benefit, an increase in tax amortization deductions, and a decline in the proportion of nondeductible expenses. we have recorded valuation allowances against the deferred tax assets associated with losses for which we may not realize a related tax benefit.
our provision for income taxes in 2017 was lower than in 2016 primarily due to excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation and the provisional favorable effect of the 2017 tax act, partially offset by an increase in the proportion of foreign losses for which we may not realize a tax benefit and audit-related developments.
we regularly assess whether it is more likely than not that we will realize our deferred tax assets in each taxing jurisdiction in which we operate. in performing this assessment with respect to each jurisdiction, we review all available evidence, including recent cumulative loss experience and expectations of future earnings, capital gains, and investment in such jurisdiction, the carry-forward periods available to us for tax reporting purposes, and other relevant factors. in q2 2017, we
recognized an estimated charge to tax expense of $600 million to record a valuation allowance against the net deferred tax assets in luxembourg.
we have tax benefits relating to excess stock-based compensation deductions and accelerated depreciation deductions that are being utilized to reduce our u.s. taxable income. the 2017 tax act enhanced and extended through 2026 the option to claim accelerated depreciation deductions on qualifying property. as of december 31, 2017, our federal net operating loss carryforward was approximately $226 million and we had approximately $855 million of federal tax credits potentially available to offset future tax liabilities. our federal tax credits are primarily related to the u.s. federal research and development credit.
see item 8 of part ii, "financial statements and supplementary data-note 10-income taxes" for additional information.
equity-method investment activity, net of tax equity-method investment activity, net of tax, was $(22) million, $(96) million, and $(4) million in 2015, 2016, and 2017. the primary components of this activity during 2015, 2016, and 2017 were our equity-method investment losses during the periods and impairments recorded in 2016.
non-gaap financial measures regulation g, conditions for use of non-gaap financial measures, and other sec regulations define and prescribe the conditions for use of certain non-gaap financial information. our measures of free cash flows and the effect of foreign exchange rates on our consolidated statements of operations, meet the definition of non-gaap financial measures.
we provide multiple measures of free cash flows because we believe these measures provide additional perspective on the impact of acquiring property and equipment with cash and through capital and finance leases. as a result of the adoption of new accounting guidance, we retrospectively adjusted our consolidated statements of cash flows to reclassify excess tax benefits of $119 million and $829 million in 2015 and 2016 from financing activities to operating activities.
free cash flow free cash flow is cash flow from operations reduced by "purchases of property and equipment, including internal-use software and website development, net of proceeds from property and equipment incentives," which both are included in cash flow from investing activities. the following is a reconciliation of free cash flow to the most comparable gaap cash flow measure, "net cash provided by (used in) operating activities," for 2015, 2016, and 2017 (in millions):
net cash provided by (used in) operating activities                                                                                                      $12,039               $17,272                 $18,434

free cash flow less lease principal repayments free cash flow less lease principal repayments is free cash flow reduced by "principal repayments of capital lease obligations," and "principal repayments of finance lease obligations," which are included in cash flow from financing activities. free cash flow less lease principal repayments approximates the actual payments of cash for our capital and finance leases. the following is a reconciliation of free cash flow less lease principal repayments to the most comparable gaap cash flow measure, "net cash provided by (used in) operating activities," for 2015, 2016, and 2017 (in millions):

free cash flow less finance lease principal repayments and assets acquired under capital leases free cash flow less finance lease principal repayments and assets acquired under capital leases is free cash flow reduced by "principal repayments of finance lease obligations," which is included in cash flow from financing activities, and property and equipment acquired under capital leases. in this measure, property and equipment acquired under capital leases is reflected as if these assets had been purchased with cash, which is not the case as these assets have been leased. the following is a reconciliation of free cash flow less finance lease principal repayments and assets acquired under capital leases to the most comparable gaap cash flow measure, "net cash provided by (used in) operating activities," for 2015, 2016, and 2017 (in millions):
net cash provided by (used in) operating activities                                                                                                      $12,039               $17,272                 $18,434

all of these free cash flows measures have limitations as they omit certain components of the overall cash flow statement and do not represent the residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures. for example, these measures of free cash flows do not incorporate the portion of payments representing principal reductions of debt or cash payments for business acquisitions. additionally, our mix of property and equipment acquisitions with cash or other financing options may change over time. therefore, we believe it is important to view free cash flows measures only as a complement to our entire consolidated statements of cash flows.
effect of foreign exchange rates information regarding the effect of foreign exchange rates, versus the u.s. dollar, on our net sales, operating expenses, and operating income is provided to show reported period operating results had the foreign exchange rates remained the same as those in effect in the comparable prior year periods. the effect on our net sales, operating expenses, and operating income from changes in our foreign exchange rates versus the u.s. dollar is as follows (in millions):

guidance we provided guidance on february 1, 2018, in our earnings release furnished on form 8-k as set forth below. these forward-looking statements reflect amazon.com's expectations as of february 1, 2018, and are subject to substantial uncertainty. our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors, such as fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, changes in global economic conditions and customer spending, world events, the rate of growth of the internet, online commerce, and cloud services, as well as those outlined in item 1a of part i, "risk factors."
•   net sales are expected to be between $47.75 billion and $50.75 billion, or to grow between 34% and 42% compared with first quarter 2017. this guidance anticipates a favorable impact of approximately $1.2 billion or 330 basis points from foreign exchange rates.
•   operating income is expected to be between $300 million and $1.0 billion, compared with $1.0 billion in first quarter 2017.
•   this guidance assumes, among other things, that no additional business acquisitions, investments, restructurings, or legal settlements are concluded.

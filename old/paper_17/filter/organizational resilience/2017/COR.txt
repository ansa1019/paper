in june 2017 we announced a new organizational structure, described in the management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in part ii, item 7 below, designed to further align the organization to its customer needs in a more seamless and unified way, while supporting corporate strategy, accelerating growth, and improving efficiency. there can be no assurance that we will realize, in full or in part, the anticipated benefits of these changes. our financial goals assume a level of productivity improvement from our business optimization initiatives. our ability to successfully manage and execute these initiatives and realize expected savings and benefits is important to our business success. the reorganization and other initiatives could yield unintended consequences such as distraction of our management and employees, business disruption, attrition, inability to attract or retain key personnel, and reduced employee productivity which could negatively affect our business, sales, financial condition, and results of operations. moreover, our restructuring and business process initiatives may result in charges and expenses that impact our operating results. there can be no assurance that the activities under any restructuring and business initiative will result in the desired benefits.

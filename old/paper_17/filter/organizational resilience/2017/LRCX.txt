item 1a.   risk factors in addition to the other information in this annual report on form 10-k ("2017 form 10-k"), the following risk factors should be carefully considered in evaluating the company and its business because such factors may significantly impact our business, operating results, and financial condition. as a result of these risk factors, as well as other risks discussed in our other sec filings, our actual results could differ materially from those projected in any forward-looking statements. no priority or significance is intended, nor should be attached, to the order in which the risk factors appear.
the semiconductor capital equipment industry is subject to variability and periods of rapid growth or decline; we therefore face risks related to our strategic resource allocation decisions the semiconductor capital equipment industry has historically been characterized by rapid changes in demand. the industry environment has moved toward being more characterized by variability across segments and customers accentuated by consolidation within the industry. variability in our customers' business plans may lead to changes in demand for our equipment and services, which could negatively impact our results. the variability in our customers' investments during any particular period is dependent on several factors, including but not limited to electronics demand, economic conditions (both general and in the semiconductor and electronics industries), industry supply and demand, prices for semiconductors, and our customers' ability to develop and manufacture increasingly complex and costly semiconductor devices. the changes in demand may require our management to adjust spending and other resources allocated to operating activities.
during periods of rapid growth or decline in demand for our products and services, we face significant challenges in maintaining adequate financial and business controls, management processes, information systems, and procedures for training and managing our workforce, and in appropriately sizing our supply chain infrastructure and facilities, work force, and other components of our business on a timely basis. if we do not adequately meet these challenges during periods of increasing or declining demand, our gross margins and earnings may be negatively impacted.
we continuously reassess our strategic resource allocation choices in response to the changing business environment. if we do not adequately adapt to the changing business environment, we may lack the infrastructure and resources to scale up our business to meet customer expectations and compete successfully during a period of growth, or we may expand our capacity too rapidly and/or beyond what is appropriate for the actual demand environment, resulting in excess fixed costs.
especially during transitional periods, resource allocation decisions can have a significant impact on our future performance, particularly if we have not accurately anticipated industry changes. our success will depend, to a significant extent, on the ability of our executive officers and other members of our senior management to identify and respond to these challenges effectively.
future declines in the semiconductor industry, and the overall world economic conditions on which it is significantly dependent, could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition our business depends on the capital equipment expenditures of semiconductor manufacturers, which in turn depend on the current and anticipated market demand for integrated circuits. with the consolidation of customers within the industry, the semiconductor capital equipment market may experience rapid changes in demand driven both by changes in the market generally and the plans and requirements of particular customers. the economic, political, and business conditions occurring nationally, globally, or in any of our key sales regions, which are often unpredictable, have historically impacted customer demand for our products and normal commercial relationships with our customers, suppliers, and creditors. additionally, in times of economic uncertainty, our customers' budgets for our products, or their ability to access credit to purchase them, could be adversely affected. this would limit their ability to purchase our products and services. as a result, changing business or economic conditions can cause material adverse changes to our results of operations and financial condition, including but not limited to:
•   a decline in demand for our products or services;
•   an increase in reserves on accounts receivable due to our customers' inability to pay us;
•   an increase in reserves on inventory balances due to excess or obsolete inventory as a result of our inability to sell such inventory;
•   asset impairments including the potential impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets;
•   a decline in the value of our investments;
•   exposure to claims from our suppliers for payment on inventory that is ordered in anticipation of customer purchases that do not come to fruition;
•   a decline in the value of certain facilities we lease to less than our residual value guarantee with the lessor; and
•   challenges maintaining reliable and uninterrupted sources of supply.
fluctuating levels of investment by semiconductor manufacturers may materially affect our aggregate shipments, revenues, operating results, and earnings. where appropriate, we will attempt to respond to these fluctuations with cost management programs aimed at aligning our expenditures with anticipated revenue streams, which sometimes result in restructuring charges. even during periods of reduced revenues, we must continue to invest in r&d and maintain extensive ongoing worldwide customer service and support capabilities to remain competitive, which may temporarily harm our profitability and other financial results.
our quarterly revenues and operating results are variable our revenues and operating results may fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter due to a number of factors, not all of which are in our control. we manage our expense levels based in part on our expectations of future revenues. because our operating expenses are based in part on anticipated future revenues, and a certain amount of those expenses are relatively fixed, a change in the timing of recognition of revenue and/or the level of gross profit from a small number of transactions can unfavorably affect operating results in a particular quarter. factors that may cause our financial results to fluctuate unpredictably include but are not limited to:
•   economic conditions in the electronics and semiconductor industries in general and specifically the semiconductor equipment industry;
•   the size and timing of orders from customers;
•   consolidation of the customer base, which may result in the investment decisions of one customer or market having a significant effect on demand for our products or services;
•   the failure of our suppliers or outsource providers to perform their obligations in a manner consistent with our expectations;
•   customer cancellations or delays in shipments, installations, and/or customer acceptances;
•   the extent that customers continue to purchase and use our products and services in their business;
•   our customers' reuse of existing and installed products, to the extent that such reuse decreases their need to purchase new products or services;
•   changes in average selling prices, customer mix, and product mix;
•   our ability to develop, introduce, and market new, enhanced, and competitive products in a timely manner;
•   our competitors' introduction of new products;
•   transportation, communication, demand, information technology, or supply disruptions based on factors outside our control, such as strikes, acts of god, wars, terrorist activities, and natural or man-made disasters;
•   legal, tax, accounting, or regulatory changes (including but not limited to change in import/export regulations) or changes in the interpretation or enforcement of existing requirements;
•   changes in our estimated effective tax rate;
•   foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations; and
•   the dilutive impact of our convertible notes (as defined below) and related warrants on our earnings per share.
we may incur impairments to goodwill or long-lived assets we review our long-lived assets, including goodwill and other intangible assets, for impairment annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of these assets may not be recoverable. negative industry or economic trends, including reduced market prices of our common stock, reduced estimates of future cash flows, disruptions to our business, slower growth rates, or lack of growth in our relevant business units, could lead to impairment charges against our long-lived assets, including goodwill and other intangible assets. if, in any period, our stock price decreases to the point where our fair value, as determined by our market capitalization, is less than the book value of our assets, this could also indicate a potential impairment, and we may be required to record an impairment charge in that period, which could adversely affect our result of operations.
our valuation methodology for assessing impairment requires management to make judgments and assumptions based on historical experience and to rely heavily on projections of future operating performance. we operate in a highly competitive environment and projections of future operating results and cash flows may vary significantly from actual results. additionally, if our analysis indicates potential impairment to goodwill in one or more of our business units, we may be required to record additional charges to earnings in our financial statements, which could negatively affect our results of operations.
our leverage and debt service obligations and potential note conversion or related hedging activities may adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, and earnings per share we have $2.9 billion in aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes and convertible note instruments outstanding. additionally, we have $750 million available to us in revolving credit arrangements, with an option for us to request an increase in the facility of up to an additional $250 million, for a potential total commitment of $1.0 billion. we may, in the future, decide to borrow amounts under the revolving credit agreement, or to enter into additional debt arrangements.
in addition, we have entered, and in the future may enter, into derivative instrument arrangements to hedge against the variability of cash flows due to changes in the benchmark interest rate of fixed rate debt. we could be exposed to losses in the event of nonperformance by the counterparties to our derivative instruments.
•   risk associated with any inability to satisfy our obligations;
•   a portion of our cash flows that may have to be dedicated to interest and principal payments and may not be available for operations, working capital, capital expenditures, expansion, acquisitions, or general corporate or other purposes; and
•   impairing our ability to obtain additional financing in the future.
our ability to meet our expenses and debt obligations will depend on our future performance, which will be affected by financial, business, economic, regulatory, and other factors. furthermore, our operations may not generate sufficient cash flows, particularly in the united states, to enable us to meet our expenses and service our debt. as a result, we may need to enter into new financing arrangements to obtain the necessary funds. if we continues on next page lam research corporation 2017 10-k 16
conversion of our convertible notes and the exercise of the related warrants may cause dilution to our stockholders and to our earnings per share. the number of shares of our common stock into which the convertible notes are convertible and for which related warrants are exercisable for may be adjusted from time to time, including increases in such rates as a result of dividends that we pay to our stockholders. upon conversion of any convertible notes, we will deliver cash in the amount of the principal amount of the convertible notes and, with respect to any excess conversion value greater than the principal amount of the convertible notes, shares of our common stock, which would result in dilution to our stockholders. this dilution may not be completely mitigated by the hedging transactions we entered into in connection with the sale of certain convertible notes or through share repurchases. prior to the maturity of the convertible notes, if the price of our common stock exceeds the conversion price, u.s. generally accepted accounting principles require that we report an increase in diluted share count, which would result in lower reported earnings per share. the price of our common stock could also be affected by sales of our common stock by investors who view the convertible notes as a more attractive means of equity participation in our company and also by hedging activity that may develop involving our common stock by holders of the convertible notes.
our credit agreements contain covenant restrictions that may limit our ability to operate our business we may be unable to respond to changes in business and economic conditions, engage in transactions that might otherwise be beneficial to us, or obtain additional financing because our debt agreements contain, and any of our other future similar agreements may contain, covenant restrictions that limit our ability to, among other things:
•   incur additional debt, assume obligations in connection with letters of credit, or issue guarantees;
our ability to comply with these covenants is dependent on our future performance, which will be subject to many factors, some of which are beyond our control, including prevailing economic conditions. in addition, our failure to comply with these covenants could result in a default under the senior notes, the convertible notes, or our other debt, which could permit the holders to accelerate such debt. if any of our debt is accelerated, we may not have sufficient funds available to repay such debt, which could materially and negatively affect our financial condition and results of operation.
we have a limited number of key customers sales to a limited number of large customers constitute a significant portion of our overall revenue, shipments, cash flows, collections, and profitability. as a result, the actions of even one customer may subject us to variability in those areas that is difficult to predict. in addition, large customers may be able to negotiate requirements that result in decreased pricing, increased costs, and/or lower margins for us; compliance with specific environmental, social, and corporate governance standards; and limitations on our ability to share jointly developed technology with others. similarly, significant portions of our credit risk may, at any given time, be concentrated among a limited number of customers so that the failure of even one of these key customers to pay its obligations to us could significantly impact our financial results.
we depend on creating new products and processes and enhancing existing products and processes for our success. consequently, we are subject to risks associated with rapid technological change rapid technological changes in semiconductor manufacturing processes subject us to increased pressure to develop technological advances that enable those processes. we believe that our future success depends in part upon our ability to develop and offer new products with improved capabilities and to continue to enhance our existing products. if new products or existing products have reliability, quality, design, or safety problems, our performance may be impacted by reduced orders, higher manufacturing costs, delays in acceptance of and payment for new products, and additional service and warranty expenses. we may be unable to develop and manufacture products successfully, or products that we introduce may fail in the marketplace. for more than 25 years, the primary driver of technology advancement in the semiconductor industry has been to shrink the lithography that prints the circuit design on semiconductor chips. that driver could be approaching its technological limit, leading semiconductor manufacturers to investigate more complex changes in multiple technologies in an effort to continue technology development. in the face of uncertainty on which technology solutions will become successful, we will need to focus our efforts on developing the technology changes that are ultimately successful in supporting our customer requirements. our failure to develop and offer the correct technology solutions in a timely manner with productive and cost-effective products could adversely affect our business in a material way. our failure to commercialize new products in a timely manner could result in loss of market share, unanticipated costs, and inventory obsolescence, which would adversely affect our financial results.
in order to develop new products and processes and enhance existing products and processes, we expect to continue to make significant investments in r&d, to investigate the acquisition of new products and technologies, to invest in or acquire such business or technologies, and to pursue joint development relationships with customers, suppliers, or other members of the industry. our investments and acquisitions may not be as successful as we may expect, particularly as we seek to invest or acquire product lines and technologies that are new to us. we may find that acquisitions are not available to us, for regulatory or other reasons, and that we must therefore limit ourselves to collaboration and joint venture development activities, which do not have the same benefits as acquisitions. pursuing development through collaboration and/or joint development activities rather than through an acquisition poses substantial challenges for management, including those related to aligning business objectives, sharing confidential information and intellectual property, sharing value with third parties, and realizing synergies that might have been available in an acquisition but are not available through a joint development project. we must manage product transitions and joint development relationships successfully, as the introduction of new products could adversely affect our sales of existing products and certain jointly developed technologies may be subject to restrictions on our ability to share that technology with other customers, which could limit our market for products incorporating those technologies. future technologies, processes, or product developments may render our current product offerings obsolete, leaving us with non-competitive products, obsolete inventory, or both. moreover, customers may adopt new technologies or processes to address the complex challenges associated with next-generation devices. this shift may result in a reduction in the size of our addressable markets or could increase the relative size of markets in which we either do not compete or have relatively low market share.
we are subject to risks relating to product concentration and lack of product revenue diversification we derive a substantial percentage of our revenues from a limited number of products. our products are priced up to approximately $10 million per system. as a result, the inability to recognize revenue on even a few systems can cause a significantly adverse impact on our revenues for a given quarter, and, in the longer term, the continued market acceptance of these products is critical to our future success. our business, operating results, financial condition, and cash flows could therefore be adversely affected by:
•   a decline in demand for even a limited number of our products,
•   a failure to achieve continued market acceptance of our key products,
•   export restrictions or other regulatory or legislative actions that could limit our ability to sell those products to key customers or customers within certain markets,
•   an improved version of products being offered by a competitor in the markets in which we participate,
•   increased pressure from competitors that offer broader product lines,
•   technological changes that we are unable to address with our products, or
•   a failure to release new or enhanced versions of our products on a timely basis.
in addition, the fact that we offer limited product lines creates the risk that our customers may view us as less important to their business than our competitors that offer additional products and/or product capabilities. this may impact our ability to maintain or expand our business with certain customers. such product concentration may also subject us to additional risks associated with technology changes. our business is affected by our customers' use of our products in certain steps in their wafer fabrication processes. should technologies change so that the manufacture of semiconductors requires fewer steps using our products, this could have a larger impact on our business than it would on the business of our less concentrated competitors.
strategic alliances and customer consolidation may have negative effects on our business increasingly, semiconductor manufacturing companies are entering into strategic alliances or consolidating with one another to expedite the development of processes and other manufacturing technologies and/or achieve economies of scale. the outcomes of such an alliance can be the definition of a particular tool set for a certain function and/or the standardization of a series of process steps that use a specific set of manufacturing equipment, while the outcomes of consolidation can lead to an overall reduction in the market for semiconductor manufacturing equipment as customers' operations achieve economies of scale and/or increased purchasing power based on their higher volumes. in certain instances, this could work to our disadvantage if a competitor's tools or equipment become the standard equipment for such functions or processes. additional outcomes of such consolidation may include our customers re-evaluating their future supplier relationships to consider our competitors' products and/or gaining additional influence over the pricing of products and the control of intellectual property.
similarly, our customers may partner with, or follow the lead of, educational or research institutions that establish processes for accomplishing various tasks or manufacturing steps. if those institutions utilize a competitor's equipment when they establish those processes, it is likely that customers will tend to use the same equipment in setting up their own manufacturing lines. even if they select our equipment, the institutions and the customers that follow their lead could impose conditions on acceptance of that equipment, such as adherence to standards and requirements or limitations on how we license our proprietary rights, that increase our costs or require us to take on greater risk. these actions could adversely impact our market share and financial results.
we depend on a limited number of key suppliers and outsource providers, and we run the risk that they might not perform as we expect outsource providers and component suppliers have played and will continue to play a key role in our manufacturing operations, field installation and support, and many of our transactional and administrative functions, such as information technology, facilities management, and certain elements of our finance organization. these providers and suppliers might suffer financial setbacks, be acquired by third parties, become subject to exclusivity arrangements that preclude further business with us, or be unable to meet our requirements or expectation due to their independent business decisions or force majeure events that could interrupt or impair their continued ability to perform as we expect.
although we attempt to select reputable providers and suppliers and we attempt to secure their performance on terms documented in written contracts, it is possible that one or more of these providers or suppliers could fail to perform as we expect, or fail to secure or protect intellectual property rights, and such failure could have an adverse impact on our business. in some cases, the requirements of our business mandate that we obtain certain components and sub-assemblies included in our products from a single supplier or a limited group of suppliers. where practical, we endeavor to establish alternative sources to mitigate the risk that the failure of any single provider or supplier will adversely affect our business, but this is not feasible in all circumstances. there is therefore a risk that a prolonged inability to obtain certain components or secure key services could impair our ability to manage operations, ship products, and generate revenues, which could adversely affect our operating results and damage our customer relationships.
we face risks related to the disruption of our primary manufacturing facilities our manufacturing facilities are concentrated in just a few locations. these locations are subject to disruption for a variety of reasons, such as natural or man-made disasters, terrorist activities, disruptions of our information technology resources, and utility interruptions. such disruptions may cause delays in shipping our products, continues on next page lam research corporation 2017 10-k 19
which could result in the loss of business or customer trust, adversely affecting our business and operating results.
once a semiconductor manufacturer commits to purchase a competitor's semiconductor manufacturing equipment, the manufacturer typically continues to purchase that competitor's equipment, making it more difficult for us to sell our equipment to that customer semiconductor manufacturers must make a substantial investment to qualify and integrate wafer processing equipment into a semiconductor production line. we believe that once a semiconductor manufacturer selects a particular supplier's processing equipment, the manufacturer generally relies upon that equipment for that specific production line application for an extended period of time, especially for customers that are more focused on tool reuse. accordingly, we expect it to be more difficult to sell our products to a given customer if that customer initially selects a competitor's equipment for the same product line application.
we face a challenging and complex competitive environment we face significant competition from multiple competitors, and with increased consolidation efforts in our industry, we may face increasing competitive pressures. other companies continue to develop systems and/or acquire businesses and products that are competitive to ours and may introduce new products and product capabilities that may affect our ability to sell our existing products. we face a greater risk if our competitors enter into strategic relationships with leading semiconductor manufacturers covering products similar to those we sell or may develop, as this could adversely affect our ability to sell products to those manufacturers.
we believe that to remain competitive we must devote significant financial resources to offer products that meet our customers' needs, to maintain customer service and support centers worldwide, and to invest in product and process r&d. certain of our competitors, including those that are created and financially backed by foreign governments, have substantially greater financial resources and more extensive engineering, manufacturing, marketing, and customer service and support resources than we do and therefore have the potential to offer customers a more comprehensive array of products and/or product capabilities and to therefore achieve additional relative success in the semiconductor equipment industry. these competitors may deeply discount or give away products similar to those that we sell, challenging or even exceeding our ability to make similar accommodations and threatening our ability to sell those products. we also face competition from our own customers, who in some instances have established affiliated entities that manufacture equipment similar to ours. in addition, we face competition from companies that exist in a more favorable legal or regulatory environment than we do, allowing the freedom of action in ways that we may be unable to match. in many cases speed to solution is necessary for customer satisfaction and our competitors may be better positioned to achieve these objectives. for these reasons, we may fail to continue to compete successfully worldwide.
in addition, our competitors may be able to develop products comparable or superior to those we offer or may adapt more quickly to new technologies or evolving customer requirements. in particular, while we continue to develop product enhancements that we believe will address future customer requirements, we may fail in a timely manner to complete the development or introduction of these additional product enhancements successfully, or these product enhancements may not achieve market acceptance or be competitive. accordingly, competition may intensify, and we may be unable to continue to compete successfully in our markets, which could have a material adverse effect on our revenues, operating results, financial condition, and/or cash flows.
our future success depends heavily on international sales and the management of global operations non-u.s. sales, as reflected in part 1 item 1. business, accounted for approximately 92%, 92%, and 83% of total revenue in fiscal years 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively. we expect that international sales will continue to account for a substantial majority of our total revenue in future years.
we are subject to various challenges related to international sales and the management of global operations including, but not limited to:
•   global or national economic and political conditions;
•   changes in currency controls;
•   differences in the enforcement of intellectual property and contract rights in varying jurisdictions;
•   our ability to respond to customer and foreign government demands for locally sourced systems, spare parts, and services and develop the necessary relationships with local suppliers;
•   compliance with u.s. and international laws and regulations affecting foreign operations, including u.s. and international trade restrictions and sanctions, anti-bribery, anti-corruption, environmental, tax, and labor laws;
•   fluctuations in interest and foreign currency exchange rates;
•   the need for technical support resources in different locations; and
•   our ability to secure and retain qualified people, and effectively manage people, in all necessary locations for the successful operation of our business.
certain international sales depend on our ability to obtain export licenses from the u.s. government. our failure or inability to obtain such licenses would substantially limit our markets and severely restrict our revenues. many of the challenges noted above are applicable in china, which is a fast developing market for the semiconductor equipment industry and therefore an area of potential significant growth for our business. as the business volume between china and the rest of the world grows, there is inherent risk, based on the complex relationships among china, japan, korea, taiwan, and the united states, that political and diplomatic influences might lead to trade disruptions. this would adversely affect our business with china, japan, korea, and/or taiwan and perhaps the entire asia pacific region. a significant trade disruption in these areas could have a materially adverse impact on our future revenue and profits. in addition, there are risks that the chinese government may, among other things, insist on the use of local suppliers; compel companies that do business in china to partner with local companies to design and supply equipment on a local basis, requiring the transfer of intellectual property rights and/or local manufacturing; and provide special incentives to government-backed local customers to buy from local competitors, even if their products are inferior to ours; all of which could adversely impact our revenues and margins.
we are exposed to potentially adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates. the majority of our sales and expenses are denominated in u.s. dollars. however, we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations primarily related to revenues denominated in japanese yen and expenses denominated in euro and korean won. currently, we hedge certain anticipated foreign currency cash flows, primarily anticipated revenues denominated in japanese yen and expenses dominated in euro and korean won. in addition, we enter into foreign currency hedge contracts to minimize the short-term impact of the foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on certain foreign currency monetary assets and liabilities, primarily third-party accounts receivables, accounts payables, and intercompany receivables and payables. we believe these are our primary exposures to currency rate fluctuation. we expect to continue to enter into hedging transactions, for the purposes outlined, for the foreseeable future. however, these hedging transactions may not achieve their desired effect because differences between the actual timing of the underlying exposures and our forecasts of those exposures may leave us either over or under hedged on any given transaction. moreover, by hedging these foreign currency denominated revenues, expenses, monetary assets, and liabilities, we may miss favorable currency trends that would have been advantageous to us but for the hedges. additionally, we are exposed to short-term foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on non-u.s. dollar-denominated monetary assets and liabilities (other than those currency exposures previously discussed), and currently we do not enter into foreign currency hedge contracts against these exposures. therefore, we are subject to potential unfavorable foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations to the extent that we transact business (including intercompany transactions) in these currencies.
the magnitude of our overseas business also affects where our cash is generated. certain uses of cash, such as share repurchases, payment of dividends, or the repayment of our notes, can usually only be made with onshore cash balances. since the majority of our cash is generated outside of the united states, this may impact certain business decisions and adversely affect business outcomes.
our ability to attract, retain, and motivate key employees is critical to our success our ability to compete successfully depends in large part on our ability to attract, retain, and motivate key employees with the appropriate skills, experiences and competencies. this is an ongoing challenge due to intense competition for top talent, fluctuations in industry or business economic conditions, as well as increasing geographic expansion that may require cycles of hiring activity and workforce reductions. our success in hiring continues on next page lam research corporation 2017 10-k 21
depends on a variety of factors, including the attractiveness of our compensation and benefit programs, global economic or political and industry conditions, our organizational structure, global competition for talent and the availability of qualified employees, the availability of career development opportunities, the ability to obtain necessary authorizations for workers to provide services outside their home countries, and our ability to offer a challenging and rewarding work environment. we periodically evaluate our overall compensation and benefit programs and make adjustments, as appropriate, to maintain or enhance their competitiveness. if we are not able to successfully attract, retain, and motivate key employees, we may be unable to capitalize on market opportunities and our operating results may be materially and adversely affected.
we rely upon certain critical information systems for the operation of our business that are susceptible to cybersecurity and other threats or incidents we maintain and rely upon certain critical information systems for the effective operation of our business. these information systems include, but are not limited to, telecommunications, the internet, our corporate intranet, various computer hardware and software applications, network communications, and email. these information systems may be owned and maintained by us, our outsourced providers, or third parties such as vendors, contractors, and cloud providers. many of these information systems and outsourced service providers, including certain hosted software applications that we use for storage of confidential data and data processing (e.g., company-related, whether intellectual property or not; customer-related; supplier-related; and/or employee-related), employ cloud technology for such storage and data processing (which refers to an information technology hosting and delivery system in which data is not stored or processed within the user's physical infrastructure but instead is delivered to and consumed by the user as an internet-based service). all of these information systems are subject to disruption, breach or failure from sources including but not limited to attacks, degradation, and failures resulting from potential sources, including viruses, malware, denial of service, destructive or inadequate code, power failures, and physical damage to computers, hard drives, communication lines, and networking equipment. confidential and/or sensitive information stored on these information systems or transmitted to or from cloud storage could be intentionally or unintentionally compromised, lost, and/or stolen. while we have implemented iso 27001 compliant security procedures and virus protection software, intrusion prevention systems, access control, and emergency recovery processes to mitigate the outlined risks with respect to information systems that are under our control, they cannot be guaranteed to be fail-safe and may be breached. our inability to use or access these information systems at critical points in time, or unauthorized releases of proprietary or confidential information, could unfavorably impact the timely and efficient operation of our business, including our results of operations, and our reputation.
we have experienced cyber attacks. although past attacks have not resulted in a material adverse effect, we may incur material losses related to cyber attacks in the future. the insurance we carry may not fully compensate us for the effects of potential losses arising from a cyber-related incident. cyber-related incidents could result in:
•   disruptions to our operations;
•   misappropriation or theft of company, customer, supplier, or other's assets or resources, including intellectual property and confidential information, and costs associated therewith;
•   litigation with, or claims of damages arising from, our employees, customers, suppliers, or other third parties which whom we collaborate; or
•   adverse impact to our results of operations, as a result of associated remediation costs such as those related to responding to potential regulatory inquiries, to rebuild the effected information systems, and those associated with improving our security and internal control environment.
our financial results may be adversely impacted by higher than expected tax rates or exposure to additional tax liabilities as a global company, our effective tax rate is highly dependent upon the geographic composition of worldwide earnings and tax regulations governing each region. we are subject to income taxes in the united states and various foreign jurisdictions, and significant judgment is required to determine worldwide tax liabilities. our effective tax rate could be adversely affected by changes in the split of earnings between countries with differing statutory tax rates, in the valuation allowance of deferred tax assets, in tax laws, by material audit assessments, or changes in or expirations of agreements with tax authorities. these factors could affect our profitability. in particular, the carrying value of deferred tax assets, which are predominantly in the united states, is dependent continues on next page lam research corporation 2017 10-k 22
on our ability to generate future taxable income in the united states. in addition, the amount of income taxes we pay is subject to ongoing audits in various jurisdictions, and a material assessment by a governing tax authority could affect our profitability.
a failure to comply with environmental regulations may adversely affect our operating results we are subject to a variety of domestic and international governmental regulations related to the handling, discharge, and disposal of toxic, volatile, or otherwise hazardous chemicals. failure to comply with present or future environmental regulations could result in fines being imposed on us, require us to suspend production, and/or cease operations, or cause our customers to not accept our products. these regulations could require us to alter our current operations, acquire significant additional equipment, incur substantial other expenses to comply with environmental regulations, or take other actions. any failure to comply with regulations governing the use, handling, sale, transport, or disposal of hazardous substances could subject us to future liabilities that may adversely affect our operating results, financial condition, and ability to operate our business.
if we choose to acquire or dispose of businesses, product lines, and technologies, we may encounter unforeseen costs and difficulties that could impair our financial performance an important element of our management strategy is to review acquisition prospects that would complement our existing products, augment our market coverage and distribution ability, or enhance our technological capabilities. as a result, we may seek to make acquisitions of complementary companies, products, or technologies, or we may reduce or dispose of certain product lines or technologies that no longer fit our long-term strategies. for regulatory or other reasons, we may not be successful in our attempts to acquire or dispose of businesses, products, or technologies, resulting in significant financial costs, reduced or lost opportunities, and diversion of management's attention. managing an acquired business, disposing of product technologies, or reducing personnel entails numerous operational and financial risks, including difficulties in assimilating acquired operations and new personnel or separating existing business or product groups, diversion of management's attention away from other business concerns, amortization of acquired intangible assets, adverse customer reaction to our decision to cease support for a product, and potential loss of key employees or customers of acquired or disposed operations. there can be no assurance that we will be able to achieve and manage successfully any such integration of potential acquisitions, disposition of product lines or technologies, or reduction in personnel or that our management, personnel, or systems will be adequate to support continued operations. any such inabilities or inadequacies could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, financial condition, and/or cash flows.
in addition, any acquisition could result in changes such as potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities, the incurrence of debt and contingent liabilities, the amortization of related intangible assets, and goodwill impairment charges, any of which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, and/or the price of our common stock.
the market for our common stock is volatile, which may affect our ability to raise capital or make acquisitions or may subject our business to additional costs the market price for our common stock is volatile and has fluctuated significantly over the past years. the trading price of our common stock could continue to be highly volatile and fluctuate widely in response to a variety of factors, many of which are not within our control or influence. these factors include but are not limited to the following:
•   general market, semiconductor, or semiconductor equipment industry conditions;
•   economic or political events, trends, and unexpected developments occurring nationally, globally, or in any of our key sales regions;
•   variations in our quarterly operating results and financial condition, including our liquidity;
•   variations in our revenues, earnings, or other business and financial metrics from forecasts by us or securities analysts or from those experienced by other companies in our industry;
•   announcements of restructurings, reductions in force, departure of key employees, and/or consolidations of operations;
•   developments in, or claims relating to, patent or other proprietary rights;
•   technological innovations and the introduction of new products by us or our competitors;
•   commercial success or failure of our new and existing products;
•   disruptions of relationships with key customers or suppliers; or
•   dilutive impacts of our convertible notes and related warrants.
in addition, the stock market experiences significant price and volume fluctuations. historically, we have witnessed significant volatility in the price of our common stock due in part to the price of and markets for semiconductors. these and other factors have and may again adversely affect the price of our common stock, regardless of our actual operating performance. in the past, following volatile periods in the price of their stock, many companies became the object of securities class action litigation. if we are sued in a securities class action, we could incur substantial costs, and it could divert management's attention and resources and have an unfavorable impact on our financial performance and the price for our common stock.
intellectual property, indemnity, and other claims against us can be costly and we could lose significant rights that are necessary to our continued business and profitability third parties may assert infringement, unfair competition, product liability, breach of contract, or other claims against us. from time to time, other persons send us notices alleging that our products infringe their patent or other intellectual property rights. in addition, law enforcement authorities may seek criminal charges relating to intellectual property or other issues. we also face risks of claims arising from commercial and other relationships. in addition, our bylaws and other indemnity obligations provide that we will indemnify officers and members of our board of directors against losses that they may incur in legal proceedings resulting from their service to us. from time to time, in the normal course of business, we indemnify third parties with whom we enter into contractual relationships, including customers and suppliers, with respect to certain matters. we have agreed, under certain conditions, to hold these third parties harmless against specified losses, such as those arising from a breach of representations or covenants, other third-party claims that our products when used for their intended purposes infringe the intellectual property rights of such other third parties, or other claims made against certain parties. in such cases, it is our policy either to defend the claims or to negotiate licenses or other settlements on commercially reasonable terms. however, we may be unable in the future to negotiate necessary licenses or reach agreement on other settlements on commercially reasonable terms, or at all, and any litigation resulting from these claims by other parties may materially adversely affect our business and financial results, and we may be subject to substantial damage awards and penalties. moreover, although we have insurance to protect us from certain claims and cover certain losses to our property, such insurance may not cover us for the full amount of any losses, or at all, and may be subject to substantial exclusions and deductibles.
we may fail to protect our critical proprietary technology rights, which could affect our business our success depends in part on our proprietary technology and our ability to protect key components of that technology through patents, copyrights, and trade secret protection. protecting our key proprietary technology helps us to achieve our goals of developing technological expertise and new products and systems that give us a competitive advantage; increasing market penetration and growth of our installed base; and providing comprehensive support and service to our customers. as part of our strategy to protect our technology, we currently hold a number of u.s. and foreign patents and pending patent applications, and we keep certain information, processes, and techniques as trade secrets. however, other parties may challenge or attempt to invalidate or circumvent any patents the u.s. or foreign governments issue to us; these governments may fail to issue patents for pending applications; or we may lose trade secret protection over valuable information due to the intentional or unintentional actions or omissions of third parties, of ours, or even of our own employees. additionally, intellectual property litigation can be expensive and time-consuming and even when patents are issued or trade secret processes are followed, the legal systems in certain of the countries in which we do business do not enforce patents and other intellectual property rights as rigorously as the united states. the rights granted or anticipated under any of our patents, pending patent applications, or trade secrets may be narrower than we expect or, in fact, provide no competitive advantages. moreover, because we determine the jurisdictions in which to file patents at the time of filing, we may not have adequate protection in the future based on such previous decisions. any of these circumstances could have a material adverse impact on our business.
we are exposed to various risks from our regulatory environment we are subject to various risks related to (1) new, different, inconsistent, or even conflicting laws, rules, and regulations that may be enacted by legislative bodies and/or regulatory agencies in the countries that we operate; (2) disagreements or disputes between national or regional regulatory agencies related to international trade; and (3) the interpretation and application of laws, rules, and regulations. as a public company with global operations, we are subject to the laws of multiple jurisdictions and the rules and regulations of various governing bodies, including those related to financial and other disclosures, corporate governance, privacy, anti-corruption, such as the foreign corrupt practices act and other local laws prohibiting corrupt payments to governmental officials, conflict minerals or other social responsibility legislation, immigration or travel regulations, and antitrust regulations, among others. each of these laws, rules, and regulations imposes costs on our business, including financial costs and potential diversion of our management's attention associated with compliance, and may present risks to our business, including potential fines, restrictions on our actions, and reputational damage if we are unable to fully comply.
to maintain high standards of corporate governance and public disclosure, we intend to invest all reasonably necessary resources to comply with all evolving standards. changes in or ambiguous interpretations of laws, regulations, and standards may create uncertainty regarding compliance matters. efforts to comply with new and changing regulations have resulted in, and are likely to continue to result in, increased selling, general, and administrative expenses and a diversion of management's time and attention from revenue-generating activities to compliance activities. if we are found by a court or regulatory agency not to be in compliance with the laws and regulations, our business, financial condition, and/or results of operations could be adversely affected.
there can be no assurance that we will continue to declare cash dividends or repurchase our shares at all or in any particular amounts our board of directors has declared quarterly dividends since april 2014. our intent to continue to pay quarterly dividends and to repurchase our shares is subject to capital availability and, in the case of dividends, periodic determinations by our board of directors that cash dividends are in the best interest of our stockholders and are in compliance with all laws and agreements applicable to the declaration and payment of cash dividends by us. future dividends and share repurchases may also be affected by, among other factors, our views on potential future capital requirements for investments in acquisitions and the funding of our research and development; legal risks; changes in federal and state income tax laws or corporate laws; contractual restrictions, such as financial or operating covenants in our debt arrangements; availability of onshore cash flow; and changes to our business model. our dividend payments and share repurchases may change from time to time, and we cannot provide assurance that we will continue to declare dividends or repurchase shares at all or in any particular amounts. a reduction or suspension in our dividend payments could have a negative effect on the price of our common stock.
item 7.   management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations contains forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks, uncertainties, and changes in condition, significance, value, and effect. our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in the forward-looking statements as a result of certain factors, including but not limited to those discussed in "risk factors" and elsewhere in this 2017 form 10-k and other documents we file from time to time with the securities and exchange commission. (see "cautionary statement regarding forward-looking statements" in part i of this 2017 form 10-k.)
management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations ("md&a") provides a description of our results of operations and should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements included in this 2017 form 10-k. md&a consists of the following sections:
executive summary provides a summary of the key highlights of our results of operations and our management's assessment of material trends and uncertainties relevant to our business.
results of operations provides an analysis of operating results.
critical accounting policies and estimates discusses accounting policies that reflect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.
liquidity and capital resources provides an analysis of cash flows, contractual obligations, and financial position.
executive summary lam research has been an innovative supplier of wafer fabrication equipment and services to the semiconductor industry for more than 35 years. our vision is to realize full value from natural technology extensions of our company. our customer base includes leading semiconductor memory, foundry, and idms that make products such as nvm, dram memory, and logic devices. we aim to increase our strategic relevance with our customers by contributing more to their continued success. our core technical competency is integrating hardware, process, materials, software, and process control enabling results on the wafer.
our products and services are designed to help our customers build smaller, faster, and better performing devices that are used in a variety of electronic products, including mobile phones, personal computers, servers, wearables, automotive devices, storage devices, and networking equipment.
semiconductor manufacturing, our customers' business, involves the complete fabrication of multiple dies or integrated circuits on a wafer. this involves the repetition of a set of core processes and can require hundreds of individual steps. fabricating these devices requires highly sophisticated process technologies to integrate an increasing array of new materials with precise control at the atomic scale. along with meeting technical requirements, wafer processing equipment must deliver high productivity and be cost-effective.
demand from the cloud, iot, and other markets is driving the need for increasingly powerful and cost-efficient semiconductors. at the same time, there are growing technical challenges with traditional two-dimensional scaling. these trends are driving significant inflections in semiconductor manufacturing, such as the increasing importance of vertical scaling strategies like 3d architectures as well as multiple patterning to enable shrinks.
we believe we are in an strong position with our leadership and competency in deposition, etch, and single-wafer clean to facilitate some of the most significant innovations in semiconductor device manufacturing. several factors create opportunity for sustainable differentiation for us: our focus on research and development, with a breadth of programs across sustaining engineering, product and process development, and concept and feasibility; our ability to effectively leverage cycles of learning from our broad installed base; and our collaborative focus with ecosystem partners.
during the most recent fiscal year, demand for our products improved as semiconductor device manufacturers, particularly non volatile memory and foundry customers, made capacity and technology investments. technology inflections in our industry, including nvm, multiple patterning, finfet and advanced packaging have led to an increase in our served addressable market for our products in deposition, etch, single-wafer clean and customer service business. we believe that demand for our products and services should increase faster than overall spending on wafer fabrication equipment, as the proportion of customers' capital expenditures rises in these technology inflection areas, and we continue to gain market share.
in october 2015, we entered into an agreement and plan of merger and reorganization with kla-tencor. on october 5, 2016, we announced that the parties mutually agreed to terminate that agreement.
the following summarizes certain key financial information for the periods indicated below:
gross margin as a percent of total revenue            45.0    %   44.5                  %   43.4                  %   0.5                   %                  1.1                 %
total operating expenses                        $1,701,227                $1,544,666                $1,496,297                  $156,561           10.1    %            $48,369            3.2    %
revenues in fiscal year 2017 increased 36% compared to fiscal year 2016, and revenues in fiscal year 2016 increased 12% compared to fiscal year 2015, reflecting a continuous increase in technology and capacity investments by our customers.
the increase in gross margin as a percentage of revenue for fiscal year 2017 compared to fiscal year 2016 was primarily due to higher revenue and improved factory utilization resulting from higher production volume.
fiscal year 2016 gross margin as a percentage of revenue compared to fiscal year 2015 improved primarily due to a more favorable customer and product mix.
operating expenses in fiscal year 2017 increased as compared to fiscal year 2016 primarily as a result of continued investments in research and development including the effect of increased employee headcount, partially offset by a decrease in acquisition-related costs associated with the terminated agreement with kla-tencor.
operating expenses in fiscal year 2016 increased as compared to fiscal year 2015 primarily as a result of continued investments in research and development and increased employee headcount. fiscal year 2016 also included $51 million of acquisition-related costs associated with the terminated agreement with kla-tencor.
our cash and cash equivalents, investments, and restricted cash and investments balances totaled approximately $6.3 billion as of june 25, 2017, compared to $7.1 billion as of june 26, 2016. cash flow provided from operating activities was $2.0 billion for fiscal year 2017 compared to $1.4 billion for fiscal year 2016. cash flow provided from operating activities in fiscal 2017 was primarily used for $1.7 billion of principal payments on debt instruments, $812 million in treasury stock purchases, $243 million in dividends paid to our stockholders, and $157 million of capital expenditures and are partially offset by $73 million of treasury stock reissuance and common stock issuance resulting from our employee equity-based compensation programs.
results of operations shipments and backlog shipments for fiscal year 2017 were approximately $8.6 billion, an increase of 46% compared to fiscal year 2016. shipments for fiscal year 2016 were approximately $5.9 billion, an increase of 8% compared to fiscal year 2015. the increase in shipments during the fiscal year 2017 as compared to the last two fiscal years is related to continued strengthening of customer demand for semiconductor equipment.
the percentage of total lam semiconductor processing system shipments to each of the markets we serve were as follows for fiscal years 2017, 2016, and 2015.
our shipments to memory customers during fiscal year 2017 was largely unchanged compared to fiscal year 2016. foundry spending increased due to higher investments at leading-edge process nodes.
unshipped orders in backlog as of june 25, 2017, were approximately $2.1 billion, an increase from approximately $1.4 billion as of june 26, 2016. our unshipped orders backlog includes orders for systems, spares, and services. please refer to "backlog" in part i item 1, "business" of this report for a description of our policies for adding to and adjusting backlog.
the revenue increases in fiscal year 2017 compared to the last two fiscal years and in fiscal year 2016 compared to fiscal year 2015, reflect an increase in technology and capacity investments by our customers. our revenue levels are generally correlated to the amount of shipments and our installation and acceptance timelines. the overall asia region continues to account for a majority of our revenues as a substantial amount of the worldwide capacity additions for semiconductor manufacturing continues to occur in this region. our deferred revenue balance was $966 million as of june 25, 2017, compared to $566 million as of june 26, 2016. our deferred revenue balance does not include shipments to japanese customers, to whom title does not transfer until customer acceptance. shipments to japanese customers are classified as inventory at cost until the time of customer acceptance. the anticipated future revenue value from shipments to japanese customers was approximately $397 million as of june 25, 2017, compared to $132 million as of june 26, 2016.

the increase in gross margin as a percentage of revenue for fiscal year 2017 compared to fiscal year 2016 was primarily due to higher revenue and improved factory utilization resulting from higher production volume.
the increase in gross margin as a percentage of revenue for fiscal year 2016 compared to fiscal year 2015 was due to a more favorable customer mix and product mix. additionally, there was a $10 million impairment charge of a long-lived asset in fiscal year 2015.
research and development year ended june 25,                                         june 26,               june 28,           fy17 vs. fy16                          fy16 vs. fy15

we continued to make significant r&d investments focused on leading-edge deposition, plasma etch, single wafer clean, and other semiconductor manufacturing requirements. the increase in r&d expense during fiscal year 2017 compared to fiscal year 2016 was primarily due to an $80 million increase in employee compensation and benefits related to increased headcount, a $20 million increase in depreciation and lab maintenance, a $9 million increase in outside services, and a $7 million increase in supplies.
the increase in r&d expense during fiscal year 2016 compared to fiscal year 2015 was primarily due to a $36 million increase in employee compensation and benefits related to increased headcount, a $14 million increase in facility and information technology related spending, a $14 million increase in supplies, a $12 million increase in depreciation and lab maintenance, and an $8 million increase in costs associated with campus consolidation.
percent of total revenue               8.3           %   10.7               %   11.2               %         (2.4        )%                      (0.5        )%
the increase in selling, general, and administrative ("sg&a") expense during fiscal year 2017 compared to fiscal year 2016 was primarily due to a $36 million increase in employee compensation and benefits from increased headcount, a $15 million gain from sale of assets in fiscal year 2016, and a $14 million increase in outside services, offset by a $41 million decrease in acquisition-related costs associated with the terminated agreement with kla-tencor.
the increase in sg&a expense during fiscal year 2016 compared to fiscal year 2015 was primarily due to $51 million of kla-tencor acquisition-related costs and a $3 million increase in restructuring charges. this increase was offset by a $15 million gain on sale of assets, net of associated exit costs.
goodwill impairment our annual goodwill impairment analysis for fiscal year 2015 resulted in a non-cash impairment charge upon our single-wafer clean reporting unit of $79 million, extinguishing the goodwill ascribed to the reporting unit. uncertainty surrounding future revenue growth in certain products resulted in the estimated discounted cash flow falling below the carrying value of the goodwill balance. there were no impairment charges in fiscal year 2017 or 2016.
other expense, net other expense, net, consisted of the following:
loss on extinguishment of debt, net                                    (36,252   )        -                      -                      $(36,252      )         (100.0   )%        $-                           -    %
foreign exchange (losses) gains, net                                      (569   )   308                         2,331                  $(877         )         (284.7   )%        $(2,023       )          (86.8   )%
interest income increased in fiscal year 2017 compared to fiscal years 2016 and 2015 primarily as a result of higher average cash and investment balances, as well as higher yield.
the decrease in interest expense during fiscal year 2017 compared to fiscal year 2016 was primarily due to the retirement of the 2016 convertible note. the increase in interest expense during fiscal year 2016 compared to fiscal year 2015 was primarily due to the $1.0 billion senior note issuance in march 2015, combined with the note issuance cost amortization related to the october 2015 bridge financing arrangement.
the gain on deferred compensation plan related assets, in fiscal year 2017, compared to a loss in fiscal year 2016 and gain in fiscal year 2015 was driven by a rally in the fair market value of the underlying funds at year end.
loss on extinguishment of debt during fiscal year 2017 related to the special mandatory redemption of our 2023 and 2026 notes, as well as the termination of the amended and restated term loan agreement following the termination of the agreement and plan of merger and reorganization with kla-tencor.
the increase in the effective tax rate in fiscal year 2017 as compared to fiscal year 2016 was primarily due to the change in the mix of income offset by the recognition of previously unrecognized tax benefits.
the decrease in the effective tax rate in fiscal year 2016 as compared to fiscal year 2015 was primarily due to the tax benefit of the altera court ruling (discussed in more detail below), higher income in lower tax jurisdictions, and an increased federal tax benefit due to a retroactive and permanent extension of federal research and development tax credit in fiscal year 2016.
in july 2015, the u.s. tax court (the "court") issued an opinion favorable to altera corporation ("altera") with respect to altera's litigation with the internal revenue service ("irs"). the litigation relates to the treatment of stock-based compensation expense in an intercompany cost-sharing arrangement with altera's foreign subsidiary. in its opinion, the court accepted altera's position of excluding stock-based compensation from its intercompany cost-sharing arrangement. however, the u.s. department of the treasury has not withdrawn the requirement to include stock-based compensation from its regulations. we have evaluated the opinion and as a result of such evaluation have recorded a tax benefit of $88 million related to reimbursement of cost share payments for the previously shared stock-based compensation costs. we have also recorded a tax benefit of $11 million related to stock-based compensation expense. in addition, we have recorded a tax liability of $74 million for the u.s. tax cost of potential repatriation of the associated contingent foreign earnings because at this time we cannot reasonably conclude that we have the ability and the intent to indefinitely reinvest these contingent earnings. we will continue to monitor this matter and related potential impacts to our consolidated financial statements.
international revenues account for a significant portion of our total revenues, such that a material portion of our pre-tax income is earned and taxed outside the united states at rates that are generally lower than in the united states. please refer to note 6 of our consolidated financial statements.
deferred income taxes deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effect of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes, as well as the tax effect of carryforwards. our gross deferred tax assets were $546 million and $465 million at the end of fiscal years 2017 and 2016, respectively. these gross deferred tax assets were offset by gross deferred tax liabilities of $585 million and $429 million at the end of fiscal years 2017 and 2016, respectively, and a valuation allowance of $114 million and $102 million at the end of fiscal years 2017 and 2016, respectively. the change in the gross deferred tax assets, gross deferred tax liabilities, and valuation allowance between fiscal year 2017 and 2016 is primarily due to an increase related to allowances and reserves and an increase in deferred tax liabilities related to an accrual for future tax liabilities due to the expected repatriation of foreign earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries.
as of our fiscal year end of june 25, 2017, we continue to record a valuation allowance to offset the entire california deferred tax asset balance due to the single sales factor apportionment election resulting in lower taxable income in california. we also recorded a valuation allowance on certain state tax credits and continue to record valuation allowances on certain foreign entities' net operating losses. the valuation allowances were $114 million and $102 million at the end of fiscal years 2017 and 2016, respectively.
we evaluate if the deferred tax assets are realizable on a quarterly basis and will continue to assess the need for changes in valuation allowances, if any.
uncertain tax positions we re-evaluate uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis. this evaluation is based on factors including, but not limited to, changes in facts or circumstances, changes in tax law, and effectively settled issues under audit. such a change in recognition or measurement would result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision.
critical accounting policies and estimates a critical accounting policy is defined as one that has both a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations and requires us to make difficult, complex and/or subjective judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain. the preparation of financial statements in conformity with u.s. generally accepted accounting principles ("gaap") requires management to make certain judgments, estimates and assumptions that could affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. we base our estimates and assumptions on historical experience and on various other assumptions we believe to be applicable and evaluate them on an ongoing basis to ensure they remain reasonable under current conditions. actual results could differ significantly from those estimates, which could have a material impact on our business, results of operations, and financial condition. our critical accounting estimates include:
•   the recognition and valuation of revenue from multiple-element arrangements, which impacts revenue;
•   the valuation of inventory, which impacts gross margin;
•   the valuation of warranty reserves, which impacts gross margin;
•   the valuation of equity-based compensation expense, including forfeiture estimates, which impacts both gross margin and operating expenses;
•   the recognition and measurement of current and deferred income taxes, including the measurement of uncertain tax positions, which impact our provision for income tax expenses; and
•   the valuation and recoverability of long-lived assets, which impacts gross margin and operating expenses when we record asset impairments or accelerate their depreciation or amortization.
we believe that the following critical accounting policies reflect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements regarding the critical accounting estimates indicated above. see note 2, "summary of significant accounting policies," of our consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding our accounting policies.
revenue recognition: we recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred and title has passed or services have been rendered, the selling price is fixed or determinable, collection of the receivable is reasonably assured, and we have received customer acceptance or are otherwise released from our customer acceptance obligations. if terms of the sale provide for a lapsing customer acceptance period, we recognize revenue upon the expiration of the lapsing acceptance period or customer acceptance, whichever occurs first. if the practices of a customer do not provide for a written acceptance or the terms of sale do not include a lapsing acceptance provision, we recognize revenue when it can be reliably demonstrated that the delivered system meets all of the agreed-to customer specifications. in situations with multiple deliverables, we recognize revenue upon the delivery of the separate elements to the customer and when we receive customer acceptance or are otherwise released from our customer acceptance obligations. we allocate revenue from multiple-element arrangements among the separate elements using their relative selling prices, based on our best estimate of selling price. our sales arrangements do not include a general right of return. the maximum revenue recognized on a delivered element is limited to the amount that is not contingent upon the delivery of additional items. we generally recognize revenue related to sales of spare parts and system upgrade kits upon shipment. we generally recognize revenue related to services upon completion of the services requested by a customer order. we recognize revenue for extended maintenance service contracts with a fixed payment amount on a straight-line basis over the term of the contract. when goods or services have been delivered to the customer, but all conditions for revenue recognition have not been met, deferred revenue and deferred costs are recorded in deferred profit on our consolidated balance sheet.
inventory valuation: our policy is to assess the valuation of all inventories including manufacturing raw materials, work-in-process, finished goods, and spare parts in each reporting period. obsolete inventory or inventory in excess of management's estimated usage requirement is written down to its estimated market value if less than continues on next page lam research corporation 2017 10-k 38
cost. estimates of market value include but are not limited to management's forecasts related to our future manufacturing schedules, customer demand, technological and/or market obsolescence, general semiconductor market conditions, and possible alternative uses. if future customer demand or market conditions are less favorable than our projections, additional inventory write-downs may be required and would be reflected in cost of goods sold in the period in which we make the revision.
warranty: we record a provision for estimated warranty expenses to cost of sales for each system when we recognize revenue. we periodically monitor the performance and cost of warranty activities, if actual costs incurred are different than our estimates, we may recognize adjustments to provisions in the period in which those differences arise or are identified. we do not maintain general or unspecified reserves; all warranty reserves are related to specific systems.
equity-based compensation: employee stock purchase plan ("espp") and employee stock plans: we determine the fair value of our restricted stock units ("rsus"), excluding market-based performance rsus, based upon the fair market value of our common stock at the date of grant, discounted for dividends. we estimate the fair value of our market-based performance rsus using a monte carlo simulation model at the date of the grant. we estimate the fair value of our stock options and espp awards using a black-scholes option valuation model. this model requires the input of highly subjective assumptions, including expected stock price volatility and the estimated life of each award. we amortize the fair value of equity-based awards over the vesting periods of the award and we have elected to use the straight-line method of amortization. we estimate expected equity award forfeitures based on historical forfeiture rate activity and expected future employee turnover. we recognize the effect of adjustments made to the forfeiture rate, if any in the period that we change the forfeiture estimate.
income taxes: deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effect of temporary differences between the carrying amount of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes, as well as the tax effect of carryforwards. we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized. realization of our net deferred tax assets is dependent on future taxable income. we believe it is more likely than not that such assets will be realized; however, ultimate realization could be negatively impacted by market conditions and other variables not known or anticipated at this time. in the event that we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax assets, an adjustment would be charged to earnings in the period such determination is made. likewise, if we later determine that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets would be realized, then the previously provided valuation allowance would be reversed.
we recognize the benefit from a tax position only if it is more likely than not that the position would be sustained upon audit based solely on the technical merits of the tax position. our policy is to include interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of income tax expense.
long-lived assets: we review goodwill at least annually for impairment. if certain events or indicators of impairment occur between annual impairment tests, we will perform an impairment test at that date. in testing for a potential impairment of goodwill, we: (1) allocate goodwill to the reporting units to which the acquired goodwill relates; (2) estimate the fair value of our reporting units; and (3) determine the carrying value (book value) of those reporting units. prior to this allocation of the assets to the reporting units, we assess long-lived assets for impairment. furthermore, if the estimated fair value of a reporting unit is less than the carrying value, we must estimate the fair value of all identifiable assets and liabilities of that reporting unit, in a manner similar to a purchase price allocation for an acquired business. this can require independent valuations of certain internally generated and unrecognized intangible assets such as in-process r&d and developed technology. only after this process is completed can the amount of goodwill impairment, if any, be determined. in our goodwill impairment process we first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform a quantitative analysis. we do not calculate the fair value of a reporting unit unless we determine, based on a qualitative assessment, that it is more likely than not that the reporting unit's fair value is less than its carrying amount.
the process of evaluating the potential impairment of goodwill is subjective and requires significant judgment at many points during the analysis. we determine the fair value of our reporting units by using an income approach. under the income approach, we determine fair value based on estimated future cash flows of each reporting unit, continues on next page lam research corporation 2017 10-k 39
discounted by an estimated weighted-average cost of capital, which reflects the overall level of inherent risk of a reporting unit and the rate of return an outside investor would expect to earn.
in estimating the fair value of a reporting unit, we make estimates and judgments about the future cash flows of our reporting units, including estimated growth rates and assumptions about the economic environment. although our cash flow forecasts are based on assumptions that are consistent with the plans and estimates we are using to manage the underlying businesses, there is significant judgment involved in determining the cash flows attributable to a reporting unit. in addition, we make certain judgments about allocating shared assets to the estimated balance sheets of our reporting units. changes in judgment on these assumptions and estimates could result in a goodwill impairment charge.
as a result, several factors could result in an impairment of a material amount of our goodwill balance in future periods, including but not limited to: (1) weakening of the global economy, weakness in the semiconductor equipment industry, or our failure to reach internal forecasts, which could impact our ability to achieve our forecasted levels of cash flows and reduce the estimated discounted cash flow value of our reporting units; and (2) a decline in our common stock price and resulting market capitalization, to the extent we determine that the decline is sustained and indicates a reduction in the fair value of our reporting units below their carrying value. further, the value assigned to intangible assets, other than goodwill, is based on estimates and judgments regarding expectations such as the success and lifecycle of products and technology acquired. if actual product acceptance differs significantly from the estimates, we may be required to record an impairment charge to write down the asset to its realizable value.
for other long-lived assets, we routinely consider whether indicators of impairment are present. if such indicators are present, we determine whether the sum of the estimated undiscounted cash flows attributable to the assets is less than their carrying value. if the sum is less, we recognize an impairment loss based on the excess of the carrying amount of the assets over their respective fair values. fair value is determined by discounted future cash flows, appraisals or other methods. we recognize an impairment charge to the extent the present value of anticipated net cash flows attributable to the asset are less than the asset's carrying value. the fair value of the asset then becomes the asset's new carrying value, which we depreciate over the remaining estimated useful life of the asset. assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value.

liquidity and capital resources total gross cash, cash equivalents, investments, and restricted cash and investments balances were $6.3 billion at the end of fiscal year 2017 compared to $7.1 billion at the end of fiscal year 2016. this decrease was primarily due to the redemption of our senior notes with contractual maturities in 2023 and 2026. approximately $4.8 billion and $3.1 billion of our total cash and investments as june 25, 2017, and june 26, 2016, respectively, was held outside the united states in our foreign subsidiaries, the majority of which is held in u.s. dollars, and substantially all of which would be subject to tax at u.s. rates if it were to be repatriated. refer to note 6 of our consolidated financial statements, included in item 8 of this report, for information concerning the potential tax impact of repatriating earnings of certain non-u.s. subsidiaries that are permanently reinvested outside the united states.
cash flow from operating activities net cash provided by operating activities of $2.0 billion during fiscal year 2017 consisted of (in millions):
loss on extinguishment of debt, net                        36
amortization of note discounts and issuance costs          25
changes in operating asset and liability accounts        (311   )
significant changes in operating asset and liability accounts, net of foreign exchange impact, included the following uses of cash: increases in accounts receivable of $411 million, inventories of $308 million, and prepaid expenses and other assets of $27 million, partially offset by the following sources of cash: increases in accounts payable of $127 million, deferred profit of $258 million, and accrued expenses and other liabilities of $50 million.
cash flow from investing activities net cash used for investing activities during fiscal year 2017 was $2.1 billion, primarily consisting of net purchases of available-for-sale securities of $1.9 billion, and capital expenditures of $157 million.
cash flow from financing activities net cash used by financing activities during fiscal year 2017 was $2.6 billion, primarily consisting of $1.7 billion of cash paid for debt extinguishment, $812 million in treasury stock repurchases, and $243 million of dividends paid, partially offset by $73 million of stock issuance and treasury stock reissuances associated with our employee stock-based compensation plans.
liquidity given that the semiconductor industry is highly competitive and has historically experienced rapid changes in demand, we believe that maintaining sufficient liquidity reserves is important to support sustaining levels of investment in r&d and capital infrastructure. anticipated cash flows from operations based on our current business outlook, combined with our current levels of cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments as of june 25, 2017, are expected to be sufficient to support our anticipated levels of operations, investments, debt service requirements, capital expenditures, capital redistributions, and dividends through at least the next 12 months. however, uncertainty in the global economy and the semiconductor industry, as well as disruptions in credit markets, have in the past, and could in the future, impact customer demand for our products, as well as our ability to manage normal commercial relationships with our customers, suppliers, and creditors.
in the longer term, liquidity will depend to a great extent on our future revenues and our ability to appropriately manage our costs based on demand for our products and services. while we have substantial cash balances in the united states and offshore, we may require additional funding and need or choose to raise the required funds through borrowings or public or private sales of debt or equity securities. we believe that, if necessary, we will be able to access the capital markets on terms and in amounts adequate to meet our objectives. however, given the possibility of changes in market conditions or other occurrences, there can be no certainty that such funding will be available in needed quantities or on terms favorable to us.
off-balance sheet arrangements and contractual obligations we have certain obligations to make future payments under various contracts, some of which are recorded on our balance sheet and some of which are not. obligations that are recorded on our balance sheet in accordance with gaap include our long-term debt which is outlined in the following table. our off-balance sheet arrangements are presented as operating leases and purchase obligations in the table. our contractual obligations and commitments as of june 25, 2017, relating to these agreements and our guarantees are included in the following table based on their contractual maturity date. the amounts in the table below exclude $120 million of liabilities related to uncertain tax benefits as we are unable to reasonably estimate the ultimate amount or time of settlement. see note 6 of our consolidated financial statements for further discussion. the amounts in the table below also exclude $19 million associated with funding commitments related to non-marketable equity investments as we are unable to make a reasonable estimate regarding the timing of capital calls.

(1)   the conversion period for the convertible notes was open as of june 25, 2017, and as such the net carrying value of the convertible notes is included within current liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet. the principal balances of the convertible notes are reflected in the payment period in the table above based on the contractual maturity assuming no conversion. see note 13 of our consolidated financial statements for additional information concerning the convertible notes and associated conversion features.
(2)   certain tax-related liabilities and post-retirement benefits classified as other non-current liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet are included in the "more than five years" category due to the uncertainty in the timing and amount of future payments. additionally, the balance excludes contractual obligations recorded in our consolidated balance sheet as current liabilities.
operating leases we lease most of our administrative, r&d, and manufacturing facilities; regional sales/service offices; and certain equipment under non-cancelable operating leases. certain of our facility leases for buildings located in fremont and livermore, california, and certain other facility leases provide us with an option to extend the leases for additional periods or to purchase the facilities. certain of our facility leases provide for periodic rent increases based on the general rate of inflation. in addition to amounts included in the table above, we have guaranteed residual values for certain of our fremont and livermore facility leases of up to $250 million. see note 15 to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion.
capital leases capital leases reflect building and office equipment lease obligations. the amounts in the table above include the interest portion of payment obligations.
purchase obligations purchase obligations consist of significant contractual obligations either on an annual basis or over multi-year periods related to our outsourcing activities or other material commitments, including vendor-consigned inventories. the contractual cash obligations and commitments table presented above contains our minimum obligations at june 25, 2017, under these arrangements and others. for obligations with cancellation provisions, the amounts included in the preceding table were limited to the non-cancelable portion of the agreement terms or the minimum cancellation fee. actual expenditures will vary based on the volume of transactions and length of contractual service provided.
long-term debt in may 2011, we issued and sold $450.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 1.25% convertible senior notes due may 2018 (the "2018 notes") at par. we pay cash interest on the 2018 notes at an annual rate of 1.25%, on a semi-annual basis. concurrently with the issuance of the 2018 notes, we purchased convertible note hedges and sold warrants, which were structured to reduce the potential future economic dilution associated with the conversion of the 2018 notes.
the 2018 notes may be converted into our common stock, under certain circumstances, based on a conversion rate of 16.5702 shares of our common stock per $1,000 principal amount of notes, which is equal to a conversion price of approximately $60.35 per share of our common stock. the conversion price will be subject to adjustment for certain corporate events, including dividends on our common stock.
in june 2012, with the acquisition of novellus, we assumed $700 million in aggregate principal amount of 2.625% convertible senior notes due may 2041 (the "2041 notes"). we pay cash interest on the 2041 notes at an annual rate of 2.625%, on a semi-annual basis. the 2041 notes may be converted, under certain circumstances, into our common stock based on a conversion rate of 29.7371 shares of common stock per $1,000 principal amount of notes, which represents a conversion price of approximately $33.63 per share of common stock. the conversion price will be subject to adjustment for certain events, including dividends on our common stock.
during the quarter-ended june 25, 2017, the market value of our common stock was greater than or equal to 130% of the 2018 notes and 2041 notes conversion prices for 20 or more trading days of the 30 consecutive trading days preceding the quarter end. as a result, the 2018 notes and the 2041 notes are convertible at the option of the holder and are classified as current liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets for fiscal year 2017.
on march 12, 2015, we completed a public offering of $500 million aggregate principal amount of senior notes due march 15, 2020 (the "2020 notes") and $500 million aggregate principal amount of senior notes due march 15, 2025 (the "2025 notes"). we pay interest at an annual rate of 2.75% and 3.80%, respectively, on the 2020 notes and 2025 notes, on a semi-annual basis on march 15 and september 15 of each year.
we may redeem the 2020 notes and 2025 notes at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of such series ("par"), plus a "make whole" premium as described in the indenture in respect to the 2020 notes and 2025 notes and accrued and unpaid interest before february 15, 2020, for the 2020 notes and before december 15, 2024, for the 2025 notes. we may redeem the 2020 notes and 2025 notes at par, plus accrued and unpaid interest, at any time on or after february 15, 2020, for the 2020 notes and on or after december 24, 2024, for the 2025 notes. in addition, upon the occurrence of certain events, as described in the indenture, we will be required to make an offer to repurchase the 2020 notes and 2025 notes at a price equal to 101% of the principal amount of the respective note, plus accrued and unpaid interest.
on june 7, 2016, we completed a public offering of $800.0 million aggregate principal amount of senior notes due june 15, 2021, (the "2021 notes"), $600.0 million aggregate principal amount of senior notes due june 15, 2023 (the "2023 notes") and $1.0 billion aggregate principal amount of senior notes due june 15, 2026 (the "2026 notes", together with the 2020 notes, and 2021 notes, the "senior notes", and collectively with the convertible notes, the "notes"). we pay interest at an annual rate of 2.80% on the 2021 notes on a semi-annual basis on june 15 and december 15 of each year.
as a result of the october 5, 2016, termination of the agreement and plan of merger and reorganization with kla-tencor, the 2023 notes and the 2026 notes were redeemed on october 13, 2016, under the special mandatory redemption terms of the indenture governing these notes. we were required to redeem all of the 2023 notes and the 2026 notes then outstanding, on october 13, 2016, at a special mandatory redemption price equal to 101% of the aggregate principal amount of such notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest from the date of initial issuance.
we may redeem the 2021 notes at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of such series ("par"), plus a "make whole" premium as described in the respective indenture, and accrued and unpaid interest before may 15, 2021. we may redeem the 2021 notes at par, plus accrued and unpaid interest at any time on or after may 15, 2021. in addition, upon the occurrence of certain events, as described in the indenture, we will be continues on next page lam research corporation 2017 10-k 43
required to make an offer to repurchase the 2021 notes, at a price equal to 101% of the principal amount of the respective note, plus accrued and unpaid interest.
on may 13, 2016, we entered into an amended and restated term loan agreement (the "amended and restated term loan agreement"), which amends and restates the term loan agreement we entered into on november 10, 2015, with a syndicate of lenders. the amended and restated term loan agreement provides for a commitment of $1,530.0 million senior unsecured term loan facility composed of two tranches (the "commitments"): (1) a $1,005.0 million tranche of three-year senior unsecured loans and (2) a $525.0 million tranche of five-year senior unsecured loans. the commitments automatically terminated on october 5, 2016, upon termination of the agreement and plan of merger and reorganization with kla-tencor corporation.
during fiscal year 2017, 2016, and 2015, we made $1.7 billion, $451 million, and $2 million, respectively, in principal payments on long-term debt and capital leases.
revolving credit arrangements on november 10, 2015, we entered into an amendment and restatement agreement (as amended on april 26, 2016, by amendment no.1 to amended and restated credit agreement and as further amended, restated, amended and restated, supplemented, or otherwise modified from time to time, the "amended and restated credit agreement"), which amends and restates our prior unsecured credit agreement, dated march 12, 2014 (as amended by amendment no. 1, dated march 5, 2015). the amended and restated credit agreement provides for an increase to our revolving unsecured credit facility, from $300 million to $750 million with a syndicate of lenders. it includes an expansion option, subject to certain requirements, for us to request an increase in the facility of up to an additional $250 million, for a potential total commitment of $1.0 billion. proceeds from the credit facility can be used for general corporate purposes. the facility matures on november 10, 2020.
interest on amounts borrowed under the credit facility is, at our option, based on (1) a base rate, defined as the greatest of (a) prime rate, (b) federal funds rate plus 0.5%, or (c) one-month london interbank offered rate ("libor") plus 1.0%, plus a spread of 0.0% to 0.5%, or (2) libor multiplied by the statutory reserve rate, plus a spread of 0.9% to 1.5%, in each case as the applicable spread is determined based on the rating of our non-credit enhanced, senior unsecured long-term debt. principal and any accrued and unpaid interest is due and payable upon maturity. additionally, we will pay the lenders a quarterly commitment fee that varies based on our credit rating. the amended and restated credit agreement contains affirmative covenants, negative covenants, financial covenants, and events of default that are substantially similar to those in the amended and restated term loan agreement. as of june 25, 2017, we had no borrowings outstanding under the credit facility and were in compliance with all financial covenants.
other guarantees we have issued certain indemnifications to our lessors for taxes and general liability under some of our agreements. we have entered into certain insurance contracts that may limit our exposure to such indemnifications. as of june 25, 2017, we had not recorded any liability on our consolidated financial statements in connection with these indemnifications, as we do not believe, based on information available, that it is probable that we will pay any amounts under these guarantees.
generally, we indemnify, under pre-determined conditions and limitations, our customers for infringement of third-party intellectual property rights by our products or services. we seek to limit our liability for such indemnity to an amount not to exceed the sales price of the products or services subject to our indemnification obligations. we do not believe, based on information available, that it is probable that we will pay any material amounts under these guarantees.
we provide guarantees and standby letters of credit to certain parties as required for certain transactions initiated during the ordinary course of business. as of june 25, 2017, the maximum potential amount of future payments that we could be required to make under these arrangements and letters of credit was $16 million. we do not believe, based on historical experience and information currently available, that it is probable that any amounts will be required to be paid.

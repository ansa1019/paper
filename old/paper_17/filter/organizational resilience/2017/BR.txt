item 1a.   risk factors you should carefully consider each of the following risks and all of the other information set forth in this annual report on form 10-k or incorporated by reference herein. based on the information currently known to us, we believe that the following information identifies the material risk factors affecting our company. however, additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial may also adversely affect our business.
if any of the following risks and uncertainties develop into actual events, they could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations.
consolidation in the financial services industry could adversely affect our revenues by eliminating some of our existing and potential clients and could make us increasingly dependent on a more limited number of clients.
mergers or consolidations of financial institutions could reduce the number of our clients and potential clients. if our clients merge with or are acquired by other firms that are not our clients, or firms that use fewer of our services, they may discontinue or reduce the use of our services. in addition, it is possible that the larger financial institutions resulting from mergers or consolidations could decide to perform in-house some or all of the services that we currently provide or could provide. any of these developments could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.
a large percentage of our revenues are derived from a small number of clients in the financial services industry.
in fiscal year 2017, we derived approximately 20% of our consolidated revenues from our five largest clients and approximately 58% of the revenues of our global technology and operations segment from the 15 largest clients in that segment. our largest single client accounted for approximately 6% of our consolidated revenues. while these clients generally work with multiple business segments, the loss of business from any of these clients due to merger or consolidation, financial difficulties or bankruptcy, or the termination or non-renewal of contracts would have a material adverse effect on our revenues and results of operations. also, in the event a client experiences financial difficulties or bankruptcy resulting in a reduction in their demand for our services or loss of the client's business, in addition to losing the revenue from that client, the company would be required to write-off any investments made by the company in connection with that client, including costs incurred to set up or convert a client's systems to function with our technology. such costs for all clients represented approximately 5% of the company's total assets as of june 30, 2017.
under a number of our contracts, our clients have the opportunity to renegotiate their contracts with us and to consider whether to renew their contracts or engage one of our competitors to provide services. if we are not successful in achieving high renewal rates with favorable terms, particularly with these clients, our revenues from such renewals and the associated earnings could be negatively impacted.
security breaches or cybersecurity attacks could adversely affect our ability to operate, could result in personal information being misappropriated, and may cause us to be held liable or suffer harm to our reputation.
we process and transfer personal information provided to us by our clients, which include financial institutions, public companies, mutual funds, and healthcare providers. we also handle personal information of our employees in connection with their employment. we maintain systems and procedures including encryption, authentication technology, data loss prevention technology, entitlement management, access control and anti-malware software, and transmission of data over private networks to protect against unauthorized access to physical and electronic information, including by cyber-attacks.
in certain circumstances, third party vendors such as our data center services provider may have access to personal information. it is also possible that a third party vendor could intentionally or inadvertently disclose personal information, and we require our third party vendors to have appropriate security controls if they have access to the personal information of our clients' customers. however, despite those safeguards, it is possible that unauthorized individuals could improperly access our systems or those of our vendors, or improperly obtain or disclose the personal information that we or our vendors process or handle.
many of our services are provided through the internet which increases our exposure to potential cybersecurity attacks. we have experienced cybersecurity threats to our information technology infrastructure and have experienced cyber-attacks, attempts to breach our systems and other similar incidents. such prior events have not had a material impact on our financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. however, future threats could cause harm to our business and our reputation and challenge our ability to provide reliable service, as well as negatively impact our results of operations materially. our insurance coverage may not be adequate to cover all the costs related to cybersecurity attacks or disruptions resulting from such events.
any security breach resulting in the unauthorized use or disclosure of certain personal information could put individuals at risk of identity theft and financial or other harm and result in costs to the company in investigation, remediation, legal defense and in liability to parties who are financially harmed. we may incur significant costs to protect against the threat of information security breaches or to respond to or alleviate problems caused by such breaches. for example, laws may require notification to regulators, clients or employees and enlisting credit monitoring or identity theft protection in the event of a privacy breach. a cybersecurity attack could also be directed at our systems and result in interruptions in our operations or delivery of services to
our clients and their customers. furthermore, a material security breach could cause us to lose revenues, lose clients or cause damage to our reputation.
changes in laws or regulations to which our clients are subject could adversely affect our ability to conduct our business or may reduce our profitability.
we provide technology solutions to financial services firms that are generally subject to extensive regulation in the u.s. and in other jurisdictions. as a provider of services to financial institutions and issuers of securities, our services are provided in a manner designed to assist our clients in complying with the laws and regulations to which they are subject. therefore, our services, including our proxy processing and customer communications services, are particularly sensitive to changes in laws and regulations governing the financial services industry and the securities markets. in addition, we perform services for clients in the healthcare, insurance and telecommunications industries, which are also highly regulated.
changes in laws and regulations may impact our clients in a way that could adversely affect us. for example, new regulations governing our clients could result in significant expenditures that could cause them to reduce their use of our services, seek to renegotiate existing agreements, or cease or curtail their operations, all of which could adversely impact our business. also, changes in regulations could change the quantity or format of, or eliminate the need for, certain types of communications. further, an adverse regulatory action that changes a client's business or adversely affects its financial condition, could decrease their ability to purchase, or their demand for, our products and services. the loss of business from our larger clients could have a material adverse effect on our revenues and results of operations.
changes in laws or regulations to which we are subject may adversely affect our ability to conduct our business or may reduce our profitability.
the legislative and regulatory environment of the financial services industry is continuously changing. the sec, finra, various stock exchanges, and other u.s. and foreign governmental or regulatory authorities continuously review legislative and regulatory initiatives and may adopt new or revised laws and regulations. these legislative and regulatory initiatives may adversely affect the way in which we conduct our business and may make our business less profitable. also, changes in the interpretation or enforcement of existing laws and regulations by those entities may adversely affect our business.
as a provider of technology services to financial institutions, certain aspects of our u.s. operations are subject to regulatory oversight and examination by the ffiec. periodic examinations by the ffiec generally include areas such as data privacy, disaster recovery, information security, and third party vendor management to identify potential risks related to our services that could adversely affect our banking and financial services clients. a sufficiently unfavorable review from the ffiec could have a material adverse effect on our business.
in addition, our business process outsourcing, mutual fund processing and transfer agency solutions as well as the entities providing those services are subject to regulatory oversight. our provision of these services must comply with applicable rules and regulations of the sec, finra, dol and various stock exchanges, and other regulatory bodies charged with safeguarding the integrity of the securities markets and other financial markets and protecting the interests of investors participating in these markets. if we fail to comply with any applicable regulations in performing those services, we could lose our clients, be subject to suits for breach of contract or to governmental proceedings, censures and fines, our reputation could be harmed and we could be limited in our ability to obtain new clients.
our business process outsourcing and mutual fund processing services are performed by bbpo, an sec registered broker-dealer and a member of finra. bbpo is subject to regulations concerning many aspects of its business, including trade practices, capital requirements, record retention, money laundering prevention, the protection of customer funds and customer securities, and the supervision of the conduct of directors, officers and employees. a failure to comply with any of these laws, rules or regulations could result in censures, fines, the issuance of cease-and-desist orders, or the suspension or revocation of sec or finra authorization granted to allow the operation of its business or disqualification of its directors, officers or employees. our transfer agency business is subject to sec, nyse, and other federal and state laws and regulations.
our ability to comply with these regulations depends largely upon the maintenance of an effective compliance system which can be time consuming and costly, as well as our ability to attract and retain qualified compliance personnel.
as a provider of data and business processing solutions, our systems contain a significant amount of sensitive data, including personal information, related to our clients, customers of our clients, and our employees. we are, therefore, subject to compliance obligations under federal, state and foreign privacy and information security laws, including in the u.s., the gramm-leach-bliley act and the health insurance portability and accountability act of 1996. there has been increased public attention regarding the use of personal information, accompanied by legislation and regulations intended to strengthen data
protection, information security and consumer and personal privacy. the law in these areas continues to develop, the number of jurisdictions adopting such laws continues to increase and these laws may be inconsistent from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. furthermore, the changing nature of privacy laws in the u.s., the european union and elsewhere could impact our processing of personal information of our employees and on behalf of our clients. while we believe that broadridge is compliant with its regulatory responsibilities, information security threats continue to evolve resulting in increased risk and exposure and increased costs to protect against the threat of information security breaches or to respond to or alleviate problems caused by such breaches.
our revenues may decrease due to declines in the levels of participation and activity in the securities markets.
we generate significant revenues from the transaction processing fees we earn from our services. these revenue sources are substantially dependent on the levels of participation and activity in the securities markets. the number of unique securities positions held by investors through our clients and our clients' customer trading volumes reflect the levels of participation and activity in the markets, which are impacted by market prices, and the liquidity of the securities markets, among other factors. over the past several years, the u.s. and foreign securities markets have experienced significant volatility. sudden sharp or gradual but sustained declines in market participation and activity can result in reduced investor communications activity, including reduced proxy and event-driven communications processing such as mutual fund proxy, mergers and acquisitions and other special corporate event communications processing, and reduced trading volumes. the occurrence of any of these events would likely result in reduced revenues and decreased profitability from our business operations.
we purchase a significant portion of our data center services, including disaster recovery capabilities, from a third party data center services provider, and if our data center services provider fails to adequately perform the data center services in the manner necessary to meet our clients' requirements, our business, financial condition, and results of operations may be harmed.
ibm provides us with data center services that include supporting our mainframe, midrange, open systems, network and data center operations, as well as disaster recovery services. as a result, we currently purchase a significant portion of our data center services, including disaster recovery capabilities, from ibm. if ibm fails to adequately perform the data center services in the manner necessary to meet our clients' requirements, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be harmed.
in the event of a disaster, our disaster recovery and business continuity plans may fail, which could result in the loss of client data and adversely interrupt operations.
our operations are dependent on our ability to protect our infrastructure against damage from catastrophe, natural disaster, or severe weather including events resulting from unauthorized security breach, power loss, telecommunications failure, terrorist attack, or other events that could have a significant disruptive effect on our operations. we have disaster recovery and business continuity plans in place in the event of system failure due to any of these events and we test our plans regularly. in addition, our data center services provider also has disaster recovery plans and procedures in place. however, we cannot be certain that our plans, or those of our data center services provider, will be successful in the event of a disaster. if our disaster recovery or business continuity plans are unsuccessful in a disaster recovery scenario, we could potentially lose client data or experience material adverse interruptions to our operations or delivery of services to our clients, and we could be liable to parties who are financially harmed by those failures. in addition, such failures could cause us to lose revenues, lose clients or damage our reputation.
any slowdown or failure of our computer or communications systems or those of our data center services provider could impact our ability to provide services to our clients and support our internal operations and could subject us to liability for losses suffered by our clients or their customers.
our services depend on our ability to store, retrieve, process, and manage significant databases, and to receive and process transactions and investor communications through a variety of electronic systems such as the internet. our systems, those of our data center services provider, or any other systems with which ours interact could slow down significantly or fail for a variety of reasons, including:
•   computer viruses or undetected errors in internal software programs or computer systems;
•   direct or indirect hacking or denial of service cybersecurity attacks;
•   inability to rapidly monitor all system activity;
•   inability to effectively resolve any errors in internal software programs or computer systems once they are detected;
•   heavy stress placed on systems during peak times; or
while we monitor system loads and performance and implement system upgrades to handle predicted increases in trading volume and volatility, we may not be able to predict future volume increases or volatility accurately or that our systems and those of our data center services provider will be able to accommodate these volume increases or volatility without failure or degradation. in addition, we may not be able to prevent cybersecurity attacks on our systems. moreover, because we have outsourced our data center operations, the operation and performance of the data center involve factors beyond our control. any significant degradation or failure of our computer systems, communications systems or any other systems in the performance of our services could cause our clients or their customers to suffer delays in their receipt of our services. these delays could cause substantial losses for our clients or their customers, and we could be liable to parties who are financially harmed by those failures. in addition, such failures could cause us to lose revenues, lose clients or damage our reputation.
operational errors in the performance of our services could lead to liability for claims, client loss and result in reputational damage.
the failure to properly perform our services could result in our clients and/or certain of our subsidiaries being subjected to losses including censures, fines, or other sanctions by applicable regulatory authorities, and we could be liable to parties who are financially harmed by those errors. in addition, such errors could cause us to lose revenues, lose clients or damage our reputation.
general economic and political conditions and broad trends in business and finance that are beyond our control may contribute to reduced levels of activity in the securities markets, which could result in lower revenues from our business operations.
the number of unique securities positions held by investors through our clients, the level of investor communications activity we process on behalf of our clients, trading volumes, market prices, and liquidity of the securities markets are affected by general national and international economic and political conditions, and broad trends in business and finance that result in changes in participation and activity in the securities markets. these factors include:
•   economic, political and market conditions;
•   legislative and regulatory changes;
•   the availability of short-term and long-term funding and capital;
•   the level and volatility of interest rates;
•   national, state, and local taxation levels affecting securities transactions.
these factors are beyond our control and may contribute to reduced levels of participation and activity in the securities markets. our revenues have historically been largely driven by transaction processing based on levels of participation and activity in the securities markets. accordingly, any significant reduction in participation and activity in the securities markets would likely result in lower revenues from our business operations.
if the operational systems and infrastructure that we depend on fail to keep pace with our growth, we may experience operating inefficiencies, client dissatisfaction and lost revenue opportunities.
the growth of our business and expansion of our client base may place a strain on our management and operations. we believe that our current and anticipated future growth will require the implementation of new and enhanced communications and information systems, the training of personnel to operate these systems, and the expansion and upgrade of core technologies. while many of our systems are designed to accommodate additional growth without redesign or replacement, we may nevertheless need to make significant investments in additional hardware and software to accommodate growth. in addition, we cannot assure you that we will be able to predict the timing or rate of this growth accurately or expand and upgrade our systems and infrastructure on a timely basis.
our growth has required and will continue to require increased investments in management personnel and systems, financial systems and controls, and office facilities. we cannot assure you that we will be able to manage or continue to manage our future growth successfully. if we fail to manage our growth, we may experience operating inefficiencies, dissatisfaction among our client base, and lost revenue opportunities.
if we are unable to respond to the demands of our existing and new clients, our ability to reach our revenue goals or maintain our profitability could be diminished.
the global financial services industry is characterized by increasingly complex and integrated infrastructures and products, new and changing business models and rapid technological and regulatory changes. our clients' needs and demands for our products and services evolve with these changes. our future success will depend, in part, on our ability to respond to our clients' demands for new services, capabilities and technologies on a timely and cost-effective basis, to adapt to technological advancements and changing regulatory standards, and to address our clients' increasingly sophisticated requirements.
intense competition could negatively affect our ability to maintain or increase our market share and profitability.
the markets for our products and services continue to evolve and are highly competitive. we compete with a number of firms that provide similar products and services. in addition, our securities processing solutions compete with our clients' in-house capabilities to perform competitive functions. our competitors may be able to respond more quickly to new or changing opportunities, technologies, and client requirements and may be able to undertake more extensive promotional activities, offer more attractive terms to clients and adopt more aggressive pricing policies than we will be able to offer or adopt. in addition, we expect that the markets in which we compete will continue to attract new competitors and new technologies, including international providers of similar products and services to ours. there can be no assurances that we will be able to compete effectively with current or future competitors. if we fail to compete effectively, our market share could decrease and our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be materially harmed.
we rely on the united states postal service ("usps") and other third party carriers to deliver communications and changes in our relationships with these carriers or an increase in postal rates or shipping costs may adversely impact demand for our products and services and could have an adverse impact on our business and results of operations.
we rely upon the usps and third party carriers, including fedex and ups, for timely delivery of communications on behalf of our clients. as a result, we are subject to carrier disruptions due to factors that are beyond our control, including employee strikes, inclement weather and increased fuel costs.  any failure to deliver communications to our clients in a timely and accurate manner may damage our reputation and brand and could cause us to lose clients. in addition, the usps has incurred significant financial losses in recent years and may, as a result, implement significant changes to the breadth or frequency of its mail delivery. if our relationship with any of these third party carriers is terminated or impaired, or if any of these third parties are unable to distribute communications, we would be required to use alternative, and possibly more expensive, carriers to complete our distributions on behalf of our clients. we may be unable to engage alternative carriers on a timely basis or on acceptable terms, if at all, which could have an adverse effect on our business. in addition, future increases in postal rates or shipping costs, as well as changes in customer preferences, may result in decreased demand for our traditional printed and mailed communications resulting in an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
our business, financial position, and results of operations could be harmed by adverse rating actions by credit rating agencies.
if the credit ratings of our outstanding indebtedness are downgraded, or if rating agencies indicate that a downgrade may occur, our business, financial position, and results of operations could be adversely affected and perceptions of our financial strength could be damaged. a downgrade would have the effect of increasing our borrowing costs, and could decrease the availability of funds we are able to borrow, adversely affecting our business, financial position, and results of operations. in addition, a downgrade could adversely affect our relationships with our clients. for further information with respect to our borrowing costs, see note 12, "borrowings" to our consolidated financial statements under item 8 of part ii of this annual report on form 10-k.
our continued success depends on our ability to attract and retain key personnel such as our senior management and other qualified personnel to conduct our business. the market for such experienced senior managers and other qualified personnel is extremely competitive. there can be no assurance that we will be successful in our efforts to recruit and retain the required key personnel. if we are unable to attract and retain qualified individuals or our recruiting and retention costs increase significantly, our operations and financial results could be materially adversely affected.
the inability to identify, obtain and retain important intellectual property rights to technology could harm our business.
our success depends in part upon the development, licensing, and acquisition of systems and applications to conduct our business. our success will increasingly depend in part on our ability to identify, obtain and retain intellectual property rights to technology, both for internal use as well as for use in providing services to our clients, through internal development, acquisition, licensing from others, or alliances with others. our inability to identify, obtain and retain rights to certain technology on favorable terms and conditions would make it difficult to conduct business, or to timely introduce new and innovative products and services, which could harm our business, financial condition, and results of operations.
our products and services, and the products and services provided to us by third parties, may infringe upon intellectual property rights of third parties, and any infringement claims could require us to incur substantial costs, distract our management, or prevent us from conducting our business.
although we attempt to avoid infringing upon known proprietary rights of third parties, we are subject to the risk of claims alleging infringement of third party proprietary rights. if in response to a third party infringement allegation, we were to determine that we require a license to such third party's proprietary rights, then we may be unable to obtain such license on commercially reasonable terms. additionally, third parties that provide us with products or services that are integral to the conduct of our business may also be subject to similar infringement allegations from others, which could prevent such third parties from continuing to provide these products or services to us. in either of these events, we may need to undertake substantial reengineering of our products or services in order to continue offering them, and we may not succeed in doing so. in addition, any claim of infringement could cause us to incur substantial costs defending such claim, even if the claim is baseless, and could distract our management from our business. furthermore, a party asserting such an infringement claim could secure a judgment against us that requires us to pay substantial damages, grants such party injunctive relief, or grants other court ordered remedies that could prevent us from conducting our business.
acquisitions and integrating such acquisitions create certain risks and may affect operating results.
we frequently engage in, and expect to continue to engage in, business acquisitions. the acquisition and integration of businesses involve a number of risks. the core risks are in the areas of:
•   valuation: finding suitable businesses to acquire at affordable valuations or on other acceptable terms; competition for acquisitions from other potential acquirors, and negotiating a fair price for the business based on inherently limited due diligence reviews;
•   integration: managing the complex process of integrating the acquired company's people, products, technology, and other assets, and converting their financial, information security, privacy and other systems and controls to meet our standards, so as to realize the projected value of the acquired company and the synergies projected to be realized in connection with the acquisition; and
•   legacy issues: protecting against actions, claims, regulatory investigations, losses, and other liabilities related to the predecessor business.
also, the process of integrating these businesses may disrupt our business and divert our resources. these risks may arise for a number of reasons including, for example:
•   finding suitable businesses to acquire at affordable valuations or on other acceptable terms;
•   incurring unforeseen obligations or liabilities in connection with such acquisitions;
•   devoting unanticipated financial and management resources to an acquired business;
•   borrowing money from lenders or selling equity or debt securities to the public to finance future acquisitions on terms that may be adverse to us;
•   loss of clients of the acquired business;
•   entering markets where we have minimal prior experience; and
•   experiencing decreases in earnings as a result of non-cash impairment charges.
in addition, international acquisitions often involve additional or increased risks including, for example:
•   geographically separated organizations, systems, and facilities;
•   integrating personnel with diverse business backgrounds and organizational cultures;
•   general economic and political conditions.
we operate internationally and our operations could be adversely impacted by local legal, economic, political and other conditions.
a portion of our revenue is generated outside the u.s. and in recent years, we have expanded our operations, entered strategic alliances, and acquired businesses outside the u.s. also, our business is highly dependent on the global financial services industry and exchanges and market centers around the world. changes in the laws or policies of the countries in which we operate, or inadequate enforcement of laws or policies such as those protecting intellectual property, could affect our business and the company's overall results of operations. our operations also could be affected by economic and political changes in those countries, particularly in those with developing economies, and by macroeconomic changes, including recessions, inflation and currency fluctuations between the u.s. dollar and non-u.s. currencies. in addition, our operations and our ability to deliver our services to our clients could be adversely impacted if there is instability, disruption or destruction in certain geographic regions including as a result of natural or man-made disasters, wars, terrorist activities, or any widespread outbreak of an illness, pandemic or other local or global health issue.
our mutual fund processing services may be exposed to risk from our counterparties and third parties.
in the normal course of business, our mutual fund and exchange traded fund processing services involve the settlement of transactions on behalf of our customers and third parties. with these activities, we may be exposed to risk in the event our clients, or other broker-dealers, banks, clearing organizations, or depositories are unable to fulfill contractual obligations.
our revenues are subject to seasonal variations because we process and distribute the greatest number of proxy materials and annual reports in our fourth fiscal quarter.
processing and distributing proxy materials and annual reports to investors in equity securities and mutual funds comprises a large portion of our investor communication solutions business. we process and distribute the greatest number of proxy materials and annual reports during our fourth fiscal quarter. the recurring periodic activity of this business is linked to significant filing deadlines imposed by law on public reporting companies and mutual funds. historically, this has caused our revenues, operating income, net earnings, and cash flows from operating activities to be higher in our fourth fiscal quarter than in any other fiscal quarter. the seasonality of our revenues makes it difficult to estimate future operating results based on the results of any specific fiscal quarter and could affect an investor's ability to compare our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows on a fiscal quarter-by-quarter basis.
item 7.   management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations this discussion summarizes the significant factors affecting the results of operations and financial condition of broadridge during the fiscal years ended june 30, 2017, 2016, and 2015 and should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes thereto included elsewhere herein. certain information contained in "management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations" are "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of 1995. statements that are not historical in nature and which may be identified by the use of words such as "expects," "assumes," "projects," "anticipates," "estimates," "we believe," "could be" and other words of similar meaning, are forward-looking statements. these statements are based on management's expectations and assumptions and are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed. our actual results, performance or achievements may differ materially from the results discussed in this item 7 because of various factors, including those set forth elsewhere herein. see "forward-looking statements" and "risk factors" included in item 1 of this annual report on form 10-k.

basis of presentation the consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles ("gaap") in the united states of america ("u.s."). these financial statements present the consolidated position of the company and include the entities in which the company directly or indirectly has a controlling financial interest as well as various entities in which the company has investments recorded under either the cost or equity methods of accounting. intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated. amounts presented may not sum due to rounding.
in presenting the consolidated financial statements, management makes estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported and related disclosures. management continually evaluates the accounting policies and estimates used to prepare the consolidated financial statements. the estimates, by their nature, are based on judgment, available information, and historical experience and are believed to be reasonable. however, actual amounts and results could differ from those estimates made by management. in management's opinion, the consolidated financial statements contain all normal recurring adjustments necessary for a fair presentation of results reported. the results of operations reported for the periods presented are not necessarily indicative of the results of operations for subsequent periods.
effective in the first quarter of fiscal year 2017, we have revised our presentation in the consolidated statements of earnings to separately present interest expense, net. previously, interest expense, net, was reported as part of non-operating expenses, net, and was not separately presented in the consolidated statements of earnings. all prior period information has been conformed to the current period presentation. see note 4, "interest expense, net," to our consolidated financial statements under item 8 of part ii of this annual report on form 10-k for details of the company's interest expense, net, note 5, "other non-operating (income) expenses, net," to our consolidated financial statements under item 8 of part ii of this annual report on form 10-k for details of the company's other non-operating (income) expenses, net, and note 19, "quarterly financial results (unaudited)," to our consolidated financial statements under item 8 of part ii of this annual report on form 10-k for details of our operating income.
effective in the first quarter of fiscal year 2017, the company adopted financial accounting standards board ("fasb") accounting standards update ("asu") no. 2015-03, "simplifying the presentation of debt issuance costs" ("asu no. 2015-03"), which requires that debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of that debt liability, consistent with debt discounts. the company has applied this guidance on a retrospective basis and accordingly, the consolidated balance sheet under item 8 of part ii of this annual report on form 10-k as of june 30, 2016 has been updated to reflect this new classification, which resulted in a decrease in other non-current assets of $7.1 million, a decrease in long-term debt, excluding current portion of $7.0 million and a decrease of $0.1 million in current portion of long-term debt at june 30, 2016.
critical accounting policies we continually evaluate the accounting policies and estimates used to prepare the consolidated financial statements. the estimates, by their nature, are based on judgment, available information, and historical experience and are believed to be reasonable. however, actual amounts and results could differ from these estimates made by management. certain accounting policies that require significant management estimates and are deemed critical to our results of operations or financial position are discussed below.
goodwill. we review the carrying value of all our goodwill by comparing the carrying value of our reporting units to their fair values. we are required to perform this comparison at least annually or more frequently if circumstances indicate a possible impairment. when determining fair value of a reporting unit, we utilize the income approach which considers future cash flows using various assumptions, including projections of revenues based on assumed long-term growth rates, estimated costs and appropriate discount rates based on the particular reporting unit's weighted-average cost of capital. the principal factors used in the discounted cash flow analysis requiring judgment are the projected future operating cash flows, the weighted-average cost of capital and the terminal value growth rate assumptions. the weighted-average cost of capital takes into account the relative weight of each component of our consolidated capital structure (equity and long-term debt). our estimates of long-term growth and costs are based on historical data, various internal estimates and a variety of external sources, and are developed as part of our routine, long-range planning process. changes in economic and operating conditions impacting these assumptions could result in goodwill impairments in future periods. we had $1,159.3 million of goodwill as of june 30, 2017. given the significance of our goodwill, an adverse change to the fair value of one of our reporting units could result in an impairment charge, which could be material to our earnings.
the company performs a sensitivity analysis under step 1 of the goodwill impairment test assuming hypothetical reductions in the fair values of our reporting units. a 10% change in our estimates of projected future operating cash flows,
discount rates, or terminal value growth rates used in our calculations of the fair values of the reporting units would not result in an impairment of our goodwill.
income taxes. the objectives of accounting for income taxes are to recognize the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in an entity's financial statements or tax returns. judgment is required in addressing the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our consolidated financial statements or tax returns (e.g., realization of deferred tax assets, changes in tax laws or interpretations thereof). the company is subject to regular examination of its income tax returns by the u.s. federal, state and foreign tax authorities. a change in the assessment of the outcomes of such matters could materially impact our consolidated financial statements. the company has estimated foreign net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $14.8 million as of june 30, 2017 of which $1.3 million expires in 2018 through 2027 and of which $13.5 million has an indefinite utilization period. in addition, the company has estimated u.s. federal net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $26.4 million, which expire in 2018 through 2030.
valuation allowances are recognized to reduce deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that the company will not be able to utilize the deferred tax assets attributable to net operating and capital loss carryforwards of certain subsidiaries to offset future taxable earnings. the company has recorded valuation allowances of $9.3 million and $9.8 million at june 30, 2017 and 2016, respectively. the determination as to whether a deferred tax asset will be recognized is made on a jurisdictional basis and is based on the evaluation of historical taxable income or loss, projected future taxable income, carryforward periods, scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities and tax planning strategies. projected future taxable income is based on expected results and assumptions as to the jurisdiction in which the income will be earned. the assumptions used to project future taxable income requires significant judgment and are consistent with the plans and estimates used to manage the underlying businesses.
share-based payments. accounting for stock-based compensation requires the measurement of stock-based compensation expense based on the fair value of the award on the date of grant. we determine the fair value of stock options issued by using a binomial option-pricing model. the binomial option-pricing model considers a range of assumptions related to volatility, dividend yield, risk-free interest rate and employee exercise behavior. expected volatilities utilized in the binomial option-pricing model are based on a combination of implied market volatilities, historical volatility of our stock price and other factors. similarly, the dividend yield is based on historical experience and expected future changes. the risk-free rate is derived from the u.s. treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant. the binomial option-pricing model also incorporates exercise and forfeiture assumptions based on an analysis of historical data. the expected life of the stock option grants is derived from the output of the binomial model and represents the period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding. determining these assumptions are subjective and complex, and therefore, a change in the assumptions utilized could impact the calculation of the fair value of our stock options. a hypothetical change of five percentage points applied to the volatility assumption used to determine the fair value of the fiscal year 2017 stock option grants would result in approximately a $1.6 million change in total pre-tax stock-based compensation expense for the fiscal year 2017 grants, which would be amortized over the vesting period. a hypothetical change of one year in the expected life assumption used to determine the fair value of the fiscal year 2017 stock option grants would result in approximately a $0.5 million change in the total pre-tax stock-based compensation expense for the fiscal year 2017 grants, which would be amortized over the vesting period. a hypothetical change of one percentage point in the forfeiture rate assumption used for the fiscal year 2017 stock option grants would result in approximately a $0.1 million change in the total pre-tax stock-based compensation expense for the fiscal year 2017 grants, which would be amortized over the vesting period. a hypothetical one-half percentage point change in the dividend yield assumption used to determine the fair value of the fiscal year 2017 stock option grants would result in approximately a $0.7 million change in the total pre-tax stock-based compensation expense for the fiscal year 2017 grants, which would be amortized over the vesting period.
results of operations the following discussions of analysis of consolidated statements of earnings and analysis of reportable segments refer to the fiscal year ended june 30, 2017 compared to the fiscal year ended june 30, 2016, and the fiscal year ended june 30, 2016 compared to the fiscal year ended june 30, 2015. the analysis of consolidated statements of earnings should be read in conjunction with the analysis of reportable segments, which provides more detailed discussions concerning certain components of the consolidated statements of earnings.
the following references are utilized in the discussions of analysis of consolidated statements of earnings and analysis of reportable segments:
"amortization of acquired intangibles and purchased intellectual property" and "acquisition and integration costs" represent certain non-cash amortization expenses associated with acquired intangible assets and purchased intellectual property assets, and certain transaction and integration costs associated with the company's acquisition activities, respectively.
"net new business" refers to recurring revenue from closed sales less recurring revenue from client losses.
fee revenues in the investor communication solutions segment are derived from both recurring and event-driven activity. in addition, the level of recurring and event-driven activity we process directly impacts distribution revenues. while event-driven activity is highly repeatable, it may not recur on an annual basis. the types of services we provide that comprise event-driven activity are:
•   mutual fund proxy: the proxy and related services we provide to mutual funds when certain events occur requiring a shareholder vote including changes in directors, sub-advisors, fee structures, investment restrictions, and mergers of funds.
•   mutual fund communications: mutual fund communications services consist primarily of the distribution on behalf of mutual funds of supplemental information required to be provided to the annual mutual fund prospectus as a result of certain triggering events such as a change in portfolio managers. in addition, mutual fund communications consist of notices and marketing materials such as newsletters.
•   proxy contests and specials, corporate actions, and other: the proxy services we provide in connection with shareholder meetings driven by special events such as proxy contests, mergers and acquisitions, and tender/exchange offers.
event-driven fee revenues are based on the number of special events and corporate transactions we process. event-driven activity is impacted by financial market conditions and changes in regulatory compliance requirements, resulting in fluctuations in the timing and levels of event-driven fee revenues. as such, the timing and level of event-driven activity and its potential impact on revenues and earnings are difficult to forecast.
generally, mutual fund proxy activity has been subject to a greater level of volatility than the other components of event-driven activity. during fiscal year 2017, mutual fund proxy fee revenues were 19% higher than the prior fiscal year while during fiscal years 2016 and 2015, mutual fund proxy revenues were 22% higher and 2% lower than the prior fiscal year, respectively. although it is difficult to forecast the levels of event-driven activity, we expect that the portion of fee revenues derived from mutual fund proxy activity may continue to experience volatility in the future.
distribution revenues primarily include revenues related to the physical mailing of proxy materials, interim communications, transaction reporting, customer communications and fulfillment services as well as matrix administrative services.
distribution cost of revenues consists primarily of postage-related expenses incurred in connection with our investor communication solutions segment, as well as matrix administrative services expenses. these costs are reflected in cost of revenues.
closed sales represent an estimate of the expected annual recurring fee revenue for new client contracts that were signed by broadridge in the current reporting period. closed sales does not include event-driven or distribution activity. we consider contract terms, expected client volumes or activity, knowledge of the marketplace and experience with our clients, among other factors, when determining the estimate. management uses closed sales to measure the effectiveness of our sales and marketing programs, as an indicator of expected future revenues and as a performance metric in determining incentive compensation.
closed sales is not a measure of financial performance under gaap, and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for revenue or other income statement data prepared in accordance with gaap. closed sales is a useful metric for investors in understanding how management measures and evaluates our ongoing operational performance.
the inherent variability of transaction volumes and activity levels can result in some variability of amounts reported as actual achieved closed sales. for fiscal years prior to fiscal year 2017, we tracked actual revenues achieved during the first year that the client contract was fully implemented and compared this to the previously reported closed sales amount, this process was used to calibrate metrics used in incentive compensation and will be used to estimate future allowance adjustments. larger closed sales can take up to 12 to 24 months or longer to convert to revenues, particularly for the services provided by our global technology and operations segment.
beginning in the fiscal year ended june 30, 2017, we have reported closed sales net of a 3.5% allowance adjustment, in lieu of our previous practice of adjusting for actual performance in subsequent periods. consequently, our reported closed sales amounts will not be adjusted for actual revenues achieved because these adjustments are estimated in the period the sale is reported. the allowance adjustment was determined by reviewing the reported closed sales amounts for the prior five fiscal years based on estimated revenues at signing and comparing those amounts to the revenues achieved one year after the clients went live on the services. cumulatively during the five years from fiscal year 2012 through fiscal year 2016, we reported closed sales of $689.3 million based on estimates at signing, while revenues achieved one year after go-live were $665.2 million, resulting in revaluation losses of $24.1 million or a realized loss experience of 3.5%. we will assess this allowance amount at the end of each fiscal year to establish the appropriate allowance for the subsequent year using the trailing five years data referenced earlier as the starting point, normalized for outlying factors, if any, to enhance the accuracy of the allowance.
for the fiscal years ended june 30, 2017, 2016 and 2015, closed sales, which includes contributions from nacc in fiscal year 2017, were $188.5 million, $150.9 million and $146.4 million, respectively. the fiscal year ended june 30, 2017 is net of an allowance adjustment of $6.8 million.

selling, general and administrative expenses for the fiscal year ended june 30, 2016 were $420.9 million, an increase of $21.8 million, or 5%, compared to $399.1 million for the fiscal year ended june 30, 2015. the increase was primarily due to (i) higher costs related to acquisitions of $15.7 million; (ii) higher performance-based compensation expense of $6.8 million and (iii) higher selling and marketing expenses of $2.9 million as the company continued to focus on increasing its sales capabilities, partially offset by (iv) lower professional services fees of $5.1 million.
operating income. operating income for the fiscal year ended june 30, 2016 was $500.3 million, an increase of $33.4 million, or 7%, compared to $466.9 million for the fiscal year ended june 30, 2015. the increase is due to higher revenues, partially offset by higher operating expenses including $6.5 million of increased amortization expense from acquired intangibles. operating income margins was unchanged at 17.3% for the fiscal year ended june 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
interest expense, net. interest expense, net for the fiscal year ended june 30, 2016 was $25.7 million, an increase of $3.2 million, or 14%, compared to $22.6 million for the fiscal year ended june 30, 2015. the increase was primarily due to an increase in interest expense of $3.0 million from higher long-term borrowings related to our revolving credit facility.
other non-operating (income) expenses, net. other non-operating expenses, net for the fiscal year ended june 30, 2016 were $5.6 million, an increase of $0.2 million, or 4%, compared to $5.4 million for the fiscal year ended june 30, 2015.
earnings before income taxes. earnings before income taxes for the fiscal year ended june 30, 2016 were $468.9 million, an increase of $30.0 million, or 7%, compared to $438.9 million for the fiscal year ended june 30, 2015. the increase is primarily due to higher revenues, partially offset by higher operating and non-operating expenses.
provision for income taxes. the provision for income taxes and the effective tax rates for the fiscal year ended june 30, 2016 were $161.4 million and 34.4%, respectively, compared to $151.8 million and 34.6%, for the fiscal year ended june 30, 2015, respectively. the decrease in the effective tax rate was primarily attributable to a greater recognition of tax benefits in fiscal year 2016 for the current year federal research and development tax credit and the section 199 domestic production activities deduction.
net earnings and basic and diluted earnings per share. net earnings for the fiscal year ended june 30, 2016 were $307.5 million, an increase of $20.4 million, or 7%, compared to $287.1 million for the fiscal year ended june 30, 2015. the increase in net earnings reflects higher revenues, and improvement in pre-tax margins as discussed above.
basic and diluted earnings per share for the fiscal year ended june 30, 2016 were $2.60, an increase of $0.21, or 9%, and $2.53, an increase of $0.21, or 9%, respectively, compared to $2.39 and $2.32 for the fiscal year ended june 30, 2015, respectively.
analysis of reportable segments broadridge has two reportable business segments: (1) investor communication solutions and (2) global technology and operations.
the primary component of "other" are certain gains, losses, corporate overhead expenses and non-operating expenses that have not been allocated to the reportable segments, such as interest expense. foreign currency exchange is a reconciling item between the actual foreign currency exchange rates and the constant foreign currency exchange rates used for internal management reporting.
certain corporate expenses, as well as certain centrally managed expenses, are allocated based upon budgeted amounts in a reasonable manner. because the company compensates the management of its various businesses on, among other factors, segment profit, the company may elect to record certain segment-related operating and non-operating expense items in other rather than reflect such items in segment profit.

revenues. investor communication solutions segment's revenues for the fiscal year ended june 30, 2017 were $3,421.4 million an increase of $1,201.0 million, or 54%, compared to $2,220.4 million for the fiscal year ended june 30, 2016. revenues from the nacc acquisition contributed $1,067.1 million of this total increase. the increase was attributable to higher recurring fee revenues of $491.2 million, higher event-driven fee revenues of $19.5 million and higher distribution revenues of $690.2 million.
the higher recurring fee revenues of $491.2 million, or 42%, reflected: (i) contributions from the nacc acquisition (37 pts), (ii) net new business (4 pts), and (iii) internal growth (2 pts). higher event-driven fee revenues were the result of increased mutual fund proxy and proxy contests. position growth compared to the same period in the prior year, which is a component of internal growth, was 4% for mutual fund interims and 8% for annual equity proxy communications. revenue contribution from position growth was offset by lower activity in other products.

higher recurring fee revenues of 10% were attributable to: (i) contributions from our recent acquisitions (5 pts); (ii) net new business primarily driven by increases in revenues from closed sales (5 pts); and (iii) internal growth (1 pt). position growth compared to the same period in the prior year, which is a component of internal growth, was 3% for annual equity
proxy communications and 4% for mutual fund interims and was the primary driver behind internal growth. higher event-driven fee revenues were the result of increased mutual fund proxy and corporate re-organization communications activity.

explanation and reconciliation of the company's use of non-gaap financial measures the company's results in this annual report on form 10-k are presented in accordance with u.s. gaap except where otherwise noted. in certain circumstances, results have been presented that are not generally accepted accounting principles measures ("non-gaap"). these non-gaap measures are adjusted operating income, adjusted net earnings, adjusted earnings per share, and free cash flow. these non-gaap financial measures should be viewed in addition to, and not as a substitute for, the company's reported results.
the company believes our non-gaap financial measures help investors understand how management plans, measures and evaluates the company's business performance. management believes that non-gaap measures provide consistency in its financial reporting and facilitates investors' understanding of the company's operating results and trends by providing an additional basis for comparison. management uses these non-gaap financial measures to, among other things, evaluate our ongoing operations, for internal planning and forecasting purposes and in the calculation of performance-based compensation. in addition, and as a consequence of the importance of these non-gaap financial measures in managing our business, the company's compensation committee of the board of directors incorporates non-gaap financial measures in the evaluation process for determining management compensation.
adjusted operating income, adjusted net earnings and adjusted earnings per share these non-gaap measures reflect operating income, operating income margin, net earnings, and diluted earnings per share, as adjusted to exclude the impact of certain costs, expenses, gains and losses and other specified items that management believes are not indicative of our ongoing operating performance. these adjusted measures exclude the impact of amortization of acquired intangibles and purchased intellectual property, acquisition and integration costs and the mal investment gain. amortization of acquired intangibles and purchased intellectual property represents non-cash expenses associated with the company's acquisition activities. acquisition and integration costs represent certain transaction and integration costs associated with the company's acquisition activities.
we exclude amortization of acquired intangibles and purchased intellectual property, acquisition and integration costs and the mal investment gain from these measures because excluding such information provides us with an understanding of the results from the primary operations of our business and these items do not reflect ordinary operations or earnings. management believes these measures may be useful to an investor in evaluating the underlying operating performance of our business.
free cash flows in addition to the non-gaap financial measures discussed above, we provide free cash flow information because we consider free cash flow to be a liquidity measure that provides useful information to management and investors about the amount of cash generated that could be used for dividends, share repurchases, strategic acquisitions and other discretionary investments. free cash flow is a non-gaap financial measure and is defined by the company as net cash flows provided by operating activities less capital expenditures as well as software purchases and capitalized internal use software.

financial condition, liquidity and capital resources cash and cash equivalents consisted of the following:
at june 30, 2017 and 2016, cash and cash equivalents were $271.1 million and $727.7 million, respectively. total stockholders' equity was $1,003.8 million and $1,045.5 million at june 30, 2017 and 2016, respectively. at june 30, 2017, net working capital was $244.6 million, compared to $596.2 million at june 30, 2016. at the current time, and in future periods, we expect cash generated by our operations, together with existing cash, cash equivalents, and borrowing capacity to be sufficient to cover cash needs for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, dividends and common stock repurchases.
as of june 30, 2017, $126.2 million of the $271.1 million of cash and cash equivalents was held by our foreign subsidiaries, and $58.1 million of cash and cash equivalents was held by regulated entities. we expect existing domestic cash, cash equivalents, and cash flows from operations together with borrowing capacity to continue to be sufficient to fund our domestic operating activities and cash commitments for investing and financing activities, such as regular quarterly dividends, debt repayment schedules, and material capital expenditures, for at least the next 12 months and thereafter for the foreseeable future. in addition, we expect existing foreign cash, cash equivalents, cash flows from operations and borrowing capacity to continue to be sufficient to fund our foreign operating activities and cash commitments for investing activities, such as material capital expenditures, for at least the next 12 months and thereafter for the foreseeable future. if these funds are needed for our operations in the u.s., we would be required to accrue and pay u.s. taxes to repatriate these funds. however, our current plans do not demonstrate a need to repatriate them to fund our u.s. operations, as we consider these funds to be permanently reinvested outside the u.s.
outstanding borrowings and available capacity under the company's borrowing arrangements were as follows:

(a) on july 1, 2016, the company adopted asu 2015-03 on a retrospective basis and accordingly, the consolidated balance sheet as of june 30, 2016 has been updated to reflect this new classification, which resulted in a decrease in other non-current assets of $7.1 million, a decrease in long-term debt, excluding current portion of $7.0 million and a decrease of $0.1 million in current portion of long-term debt at june 30, 2016.
future principal payments on the company's outstanding debt are as follows:
on february 6, 2017, the company entered into a $1.0 billion five-year revolving credit facility (the "fiscal 2017 revolving credit facility"), which is comprised of a $900.0 million u.s. dollar tranche and an $100.0 million multicurrency tranche, and which replaced the $750.0 million five-year revolving credit facility entered into during august 2014 (the "fiscal 2015 revolving credit facility") (together the "revolving credit facilities"). borrowings under the fiscal 2017 revolving credit facility bear interest at libor plus 100 basis points. in addition, the fiscal 2017 revolving credit facility has an annual facility fee equal to 12.5 basis points on the entire facility, similar to the previous fiscal 2015 revolving credit facility. the annual facility fees for the revolving credit facilities totaled $1.1 million for the fiscal year ended june 30, 2017. as of june 30, 2017, the company had $210.0 million in outstanding borrowings and had unused available capacity of $790.0 million under the fiscal 2017 revolving credit facility. the facility is scheduled to expire in february 2022.
at june 30, 2017, the carrying value of the company's outstanding long-term debt was $1,102.1 million, consisting of: (i) borrowings on the fiscal 2017 revolving credit facility of $210.0 million, (ii) senior notes of $397.9 million ($400.0 million principal amount less $0.3 million of unamortized bond discount and $1.9 million of unamortized debt issuance costs) due september 2020 and (iii) senior notes of $494.1 million ($500.0 million principal amount less $1.9 million of unamortized
bond discount and $4.0 million of unamortized debt issuance costs) due june 2026. the fiscal 2017 revolving credit facility and senior notes are senior unsecured obligations of the company and are ranked equally in right of payment. interest on the senior notes due september 2020 is payable semiannually on march 1st and september 1st each year based on a fixed per annum rate equal to 3.95%. interest on the senior notes due june 2026 is payable semiannually on june 27th and december 27th each year based on a fixed per annum rate equal to 3.40%.
our liquidity position may be negatively affected by changes in general economic conditions, regulatory requirements and access to the capital markets, which may be limited if we were to fail to renew any of the credit facilities on their renewal dates or if we were to fail to meet certain covenants.

the increase in cash provided by operating activities of $78.2 million was due to: (i) an increase in net earnings of $19.3 million, (ii) increased cash provided by working capital of $31.3 million, and (iii) increased non-cash expense add-backs of $42.1 million, partially offset by (iv) increased cash used in long-term assets and liabilities of $14.5 million driven by client implementations and prepaid broker fees.
the increase in free cash flow of $40.0 million was driven by an increase in net cash flows provided by operating activities of $78.2 million partially offset by increased capital expenditures and software purchases and capitalized internal use software of $38.2 million.
the increase in cash used in investing activities of $522.4 million primarily reflects increased investments of $395.7 million in acquisitions and $90.0 million in purchased intellectual property.
the increase in cash used in financing activities of $420.3 million reflects: (i) a $223.0 million increase in the purchase of common stock, (ii) a $125.0 million repayment of short term borrowings, (iii) a $122.9 million decrease in net proceeds from borrowings in the current year compared to the prior fiscal year, and (iv) a $14.0 million increase in dividends paid, partially offset by cash provided by: (i) a $36.2 million increase in the proceeds from stock option exercises, and (ii) a $19.2 million increase in excess tax benefits from the exercise and vesting of stock-based compensation awards.

capital expenditures and software purchases and capitalized internal use software       (75.5   )           (66.0   )            (9.5    )
the increase in cash provided by operating activities of $6.3 million was due to: (a) $42.4 million of increased cash provided by (i) an increase in net earnings of $20.4 million; combined with (ii) an increase in non-cash expense add-backs and other adjustments of $10.5 million; and (iii) a decrease in working capital of $11.5 million, notwithstanding the collection of a $26.1 million tax refund by a canadian subsidiary in the prior year that did not recur; offset by: (b) $36.1 million of increased cash used in non-current assets and liabilities due primarily to long-term client contracts.
the decrease in free cash flows of $3.2 million was driven by an increase in net cash flows provided by operating activities of $6.3 million, partially offset by increased capital expenditures, software purchases and capitalized internal use software of $9.5 million.
the decrease in cash used in investing activities of $139.5 million primarily reflects lower spending of $149.9 million on acquisitions in the current fiscal year as compared to the prior fiscal year, partially offset by higher capital expenditures and purchases of intangibles of $9.5 million in the current fiscal year as compared to the prior fiscal year.
the increased cash provided by financing activities of $266.9 million reflects a $181.9 million decrease in the purchases of common stock in the current fiscal year compared to the prior fiscal year and an increase in net proceeds from borrowings of $167.9 million in the current year compared to the prior fiscal year, partially offset by a decrease of $37.3 million in proceeds from stock options the current fiscal year as compared to the prior fiscal year, a decrease of $19.2 million in excess tax benefits from the issuance of stock-based compensation awards and a $15.9 million increase in dividends paid.
income taxes the company, headquartered in the u.s., is routinely examined by the irs and is also routinely examined by the tax authorities in the u.s. states and foreign countries in which it conducts business. the tax years under audit examination vary by tax jurisdiction. the company regularly considers the likelihood of assessments in each of the jurisdictions resulting from examinations. to the extent the company determines it has potential tax assessments in particular tax jurisdictions, the company has established tax reserves which it believes are adequate in relation to the potential assessments. once established, reserves are adjusted when there is more information available, when an event occurs necessitating a change to the reserves or the statute of limitations for the relevant taxing authority to examine the tax position has expired. the resolution of tax matters should not have a material effect on the financial condition of the company or on the company's consolidated statements of earnings for a particular future period.

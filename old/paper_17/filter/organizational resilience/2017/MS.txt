credit quality crm evaluates new obligors before credit transactions are initially approved and at least annually thereafter for corporate and wholesale real estate loans. for corporate loans, credit evaluations typically involve the evaluation of financial statements, assessment of leverage, liquidity, capital strength, asset composition and quality, market capitalization and access to capital markets, cash flow projections and debt service requirements, and the adequacy of collateral, if applicable.
notes to consolidated financial statements crm also evaluates strategy, market position, industry dynamics, obligors management and other factors that could affect an obligors risk profile. for wholesale real estate loans, the credit evaluation is focused on property and transaction metrics, including property type, loan-to-value ratio, occupancy levels, debt service ratio, prevailing capitalization rates and market dynamics. for residential real estate and consumer loans, the initial credit evaluation typically includes, but is not limited to, review of the obligors income, net worth, liquidity, collateral, loan-to-value ratio and credit bureau information. subsequent credit monitoring for residential real estate loans is performed at the portfolio level. consumer loan collateral values are monitored on an ongoing basis.
the firm utilizes the following credit quality indicators, which are consistent with u.s. banking agencies definitions of criticized exposures, in its credit monitoring process for loans held for investment:
                                      pass. a credit exposure rated pass has a continued expectation of timely repayment, all obligations of the borrower are current, and the obligor complies with material terms and conditions of the lending agreement.
                                           special mention. extensions of credit that have potential weakness that deserve managements close attention and, if left uncorrected, may, at some future date, result in the deterioration of the repayment prospects or collateral position.
                                              substandard. obligor has a well-defined weakness that jeopardizes the repayment of the debt and has a high probability of payment default with the distinct possibility that the firm will sustain some loss if noted deficiencies are not corrected.
                     doubtful. inherent weakness in the exposure makes the collection or repayment in full, based on existing facts, conditions and circumstances, highly improbable, and the amount of loss is uncertain.
   loss. extensions of credit classified as loss are considered uncollectible and are charged off.
loans considered as doubtful or loss are considered impaired. substandard loans are regularly reviewed for impairment. when a loan is impaired, the impairment is measured based on the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loans effective interest rate or, as a practical expedient, the observable market price of the loan or the fair value of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent. for further information, see note 2.
the following loans and lending commitments have been evaluated for a specific allowance. all remaining loans and lending commitments are assessed under the inherent allowance methodology.
1.                                                 at december 31, 2017 and december 31, 2016, no allowance was recorded for these loans and lending commitments as the present value of the expected future cash flows (or, alternatively, the observable market price of the instrument or the fair value of the collateral held) equaled or exceeded the carrying value.
2.   the impaired loans upb differs from the aggregate amount of impaired loan balances with and without allowance due to various factors, including charge-offs and net deferred loan fees or costs.

notes to consolidated financial statements employee loans
employee loans are granted in conjunction with a program established to retain and recruit certain employees, are full recourse and generally require periodic repayments. these loans are recorded in customer and other receivables in the balance sheets. the firm establishes an allowance for loan amounts it does not consider recoverable, and the related provision is recorded in compensation and benefits expense.
8. equity method investments overview the firms investments accounted for under the equity method of accounting (see note 1) are included in other assets in the balance sheets. income (loss) from equity method investments is included in other revenues in the income statements.
1.   includes a $53 million impairment of the investment management business segments interest in a third-party asset manager.
japanese securities joint venture included in the equity method investments is the firms 40% voting interest in mitsubishi ufj morgan stanley securities co., ltd. (mumss). mufg holds a 60% voting interest. the firm accounts for its equity method investment in mumss within the institutional securities business segment.
in 2011, mufg contributed capital to mumss and in return received class c stock from mumss (class c stock) to restore its capital base which was eroded by trading and other losses. morgan stanley did not have an obligation to make matching capital contributions to mumss at that time.
accordingly, the firm recorded increases in its investment, with corresponding increases in additional paid-in capital, reflecting the firms 40% share of the increase in the net asset value of mumss. in the fourth quarter of 2017, mumss partially redeemed the class c stock issued to mufg, and the firm recorded a decrease in both its investment in mumss and additional paid-in capital of $71 million.
9. goodwill and intangible assets goodwill the firm completed its annual goodwill impairment testing as of july 1, 2017 and july 1, 2016. the firms impairment testing for each period did not indicate any goodwill impairment as each of the firms reporting units with goodwill had a fair value that was substantially in excess of its carrying value.

original maturities of one year or less:
1.                      variable rate borrowings bear interest based on a variety of money market indices, including libor and federal funds rates. amounts include notes carried at fair value with various payment provisions, including notes linked to equity, credit, commodity or other indices.
2.                                                    includes only borrowings with original maturities greater than one year. weighted average coupon is calculated utilizing u.s. and non-u.s. dollar interest rates and excludes financial instruments for which the fair value option was elected. virtually all of the variable rate notes issued by subsidiaries are carried at fair value so a weighted average coupon is not meaningful.
increases (decreases) in carrying amount of borrowings associated with fair value hedges
notes to consolidated financial statements certain senior debt securities are denominated in various non-u.s. dollar currencies and may be structured to provide a return that is linked to equity, credit, commodity or other indices (e.g., the consumer price index). senior debt also may be structured to be callable by the firm or extendible at the option of holders of the senior debt securities.
debt containing an option that effectively allows the holders to put the notes back to the firm totaled $3,023 million at december 31, 2017 and $3,156 million at december 31, 2016. in addition, in certain circumstances, certain purchasers may be entitled to cause the repurchase of the notes through liquidity arrangements with the firm. the aggregated value of notes subject to these arrangements was $1,414 million at december 31, 2017 and $1,117 million at december 31, 2016. subordinated debt generally is issued to meet the capital requirements of the firm or its regulated subsidiaries and primarily is u.s. dollar denominated.
senior debtstructured borrowings the firms index-linked, equity-linked or credit-linked borrowings include various structured instruments whose payments and redemption values are linked to the performance of a specific index (e.g., s&p 500), a basket of stocks, a specific equity security, a credit exposure or basket of credit exposures. to minimize the exposure from such instruments, the firm has entered into various swap contracts and purchased options that effectively convert the borrowing costs into floating rates based upon libor. the firm generally carries the entire structured borrowing at fair value. the swaps and purchased options used to economically hedge the embedded features are derivatives and also are carried at fair value. changes in fair value related to the notes and economic hedges are reported in trading revenues. see notes 2 and 3 for further information on structured borrowings.
maturities of subordinated notes range from 2022 to 2027.
asset and liability management in general, other than securities inventories financed by secured funding sources, the majority of the firms assets are financed with a combination of deposits, short-term funding, floating rate long-term debt or fixed rate long-term debt swapped to a floating rate. the firm uses interest rate swaps to more closely match these borrowings to the duration, holding period and interest rate characteristics of the assets being funded and to manage interest rate risk. these swaps effectively convert certain of the firms fixed rate borrowings into floating rate obligations. in addition, for non-u.s. dollar currency borrowings that are not used to fund assets in the same currency, the firm has entered into currency swaps that effectively convert the borrowings into u.s. dollar obligations.
the firms use of swaps for asset and liability management affected its effective average borrowing rate.
1.   weighted average coupon was calculated utilizing u.s. and non-u.s. dollar interest rates and excludes financial instruments for which the fair value option was elected.
other secured financings other secured financings include the liabilities related to certain elns, transfers of financial assets that are accounted for as financings rather than sales, pledged commodities, consolidated vies where the firm is deemed to be the primary beneficiary and other secured borrowings. these liabilities are generally payable from the cash flows of the related assets accounted for as trading assets. see note 13 for further information on other secured financings related to vies and securitization activities.

within three business days types of commitments lending commitments.  lending commitments represent the notional amount of legally binding obligations to provide funding to clients for different types of loan transactions. for syndications led by the firm, the lending commitments accepted by the borrower but not yet closed are net of the amounts agreed to by counterparties that will participate in the syndication. for syndications that the firm participates in and does not lead, lending commitments accepted by the borrower but not yet closed include only the amount that the firm expects it will be allocated from the lead syndicate bank. due to the nature of the firms obligations under the commitments, these amounts include certain commitments participated to third parties. see note 7 for further information.
notes to consolidated financial statements to certain clearinghouses or associated depositories that the firm is a member of and are contingent upon the default of a clearinghouse member or other stress event. these transactions are primarily secured by collateral from u.s. government agency securities and other sovereign government obligations when they are funded.
underwriting commitments.    the firm provides underwriting commitments in connection with its capital raising sources to a diverse group of corporate and other institutional clients.
investment activities.    the firm sponsors several non-consolidated investment management funds for third-party investors where it typically acts as general partner of, and investment advisor to, these funds and typically commits to invest a minority of the capital of such funds, with subscribing third-party investors contributing the majority. the firms employees, including its senior officers as well as the firms board of directors (board), may participate on the same terms and conditions as other investors in certain of these funds that the firm sponsors primarily for client investment, except that the firm may waive or lower applicable fees and charges for its employees. the firm has contractual capital commitments, guarantees and counterparty arrangements with respect to these investment management funds.
letters of credit and other financial guarantees.    the firm has outstanding letters of credit and other financial guarantees issued by third-party banks to certain of the firms counterparties. the firm is contingently liable for these letters of credit and other financial guarantees, which are primarily used to provide collateral for securities and commodities traded and to satisfy various margin requirements in lieu of depositing cash or securities with these counterparties.
premises and equipment.    the firm has non-cancelable operating leases covering premises and equipment. future minimum rental commitments under such leases (net of sublease commitments, principally on office rentals) were as follows:
operating premises leases
total minimum rental income to be received in the future under non-cancelable operating subleases                 $12
occupancy lease agreements, in addition to base rentals, generally provide for rent and operating expense escalations resulting from increased assessments for real estate taxes and other charges.

143     december 2017 form 10-k notes to consolidated financial statements types of guarantees derivative contracts.  certain derivative contracts meet the accounting definition of a guarantee, including certain written options, contingent forward contracts and cdss (see note 4 regarding credit derivatives in which the firm has sold credit protection to the counterparty). information regarding all derivative contracts that could meet the accounting definition of a guarantee is included in the previous table wherein the notional amount is used as the maximum potential payout for certain derivative contracts, such as written interest rate caps and written foreign currency options.
in certain situations, collateral may be held by the firm for those contracts that meet the definition of a guarantee. generally, the firm sets collateral requirements by counterparty so that the collateral covers various transactions and products and is not allocated specifically to individual contracts. also, the firm may recover amounts related to the underlying asset delivered to the firm under the derivative contract.
the firm records derivative contracts at fair value. aggregate market risk limits have been established, and market risk measures are routinely monitored against these limits. the firm also manages its exposure to these derivative contracts through a variety of risk mitigation strategies, including, but not limited to, entering into offsetting economic hedge positions. the firm believes that the notional amounts of the derivative contracts generally overstate its exposure.
standby letters of credit and other financial guarantees issued.  in connection with its corporate lending business and other corporate activities, the firm provides standby letters of credit and other financial guarantees to counterparties. such arrangements represent obligations to make payments to third parties if the counterparty fails to fulfill its obligation under a borrowing arrangement or other contractual obligation. a majority of the firms standby letters of credit are provided on behalf of counterparties that are investment grade.
market value guarantees.  market value guarantees are issued to guarantee timely payment of a specified return to investors in certain affordable housing tax credit funds. these guarantees are designed to return an investors contribution to a fund and the investors share of tax losses and tax credits expected to be generated by a fund. from time to time, the firm may also guarantee return of principal invested, potentially including a specified rate of return, to fund investors.
liquidity facilities.  the firm has entered into liquidity facilities with spes and other counterparties, whereby the firm is required to make certain payments if losses or defaults occur. primarily, the firm acts as liquidity provider to municipal bond securitization spes and for standalone municipal bonds in which the holders of beneficial interests issued by these spes or the holders of the individual bonds, respectively, have the right to tender their interests for purchase by the firm on specified dates at a specified price. the firm often may have recourse to the underlying assets held by the spes in the event payments are required under such liquidity facilities, as well as make-whole or recourse provisions with the trust sponsors. primarily all of the underlying assets in the spes are investment grade. liquidity facilities provided to municipal tender option bond trusts are classified as derivatives.
whole loan sales guarantees.  the firm has provided, or otherwise agreed to be responsible for, representations and warranties regarding certain whole loan sales. under certain circumstances, the firm may be required to repurchase such assets or make other payments related to such assets if such representations and warranties are breached. the firms maximum potential payout related to such representations and warranties is equal to the current upb of such loans. the firm has information on the current upb only when it services the loans. the firm no longer services those loans and the amount included in the previous table represents the upb at the time of sale or at the time when the firm last serviced any of those loans. the current upb balances could be substantially lower than the maximum potential payout amount included in the previous table. the related liability primarily relates to sales of loans to the federal mortgage agencies.
securitization representations and warranties.  as part of the firms institutional securities business segments securitizations and related activities, the firm has provided, or otherwise agreed to be responsible for, representations and warranties regarding certain assets transferred in securitization transactions sponsored by the firm. the extent and nature of the representations and warranties, if any, vary among different securitizations. under certain circumstances, the firm may be required to repurchase certain assets or make other payments related to such assets if such representations and warranties are breached. the maximum potential amount of future payments the firm could be required to make would be equal to the current outstanding balances of, or losses associated with, the assets subject to breaches of such representations and warranties. the amount included in the previous table for the maximum potential payout includes the current upb or historical losses where known, and the upb at the time of sale when the current upb is not known.
notes to consolidated financial statements has agreed to be responsible for representations and warranties made by third-party sellers, many of which are now insolvent.
the firm also provided representations and warranties in connection with its role as an originator of certain commercial mortgage loans that it securitized into cmbs.
1.   reserved in the firms financial statements for payments to resolve claims related to breach of representations and warranties in connection with residential mortgages.
general partner guarantees.    as a general partner in certain investment management funds, the firm receives certain distributions from the partnerships related to achieving certain return hurdles according to the provisions of the partnership agreements. the firm may be required to return all or a portion of such distributions to the limited partners in the event the limited partners do not achieve a certain return as specified in the various partnership agreements, subject to certain limitations.
other guarantees and indemnities in the normal course of business, the firm provides guarantees and indemnifications in a variety of transactions. these provisions generally are standard contractual terms. certain of these guarantees and indemnifications are described below:
                                                                                          indemnities. the firm provides standard indemnities to counterparties for certain contingent exposures and taxes, including u.s. and foreign withholding taxes, on interest and other payments made on derivatives, securities and stock lending transactions, certain annuity products and other financial arrangements. these indemnity payments could be required based on a change in the tax laws, a change in interpretation of applicable tax rulings or a change in factual circumstances. certain contracts contain provisions that enable the firm to terminate the agreement upon the occurrence of such events. the maximum potential amount of future payments that the firm could be required to make under these indemnifications cannot be estimated.
                                                                  exchange/clearinghouse member guarantees. the firm is a member of various u.s.
and non-u.s. exchanges and clearinghouses that trade and clear securities and/or derivative contracts. associated with its membership, the firm may be required to pay a certain amount as determined by the exchange or the clearinghouse in case of a default of
any of its members or pay a proportionate share of the financial obligations of another member that may default on its obligations to the exchange or the clearinghouse. while the rules governing different exchange or clearinghouse memberships and the forms of these guarantees may vary, in general the firms obligations under these rules would arise only if the exchange or clearinghouse had previously exhausted its resources.
in addition, some clearinghouse rules require members to assume a proportionate share of losses resulting from the clearinghouses investment of guarantee fund contributions and initial margin, and of other losses unrelated to the default of a clearing member, if such losses exceed the specified resources allocated for such purpose by the clearinghouse.
the maximum potential payout under these rules cannot be estimated. the firm has not recorded any contingent liability in its financial statements for these agreements and believes that any potential requirement to make payments under these agreements is remote.
                                                                                       merger and acquisition guarantees. the firm may, from time to time, in its role as investment banking advisor be required to provide guarantees in connection with certain european merger and acquisition transactions. if required by the regulating authorities, the firm provides a guarantee that the acquirer in the merger and acquisition transaction has or will have sufficient funds to complete the transaction and would then be required to make the acquisition payments in the event the acquirers funds are insufficient at the completion date of the transaction.
these arrangements generally cover the time frame from the transaction offer date to its closing date and, therefore, are generally short term in nature. the firm believes the likelihood of any payment by the firm under these arrangements is remote given the level of its due diligence in its role as investment banking advisor.
in addition, in the ordinary course of business, the firm guarantees the debt and/or certain trading obligations (including obligations associated with derivatives, foreign exchange contracts and the settlement of physical commodities) of certain subsidiaries. these guarantees generally are entity or product specific and are required by investors or trading counterparties. the activities of the firms subsidiaries covered by these guarantees (including any related debt or trading obligations) are included in the financial statements.
contingencies legal.    in addition to the matters described below, in the normal course of business, the firm has been named, from time to time, as a defendant in various legal actions, including
145     december 2017 form 10-k notes to consolidated financial statements arbitrations, class actions and other litigation, arising in connection with its activities as a global diversified financial services institution. certain of the actual or threatened legal actions include claims for substantial compensatory and/or punitive damages or claims for indeterminate amounts of damages. in some cases, the entities that would otherwise be the primary defendants in such cases are bankrupt or are in financial distress. these actions have included, but are not limited to, residential mortgage and credit crisis-related matters.
over the last several years, the level of litigation and investigatory activity (both formal and informal) by governmental and self-regulatory agencies has increased materially in the financial services industry. as a result, the firm expects that it will continue to be the subject of elevated claims for damages and other relief and, while the firm has identified below any individual proceedings where the firm believes a material loss to be reasonably possible and reasonably estimable, there can be no assurance that material losses will not be incurred from claims that have not yet been asserted or are not yet determined to be probable or possible and reasonably estimable losses.
the firm contests liability and/or the amount of damages as appropriate in each pending matter. where available information indicates that it is probable a liability had been incurred at the date of the financial statements and the firm can reasonably estimate the amount of that loss, the firm accrues the estimated loss by a charge to income.
the firms future legal expenses may fluctuate from period to period, given the current environment regarding government investigations and private litigation affecting global financial services firms, including the firm.
in many proceedings and investigations, however, it is inherently difficult to determine whether any loss is probable or even possible or to estimate the amount of any loss. in addition, even where a loss is possible or an exposure to loss exists in excess of the liability already accrued with respect to a previously recognized loss contingency, it is not always possible to reasonably estimate the size of the possible loss or range of loss.
for certain legal proceedings and investigations, the firm cannot reasonably estimate such losses, particularly for proceedings and investigations where the factual record is being developed or contested or where plaintiffs or government entities seek substantial or indeterminate damages, restitution, disgorgement or penalties. numerous issues may need to be resolved, including through potentially lengthy discovery and determination of important factual matters, determination of issues related to class certification and the calculation of damages or other relief, and by addressing novel or unsettled legal questions relevant to the proceedings or investigations in question, before a loss or additional loss or range of loss or additional range of loss can be reasonably estimated for a proceeding or investigation.
for certain other legal proceedings and investigations, the firm can estimate reasonably possible losses, additional losses, ranges of loss or ranges of additional loss in excess of amounts accrued, but does not believe, based on current knowledge and after consultation with counsel, that such losses will have a material adverse effect on the firms financial statements as a whole, other than the matters referred to in the following paragraphs.

in matters styled case number 15/3637 and case number 15/4353, the dutch tax authority (dutch authority) is challenging, in the district court in amsterdam, the prior set-off by the firm of approximately 124 million (approximately $149 million) plus accrued interest of withholding tax credits against the firms corporation tax liabilities for the tax years 2007 to 2013. the dutch authority alleges that the firm was not entitled to receive the withholding tax credits on the basis, inter alia, that a firm subsidiary did not hold legal title to certain securities subject to withholding tax on the relevant dates. the dutch authority has also alleged that the firm failed to provide certain information to the dutch authority and keep adequate books and records. a hearing took place in this matter on september 19, 2017. based on currently available information, the firm believes that it could incur a loss in this action of up to approximately 124 million (approximately $149 million) plus accrued interest.
13. variable interest entities and securitization activities overview the firm is involved with various spes in the normal course of business. in most cases, these entities are deemed to be vies.
the firms variable interests in vies include debt and equity interests, commitments, guarantees, derivative instruments and certain fees. the firms involvement with vies arises primarily from:
         interests purchased in connection with market-making activities, securities held in its investment securities portfolio and retained interests held as a result of securitization activities, including re-securitization transactions.
notes to consolidated financial statements
   structuring of clns or other asset-repackaged notes designed to meet the investment objectives of clients.
   other structured transactions designed to provide tax-efficient yields to the firm or its clients.
the firm determines whether it is the primary beneficiary of a vie upon its initial involvement with the vie and reassesses whether it is the primary beneficiary on an ongoing basis as long as it has any continuing involvement with the vie. this determination is based upon an analysis of the design of the vie, including the vies structure and activities, the power to make significant economic decisions held by the firm and by other parties, and the variable interests owned by the firm and other parties.
the power to make the most significant economic decisions may take a number of different forms in different types of vies. the firm considers servicing or collateral management decisions as representing the power to make the most significant economic decisions in transactions such as securitizations or cdos. as a result, the firm does not consolidate securitizations or cdos for which it does not act as the servicer or collateral manager unless it holds certain other rights to replace the servicer or collateral manager or to require the liquidation of the entity. if the firm serves as servicer or collateral manager, or has certain other rights described in the previous sentence, the firm analyzes the interests in the vie that it holds and consolidates only those vies for which it holds a potentially significant interest in the vie.
the structure of securitization vehicles and cdos is driven by several parties, including loan seller(s) in securitization transactions, the collateral manager in a cdo, one or more rating agencies, a financial guarantor in some transactions and the underwriter(s) of the transactions, that serve to reflect specific investor demand. in addition, subordinate investors, such as the b-piece buyer (i.e., investors in most subordinated bond classes) in commercial mortgage-backed securitizations or equity investors in cdos, can influence whether specific loans are excluded from a cmbs transaction or investment criteria in a cdo.
for many transactions, such as re-securitization transactions, clns and other asset-repackaged notes, there are no significant economic decisions made on an ongoing basis. in these cases, the firm focuses its analysis on decisions made prior to the initial closing of the transaction and at the termination of the transaction. the firm concluded in most of these transactions that decisions made prior to the initial closing were shared between the firm and the initial investors based upon the nature of the assets, including whether the assets were issued in a transaction sponsored by the firm and the extent of the information available to the firm and to investors, the number, nature and involvement of investors, other rights held by the firm and investors, the standardization of the legal documentation and the level of continuing involvement by the firm, including the amount and type of interests owned by the firm and by other investors. the firm focused its control decision on any right held by the firm or investors related to the termination of the vie. most re-securitization transactions, clns and other asset-repackaged notes have no such termination rights.

149     december 2017 form 10-k notes to consolidated financial statements consolidated vie assets and liabilities are presented in the previous tables after intercompany eliminations. most assets owned by consolidated vies cannot be removed unilaterally by the firm and are not generally available to the firm. most related liabilities issued by consolidated vies are non-recourse to the firm. in certain other consolidated vies, the firm either has the unilateral right to remove assets or provides additional recourse through derivatives such as total return swaps, guarantees or other forms of involvement.
in general, the firms exposure to loss in consolidated vies is limited to losses that would be absorbed on the vies net assets recognized in its financial statements, net of amounts absorbed by third-party variable interest holders.
select information related to consolidated vies
1.   primarily related to certain derivatives, commitments, guarantees and other forms of involvement not recognized in the financial statements.
non-consolidated vies the following tables include all vies in which the firm has determined that its maximum exposure to loss is greater than specific thresholds or meets certain other criteria and exclude exposure to loss from liabilities due to immateriality. most of the vies included in the following tables are sponsored by unrelated parties; the firms involvement generally is the result of its secondary market-making activities, securities held in its investment securities portfolio (see note 5) and certain investments in funds.
carrying value of exposure to lossassets debt and equity interests                         $10,657                  $1,384                       $43              $1,202                $4,730

the firms maximum exposure to loss presented in the previous table often differs from the carrying value of the variable interests held by the firm. the maximum exposure to loss presented in the previous table is dependent on the nature of the firms variable interest in the vies and is limited to the notional amounts of certain liquidity facilities, other credit support, total return swaps, written put options, and the fair value of certain other derivatives and investments the firm has made in the vies. liabilities issued by vies generally are non-recourse to the firm. where notional amounts are utilized in quantifying the maximum exposure related to derivatives, such amounts do not reflect fair value write-downs already recorded by the firm.
the firms maximum exposure to loss presented in the previous table does not include the offsetting benefit of any financial instruments that the firm may utilize to hedge these risks associated with its variable interests. in addition, the firms maximum exposure to loss presented in the previous table is not reduced by the amount of collateral held as part of a transaction with the vie or any party to the vie directly against a specific exposure to loss.
notes to consolidated financial statements securitization transactions generally involve vies. primarily as a result of its secondary market-making activities, the firm owned additional vie assets mainly issued by securitization spes for which the maximum exposure to loss is less than specific thresholds.
these assets were either retained in connection with transfers of assets by the firm, acquired in connection with secondary market-making activities, held as afs securities in its investment securities portfolio (see note 5), or held as investments in funds. at december 31, 2017 and december 31, 2016, these assets consisted of securities backed by residential mortgage loans, commercial mortgage loans or other consumer loans, such as credit card receivables, automobile loans and student loans, cdos or clos, and investment funds.
the firms primary risk exposure is to the securities issued by the spe owned by the firm, with the highest risk on the most subordinate class of beneficial interests. these assets generally are included in trading assetscorporate and other debt, trading assetsinvestments or afs securities within its investment securities portfolio and are measured at fair value (see note 3). the firm does not provide additional support in these transactions through contractual facilities, such as liquidity facilities, guarantees or similar derivatives. the firms maximum exposure to loss generally equals the fair value of the assets owned.
securitization activities in a securitization transaction, the firm transfers assets (generally commercial or residential mortgage loans or u.s. agency securities) to an spe, sells to investors most of the beneficial interests, such as notes or certificates, issued by the spe, and, in many cases, retains other beneficial interests. in many securitization transactions involving commercial mortgage loans, the firm transfers a portion of the assets to the spe with unrelated parties transferring the remaining assets.
the purchase of the transferred assets by the spe is financed through the sale of these interests. in some of these transactions, primarily involving residential mortgage loans in the u.s., the firm serves as servicer for some or all of the transferred loans. in many securitizations, particularly involving residential mortgage loans, the firm also enters into derivative transactions, primarily interest rate swaps or interest rate caps, with the spe.
although not obligated, the firm generally makes a market in the securities issued by spes in these transactions. as a market maker, the firm offers to buy these securities from, and sell these securities to, investors. securities purchased through these market-making activities are not considered to be retained interests, although these beneficial interests generally are included in trading assetscorporate and other debt and are measured at fair value.
the firm enters into derivatives, generally interest rate swaps and interest rate caps, with a senior payment priority in many securitization transactions. the risks associated with these and similar derivatives with spes are essentially the same as similar derivatives with non-spe counterparties and are managed as part of the firms overall exposure. see note 4 for further information on derivative instruments and hedging activities.
available- for-sale securities in the afs securities within the investment securities portfolio, the firm holds securities issued by vies not sponsored by the firm. these securities include an explicit and implicit guarantee provided by the u.s. government issued in transactions sponsored by the federal mortgage agencies and the most senior securities issued by vies in which the securities are backed by student loans, automobile loans, commercial mortgage loans or clos (see note 5).
municipal tender option bond trusts in a municipal tender option bond trust transaction, the firm, generally on behalf of a client, transfers a municipal bond to a trust. the trust issues short-term securities that the firm, as the remarketing agent, sells to investors. the client retains a residual interest. the short-term securities are supported by a liquidity facility pursuant to which the investors may put their short-term interests. in some programs, the firm provides this liquidity facility; in most programs, a third-party provider will provide such liquidity facility.
the firm may purchase short-term securities in its role either as remarketing agent or as liquidity provider. the client can generally terminate the transaction at any time. the liquidity provider can generally terminate the transaction upon the occurrence of certain events. when the transaction is terminated, the municipal bond is generally sold or returned to the client. any losses suffered by the liquidity provider upon the sale of the bond are the responsibility of the client. this obligation generally is collateralized. liquidity facilities provided to municipal tender option bond trusts are classified as derivatives. the firm consolidates any municipal tender option bond trusts in which it holds the residual interest.
151     december 2017 form 10-k notes to consolidated financial statements credit protection purchased through credit-linked notes in a cln transaction, the firm transfers assets (generally high-quality securities or money market investments) to an spe, enters into a derivative transaction in which the spe writes protection on an unrelated reference asset or group of assets, through a cds, a total return swap or similar instrument, and sells to investors the securities issued by the spe. in some transactions, the firm may also enter into interest rate or currency swaps with the spe. upon the occurrence of a credit event related to the reference asset, the spe will deliver collateral securities as payment to the firm. the firm is generally exposed to price changes on the collateral securities in the event of a credit event and subsequent sale. these transactions are designed to provide investors with exposure to certain credit risk on the reference asset. in some transactions, the assets and liabilities of the spe are recognized in the firms balance sheets. in other transactions, the transfer of the collateral securities is accounted for as a sale of assets, and the spe is not consolidated. the structure of the transaction determines the accounting treatment.
derivative payments by the spe are collateralized. the risks associated with these and similar derivatives with spes are essentially the same as similar derivatives with non-spe counterparties and are managed as part of the firms overall exposure.
other structured financings the firm invests in interests issued by entities that develop and own low-income communities (including low-income housing projects) and entities that construct and own facilities that will generate energy from renewable resources. the interests entitle the firm to its share of tax credits and tax losses generated by these projects. in addition, the firm has issued guarantees to investors in certain low-income housing funds. the guarantees are designed to return an investors contribution to a fund and the investors share of tax losses and tax credits expected to be generated by the fund. the firm is also involved with entities designed to provide tax-efficient yields to the firm or its clients.
collateralized loan and debt obligations a clo or a cdo is an spe that purchases a pool of assets, consisting of corporate loans, corporate bonds, abs or synthetic exposures on similar assets through derivatives, and issues multiple tranches of debt and equity securities to investors. the firm underwrites the securities issued in clo transactions on behalf of unaffiliated sponsors and provides advisory services to these unaffiliated sponsors. the firm sells corporate loans to many of these spes, in some cases representing a significant portion of the total assets purchased. if necessary, the firm may retain unsold securities issued in these transactions. although not obligated, the firm generally makes a market in the securities issued by spes in these transactions. these beneficial interests are included in trading assets and are measured at fair value.
equity-linked notes in an eln transaction, the firm typically transfers to an spe either (1) a note issued by the firm, the payments on which are linked to the performance of a specific equity security, equity index, or other index or (2) debt securities issued by other companies and a derivative contract, the terms of which will relate to the performance of a specific equity security, equity index or other index. these transactions are designed to provide investors with exposure to certain risks related to the specific equity security, equity index or other index. eln transactions with spes were not consolidated at december 31, 2017 and december 31, 2016.
transactions with spes in which the firm, acting as principal, transferred financial assets with continuing involvement and received sales treatment are shown in the following tables.

transferred assets are carried at fair value prior to securitization, and any changes in fair value are recognized in the income statements. the firm may act as underwriter of the beneficial interests issued by these securitization vehicles. investment banking underwriting net revenues are recognized in connection with these transactions. the firm may retain interests in the securitized financial assets as one or more tranches of the securitization. these retained interests are generally carried at fair value in the balance sheets with changes in fair value recognized in the income statements.

14. regulatory requirements regulatory capital framework the firm is an fhc under the bank holding company act of 1956, as amended, and is subject to the regulation and oversight of the board of governors of the federal reserve system (federal reserve). the federal reserve establishes capital requirements for the firm, including well-capitalized standards, and evaluates the firms compliance with such capital requirements. the occ establishes similar capital requirements and standards for msbna and mspbna (collectively, our u.s. bank subsidiaries). the regulatory capital requirements are largely based on the basel iii capital standards
153     december 2017 form 10-k notes to consolidated financial statements established by the basel committee on banking supervision and also implement certain provisions of the dodd-frank wall street reform and consumer protection act.
regulatory capital requirements the firm is required to maintain minimum risk-based and leverage capital ratios under the regulatory capital requirements. a summary of the calculations of regulatory capital, rwas and transition provisions follows.
minimum risk-based capital ratio requirements apply to common equity tier 1 capital, tier 1 capital and total capital. certain adjustments to and deductions from capital are required for purposes of determining these ratios, such as goodwill, intangible assets, certain deferred tax assets, other amounts in aoci and investments in the capital instruments of unconsolidated financial institutions. certain of these adjustments and deductions are also subject to transitional provisions.
in addition to the minimum risk-based capital ratio requirements, on a fully phased-in basis by 2019, the firm will be subject to the following buffers:
   a greater than 2.5% common equity tier 1 capital conservation buffer;
   the common equity tier 1 g-sib capital surcharge, currently at 3%; and
the phase-in amount for each of the buffers was 50% of the fully phased-in buffer requirement in 2017, and increases to 75% in 2018. failure to maintain the buffers will result in restrictions on the firms ability to make capital distributions, including the payment of dividends and the repurchase of stock, and to pay discretionary bonuses to executive officers.
risk-weighted assets rwas reflect both the firms on- and off-balance sheet risk, as well as capital charges attributable to the risk of loss arising from the following:
   credit risk: the failure of a borrower, counterparty or issuer to meet its financial obligations to the firm;
   market risk: adverse changes in the level of one or more market prices, rates, indices, volatilities, correlations or other market factors, such as market liquidity; and
   operational risk: inadequate or failed processes or systems, from human factors or from external events
(e.g., fraud, theft, legal and compliance risks, cyber attacks or damage to physical assets).
the firms risk-based capital ratios for purposes of determining regulatory compliance are the lower of the capital ratios computed under (i) the standardized approaches for calculating credit risk and market risk rwas (standardized approach) and (ii) the applicable advanced approaches for calculating credit risk, market risk and operational risk rwas (advanced approach).
the firms regulatory capital and capital ratios at december 31, 2017, the firms ratios are based on the standardized approach transitional rules. at december 31, 2016, the firms ratios were based on the advanced approach transitional rules.

1.   percentages represent minimum regulatory capital ratios under the transitional rules.
2.                                        adjusted average assets represent the denominator of the tier 1 leverage ratio and are composed of the average daily balance of consolidated on-balance sheet assets under u.s. gaap during the quarter ended december 31, 2017 and december 31, 2016, respectively, adjusted for disallowed goodwill, transitional intangible assets, certain deferred tax assets, certain investments in the capital instruments of unconsolidated financial institutions and other adjustments.
u.s. bank subsidiaries regulatory capital and capital ratios the firms u.s. bank subsidiaries are subject to similar regulatory capital requirements as the firm. failure to meet minimum capital requirements can initiate certain mandatory and discretionary actions by regulators that, if undertaken, could have a direct material effect on the u.s. bank subsidiaries and the firms financial statements. under capital adequacy guidelines and the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action, each of the u.s. bank subsidiaries must meet specific capital guidelines that involve quantitative measures of its assets, liabilities and certain off-balance sheet items as calculated under regulatory accounting practices.
notes to consolidated financial statements each u.s. depository institution subsidiary of the firm must be well-capitalized in order for the firm to continue to qualify as an fhc and to continue to engage in the broadest range of financial activities permitted for financial holding companies. under regulatory capital requirements adopted by the u.s. federal banking agencies, u.s. depository institutions must maintain certain minimum capital ratios in order to be considered well-capitalized. at december 31, 2017 and december 31, 2016, the firms u.s. bank subsidiaries maintained capital at levels sufficiently in excess of the universally mandated well-capitalized requirements to address any additional capital needs and requirements identified by the u.s. federal banking regulators.

the firm generally amortizes into net periodic benefit expense (income) the unrecognized net gains and losses exceeding 10% of the greater of the projected benefit obligation or the market-related value of plan assets. the u.s. qualified plan and the serep amortize the unrecognized net gains and losses over the average life expectancy of participants. the remaining plans generally amortize the unrecognized net gains and losses and prior service credit over the average remaining service period of active participants.

the accounting for pension and postretirement plans involves certain assumptions and estimates. the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets is an assumption that generally is expected to remain the same from one year to the next unless there is a significant change in the target asset allocation, the fees and expenses paid by the plan or market conditions. the expected long-term rate of return for the u.s. qualified plan was estimated by computing a weighted average of the underlying long-term expected returns based on the investment managers target allocations. the u.s. qualified plan is primarily invested in fixed income securities and related derivative instruments, including interest rate swap contracts. this asset allocation is expected to help protect the plans funded status and limit volatility of the firms contributions. total u.s. qualified plan investment portfolio performance is assessed by comparing actual investment performance with changes in the estimated present value of the u.s. qualified plans benefit obligation.

plan assets the u.s. qualified plans assets represent 87% of the firms total pension plan assets. the u.s. qualified plan uses a combination of active and risk-controlled fixed income investment strategies. the fixed income asset allocation consists primarily of fixed income securities and related derivative instruments designed to approximate the expected cash flows of the plans liabilities in order to help reduce plan exposure to interest rate variation and to better align assets with the obligation. the longer-duration fixed income allocation is expected to help protect the plans funded status and maintain the stability of plan contributions over the long run.
derivative instruments are permitted in the u.s. qualified plans investment portfolio only to the extent that they comply with all of the plans investment policy guidelines and are consistent with the plans risk and return objectives. in addition, any investment in derivatives must meet the following conditions:
         may be used only if derivative instruments are deemed by the investment manager to be more attractive than a similar direct investment in the underlying cash market or if the vehicle is being used to manage risk of the portfolio.
   may not be used in a speculative manner or to leverage the portfolio under any circumstances.
   may not be used as short-term trading vehicles. the investment philosophy of the u.s. qualified plan is that investment activity is undertaken for long-term investment rather than short-term trading.
                                      may be used in the management of the u.s. qualified plans portfolio only when the derivative instruments possible effects can be quantified, shown to enhance the risk-return profile of the portfolio, and reported in a meaningful and understandable manner.
as a fundamental operating principle, any restrictions on the underlying assets apply to a respective derivative product. this includes percentage allocations and credit quality. derivatives are used solely for the purpose of enhancing investment in the underlying assets and not to circumvent portfolio restrictions.
plan assets are measured at fair value using valuation techniques that are consistent with the valuation techniques applied to the firms major categories of assets and liabilities as described in notes 2 and 3. otc derivative contracts consist of investments in interest rate swaps.
other investments consist of pledged insurance annuity contracts held by non-u.s.-based plans. the pledged insurance annuity contracts are valued based on the premium reserve of the insurer for a guarantee that the insurer has given to the employee benefit plan that approximates fair value. the pledged insurance annuity contracts are categorized in level 3 of the fair value hierarchy.
commingled trust funds are privately offered funds that are regulated, supervised and subject to periodic examination by a u.s. federal or state agency and available to institutional clients. the trust must be maintained for the collective investment or reinvestment of assets contributed to it from u.s. tax-qualified employee benefit plans maintained by more than one employer or controlled group of corporations. the sponsor of the commingled trust funds values the funds based on the fair value of the underlying securities. the underlying securities of the commingled trust funds held by the u.s. qualified plan consist mainly of long-duration fixed income instruments. commingled trust funds are redeemable at nav at the measurement date or in the near future.
some non-u.s.-based plans hold foreign funds that consist of investments in fixed income funds, target cash flow funds and liquidity funds. fixed income funds invest in individual securities quoted on a recognized stock exchange or traded in a regulated market. certain fixed income funds aim to produce returns consistent with certain financial times stock exchange indexes. target cash flow funds are designed to provide a series of fixed annual cash flows achieved by investing in government bonds and derivatives. liquidity funds place a high priority on capital preservation, stable value and a high liquidity of assets. foreign funds are readily redeemable at nav.
the firm generally considers the nav of commingled trust funds and foreign funds provided by the fund manager to be the best estimate of fair value.

notes to consolidated financial statements the firms effective tax rate from continuing operations for 2017 included an intermittent net discrete tax provision of $968 million, which included approximately $1.2 billion primarily related to the remeasurement of certain net deferred tax assets as a result of the tax act, partially offset by $233 million of net discrete tax benefits primarily associated with the remeasurement of reserves and related interest due to new information regarding the status of multi-year irs tax examinations.
the tax act, enacted on december 22, 2017, significantly revised u.s. corporate income tax law by, among other things, reducing the corporate income tax rate to 21%, and implementing a modified territorial tax system that includes a one-time transition tax on deemed repatriated earnings of foreign subsidiaries; imposes a minimum tax on gilti and an alternative base erosion and anti-abuse tax (beat) on u.s. corporations that make deductible payments to non-u.s. related persons in excess of specified amounts; and broadens the tax base by partially or wholly eliminating tax deductions for certain historically deductible expenses (e.g., fdic premiums and executive compensation).
the firms effective tax rate from continuing operations for 2016 included intermittent net discrete tax benefits of $68 million. these net discrete tax benefits were primarily related to the remeasurement of reserves and related interest due to new information regarding the status of multi-year irs tax examinations, partially offset by adjustments for other tax matters.
the firms effective tax rate from continuing operations for 2015 included intermittent net discrete tax benefits of $564 million. these net discrete tax benefits were primarily associated with the repatriation of non-u.s. earnings at a cost lower than originally estimated due to an internal restructuring to simplify the firms legal entity organization in the u.k.
deferred tax assets and liabilities deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when such differences are expected to reverse.

the firm had tax credit carryforwards for which a related deferred tax asset of $114 million and $465 million was recorded at december 31, 2017 and december 31, 2016, respectively. these carryforwards are subject to annual limitations on utilization, with the earliest expiration beginning in 2037, if not utilized.
the firm believes the recognized net deferred tax assets (after valuation allowance) at december 31, 2017 are more likely than not to be realized based on expectations as to future taxable income in the jurisdictions in which it operates.
the earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries are indefinitely reinvested due to regulatory and other capital requirements in foreign jurisdictions. as a result of the tax acts one-time transition tax on the earnings of foreign subsidiaries, as of december 31, 2017 the firm expects the unrecognized deferred tax liability attributable to indefinitely reinvested earnings to be immaterial.

interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits are classified as provision for income taxes. penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits for the years mentioned above were immaterial.
tax authority examinations the firm is under continuous examination by the irs and other tax authorities in certain countries, such as japan and the u.k., and in states in which it has significant business operations, such as new york. the firm has established a liability for unrecognized tax benefits, and associated interest, if applicable (tax liabilities), that it believes is adequate in relation to the potential for additional assessments. once established, the firm adjusts such tax liabilities only when new information is available or when an event occurs necessitating a change.
the firm is currently at various levels of field examination with respect to audits by the irs, as well as new york state and new york city, for tax years 2009-2012 and 2007-2014, respectively. during the fourth quarter of 2017, the firm agreed to proposed adjustments associated with the expected closure of the field audits for tax years 2006-2008.
the firm believes that the resolution of the above tax matters will not have a material effect on the annual financial statements, although a resolution could have a material impact in the income statements and effective tax rate for any period in which such resolution occurs.
additionally, during the fourth quarter of 2017, the firm received new information relating to the expected closure of the irs field audits for tax years 2009-2012 resulting in a remeasurement and an overall net decrease in the firms recorded tax liabilities.
also, during the fourth quarter of 2017, the firm reached agreement with the irs on resolution of claims filed with the irs to contest certain items associated with tax years 1999-2005, which did not have a material impact on the annual statements or effective tax rate. furthermore, during the fourth quarter of 2017, the firm reached a conclusion with the u.k. tax authorities on certain issues through tax year 2010, the resolution of which did not have a material impact on the annual financial statements or effective tax rate.
see note 12 regarding the dutch tax authoritys challenge, in the district court in amsterdam (matters styled case number 15/3637 and case number 15/4353), of the firms entitlement to certain withholding tax credits which may impact the balance of unrecognized tax benefits.
it is reasonably possible that significant changes in the balance of unrecognized tax benefits occur within the next 12 months. at this time, however, it is not possible to reasonably estimate the expected change to the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits and the impact on the firms effective tax rate over the next 12 months.

21. segment and geographic information segment information the firm structures its segments primarily based upon the nature of the financial products and services provided to customers and its management organization. the firm provides a wide range of financial products and services to its customers in each of the business segments: institutional securities, wealth management and investment management. for a further discussion of the business segments, see note 1.
revenues and expenses directly associated with each respective business segment are included in determining its operating results. other revenues and expenses that are not directly attributable to a particular business segment are allocated based upon the firms allocation methodologies, generally based on each business segments respective net revenues, non-interest expenses or other relevant measures.
as a result of revenues and expenses from transactions with other operating segments being treated as transactions with external parties, the firm includes an intersegment eliminations category to reconcile the business segment results to the consolidated results.

(collectively, the fixed income integration). prior periods have not been recast for this new intersegment agreement due to immateriality.
the firm waives a portion of its fees in the investment management business segment from certain registered money market funds that comply with the requirements of rule 2a-7 of the investment company act of 1940.
reduction of fees due to fee waivers
for certain management fee arrangements in the investment management business segment, the firm is entitled to receive performance-based fees (also referred to as incentive fees and includes carried interest) when the return on assets under management exceeds certain benchmark returns or other performance targets. in such arrangements, performance fee revenues are accrued (or reversed) quarterly based on measuring account/fund performance to date versus the performance benchmark stated in the investment management agreement. the firms portion of net unrealized cumulative performance-based fees (for which the firm is not obligated to pay compensation) are at risk of reversing if the fund performance falls below the stated investment management agreement benchmarks. see note 12 for information regarding general partner guarantees, which include potential obligations to return performance fee distributions previously received.

guarantees in the normal course of its business, the parent company guarantees certain of its subsidiaries obligations under derivative and other financial arrangements. the parent company records trading assets and trading liabilities, which include derivative contracts, at fair value in its condensed balance sheets.
the parent company also, in the normal course of its business, provides standard indemnities to counterparties on behalf of its subsidiaries for taxes, including u.s. and foreign withholding taxes, on interest and other payments made on derivatives, securities and stock lending transactions, and certain annuity products. these indemnity payments could be required based on a change in the tax laws or change in interpretation of applicable tax rulings. certain contracts contain provisions that enable the parent company to terminate the agreement upon the occurrence of such events. the maximum potential amount of future payments that the parent company could be required to make under these indemnifications cannot be estimated. the parent company has not recorded any contingent liability in its condensed financial statements for these indemnifications and believes that the occurrence of any events that would trigger payments under these contracts is remote.
the parent company has issued guarantees on behalf of its subsidiaries to various u.s. and non-u.s. exchanges and clearinghouses that trade and clear securities and/or futures contracts. under these guarantee arrangements, the parent company may be required to pay the financial obligations of its subsidiaries related to business transacted on or with the exchanges and clearinghouses in the event of a subsidiarys default on its obligations to the exchange or the clearinghouse. the parent company has not recorded any contingent liability in its condensed financial statements for these arrangements and believes that any potential requirements to make payments under these arrangements are remote.

controls and procedures conclusion regarding the effectiveness of disclosure controls and procedures under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our chief executive officer and our chief financial officer, we conducted an evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures, as such term is defined under exchange act rule 13a-15(e). based on this evaluation, our chief executive officer and our chief financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of the end of the period covered by this annual report.
managements report on internal control over financial reporting our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. the firms internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america (u.s. gaap).
our internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that:
   pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the firm;
                                      provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with u.s. gaap, and that our receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of the firms management and directors; and
   provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on our financial statements.
because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
management assessed the effectiveness of the firms internal control over financial reporting as of december 31, 2017. in making this assessment, management used the criteria set forth by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission (coso) in internal controlintegrated framework (2013). based on managements assessment and those criteria, management believes that the firm maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of december 31, 2017.
the firms independent registered public accounting firm has audited and issued a report on the firms internal control over financial reporting, which appears below.
report of independent registered public accounting firm to the shareholders and board of directors of morgan stanley:
opinion on internal control over financial reporting we have audited the internal control over financial reporting of morgan stanley and subsidiaries (the firm) as of december 31, 2017, based on criteria established in internal control  integrated framework (2013) issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission (coso). in our opinion, the firm maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of december 31, 2017, based on criteria established in internal control  integrated framework (2013) issued by coso.
we have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board (united states) (pcaob), the consolidated financial statements of the firm as of and for the year ended december 31, 2017 and our report dated february 27, 2018 expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements.
basis for opinion the firms management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying managements report on internal control over financial reporting. our responsibility is to express an opinion on the firms internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. we are a public accounting firm registered with the pcaob and are required to be independent with respect to the firm in accordance with the u.s. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the securities and exchange commission and the pcaob.
we conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the pcaob. those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. we believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
definition and limitations of internal control over financial reporting a companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. a companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
183     december 2017 form 10-k changes in internal control over financial reporting no change in the firms internal control over financial reporting (as such term is defined in exchange act rule 13a-15(f)) occurred during the quarter ended december 31, 2017 that materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the firms internal control over financial reporting.
other information on february 26, 2018 the compensation, management development and succession committee of the board of directors (cmds committee) of morgan stanley approved amendments to each of the 2015, 2016 and 2017 long-term incentive program award certificates (award certificates) covering awards of performance stock units granted under the morgan stanley equity incentive compensation plan to named executive officers of the firm. under the terms of the award certificates, participants are entitled to an award that will vest and convert to shares of the firms common stock based on achievement of predetermined performance goals with respect to return on equity (ms roe, as defined in the award certificates) and total stockholder return (relative tsr, as defined in the award certificates), in each case over a three-year performance period. the cmds committee amended each award certificate to include a new section entitled equitable adjustments which provides that, if the committee determines, in its sole discretion, that any of the performance measures, as set forth in the award certificate, are no longer appropriate, including due to any unusual or non-recurring event affecting the particular performance measure or any change in applicable tax, legal or regulatory requirements or accounting methods, practices or polices, the cmds committee will equitably adjust the calculation of such performance measures to maintain the intended economics and to carry out the intent of the original terms of applicable award.
on february 26, 2018 the cmds committee further determined to use its authority under the equitable adjustment provision of the amended award certificates, to make equitable adjustments to the calculation of ms roe for the firms 2017 fiscal year with respect to awards granted under each award certificate to account for the impact of the enactment of tax reform under the tax cuts and jobs act. as a result, the firms named executive officers will receive a payout of performance stock units under the 2015 long-term incentive program award certificates based on a performance multiplier of approximately 1.03.
this description of the award certificates is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the award certificates, a form of which is filed hereto as exhibit 10.35.

legal and compliance risk legal and compliance risk includes the risk of legal or regulatory sanctions, material financial loss, including fines, penalties, judgments, damages and/or settlements, or loss to reputation that we may suffer as a result of failure to comply with laws, regulations, rules, related self-regulatory organization standards and codes of conduct applicable to our business activities. this risk also includes contractual and commercial risk, such as the risk that a counterpartys performance obligations will be unenforceable. it also includes compliance with aml and terrorist financing rules and regulations. we are generally subject to extensive regulation in the different jurisdictions in which we conduct our business (see also businesssupervision and regulation and risk factors).
we have established procedures based on legal and regulatory requirements on a worldwide basis that are designed to facilitate compliance with applicable statutory and regulatory requirements and to require that our policies relating to business conduct, ethics and practices are followed globally. in addition, we have established procedures to mitigate the risk that a counterpartys performance obligations will be unenforceable, including consideration of counterparty legal authority and capacity, adequacy of legal documentation, the permissibility of a transaction under applicable law and whether applicable bankruptcy or insolvency laws limit or alter contractual remedies. the heightened legal and regulatory focus on the financial services and banking industries globally presents a continuing business challenge for us.
financial statements and supplementary data report of independent registered public accounting firm to the shareholders and board of directors of morgan stanley:
opinion on the financial statements we have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of morgan stanley and subsidiaries (the firm) as of december 31, 2017 and 2016, the related consolidated income statements, comprehensive income statements, cash flow statements and statements of changes in total equity for the years ended december 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the financial statements). in our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the firm as of december 31, 2017 and 2016, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the years ended december 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america.
we have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board (united states) (pcaob), the firms internal control over financial reporting as of december 31, 2017, based on criteria established in internal controlintegrated framework (2013) issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission and our report dated february 27, 2018, expressed an unqualified opinion on the firms internal control over financial reporting.
basis for opinion these financial statements are the responsibility of the firms management. our responsibility is to express an opinion on the firms financial statements based on our audits. we are a public accounting firm registered with the pcaob and are required to be independent with respect to the firm in accordance with the u.s. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the securities and exchange commission and the pcaob.
we conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the pcaob. those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. we believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
we have served as the firms auditor since 1997.

1. introduction and basis of presentation the firm morgan stanley, an fhc, is a global financial services firm that maintains significant market positions in each of its business segmentsinstitutional securities, wealth management and investment management. morgan stanley, through its subsidiaries and affiliates, provides a wide variety of products and services to a large and diversified group of clients and customers, including corporations, governments, financial institutions and individuals. unless the context otherwise requires, the terms morgan stanley or the firm mean morgan stanley (the parent company) together with its consolidated subsidiaries. see the glossary of common acronyms for definitions of certain acronyms used throughout the 2017 form 10-k.
a description of the clients and principal products and services of each of the firms business segments is as follows:
institutional securities provides investment banking, sales and trading, lending and other services to corporations, governments, financial institutions, and high to ultra-high net worth clients. investment banking services consist of capital raising and financial advisory services, including services relating to the underwriting of debt, equity and other securities, as well as advice on mergers and acquisitions, restructurings, real estate and project finance. sales and trading services include sales, financing and market-making activities in equity and fixed income products, including foreign exchange and commodities, as well as prime brokerage services. lending services include originating and/or purchasing corporate loans, commercial and residential mortgage lending, asset-backed lending, financing extended to equities and commodities customers, and loans to municipalities. other activities include investments and research.
wealth management provides a comprehensive array of financial services and solutions to individual investors and small to medium-sized businesses and institutions covering brokerage and investment advisory services, financial and wealth planning services, annuity and insurance products, credit and other lending products, banking and retirement plan services.
investment management provides a broad range of investment strategies and products that span geographies, asset classes, and public and private markets to a diverse group of clients across institutional and intermediary channels. strategies and products include equity, fixed income, liquidity and alternative/other products. institutional clients include defined benefit/defined contribution plans, founda-
tions, endowments, government entities, sovereign wealth funds, insurance companies, third-party fund sponsors and corporations. individual clients are serviced through intermediaries, including affiliated and non-affiliated distributors.
basis of financial information the consolidated financial statements (financial statements) are prepared in accordance with u.s. gaap, which require the firm to make estimates and assumptions regarding the valuations of certain financial instruments, the valuation of goodwill and intangible assets, compensation, deferred tax assets, the outcome of legal and tax matters, allowance for credit losses and other matters that affect its financial statements and related disclosures. the firm believes that the estimates utilized in the preparation of its financial statements are prudent and reasonable. actual results could differ materially from these estimates. intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated. certain reclassifications have been made to prior periods to conform to the current presentation.
consolidation the financial statements include the accounts of the firm, its wholly owned subsidiaries and other entities in which the firm has a controlling financial interest, including certain vies (see note 13). for consolidated subsidiaries that are less than wholly owned, the third-party holdings of equity interests are referred to as noncontrolling interests. the net income attributable to noncontrolling interests for such subsidiaries is presented as net income applicable to noncontrolling interests in the consolidated income statements (income statements). the portion of shareholders equity that is attributable to noncontrolling interests for such subsidiaries is presented as noncontrolling interests, a component of total equity, in the consolidated balance sheets (balance sheets).
for entities where (1) the total equity investment at risk is sufficient to enable the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support and (2) the equity holders bear the economic residual risks and returns of the entity and have the power to direct the activities of the entity that most significantly affect its economic performance, the firm consolidates those entities it controls either through a majority voting interest or otherwise. for vies (i.e., entities that do not meet these criteria), the firm consolidates those entities where it has the power to make the decisions that most significantly affect the economic performance of the vie and has the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits that could potentially be significant to the vie.
97      december 2017 form 10-k notes to consolidated financial statements for investments in entities in which the firm does not have a controlling financial interest but has significant influence over operating and financial decisions, it applies the equity method of accounting with net gains and losses recorded within other revenues (see note 8) unless the firm has elected to measure the investment at fair value, in which case net gains and losses are recorded within investments revenues (see note 3).
the firms significant regulated u.s. and international subsidiaries include morgan stanley & co. llc (ms&co.), morgan stanley smith barney llc (mssb llc), morgan stanley & co. international plc (msip), morgan stanley mufg securities co., ltd. (msms), morgan stanley bank, n.a. (msbna) and morgan stanley private bank, national association (mspbna).
consolidated cash flow statements presentation for purposes of the consolidated cash flow statements (cash flow statements), cash and cash equivalents consist of cash and due from banks, interest bearing deposits with banks and restricted cash. cash and cash equivalents includes highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less that are held for investment purposes and are readily convertible to known amounts of cash.
dispositions the firm completed the sale of its global oil merchanting unit of the commodities division to castleton commodities international llc on november 1, 2015. the firm recognized an impairment charge of approximately $71 million in other revenues. the transaction did not meet the criteria for discontinued operations and did not have a material impact on the firms financial results.
2. significant accounting policies revenue recognition investment banking underwriting revenues and advisory fees from mergers, acquisitions and restructuring transactions are recorded when services for the transactions are determined to be substantially completed, generally as set forth under the terms of the engagement. transaction-related expenses, primarily consisting of legal, travel and other costs directly associated with the transaction, are deferred and recognized in the same period as the related investment banking transaction revenues. underwriting revenues are presented net of related expenses. non-reimbursed expenses associated with advisory transactions are recorded within non-interest expenses.
commissions and fees commission and fee revenues are recognized on trade date. commission and fee revenues primarily arise from agency transactions in listed and otc equity securities; services related to sales and trading activities; and sales of mutual funds, futures, insurance products and options.
asset management asset management revenues are recognized over the relevant contract period. sales commissions paid by the firm in connection with the sale of certain classes of shares of its open-end mutual fund products are accounted for as deferred commission assets. the firm periodically tests deferred commission assets for recoverability based on cash flows expected to be received in future periods.
in certain management fee arrangements, the firm is entitled to receive performance-based fees (which also may be referred to as incentive fees and which include carried interest) when the return on assets under management exceeds certain benchmark returns or other performance targets. in such arrangements, performance fee revenues are accrued (or reversed) quarterly based on measuring account or fund performance to date versus the performance benchmark stated in the investment management agreement. performance-based fees are recorded within investments or asset management revenues depending on the nature of the arrangement.
see note 21 for information regarding the unrealized cumulative amount of performance-based fee revenues. see note 12 for information regarding general partner guarantees, which include potential obligations to return performance fee distributions previously received.
notes to consolidated financial statements fair value of financial instruments instruments within trading assets and trading liabilities are measured at fair value, either in accordance with accounting guidance or through the fair value option election (discussed below). these financial instruments primarily represent the firms trading and investment positions and include both cash and derivative products. in addition, debt and equity securities classified as afs securities are measured at fair value.
interest income and interest expense are recorded within the income statements depending on the nature of the instrument and related market conventions. when interest is included as a component of the instruments fair value, interest is included within trading revenues or investments revenues. otherwise, it is included within interest income or interest expense. dividend income is recorded in trading revenues or investments revenues depending on the business activity.
the fair value of otc financial instruments, including derivative contracts related to financial instruments and commodities, is presented in the accompanying balance sheets on a net-by-counterparty basis, when appropriate. additionally, the firm nets the fair value of cash collateral paid or received against the fair value amounts recognized for net derivative positions executed with the same counterparty under the same master netting agreement.
fair value option the firm has elected to measure certain eligible instruments at fair value, including certain securities purchased under agreements to resell, loans and lending commitments, equity method investments, deposits (structured certificates of deposit), securities sold under agreements to repurchase, other secured financings and borrowings (primarily structured notes).
fair value measurementdefinition and hierarchy fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability (i.e., the exit price) in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.
fair value is a market-based measure considered from the perspective of a market participant rather than an entity-specific measure. therefore, even when market assumptions are not readily available, assumptions are set to reflect those that the firm believes market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability at the measurement date. where the firm manages a group of financial assets and financial liabilities on the basis of its net exposure to either market risks or credit risk, the firm measures the fair value of that group of financial instruments consistently with how market participants would price the net risk exposure at the measurement date.
in determining fair value, the firm uses various valuation approaches and establishes a hierarchy for inputs used in measuring fair value that maximizes the use of relevant observable inputs and minimizes the use of unobservable inputs by requiring that the most observable inputs be used when available.
observable inputs are inputs that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability that were developed based on market data obtained from sources independent of the firm. unobservable inputs are inputs that reflect assumptions the firm believes other market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability that are developed based on the best information available in the circumstances. the hierarchy is broken down into three levels based on the observability of inputs as follows, with level 1 being the highest and level 3 being the lowest level:
level 1.  valuations based on quoted prices in active markets that the firm has the ability to access for identical assets or liabilities. valuation adjustments and block discounts are not applied to level 1 instruments. since valuations are based on quoted prices that are readily and regularly available in an active market, valuation of these products does not entail a significant degree of judgment.
level 2.  valuations based on one or more quoted prices in markets that are not active or for which all significant inputs are observable, either directly or indirectly.
the availability of observable inputs can vary from product to product and is affected by a wide variety of factors, including, for example, the type of product, whether the product is new and not yet established in the marketplace, the liquidity of markets and other characteristics particular to the product. to the extent that valuation is based on models or inputs that are less observable or unobservable in the market, the determination of fair value requires more judgment. accordingly, the degree of judgment exercised by the firm in
99      december 2017 form 10-k notes to consolidated financial statements determining fair value is greatest for instruments categorized in level 3 of the fair value hierarchy.
the firm considers prices and inputs that are current as of the measurement date, including during periods of market dislocation. in periods of market dislocation, the observability of prices and inputs may be reduced for many instruments. this condition could cause an instrument to be reclassified from level 1 to level 2 or from level 2 to level 3 of the fair value hierarchy (see note 3).
in certain cases, the inputs used to measure fair value may fall into different levels of the fair value hierarchy. in such cases, for disclosure purposes, the level in the fair value hierarchy within which the fair value measurement falls in its entirety is determined based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety.
for assets and liabilities that are transferred between levels in the fair value hierarchy during the period, fair values are ascribed as if the assets or liabilities had been transferred as of the beginning of the period.
valuation techniques many cash instruments and otc derivative contracts have bid and ask prices that can be observed in the marketplace. bid prices reflect the highest price that a party is willing to pay for an asset. ask prices represent the lowest price that a party is willing to accept for an asset. the firm carries positions at the point within the bid-ask range that meets its best estimate of fair value. for offsetting positions in the same financial instrument, the same price within the bid-ask spread is used to measure both the long and short positions.
fair value for many cash instruments and otc derivative contracts is derived using pricing models. pricing models take into account the contract terms, as well as multiple inputs, including, where applicable, commodity prices, equity prices, interest rate yield curves, credit curves, correlation, creditworthiness of the counterparty, creditworthiness of the firm, option volatility and currency rates.
where appropriate, valuation adjustments are made to account for various factors such as liquidity risk (bid-ask adjustments), credit quality, model uncertainty and concentration risk. adjustments for liquidity risk adjust model-derived mid-market levels of level 2 and level 3 financial instruments for the bid-mid or mid-ask spread required to properly reflect the exit price of a risk position. bid-mid and mid-ask spreads are marked to levels observed in trade activity, broker quotes or other external third-party data. where these spreads are unobservable for the particular position in question, spreads are derived from observable levels of similar positions.
the firm applies credit-related valuation adjustments to its borrowings (primarily structured notes) for which the fair value option was elected and to otc derivatives. the firm considers the impact of changes in its own credit spreads based upon observations of the secondary bond market spreads when measuring the fair value for borrowings.
for otc derivatives, the impact of changes in both the firms and the counterpartys credit rating is considered when measuring fair value. in determining the expected exposure, the firm simulates the distribution of the future exposure to a counterparty, then applies market-based default probabilities to the future exposure, leveraging external third-party cds spread data. where cds spread data are unavailable for a specific counterparty, bond market spreads, cds spread data based on the counterpartys credit rating or cds spread data that reference a comparable counterparty may be utilized. the firm also considers collateral held and legally enforceable master netting agreements that mitigate its exposure to each counterparty.
adjustments for model uncertainty are taken for positions whose underlying models are reliant on significant inputs that are neither directly nor indirectly observable, hence requiring reliance on established theoretical concepts in their derivation. these adjustments are derived by making assessments of the possible degree of variability using statistical approaches and market-based information where possible.
the firm may apply a concentration adjustment to certain of its otc derivatives portfolios to reflect the additional cost of closing out a particularly large risk exposure. where possible, these adjustments are based on observable market information, but in many instances, significant judgment is required to estimate the costs of closing out concentrated risk exposures due to the lack of liquidity in the marketplace.
the firm applies an fva in the fair value measurements of otc uncollateralized or partially collateralized derivatives and in collateralized derivatives where the terms of the agreement do not permit the reuse of the collateral received. in general, fva reflects a market funding risk premium inherent in the noted derivative instruments. the methodology for measuring fva leverages the firms existing credit-related valuation adjustment calculation methodologies, which apply to both assets and liabilities.
see note 3 for a description of valuation techniques applied to the major categories of financial instruments measured at fair value.
notes to consolidated financial statements assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis certain of the firms assets and liabilities are measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis. the firm incurs losses or gains for any adjustments of these assets or liabilities to fair value.
for assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis, fair value is determined by using various valuation approaches. the same hierarchy for inputs as described above, which maximizes the use of observable inputs and minimizes the use of unobservable inputs by generally requiring that the observable inputs be used when available, is used in measuring fair value for these items.
valuation process the valuation review group (vrg) within the firms financial control group (fcg) is responsible for the firms fair value valuation policies, processes and procedures. vrg is independent of the business units and reports to the chief financial officer, who has final authority over the valuation of the firms financial instruments. vrg implements valuation control processes designed to validate the fair value of the firms financial instruments measured at fair value, including those derived from pricing models.
model review.    vrg, in conjunction with the model risk management department (mrm), which reports to the chief risk officer, independently reviews valuation models theoretical soundness, the appropriateness of the valuation methodology and calibration techniques developed by the business units using observable inputs. where inputs are not observable, vrg reviews the appropriateness of the proposed valuation methodology to determine that it is consistent with how a market participant would arrive at the unobservable input. the valuation methodologies utilized in the absence of observable inputs may include extrapolation techniques and the use of comparable observable inputs. as part of the review, vrg develops a methodology to independently verify the fair value generated by the business units valuation models. the firm generally subjects valuations and models to a review process initially and on a periodic basis thereafter.
independent price verification.    the business units are responsible for determining the fair value of financial instruments using approved valuation models and valuation methodologies. generally on a monthly basis, vrg independently validates the fair values of financial instruments determined using valuation models by determining the appropriateness of the inputs used by the business units and by testing compliance with the documented valuation methodologies approved in the model review process described above.
the results of this independent price verification and any adjustments made by vrg to the fair value generated by the business units are presented to management of the firms three business segments (i.e., institutional securities, wealth management and investment management), the chief financial officer and the chief risk officer on a regular basis.
vrg uses recently executed transactions, other observable market data such as exchange data, broker-dealer quotes, third-party pricing vendors and aggregation services for validating the fair value of financial instruments generated using valuation models. vrg assesses the external sources and their valuation methodologies to determine if the external providers meet the minimum standards expected of a third-party pricing source. pricing data provided by approved external sources are evaluated using a number of approaches; for example, by corroborating the external sources prices to executed trades, by analyzing the methodology and assumptions used by the external source to generate a price, and/or by evaluating how active the third-party pricing source (or originating sources used by the third-party pricing source) is in the market. based on this analysis, vrg generates a ranking of the observable market data designed to ensure that the highest-ranked market data source is used to validate the business units fair value of financial instruments.
vrg reviews the models and valuation methodology used to price new material level 2 and level 3 transactions, and both fcg and mrm must approve the fair value of the trade that is initially recognized.
level 3 transactions. vrg reviews the business units valuation techniques to assess whether these are consistent with market participant assumptions.
for further information on financial assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring and non-recurring basis, see note 3.
offsetting of derivative instruments in connection with its derivative activities, the firm generally enters into master netting agreements and collateral agreements with its counterparties. these agreements provide the firm with the right, in the event of a default by the counterparty, to net a counterpartys rights and obligations under the agreement and to liquidate and set off collateral against any net amount owed by the counterparty.
however, in certain circumstances, the firm may not have such an agreement in place; the relevant insolvency regime may not support the enforceability of the master netting agreement or collateral agreement; or the firm may not have sought legal advice to support the enforceability of the agree-
101     december 2017 form 10-k notes to consolidated financial statements ment. in cases where the firm has not determined an agreement to be enforceable, the related amounts are not offset (see note 4).
the firms policy is generally to receive securities and cash posted as collateral (with rights of rehypothecation), irrespective of the enforceability determination regarding the master netting and collateral agreement. in certain cases, the firm may agree for such collateral to be posted to a third-party custodian under a control agreement that enables it to take control of such collateral in the event of a counterparty default. the enforceability of the master netting agreement is taken into account in the firms risk management practices and application of counterparty credit limits.
for information related to offsetting of derivatives and certain collateralized transactions, see notes 4 and 6, respectively.
hedge accounting the firm applies hedge accounting using various derivative financial instruments for the following types of hedges: hedges of changes in the fair value of assets and liabilities due to the risk being hedged (fair value hedges); and hedges of net investments in foreign operations whose functional currency is different from the reporting currency of the parent company (net investment hedges). these financial instruments are included within trading assetsderivative and other contracts or trading liabilitiesderivative and other contracts in the balance sheets. for hedges where hedge accounting is being applied, the firm performs effectiveness testing and other procedures.
fair value hedgesinterest rate risk the firms designated fair value hedges consist primarily of interest rate swaps designated as fair value hedges of changes in the benchmark interest rate of certain fixed rate senior borrowings. the firm uses regression analysis to perform an ongoing prospective and retrospective assessment of the effectiveness of these hedging relationships. a hedging relationship is deemed effective if the change in fair value of the hedging instrument (derivative) and the change in fair value of the hedged item (debt liability) due to changes in the benchmark interest rate offset within a range of 80% to 125%. the firm considers the impact of valuation adjustments related to its own credit spreads and counterparty credit spreads to determine whether they would cause the hedging relationship to be ineffective.
for qualifying fair value hedges of benchmark interest rates, the changes in the fair value of the derivative and the changes in the fair value of the hedged liability provide an offset of one another and, together with any resulting ineffectiveness, are recorded in interest expense. when a derivative is de-designated as a hedge, any basis adjustment remaining on the hedged liability is amortized to interest expense over the remaining life of the liability using the effective interest method.
net investment hedges the firm uses forward foreign exchange contracts to manage a portion of the currency exposure relating to its net investments in non-u.s. dollar functional currency operations. to the extent that the notional amounts of the hedging instruments equal the portion of the investments being hedged and the underlying exchange rate of the derivative hedging instrument relates to the exchange rate between the functional currency of the investee and the parent companys functional currency, no hedge ineffectiveness is recognized in earnings. if these exchange rates are not the same, the firm uses regression analysis to assess the prospective and retrospective effectiveness of the hedge relationships, and any ineffectiveness is recognized in interest income. the gain or loss from revaluing hedges of net investments in foreign operations at the spot rate is reported within aoci. the forward points on the hedging instruments are excluded from hedge effectiveness testing and are recorded in interest income.
for further information on derivative instruments and hedging activities, see note 4.
investment securitiesavailable-for-sale and held-to-maturity afs securities are reported at fair value in the balance sheets with unrealized gains and losses reported in aoci, net of tax. interest and dividend income, including amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts, is included in interest income in the income statements. realized gains and losses on afs securities are reported in the income statements (see note 5). the firm utilizes the first-in, first-out method as the basis for determining the cost of afs securities.
htm securities are reported at amortized cost in the balance sheets. interest income, including amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts on htm securities, is included in interest income in the income statements.
other-than-temporary impairment afs debt securities and htm securities with a current fair value less than their amortized cost are analyzed as part of the firms periodic assessment of temporary versus otti at the individual security level. a temporary impairment is recognized in aoci. otti is recognized in the income statements with the exception of the non-credit portion related to a debt security that the firm does not intend to sell and is not likely to be required to sell, which is recognized in aoci.
notes to consolidated financial statements for afs debt securities that the firm either has the intent to sell or that the firm is likely to be required to sell before recovery of its amortized cost basis, the impairment is considered otti.
for those afs debt securities that the firm does not have the intent to sell or is not likely to be required to sell, and for all htm securities, the firm evaluates whether it expects to recover the entire amortized cost basis of the debt security. if the firm does not expect to recover the entire amortized cost of those afs debt securities or htm securities, the impairment is considered otti, and the firm determines what portion of the impairment relates to a credit loss and what portion relates to non-credit factors.
a credit loss exists if the present value of cash flows expected to be collected (discounted at the implicit interest rate at acquisition of the security or discounted at the effective yield for securities that incorporate changes in prepayment assumptions) is less than the amortized cost basis of the security. changes in prepayment assumptions alone are not considered to result in a credit loss.
when determining if a credit loss exists, the firm considers relevant information, including:
   the length of time and the extent to which the fair value has been less than the amortized cost basis;
   adverse conditions specifically related to the security, its industry or geographic area;
                                                       changes in the financial condition of the issuer of the security, the presence of explicit or implicit guarantees of repayment by the u.s. government for u.s. government and agency securities or, in the case of an asset-backed debt security, changes in the financial condition of the underlying loan obligors;
   the historical and implied volatility of the fair value of the security;
   the payment structure of the debt security and the likelihood of the issuer being able to make payments that increase in the future;
   failure of the issuer of the security to make scheduled interest or principal payments;
   the current rating and any changes to the rating of the security by a rating agency;
when estimating the present value of expected cash flows, information includes the remaining payment terms of the security, prepayment speeds, financial condition of the issuer(s), expected defaults and the value of any underlying collateral.
for afs equity securities, the firm considers various factors, including the intent and ability to hold the equity security for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in market value in evaluating whether an otti exists. if the equity security is considered other-than-temporarily impaired, the entire otti (i.e., the difference between the fair value recorded in the balance sheet and the cost basis) will be recognized in the income statements.
loans the firm accounts for loans based on the following categories: loans held for investment; loans held for sale; and loans at fair value.
loans held for investment loans held for investment are reported at outstanding principal adjusted for any charge-offs, the allowance for loan losses, any unamortized deferred fees or costs for originated loans, and any unamortized premiums or discounts for purchased loans.
interest income.    interest income on performing loans held for investment is accrued and recognized as interest income at the contractual rate of interest. purchase price discounts or premiums, as well as net deferred loan fees or costs, are amortized into interest income over the life of the loan to produce a level rate of return.
allowance for loan losses.    the allowance for loan losses estimates probable losses related to loans specifically identified for impairment in addition to the probable losses inherent in the held for investment loan portfolio.
the firm utilizes the u.s. banking agencies definition of criticized exposures, which consist of the special mention, substandard, doubtful and loss categories as credit quality indicators. for further information on the credit quality indicators, see note 7. substandard loans are regularly reviewed for impairment. factors considered by management when determining impairment include payment status, fair value of collateral, and probability of collecting scheduled principal and interest payments when due. the impairment analysis required depends on the nature and type of loans. loans classified as doubtful or loss are considered impaired.
there are two components of the allowance for loan losses: the specific allowance component and the inherent allowance component.
the specific allowance component of the allowance for loan losses is used to estimate probable losses for non-homogeneous exposures that have been specifically identified for impairment analysis by the firm and determined to be impaired. when a loan is specifically identified for impairment, the impairment is measured based on the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loans effective interest rate or as a practical expedient, the observable
103     december 2017 form 10-k notes to consolidated financial statements market price of the loan or the fair value of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent. if the present value of the expected future cash flows (or alternatively, the observable market price of the loan or the fair value of the collateral) is less than the recorded investment in the loan, then the firm recognizes an allowance and a charge to the provision for loan losses within other revenues.
the inherent allowance component of the allowance for loan losses is used to estimate the probable losses inherent in the loan portfolio and includes non-homogeneous loans that have not been identified as impaired and portfolios of smaller balance homogeneous loans. the firm maintains methodologies by loan product for calculating an allowance for loan losses that estimates the inherent losses in the loan portfolio. generally, inherent losses in the portfolio for non-impaired loans are estimated using statistical analysis and judgment around the exposure at default, the probability of default and the loss given default. qualitative and environmental factors such as economic and business conditions, nature and volume of the portfolio, and lending terms and volume and severity of past due loans may also be considered in the calculations. the allowance for loan losses is maintained at a level to ensure that it is reasonably likely to adequately absorb the estimated probable losses inherent in the portfolio. when the firm recognizes an allowance, there is also a charge to the provision for loan losses within other revenues.
troubled debt restructurings.    the firm may modify the terms of certain loans for economic or legal reasons related to a borrowers financial difficulties by granting one or more concessions that the firm would not otherwise consider. such modifications are accounted for and reported as a tdr. a loan that has been modified in a tdr is generally considered to be impaired and is evaluated for the extent of impairment using the firms specific allowance methodology. tdrs are also generally classified as nonaccrual and may only be returned to accrual status after considering the borrowers sustained repayment performance for a reasonable period.
nonaccrual loans.    the firm places loans on nonaccrual status if principal or interest is past due for a period of 90 days or more or payment of principal or interest is in doubt unless the obligation is well-secured and in the process of collection. a loan is considered past due when a payment due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement has not been remitted by the borrower. substandard loans, if identified as impaired, are categorized as nonaccrual. loans classified as doubtful or loss are categorized as nonaccrual.
payments received on nonaccrual loans held for investment are applied to principal if there is doubt regarding the ultimate collectibility of principal (i.e., cost recovery method). if collection of the principal of nonaccrual loans held for investment is not in doubt, interest income is realized on a cash basis. if neither principal nor interest collection is in doubt, loans are on accrual status, and interest income is recognized using the effective interest method. loans that are on nonaccrual status may not be restored to accrual status until all delinquent principal and/or interest has been brought current after a reasonable period of performance, typically a minimum of six months.
charge-offs.    the firm charges off a loan in the period that it is deemed uncollectible and records a reduction in the allowance for loan losses and the balance of the loan. in general, any portion of the recorded investment in a collateral dependent loan (including any capitalized accrued interest, net deferred loan fees or costs, and unamortized premium or discount) in excess of the fair value of the collateral that can be identified as uncollectible, and is therefore deemed a confirmed loss, is charged off against the allowance for loan losses. a loan is collateral dependent if the repayment of the loan is expected to be provided solely by the sale or operation of the underlying collateral. in addition, for loan transfers from loans held for investment to loans held for sale, at the time of transfer, any reduction in the loan value is reflected as a charge-off of the recorded investment, resulting in a new cost basis.
lending commitments.    the firm records the liability and related expense for the credit exposure related to commitments to fund loans that will be held for investment in a manner similar to outstanding loans discussed above. the analysis also incorporates a credit conversion factor, which is the expected utilization of the undrawn commitment. the liability is recorded in other liabilities and accrued expenses in the balance sheets, and the expense is recorded in other non-interest expenses in the income statements. for more information regarding loan commitments, standby letters of credit and financial guarantees, see note 12.
loans held for sale loans held for sale are measured at the lower of cost or fair value, with valuation changes recorded in other revenues. the firm determines the valuation allowance on an individual loan basis, except for residential mortgage loans for which the valuation allowance is determined at the loan product level. any decreases in fair value below the initial carrying amount and any recoveries in fair value up to the initial carrying amount are recorded in other revenues. however, increases in fair value above initial carrying value are not recognized.
notes to consolidated financial statements are an adjustment to the basis of the loan and, therefore, are included in the periodic determination of the lower of cost or fair value adjustments and/or the gain or loss recognized at the time of sale.
lending commitments. commitments to fund mortgage loans held for sale are derivatives and are reported in trading assets or trading liabilities in the balance sheets with an offset to trading revenues in the income statements.
commitments to fund non-mortgage loans held for sale are not derivatives. the firm records the liability and related expense for the fair value exposure below cost of such commitments in other liabilities and accrued expenses in the balance sheets with an offset to other revenues in the income statements.
loans and lending commitments held for sale are subject to the nonaccrual policies described above in the loans held for investmentnonaccrual loans section. because loans and lending commitments held for sale are recognized at the lower of cost or fair value, the allowance for loan losses and charge-off policies does not apply to these loans.
loans at fair value loans for which the fair value option is elected are carried at fair value, with changes in fair value recognized in earnings. loans carried at fair value are not evaluated for purposes of recording an allowance for loan losses. for further information on loans carried at fair value and classified as trading assets and trading liabilities, see note 3.
lending commitments. the firm records the liability and related expense for the fair value exposure related to commitments to fund loans that will be measured at fair value. the liability is recorded in trading liabilities in the balance sheets, and the expense is recorded in trading revenues in the income statements.
loans and lending commitments at fair value are subject to the nonaccrual policies described above in the loans held for investmentnonaccrual loans section. because such loans and lending commitments are reported at fair value, the allowance for loan losses and charge-off policies do not apply to these loans.
for further information on loans, see note 7.
transfers of financial assets transfers of financial assets are accounted for as sales when the firm has relinquished control over the transferred assets. any related gain or loss on sale is recorded in net revenues. transfers that are not accounted for as sales are treated as a collateralized financing, in certain cases referred to as failed sales. securities borrowed or purchased under agreements to resell and securities loaned or sold under agreements to repurchase are treated as collateralized financings (see note 6). securities purchased under agreements to resell (reverse repurchase agreements) and securities sold under agreements to repurchase (repurchase agreements) are carried in the balance sheets at the amounts of cash paid or received, plus accrued interest, except for certain repurchase agreements for which the firm has elected the fair value option (see note 3). where appropriate, repurchase agreements and reverse repurchase agreements with the same counterparty are reported on a net basis. securities borrowed and securities loaned are recorded at the amount of cash collateral advanced or received. in instances where the firm is the lender in securities-for-securities transactions and is permitted to sell or repledge these securities, the fair value of the collateral received is reported in trading assets and the related obligation to return the collateral is reported in trading liabilities in the balance sheets. securities-for-securities transactions where the firm is the borrower are not included in the balance sheets.
premises, equipment and software costs premises, equipment and software costs consist of buildings, leasehold improvements, furniture, fixtures, computer and communications equipment, power generation assets, terminals, pipelines and software (externally purchased and developed for internal use). premises, equipment and software costs are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization and are included in other assets in the balance sheets. depreciation and amortization are provided by the straight-line method over the estimated useful life of the asset.

premises, equipment and software costs are tested for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances suggest that an assets carrying value may not be fully recoverable.
goodwill and intangible assets the firm tests goodwill for impairment on an annual basis and on an interim basis when certain events or circumstances
105     december 2017 form 10-k notes to consolidated financial statements exist. the firm tests for impairment at the reporting unit level, which is generally at the level of or one level below its business segments. for both the annual and interim tests, the firm has the option to either (a) perform a quantitative impairment test or (b) first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, in which case the quantitative test would be performed.
when performing a quantitative impairment test, we compare the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount, including goodwill. if the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, the goodwill impairment loss is equal to the lesser of the excess of the carrying value over the fair value or the carrying amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit.
the estimated fair values of the reporting units are derived based on valuation techniques the firm believes market participants would use for each of the reporting units. the estimated fair values are generally determined by utilizing a discounted cash flow methodology or methodologies that incorporate price-to-book and price-to-earnings multiples of certain comparable companies.
goodwill is not amortized but, as noted above, is reviewed annually (or more frequently when certain events or circumstances exist) for impairment. other intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives and reviewed for impairment. impairment losses are recorded within other expenses in the income statements.
earnings per common share basic eps is computed by dividing earnings available to morgan stanley common shareholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the period. earnings available to morgan stanley common shareholders represents net income applicable to morgan stanley reduced by preferred stock dividends and allocations of earnings to participating securities. common shares outstanding include common stock and vested rsus where recipients have satisfied either the explicit vesting terms or retirement-eligibility requirements. diluted eps reflects the assumed conversion of all dilutive securities.
unvested share-based awards that contain non-forfeitable rights to dividends or dividend equivalents (whether paid or unpaid) are participating securities and are included in the computation of eps pursuant to the two-class method. share-based awards that pay dividend equivalents subject to vesting are not deemed participating securities and are included in diluted shares outstanding (if dilutive) under the treasury stock method.
the firm has granted psus that vest and convert to shares of common stock only if they satisfy predetermined performance and market goals. since the issuance of the shares is contingent upon the satisfaction of certain conditions, the psus are included in diluted eps based on the number of shares (if any) that would be issuable if the end of the reporting period was the end of the contingency period.
for the calculation of basic and diluted eps, see note 16.
deferred compensation stock-based compensation the firm measures compensation cost for stock-based awards at fair value and recognizes compensation cost over the service period. the firm accounts for forfeitures as they occur. the firm determines the fair value of rsus (including rsus with non-market performance conditions) based on the grant-date fair value of its common stock, measured as the volume-weighted average price on the date of grant. certain stock-based compensation with market-based conditions is valued using a monte carlo valuation model.
compensation expense for stock-based compensation awards is recognized using the graded vesting attribution method. compensation expense for awards with performance conditions is recognized based on the probable outcome of the performance condition at each reporting date. compensation expense for awards with market-based conditions is recognized irrespective of the probability of the market condition being achieved and is not reversed if the market condition is not met.
the firm recognizes the expense for stock-based awards over the requisite service period. these awards generally contain clawback and cancellation provisions. certain awards provide the firm discretion to cancel all or a portion of the award under specified circumstances. compensation expense for those awards is adjusted for changes in the fair value of the firms common stock or the relevant model valuation, as appropriate, until conversion, exercise or expiration.
for year-end stock-based awards anticipated to be granted to retirement-eligible employees under award terms that do not contain a future service requirement, the firm accrues the estimated cost over the course of the calendar year preceding the grant date, which reflects the period over which the compensation is earned.
notes to consolidated financial statements manner similar to treasury stock, where the shares of common stock outstanding are offset by an equal amount in common stock issued to employee stock trusts in the balance sheets.
the firm uses the grant-date fair value of stock-based compensation as the basis for recognition of the assets in the employee stock trusts. subsequent changes in the fair value are not recognized as the firms stock-based compensation plans do not permit diversification and must be settled by the delivery of a fixed number of shares of the firms common stock.
deferred cash-based compensation compensation expense for deferred cash-based compensation plans is calculated based on the notional value of the award granted, adjusted for changes in the fair value of the referenced investments. for unvested awards, the expense is recognized over the service period using the graded vesting attribution method. for vested awards with only notional earnings on the referenced investments, the expense is fully recognized in the current period. for year-end awards anticipated to be granted to retirement-eligible employees under award terms that do not contain a future service requirement, the firm accrues the estimated cost over the course of the calendar year preceding the grant date, which reflects the period over which the compensation is earned.
the firm invests directly, as a principal, in investments or other financial instruments to economically hedge its obligations under its deferred cash-based compensation plans. changes in value of such investments made by the firm are recorded in trading revenues and investments revenues. changes in compensation expense resulting from changes in the fair value of the referenced investments will generally be offset by changes in the fair value of investments made by the firm. however, there may be a timing difference between the immediate recognition of gains and losses on the firms investments and the deferred recognition of the related compensation expense over the vesting period.
income taxes the firm accounts for income tax expense (benefit) using the asset and liability method. under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recorded based upon the temporary differences between the financial statement and income tax bases of assets and liabilities using currently enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. the effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in income tax expense (benefit) in the period that includes the enactment date. such effects are recorded in income tax expense (benefit) from continuing operations regardless of where deferred taxes were originally recorded.
the firm recognizes net deferred tax assets to the extent that it believes these assets are more likely than not to be realized. in making such a determination, the firm considers all available positive and negative evidence, including future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences, projected future taxable income, tax planning strategies and results of recent operations. when performing the assessment, the firm considers all types of deferred tax assets in combination with each other, regardless of the origin of the underlying temporary difference. if a deferred tax asset is determined to be unrealizable, a valuation allowance is established. if the firm subsequently determines that it would be able to realize deferred tax assets in excess of their net recorded amount, it would make an adjustment to the deferred tax asset valuation allowance, which would reduce the provision for income taxes.
the firm recognizes tax expense associated with global intangible low-taxed income provisions (gilti) included in the tax cuts and jobs act (tax act) as it is incurred as part of the current income taxes to be paid or refunded for the current period.
uncertain tax positions are recorded on the basis of a two-step process, whereby (1) the firm determines whether it is more likely than not that the tax positions will be sustained on the basis of the technical merits of the position, and (2) for those tax positions that meet the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold, the firm recognizes the largest amount of tax benefit that is more than 50% likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement with the related tax authority. interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits are classified as provision for income taxes.
notwithstanding the above, it may be appropriate to record future adjustments made to amounts related to the tax act as an adjustment to income tax expense (benefit) from continuing operations in the reporting period the adjustments are determined, depending on the nature of the estimate and reason for the adjustment.
foreign currencies assets and liabilities of operations with non-u.s. dollar functional currencies are translated at year-end rates of exchange. gains or losses resulting from translating foreign currency financial statements, net of hedge gains or losses and related tax effects, are reflected in aoci, a separate component of morgan stanley shareholders equity in the balance sheets. gains or losses resulting from remeasurement of foreign currency transactions are included in net income, and amounts recognized in the income statement are translated at the rate of exchange on the respective date of recognition for each amount.
107     december 2017 form 10-k notes to consolidated financial statements accounting standards adopted the firm adopted the following accounting updates in 2017.
                                                          improvements to employee share-based payment accounting. this accounting update, adopted january 1, 2017, simplifies the accounting for employee share-based awards, including the recognition of forfeitures, the classification of related income tax consequences, and the classification of tax-related cash flows within the cash flow statements.
beginning in 2017, the income tax consequences related to share-based awards are required to be recognized in provision for income taxes in the income statements upon the conversion of employee share-based awards instead of additional paid-in capital. the impact of the income tax consequences upon conversion of the awards may be either a benefit or a provision. conversion of employee share-based awards to firm shares will primarily occur in the first quarter of each year. the impact of recognizing excess tax benefits upon conversion of awards in the quarter in which the accounting update was adopted (three months ended march 31, 2017) was a $112 million benefit to provision for income taxes. for full year impact of this discrete tax item, see note 21. the classification of cash flows from excess tax benefits was moved from the financing section to the operating section of the cash flow statements, and was applied on a retrospective basis.
in addition, this accounting update permits an entity to elect whether to continue to estimate the total forfeitures, or to account for forfeitures on an actual basis as they occur. the firm has elected to account for forfeitures on an actual basis as they occur. this change is required to be applied using a modified retrospective approach, and upon adoption, the firm recorded a cumulative catch-up adjustment, decreasing retained earnings by approximately $30 million net of tax, increasing additional paid-in capital by approximately $45 million and increasing deferred tax assets by approximately $15 million.
                                                                                 statement of cash flowsrestricted cash. this accounting update requires that an entity include in its cash and cash equivalents amounts that are deemed to be restricted cash and cash equivalents and to present a reconciliation of such amounts in the cash flow statements. the firm early adopted this accounting update in the fourth quarter of 2017. prior periods were retrospectively adjusted to conform to the current period presentation. upon adoption, the firm recorded an increase of $2.9 billion and a decrease of $(8.3) billion in net cash provided by (used for)
operating activities, for the years ended december 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. these impacts were primarily related to reclassifying the changes in the firms restricted cash balance from the operating section to the cash and cash equivalent balances within the cash flow statements.
                                                                               income tax accounting implications of the tax cuts and jobs act. this sec staff accounting bulletin addresses the recognition of the tax effects of the tax act in the period of enactment (2017). it allows companies to book provisional estimates of the effects, or to report that their accounting is incomplete when issuing financial statements. to the extent that provisional estimates are booked, it allows a one year measurement period during which any adjustments made to previous provisional amounts would be recorded as an adjustment to income tax expense (benefit) from continuing operations in the reporting period the adjustments are determined. the adoption of this accounting guidance in the fourth quarter of 2017 did not have a material impact on the firms financial statements.

 fair value of contingent corporate lending commitments is determined by using executed transactions on comparable loans and the anticipated market price based on pricing indications from syndicate banks and customers. the valuation of loans and lending commitments also takes into account fee income that is considered an attribute of the contract.  fair value of mortgage loans is determined using observable prices based on transactional data or third-party pricing for comparable instruments, when available.
 where position-specific external prices are not observable, fair value is estimated based on benchmarking to prices and rates observed in the primary market for similar loan or borrower types or based on the present value of expected future cash flows using its best estimates of the key assumptions, including forecasted credit losses, prepayment rates, forward yield curves and discount rates commensurate with the risks involved or a methodology that utilizes the capital structure and credit spreads of recent comparable securitization transactions.
 fair value of equity margin loans is determined by discounting future interest cash flows, net of estimated credit losses. the estimated credit losses are derived by benchmarking to market observable cds spreads, implied debt yields or volatility metrics of the loan collateral company.

 otc derivative contracts include forward, swap and option contracts related to interest rates, foreign currencies, credit standing of reference entities, equity prices or commodity prices.
 depending on the product and the terms of the transaction, the fair value of otc derivative products can be modeled using a series of techniques, including closed-form analytic formulas, such as the black-scholes option-pricing model, simulation models or a combination thereof. many pricing models do not entail material subjectivity as the methodologies employed do not necessitate significant judgment, since model inputs may be observed from actively quoted markets, as is the case for generic interest rate swaps, many equity, commodity and foreign currency option contracts, and certain cds. in the case of more established derivative products, the pricing models used by the firm are widely accepted by the financial services industry.
 more complex otc derivative products are typically less liquid and require more judgment in the implementation of the valuation technique since direct trading activity or quotes are unobservable. this includes certain types of interest rate derivatives with both volatility and correlation exposure, equity, commodity or foreign currency derivatives that are either longer-dated or include exposure to multiple underlyings, and credit derivatives, including cds on certain mortgage- or asset-backed securities and basket cds. where these inputs are unobservable, relationships to observ-

notes to consolidated financial statements significant unobservable inputs used in recurring and nonrecurring level 3 fair value measurements the following disclosures provide information on the valuation techniques, significant unobservable inputs, and their ranges and averages for each major category of assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring and nonrecurring basis with a significant level 3 balance. the level of aggregation and breadth of products cause the range of inputs to be wide and not evenly distributed across the inventory. further, the range of unobservable inputs may differ across firms in the financial services industry because of diversity in the types of products included in each firms inventory. there are no predictable relationships between multiple significant unobservable inputs attributable to a given valuation technique. a single amount is disclosed when there is no significant difference between the minimum, maximum and average (weighted average or simple average/median).

cash synthetic basisthe measure of the price differential between cash financial instruments and                                                                                                                                                          in general, an increase (decrease) to the their synthetic derivative-based equivalents. the range disclosed in the table above signifies the number of points by which the synthetic bond equivalent price is higher than the quoted price of the underlying cash bonds.                             cash synthetic basis for an asset would result in a lower (higher) fair value.
benchmark) from the price of a comparable bond or loan, then adjusting that yield (or spread) to derive a value for the bond or loan. the adjustment to yield (or spread) should account for relevant differences in the bonds or loans such as maturity or credit quality.

comparable equity pricea price derived from equity raises, share buybacks and external bid levels,                                                                                                                                                                                                  in general, an increase (decrease) to the etc. a discount or premium may be included in the fair value estimate.                                                                                                                                                                                                                               comparable equity price of an asset would result in a higher (lower) fair value.
contingency probabilityprobability associated with the realization of an underlying event                                                                                                                                                                                                           in general, an increase (decrease) to the upon which the value of an asset is contingent.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      contingency probability for an asset would result in a higher (lower) fair value.
correlationa pricing input where the payoff is driven by more than one underlying risk.                                                                                                                                                                                                             in general, an increase (decrease) to the correlation is a measure of the relationship between the movement of two variables (i.e., how the change in one variable influences a change in the other variable). credit correlation, for example, is the factor that describes the                                                               correlation would result in an impact to the fair value, but the magnitude and direction of the impact would depend on whether the firm is long or short the exposure.

ebitda multiple / exit multiplethe ratio of the enterprise value to ebitda, where the enterprise                                                                                                                                                                                                    in general, an increase (decrease) to the value is the aggregate value of equity and debt minus cash and cash equivalents. the ebitda multiple reflects the value of the company in terms of its full-year ebitda, whereas the exit multiple reflects the value of the company in terms of its                                                 ebitda or exit multiple of an asset would result in a higher (lower) fair value.
full-year expected ebitda at exit. either multiple allows comparison between companies from an operational perspective as the effect of capital structure, taxation and depreciation/amortization is excluded.
funding spreadthe difference between the general collateral rate (which refers to the rate                                                                                                                                                                                                          in general, an increase (decrease) to the applicable to a broad class of u.s. treasury issuances) and the specific collateral rate (which refers to the rate applicable to a specific type of security pledged as collateral, such as a municipal bond). repurchase agreements and certain other                                               funding spread of an asset would result in a lower (higher) fair value.
secured financings are discounted based on collateral curves. the curves are constructed as spreads over the corresponding ois or libor curves, with the short end of the curve representing spreads over the corresponding ois curves and the long end of the curve representing spreads over libor.
waccthe wacc implied by the current value of equity in a discounted cash flow model. the model                                                                                                                                                                                                      in general, an increase (decrease) to the assumes that the cash flow assumptions, including projections, are fully reflected in the current equity value, while the debt to equity ratio is held constant. the wacc theoretically represents the required rate of return to debt and equity                                                    implied weighted cost of capital of an asset would result in a lower (higher) fair value.
interest rate curvethe term structure of interest rates (relationship between interest rates and                                                                                                                                                                                                    in general, an increase (decrease) to the the time to maturity) and a markets measure of future interest rates at the time of observation. an interest rate curve is used to set interest rate and foreign exchange derivative cash flows and is a pricing input used in the discounting of                                                   interest rate curve would result in an impact to the fair value, but the magnitude and direction of the impact would depend on whether the firm is long or short the exposure.
recovery rateamount expressed as a percentage of par that is expected to be received when a credit                                                                                                                                                                                                  in general, an increase (decrease) to the event occurs.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        recovery rate for an asset would result in a higher (lower) fair value.
volatilitythe measure of the variability in possible returns for an instrument given how much that                                                                                                                                                                                                  in general, an increase (decrease) to the instrument changes in value over time. volatility is a pricing input for options and, generally, the lower the volatility, the less risky the option. the level of volatility used in the valuation of a particular option depends on a number of                                                    volatility would result in an impact to the fair value, but the magnitude and direction of the impact would depend on whether the firm is long or short the exposure.
factors, including the nature of the risk underlying that option (e.g., the volatility of a particular underlying equity security may be significantly different from that of a particular underlying commodity index), the tenor and the strike price of the option.
volatility skewthe measure of the difference in implied volatility for options with identical                                                                                                                                                                                                       in general, an increase (decrease) to the underliers and expiry dates but with different strikes. the implied volatility for an option with a strike price that is above or below the current price of an underlying asset will typically deviate from the implied volatility for an option with a                                             volatility skew would result in an impact to the fair value, but the magnitude and direction of the impact would depend on whether the firm is long or short the exposure.

customer and other receivables
 for the portion of the customer and other receivables where fair value does not equal carrying value, the fair value is determined using collateral information, historical resolution and recovery rates and employee termination data. the cash flow is then discounted using a market observable spread over libor.
 the fair value of consumer and residential real estate loans and lending commitments where position-specific external price data are not observable is determined based on the credit risks of the borrower using a probability of default and loss given default method, discounted at the estimated external cost of funding level.
 the fair value of corporate loans and lending commitments is determined using recently executed transactions, market price quotations (where observable), implied yields from comparable debt, market observable cds spread levels along with proprietary valuation models and default recovery analysis where such transactions and quotations are unobservable.
 the fair value is generally determined based on transactional data or third-party pricing for identical or comparable instruments, when available. where position-specific external prices are not observable, fair value is determined based on current interest rates and credit spreads for debt instruments with similar terms and maturity.

the previous table summarizes gains and losses included in trading revenues in the income statements. these activities include revenues related to derivative and non-derivative financial instruments. the firm generally utilizes financial instruments across a variety of product types in connection with its market-making and related risk management strategies. the trading revenues presented in the table are not representative of the manner in which the firm manages its business activities and are prepared in a manner similar to the presentation of trading revenues for regulatory reporting purposes.
credit risk-related contingencies in connection with certain otc trading agreements, the firm may be required to provide additional collateral or immediately settle any outstanding liability balances with certain counterparties in the event of a credit rating downgrade of the firm.
the following table presents the aggregate fair value of certain derivative contracts that contain credit risk-related contingent features that are in a net liability position for which the firm has posted collateral in the normal course of business.

the additional collateral or termination payments that may be called in the event of a future credit rating downgrade vary by contract and can be based on ratings by either or both of moodys investors service, inc. (moodys) and s&p global ratings. the following table shows the future potential collateral amounts and termination payments that could be called or required by counterparties or exchange and clearing organizations in the event of one-notch or two-notch downgrade scenarios based on the relevant contractual downgrade triggers.
incremental collateral or termination payments upon potential future ratings downgrade
1.                     amount represents arrangements between the firm and other parties where upon the downgrade of one party, the downgraded party must deliver collateral to the other party. these bilateral downgrade arrangements are used by the firm to manage the risk of counterparty downgrades.
credit derivatives and other credit contracts the firm enters into credit derivatives, principally cds, under which it receives or provides protection against the risk of default on a set of debt obligations issued by a specified reference entity or entities. a majority of the firms counterparties for these derivatives are banks, broker-dealers, and insurance and other financial institutions.
index and basket with identical underlying reference obligations
127     december 2017 form 10-k notes to consolidated financial statements at december 31, 2016
index and basket with identical underlying reference obligations the purchase of credit protection does not represent the sole manner in which the firm risk manages its exposure to credit derivatives. the firm manages its exposure to these derivative contracts through a variety of risk mitigation strategies, which include managing the credit and correlation risk across single name, non-tranched indices and baskets, tranched indices and baskets, and cash positions. aggregate market risk limits have been established for credit derivatives, and market risk measures are routinely monitored against these limits. the firm may also recover amounts on the underlying reference obligation delivered to the firm under cdss where credit protection was sold.
fair value amounts as shown in the table below are on a gross basis prior to cash collateral or counterparty netting. in order to provide an indication of the current payment status or performance risk of the cdss, a breakdown of cdss based on the firms internal credit ratings by investment grade and non-investment grade is provided. internal credit ratings serve as the credit risk management departments (crm) assessment of credit risk and the basis for a comprehensive credit limits framework used to control credit risk. the firm uses quantitative models and judgment to estimate the various risk parameters related to each obligor.
credit ratings of reference obligation and maturities of credit protection sold at december 31, 2017
notes to consolidated financial statements credit contracts single name cds.    a cds protects the buyer against the loss of principal on a bond or loan in case of a default by the issuer. the protection buyer pays a periodic premium (generally quarterly) over the life of the contract and is protected for the period. the firm, in turn, performs under a cds if a credit event as defined under the contract occurs. typical credit events include bankruptcy, dissolution or insolvency of the referenced entity, failure to pay and restructuring of the obligations of the referenced entity.
index and basket cds.    index and basket cdss are products where credit protection is provided on a portfolio of single name cdss. generally, in the event of a default on one of the underlying names, the firm pays a pro rata portion of the total notional amount of the cds.
the firm also enters into tranched index and basket cdss where credit protection is provided on a particular portion of the portfolio loss distribution. the most junior tranches cover initial defaults, and once losses exceed the notional of the tranche, they are passed on to the next most senior tranche in the capital structure.
credit protection sold through cln and cdo.    the firm has invested in clns and cdos, which are hybrid instruments containing embedded derivatives, in which credit protection has been sold to the issuer of the note. if there is a credit event of a reference entity underlying the instrument, the principal balance of the note may not be repaid in full to the firm.

the firm believes there are no securities in an unrealized loss position that are other-than-temporarily impaired after performing the analysis described in note 2. for afs debt securities, the firm does not intend to sell the securities and is not likely to be required to sell the securities prior to recovery of amortized cost basis. furthermore, for afs and htm debt securities, the securities have not experienced credit losses as the net unrealized losses reported in the previous table are primarily due to higher interest rates since those securities were purchased.

6. collateralized transactions the firm enters into securities purchased under agreements to resell, securities sold under agreements to repurchase, securities borrowed and securities loaned transactions to, among other things, acquire securities to cover short positions and settle other securities obligations, to accommodate customers needs and to finance its inventory positions.
the firm manages credit exposure arising from such transactions by, in appropriate circumstances, entering into master netting agreements and collateral agreements with counterparties that provide the firm, in the event of a counterparty default (such as bankruptcy or a counterpartys failure to pay or perform), with the right to net a counterpartys rights and obligations under such agreement and liquidate and set off collateral held by the firm against the net amount owed by the counterparty.
the firms policy is generally to take possession of securities purchased or borrowed in connection with securities purchased under agreements to resell and securities borrowed transactions, respectively, and to receive cash and securities delivered under securities sold under agreements to repurchase or securities loaned transactions (with rights of rehypothecation). in certain cases, the firm may be permitted to post collateral to a third-party custodian under a tri-party arrangement that enables the firm to take control of such collateral in the event of a counterparty default.
the firm also monitors the fair value of the underlying securities as compared with the related receivable or payable, including accrued interest, and, as necessary, requests additional collateral, as provided under the applicable agreement to ensure such transactions are adequately collateralized, or the return of excess collateral.
the risk related to a decline in the market value of collateral (pledged or received) is managed by setting appropriate market-based haircuts. increases in collateral margin calls on secured financing due to market value declines may be mitigated by increases in collateral margin calls on securities purchased under agreements to resell and securities borrowed transactions with similar quality collateral. additionally, the firm may request lower quality collateral pledged be replaced with higher quality collateral through collateral substitution rights in the underlying agreements.
the firm actively manages its secured financings in a manner that reduces the potential refinancing risk of secured financ-
ings of less liquid assets. the firm considers the quality of collateral when negotiating collateral eligibility with counterparties, as defined by its fundability criteria. the firm utilizes shorter-term secured financing for highly liquid assets and has established longer tenor limits for less liquid assets, for which funding may be at risk in the event of a market disruption.

concentration risk the firm is subject to concentration risk by holding large positions in certain types of securities, loans or commitments to purchase securities of a single issuer, including sovereign governments and other entities, issuers located in a particular country or geographic area, public and private issuers involving developing countries or issuers engaged in a particular industry.

2.   consists of securities issued by the u.s. government, federal agencies or other sovereign government obligations.
positions taken and commitments made by the firm, including positions taken and underwriting and financing commitments made in connection with its private equity, principal investment and lending activities, often involve substantial amounts and significant exposure to individual issuers and businesses, including non-investment grade issuers. in addition, the firm may originate and/or purchase certain residential and commercial mortgage loans that could contain certain terms and features that may result in additional credit risk as compared with more traditional types of mortgages. such terms and features may include loans made to borrowers subject to payment increases or loans with high loan-to-value ratios.
customer margin lending and other margin lending allows clients to borrow against the value of qualifying securities. margin loans are included within customer and other receivables in the balance sheets. under these agreements and transactions, the firm receives collateral, including u.s. government and agency securities, other sovereign government obligations, corporate and other debt, and corporate equities. customer receivables generated from margin lending activities are collateralized by customer-owned securities held by the firm. the firm monitors required margin levels and established credit terms daily and, pursuant to such guidelines, requires customers to deposit additional collateral, or reduce positions, when necessary.
margin loans are extended on a demand basis and are not committed facilities. factors considered in the review of margin loans are the amount of the loan, the intended purpose, the degree of leverage being employed in the account, and an overall evaluation of the portfolio to ensure proper diversification or, in the case of concentrated positions, appropriate liquidity of the underlying collateral or potential hedging strategies to reduce risk.
underlying collateral for margin loans is reviewed with respect to the liquidity of the proposed collateral positions, valuation of securities, historic trading range, volatility analysis and an evaluation of industry concentrations. for these transactions, adherence to the firms collateral policies significantly limits its credit exposure in the event of a customer default. the firm may request additional margin collateral from customers, if appropriate, and, if necessary, may sell securities that have not been paid for or purchase securities sold but not delivered from customers.
net customer receivables representing margin loans   $32,112               $24,359
other secured financings include the liabilities related to transfers of financial assets that are accounted for as financings rather than sales, consolidated vies where the firm is deemed to be the primary beneficiary, and certain eln and other secured borrowings. these liabilities are generally payable from the cash flows of the related assets accounted for as trading assets (see notes 11 and 13).

7. loans and allowance for credit losses loans the firms loan portfolio consists of the following types of loans:
                                                                                       corporate. corporate loans primarily include commercial and industrial lending used for general corporate purposes, working capital and liquidity, event-driven loans and asset-backed lending products. event-driven loans support client merger, acquisition, recapitalization, or project finance activities. corporate loans are structured as revolving lines of credit, letter of credit facilities, term loans and bridge loans. risk factors considered in determining the allowance for corporate loans include the borrowers financial strength, seniority of the loan, collateral type, volatility of collateral value, debt cushion, covenants and counterparty type.
                                                                                       consumer. consumer loans include unsecured loans and securities-based lending, which allows clients to borrow money against the value of qualifying securities for any suitable purpose other than purchasing, trading, or carrying securities or refinancing margin debt. the majority of consumer loans are structured as revolving lines of credit and letter of credit facilities and are primarily offered through the firms portfolio loan account and liquidity access line programs. the allowance methodology for unsecured loans considers the specific attributes of the loan, as well as the borrowers source of repayment. the allowance methodology for securities-based lending considers the collateral type underlying the loan (e.g., diversified securities, concentrated securities or restricted stock).
   residential real estate. residential real estate loans mainly include non-conforming loans and heloc. the allowance methodology for non-conforming residential mortgage loans considers several factors, including, but not limited to, loan-to-value ratio, fico score, home price index and delinquency status. the methodology for heloc considers credit limits and utilization rates in addition to the factors considered for non-conforming residential mortgages.
                                              wholesale real estate. wholesale real estate loans include owner-occupied loans and income-producing loans. the principal risk factors for determining the allowance for wholesale real estate loans are the underlying collateral type, loan-to-value ratio and debt service ratio.
loans, net of allowance   $9,977            $9,388
see note 3 for further information regarding loans and lending commitments held at fair value.
credit quality crm evaluates new obligors before credit transactions are initially approved and at least annually thereafter for corporate and wholesale real estate loans. for corporate loans, credit evaluations typically involve the evaluation of financial statements, assessment of leverage, liquidity, capital strength, asset composition and quality, market capitalization and access to capital markets, cash flow projections and debt service requirements, and the adequacy of collateral, if applicable.
notes to consolidated financial statements crm also evaluates strategy, market position, industry dynamics, obligors management and other factors that could affect an obligors risk profile. for wholesale real estate loans, the credit evaluation is focused on property and transaction metrics, including property type, loan-to-value ratio, occupancy levels, debt service ratio, prevailing capitalization rates and market dynamics. for residential real estate and consumer loans, the initial credit evaluation typically includes, but is not limited to, review of the obligors income, net worth, liquidity, collateral, loan-to-value ratio and credit bureau information. subsequent credit monitoring for residential real estate loans is performed at the portfolio level. consumer loan collateral values are monitored on an ongoing basis.
the firm utilizes the following credit quality indicators, which are consistent with u.s. banking agencies definitions of criticized exposures, in its credit monitoring process for loans held for investment:
                                      pass. a credit exposure rated pass has a continued expectation of timely repayment, all obligations of the borrower are current, and the obligor complies with material terms and conditions of the lending agreement.
                                           special mention. extensions of credit that have potential weakness that deserve managements close attention and, if left uncorrected, may, at some future date, result in the deterioration of the repayment prospects or collateral position.
                                              substandard. obligor has a well-defined weakness that jeopardizes the repayment of the debt and has a high probability of payment default with the distinct possibility that the firm will sustain some loss if noted deficiencies are not corrected.
                     doubtful. inherent weakness in the exposure makes the collection or repayment in full, based on existing facts, conditions and circumstances, highly improbable, and the amount of loss is uncertain.
   loss. extensions of credit classified as loss are considered uncollectible and are charged off.
loans considered as doubtful or loss are considered impaired. substandard loans are regularly reviewed for impairment. when a loan is impaired, the impairment is measured based on the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loans effective interest rate or, as a practical expedient, the observable market price of the loan or the fair value of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent. for further information, see note 2.
the following loans and lending commitments have been evaluated for a specific allowance. all remaining loans and lending commitments are assessed under the inherent allowance methodology.
1.                                                 at december 31, 2017 and december 31, 2016, no allowance was recorded for these loans and lending commitments as the present value of the expected future cash flows (or, alternatively, the observable market price of the instrument or the fair value of the collateral held) equaled or exceeded the carrying value.
2.   the impaired loans upb differs from the aggregate amount of impaired loan balances with and without allowance due to various factors, including charge-offs and net deferred loan fees or costs.

notes to consolidated financial statements employee loans
employee loans are granted in conjunction with a program established to retain and recruit certain employees, are full recourse and generally require periodic repayments. these loans are recorded in customer and other receivables in the balance sheets. the firm establishes an allowance for loan amounts it does not consider recoverable, and the related provision is recorded in compensation and benefits expense.
8. equity method investments overview the firms investments accounted for under the equity method of accounting (see note 1) are included in other assets in the balance sheets. income (loss) from equity method investments is included in other revenues in the income statements.
1.   includes a $53 million impairment of the investment management business segments interest in a third-party asset manager.
japanese securities joint venture included in the equity method investments is the firms 40% voting interest in mitsubishi ufj morgan stanley securities co., ltd. (mumss). mufg holds a 60% voting interest. the firm accounts for its equity method investment in mumss within the institutional securities business segment.
in 2011, mufg contributed capital to mumss and in return received class c stock from mumss (class c stock) to restore its capital base which was eroded by trading and other losses. morgan stanley did not have an obligation to make matching capital contributions to mumss at that time.
accordingly, the firm recorded increases in its investment, with corresponding increases in additional paid-in capital, reflecting the firms 40% share of the increase in the net asset value of mumss. in the fourth quarter of 2017, mumss partially redeemed the class c stock issued to mufg, and the firm recorded a decrease in both its investment in mumss and additional paid-in capital of $71 million.
9. goodwill and intangible assets goodwill the firm completed its annual goodwill impairment testing as of july 1, 2017 and july 1, 2016. the firms impairment testing for each period did not indicate any goodwill impairment as each of the firms reporting units with goodwill had a fair value that was substantially in excess of its carrying value.

original maturities of one year or less:
1.                      variable rate borrowings bear interest based on a variety of money market indices, including libor and federal funds rates. amounts include notes carried at fair value with various payment provisions, including notes linked to equity, credit, commodity or other indices.
2.                                                    includes only borrowings with original maturities greater than one year. weighted average coupon is calculated utilizing u.s. and non-u.s. dollar interest rates and excludes financial instruments for which the fair value option was elected. virtually all of the variable rate notes issued by subsidiaries are carried at fair value so a weighted average coupon is not meaningful.
increases (decreases) in carrying amount of borrowings associated with fair value hedges
notes to consolidated financial statements certain senior debt securities are denominated in various non-u.s. dollar currencies and may be structured to provide a return that is linked to equity, credit, commodity or other indices (e.g., the consumer price index). senior debt also may be structured to be callable by the firm or extendible at the option of holders of the senior debt securities.
debt containing an option that effectively allows the holders to put the notes back to the firm totaled $3,023 million at december 31, 2017 and $3,156 million at december 31, 2016. in addition, in certain circumstances, certain purchasers may be entitled to cause the repurchase of the notes through liquidity arrangements with the firm. the aggregated value of notes subject to these arrangements was $1,414 million at december 31, 2017 and $1,117 million at december 31, 2016. subordinated debt generally is issued to meet the capital requirements of the firm or its regulated subsidiaries and primarily is u.s. dollar denominated.
senior debtstructured borrowings the firms index-linked, equity-linked or credit-linked borrowings include various structured instruments whose payments and redemption values are linked to the performance of a specific index (e.g., s&p 500), a basket of stocks, a specific equity security, a credit exposure or basket of credit exposures. to minimize the exposure from such instruments, the firm has entered into various swap contracts and purchased options that effectively convert the borrowing costs into floating rates based upon libor. the firm generally carries the entire structured borrowing at fair value. the swaps and purchased options used to economically hedge the embedded features are derivatives and also are carried at fair value. changes in fair value related to the notes and economic hedges are reported in trading revenues. see notes 2 and 3 for further information on structured borrowings.
maturities of subordinated notes range from 2022 to 2027.
asset and liability management in general, other than securities inventories financed by secured funding sources, the majority of the firms assets are financed with a combination of deposits, short-term funding, floating rate long-term debt or fixed rate long-term debt swapped to a floating rate. the firm uses interest rate swaps to more closely match these borrowings to the duration, holding period and interest rate characteristics of the assets being funded and to manage interest rate risk. these swaps effectively convert certain of the firms fixed rate borrowings into floating rate obligations. in addition, for non-u.s. dollar currency borrowings that are not used to fund assets in the same currency, the firm has entered into currency swaps that effectively convert the borrowings into u.s. dollar obligations.
the firms use of swaps for asset and liability management affected its effective average borrowing rate.
1.   weighted average coupon was calculated utilizing u.s. and non-u.s. dollar interest rates and excludes financial instruments for which the fair value option was elected.
other secured financings other secured financings include the liabilities related to certain elns, transfers of financial assets that are accounted for as financings rather than sales, pledged commodities, consolidated vies where the firm is deemed to be the primary beneficiary and other secured borrowings. these liabilities are generally payable from the cash flows of the related assets accounted for as trading assets. see note 13 for further information on other secured financings related to vies and securitization activities.

within three business days types of commitments lending commitments.  lending commitments represent the notional amount of legally binding obligations to provide funding to clients for different types of loan transactions. for syndications led by the firm, the lending commitments accepted by the borrower but not yet closed are net of the amounts agreed to by counterparties that will participate in the syndication. for syndications that the firm participates in and does not lead, lending commitments accepted by the borrower but not yet closed include only the amount that the firm expects it will be allocated from the lead syndicate bank. due to the nature of the firms obligations under the commitments, these amounts include certain commitments participated to third parties. see note 7 for further information.
notes to consolidated financial statements to certain clearinghouses or associated depositories that the firm is a member of and are contingent upon the default of a clearinghouse member or other stress event. these transactions are primarily secured by collateral from u.s. government agency securities and other sovereign government obligations when they are funded.
underwriting commitments.    the firm provides underwriting commitments in connection with its capital raising sources to a diverse group of corporate and other institutional clients.
investment activities.    the firm sponsors several non-consolidated investment management funds for third-party investors where it typically acts as general partner of, and investment advisor to, these funds and typically commits to invest a minority of the capital of such funds, with subscribing third-party investors contributing the majority. the firms employees, including its senior officers as well as the firms board of directors (board), may participate on the same terms and conditions as other investors in certain of these funds that the firm sponsors primarily for client investment, except that the firm may waive or lower applicable fees and charges for its employees. the firm has contractual capital commitments, guarantees and counterparty arrangements with respect to these investment management funds.
letters of credit and other financial guarantees.    the firm has outstanding letters of credit and other financial guarantees issued by third-party banks to certain of the firms counterparties. the firm is contingently liable for these letters of credit and other financial guarantees, which are primarily used to provide collateral for securities and commodities traded and to satisfy various margin requirements in lieu of depositing cash or securities with these counterparties.
premises and equipment.    the firm has non-cancelable operating leases covering premises and equipment. future minimum rental commitments under such leases (net of sublease commitments, principally on office rentals) were as follows:

143     december 2017 form 10-k notes to consolidated financial statements types of guarantees derivative contracts.  certain derivative contracts meet the accounting definition of a guarantee, including certain written options, contingent forward contracts and cdss (see note 4 regarding credit derivatives in which the firm has sold credit protection to the counterparty). information regarding all derivative contracts that could meet the accounting definition of a guarantee is included in the previous table wherein the notional amount is used as the maximum potential payout for certain derivative contracts, such as written interest rate caps and written foreign currency options.
in certain situations, collateral may be held by the firm for those contracts that meet the definition of a guarantee. generally, the firm sets collateral requirements by counterparty so that the collateral covers various transactions and products and is not allocated specifically to individual contracts. also, the firm may recover amounts related to the underlying asset delivered to the firm under the derivative contract.
the firm records derivative contracts at fair value. aggregate market risk limits have been established, and market risk measures are routinely monitored against these limits. the firm also manages its exposure to these derivative contracts through a variety of risk mitigation strategies, including, but not limited to, entering into offsetting economic hedge positions. the firm believes that the notional amounts of the derivative contracts generally overstate its exposure.
standby letters of credit and other financial guarantees issued.  in connection with its corporate lending business and other corporate activities, the firm provides standby letters of credit and other financial guarantees to counterparties. such arrangements represent obligations to make payments to third parties if the counterparty fails to fulfill its obligation under a borrowing arrangement or other contractual obligation. a majority of the firms standby letters of credit are provided on behalf of counterparties that are investment grade.
market value guarantees.  market value guarantees are issued to guarantee timely payment of a specified return to investors in certain affordable housing tax credit funds. these guarantees are designed to return an investors contribution to a fund and the investors share of tax losses and tax credits expected to be generated by a fund. from time to time, the firm may also guarantee return of principal invested, potentially including a specified rate of return, to fund investors.
liquidity facilities.  the firm has entered into liquidity facilities with spes and other counterparties, whereby the firm is required to make certain payments if losses or defaults occur. primarily, the firm acts as liquidity provider to municipal bond securitization spes and for standalone municipal bonds in which the holders of beneficial interests issued by these spes or the holders of the individual bonds, respectively, have the right to tender their interests for purchase by the firm on specified dates at a specified price. the firm often may have recourse to the underlying assets held by the spes in the event payments are required under such liquidity facilities, as well as make-whole or recourse provisions with the trust sponsors. primarily all of the underlying assets in the spes are investment grade. liquidity facilities provided to municipal tender option bond trusts are classified as derivatives.
whole loan sales guarantees.  the firm has provided, or otherwise agreed to be responsible for, representations and warranties regarding certain whole loan sales. under certain circumstances, the firm may be required to repurchase such assets or make other payments related to such assets if such representations and warranties are breached. the firms maximum potential payout related to such representations and warranties is equal to the current upb of such loans. the firm has information on the current upb only when it services the loans. the firm no longer services those loans and the amount included in the previous table represents the upb at the time of sale or at the time when the firm last serviced any of those loans. the current upb balances could be substantially lower than the maximum potential payout amount included in the previous table. the related liability primarily relates to sales of loans to the federal mortgage agencies.
securitization representations and warranties.  as part of the firms institutional securities business segments securitizations and related activities, the firm has provided, or otherwise agreed to be responsible for, representations and warranties regarding certain assets transferred in securitization transactions sponsored by the firm. the extent and nature of the representations and warranties, if any, vary among different securitizations. under certain circumstances, the firm may be required to repurchase certain assets or make other payments related to such assets if such representations and warranties are breached. the maximum potential amount of future payments the firm could be required to make would be equal to the current outstanding balances of, or losses associated with, the assets subject to breaches of such representations and warranties. the amount included in the previous table for the maximum potential payout includes the current upb or historical losses where known, and the upb at the time of sale when the current upb is not known.
notes to consolidated financial statements has agreed to be responsible for representations and warranties made by third-party sellers, many of which are now insolvent.
the firm also provided representations and warranties in connection with its role as an originator of certain commercial mortgage loans that it securitized into cmbs.
1.   reserved in the firms financial statements for payments to resolve claims related to breach of representations and warranties in connection with residential mortgages.
general partner guarantees.    as a general partner in certain investment management funds, the firm receives certain distributions from the partnerships related to achieving certain return hurdles according to the provisions of the partnership agreements. the firm may be required to return all or a portion of such distributions to the limited partners in the event the limited partners do not achieve a certain return as specified in the various partnership agreements, subject to certain limitations.
other guarantees and indemnities in the normal course of business, the firm provides guarantees and indemnifications in a variety of transactions. these provisions generally are standard contractual terms. certain of these guarantees and indemnifications are described below:
                                                                                          indemnities. the firm provides standard indemnities to counterparties for certain contingent exposures and taxes, including u.s. and foreign withholding taxes, on interest and other payments made on derivatives, securities and stock lending transactions, certain annuity products and other financial arrangements. these indemnity payments could be required based on a change in the tax laws, a change in interpretation of applicable tax rulings or a change in factual circumstances. certain contracts contain provisions that enable the firm to terminate the agreement upon the occurrence of such events. the maximum potential amount of future payments that the firm could be required to make under these indemnifications cannot be estimated.
                                                                  exchange/clearinghouse member guarantees. the firm is a member of various u.s.
and non-u.s. exchanges and clearinghouses that trade and clear securities and/or derivative contracts. associated with its membership, the firm may be required to pay a certain amount as determined by the exchange or the clearinghouse in case of a default of
any of its members or pay a proportionate share of the financial obligations of another member that may default on its obligations to the exchange or the clearinghouse. while the rules governing different exchange or clearinghouse memberships and the forms of these guarantees may vary, in general the firms obligations under these rules would arise only if the exchange or clearinghouse had previously exhausted its resources.
in addition, some clearinghouse rules require members to assume a proportionate share of losses resulting from the clearinghouses investment of guarantee fund contributions and initial margin, and of other losses unrelated to the default of a clearing member, if such losses exceed the specified resources allocated for such purpose by the clearinghouse.
the maximum potential payout under these rules cannot be estimated. the firm has not recorded any contingent liability in its financial statements for these agreements and believes that any potential requirement to make payments under these agreements is remote.
                                                                                       merger and acquisition guarantees. the firm may, from time to time, in its role as investment banking advisor be required to provide guarantees in connection with certain european merger and acquisition transactions. if required by the regulating authorities, the firm provides a guarantee that the acquirer in the merger and acquisition transaction has or will have sufficient funds to complete the transaction and would then be required to make the acquisition payments in the event the acquirers funds are insufficient at the completion date of the transaction.
these arrangements generally cover the time frame from the transaction offer date to its closing date and, therefore, are generally short term in nature. the firm believes the likelihood of any payment by the firm under these arrangements is remote given the level of its due diligence in its role as investment banking advisor.
in addition, in the ordinary course of business, the firm guarantees the debt and/or certain trading obligations (including obligations associated with derivatives, foreign exchange contracts and the settlement of physical commodities) of certain subsidiaries. these guarantees generally are entity or product specific and are required by investors or trading counterparties. the activities of the firms subsidiaries covered by these guarantees (including any related debt or trading obligations) are included in the financial statements.
contingencies legal.    in addition to the matters described below, in the normal course of business, the firm has been named, from time to time, as a defendant in various legal actions, including
145     december 2017 form 10-k notes to consolidated financial statements arbitrations, class actions and other litigation, arising in connection with its activities as a global diversified financial services institution. certain of the actual or threatened legal actions include claims for substantial compensatory and/or punitive damages or claims for indeterminate amounts of damages. in some cases, the entities that would otherwise be the primary defendants in such cases are bankrupt or are in financial distress. these actions have included, but are not limited to, residential mortgage and credit crisis-related matters.
over the last several years, the level of litigation and investigatory activity (both formal and informal) by governmental and self-regulatory agencies has increased materially in the financial services industry. as a result, the firm expects that it will continue to be the subject of elevated claims for damages and other relief and, while the firm has identified below any individual proceedings where the firm believes a material loss to be reasonably possible and reasonably estimable, there can be no assurance that material losses will not be incurred from claims that have not yet been asserted or are not yet determined to be probable or possible and reasonably estimable losses.
the firm contests liability and/or the amount of damages as appropriate in each pending matter. where available information indicates that it is probable a liability had been incurred at the date of the financial statements and the firm can reasonably estimate the amount of that loss, the firm accrues the estimated loss by a charge to income.
the firms future legal expenses may fluctuate from period to period, given the current environment regarding government investigations and private litigation affecting global financial services firms, including the firm.
in many proceedings and investigations, however, it is inherently difficult to determine whether any loss is probable or even possible or to estimate the amount of any loss. in addition, even where a loss is possible or an exposure to loss exists in excess of the liability already accrued with respect to a previously recognized loss contingency, it is not always possible to reasonably estimate the size of the possible loss or range of loss.
for certain legal proceedings and investigations, the firm cannot reasonably estimate such losses, particularly for proceedings and investigations where the factual record is being developed or contested or where plaintiffs or government entities seek substantial or indeterminate damages, restitution, disgorgement or penalties. numerous issues may need to be resolved, including through potentially lengthy discovery and determination of important factual matters, determination of issues related to class certification and the calculation of damages or other relief, and by addressing novel or unsettled legal questions relevant to the proceedings or investigations in question, before a loss or additional loss or range of loss or additional range of loss can be reasonably estimated for a proceeding or investigation.
for certain other legal proceedings and investigations, the firm can estimate reasonably possible losses, additional losses, ranges of loss or ranges of additional loss in excess of amounts accrued, but does not believe, based on current knowledge and after consultation with counsel, that such losses will have a material adverse effect on the firms financial statements as a whole, other than the matters referred to in the following paragraphs.

13. variable interest entities and securitization activities overview the firm is involved with various spes in the normal course of business. in most cases, these entities are deemed to be vies.
the firms variable interests in vies include debt and equity interests, commitments, guarantees, derivative instruments and certain fees. the firms involvement with vies arises primarily from:
         interests purchased in connection with market-making activities, securities held in its investment securities portfolio and retained interests held as a result of securitization activities, including re-securitization transactions.
notes to consolidated financial statements
   structuring of clns or other asset-repackaged notes designed to meet the investment objectives of clients.
   other structured transactions designed to provide tax-efficient yields to the firm or its clients.
the firm determines whether it is the primary beneficiary of a vie upon its initial involvement with the vie and reassesses whether it is the primary beneficiary on an ongoing basis as long as it has any continuing involvement with the vie. this determination is based upon an analysis of the design of the vie, including the vies structure and activities, the power to make significant economic decisions held by the firm and by other parties, and the variable interests owned by the firm and other parties.
the power to make the most significant economic decisions may take a number of different forms in different types of vies. the firm considers servicing or collateral management decisions as representing the power to make the most significant economic decisions in transactions such as securitizations or cdos. as a result, the firm does not consolidate securitizations or cdos for which it does not act as the servicer or collateral manager unless it holds certain other rights to replace the servicer or collateral manager or to require the liquidation of the entity. if the firm serves as servicer or collateral manager, or has certain other rights described in the previous sentence, the firm analyzes the interests in the vie that it holds and consolidates only those vies for which it holds a potentially significant interest in the vie.
the structure of securitization vehicles and cdos is driven by several parties, including loan seller(s) in securitization transactions, the collateral manager in a cdo, one or more rating agencies, a financial guarantor in some transactions and the underwriter(s) of the transactions, that serve to reflect specific investor demand. in addition, subordinate investors, such as the b-piece buyer (i.e., investors in most subordinated bond classes) in commercial mortgage-backed securitizations or equity investors in cdos, can influence whether specific loans are excluded from a cmbs transaction or investment criteria in a cdo.
for many transactions, such as re-securitization transactions, clns and other asset-repackaged notes, there are no significant economic decisions made on an ongoing basis. in these cases, the firm focuses its analysis on decisions made prior to the initial closing of the transaction and at the termination of the transaction. the firm concluded in most of these transactions that decisions made prior to the initial closing were shared between the firm and the initial investors based upon the nature of the assets, including whether the assets were issued in a transaction sponsored by the firm and the extent of the information available to the firm and to investors, the number, nature and involvement of investors, other rights held by the firm and investors, the standardization of the legal documentation and the level of continuing involvement by the firm, including the amount and type of interests owned by the firm and by other investors. the firm focused its control decision on any right held by the firm or investors related to the termination of the vie. most re-securitization transactions, clns and other asset-repackaged notes have no such termination rights.

149     december 2017 form 10-k notes to consolidated financial statements consolidated vie assets and liabilities are presented in the previous tables after intercompany eliminations. most assets owned by consolidated vies cannot be removed unilaterally by the firm and are not generally available to the firm. most related liabilities issued by consolidated vies are non-recourse to the firm. in certain other consolidated vies, the firm either has the unilateral right to remove assets or provides additional recourse through derivatives such as total return swaps, guarantees or other forms of involvement.
in general, the firms exposure to loss in consolidated vies is limited to losses that would be absorbed on the vies net assets recognized in its financial statements, net of amounts absorbed by third-party variable interest holders.
select information related to consolidated vies
1.   primarily related to certain derivatives, commitments, guarantees and other forms of involvement not recognized in the financial statements.
non-consolidated vies the following tables include all vies in which the firm has determined that its maximum exposure to loss is greater than specific thresholds or meets certain other criteria and exclude exposure to loss from liabilities due to immateriality. most of the vies included in the following tables are sponsored by unrelated parties; the firms involvement generally is the result of its secondary market-making activities, securities held in its investment securities portfolio (see note 5) and certain investments in funds.
carrying value of exposure to lossassets debt and equity interests                         $10,657                  $1,384                       $43              $1,202                $4,730

the firms maximum exposure to loss presented in the previous table often differs from the carrying value of the variable interests held by the firm. the maximum exposure to loss presented in the previous table is dependent on the nature of the firms variable interest in the vies and is limited to the notional amounts of certain liquidity facilities, other credit support, total return swaps, written put options, and the fair value of certain other derivatives and investments the firm has made in the vies. liabilities issued by vies generally are non-recourse to the firm. where notional amounts are utilized in quantifying the maximum exposure related to derivatives, such amounts do not reflect fair value write-downs already recorded by the firm.
the firms maximum exposure to loss presented in the previous table does not include the offsetting benefit of any financial instruments that the firm may utilize to hedge these risks associated with its variable interests. in addition, the firms maximum exposure to loss presented in the previous table is not reduced by the amount of collateral held as part of a transaction with the vie or any party to the vie directly against a specific exposure to loss.
notes to consolidated financial statements securitization transactions generally involve vies. primarily as a result of its secondary market-making activities, the firm owned additional vie assets mainly issued by securitization spes for which the maximum exposure to loss is less than specific thresholds.
these assets were either retained in connection with transfers of assets by the firm, acquired in connection with secondary market-making activities, held as afs securities in its investment securities portfolio (see note 5), or held as investments in funds. at december 31, 2017 and december 31, 2016, these assets consisted of securities backed by residential mortgage loans, commercial mortgage loans or other consumer loans, such as credit card receivables, automobile loans and student loans, cdos or clos, and investment funds.
the firms primary risk exposure is to the securities issued by the spe owned by the firm, with the highest risk on the most subordinate class of beneficial interests. these assets generally are included in trading assetscorporate and other debt, trading assetsinvestments or afs securities within its investment securities portfolio and are measured at fair value (see note 3). the firm does not provide additional support in these transactions through contractual facilities, such as liquidity facilities, guarantees or similar derivatives. the firms maximum exposure to loss generally equals the fair value of the assets owned.
securitization activities in a securitization transaction, the firm transfers assets (generally commercial or residential mortgage loans or u.s. agency securities) to an spe, sells to investors most of the beneficial interests, such as notes or certificates, issued by the spe, and, in many cases, retains other beneficial interests. in many securitization transactions involving commercial mortgage loans, the firm transfers a portion of the assets to the spe with unrelated parties transferring the remaining assets.
the purchase of the transferred assets by the spe is financed through the sale of these interests. in some of these transactions, primarily involving residential mortgage loans in the u.s., the firm serves as servicer for some or all of the transferred loans. in many securitizations, particularly involving residential mortgage loans, the firm also enters into derivative transactions, primarily interest rate swaps or interest rate caps, with the spe.
although not obligated, the firm generally makes a market in the securities issued by spes in these transactions. as a market maker, the firm offers to buy these securities from, and sell these securities to, investors. securities purchased through these market-making activities are not considered to be retained interests, although these beneficial interests generally are included in trading assetscorporate and other debt and are measured at fair value.
the firm enters into derivatives, generally interest rate swaps and interest rate caps, with a senior payment priority in many securitization transactions. the risks associated with these and similar derivatives with spes are essentially the same as similar derivatives with non-spe counterparties and are managed as part of the firms overall exposure. see note 4 for further information on derivative instruments and hedging activities.
available- for-sale securities in the afs securities within the investment securities portfolio, the firm holds securities issued by vies not sponsored by the firm. these securities include an explicit and implicit guarantee provided by the u.s. government issued in transactions sponsored by the federal mortgage agencies and the most senior securities issued by vies in which the securities are backed by student loans, automobile loans, commercial mortgage loans or clos (see note 5).
municipal tender option bond trusts in a municipal tender option bond trust transaction, the firm, generally on behalf of a client, transfers a municipal bond to a trust. the trust issues short-term securities that the firm, as the remarketing agent, sells to investors. the client retains a residual interest. the short-term securities are supported by a liquidity facility pursuant to which the investors may put their short-term interests. in some programs, the firm provides this liquidity facility; in most programs, a third-party provider will provide such liquidity facility.
the firm may purchase short-term securities in its role either as remarketing agent or as liquidity provider. the client can generally terminate the transaction at any time. the liquidity provider can generally terminate the transaction upon the occurrence of certain events. when the transaction is terminated, the municipal bond is generally sold or returned to the client. any losses suffered by the liquidity provider upon the sale of the bond are the responsibility of the client. this obligation generally is collateralized. liquidity facilities provided to municipal tender option bond trusts are classified as derivatives. the firm consolidates any municipal tender option bond trusts in which it holds the residual interest.
151     december 2017 form 10-k notes to consolidated financial statements credit protection purchased through credit-linked notes in a cln transaction, the firm transfers assets (generally high-quality securities or money market investments) to an spe, enters into a derivative transaction in which the spe writes protection on an unrelated reference asset or group of assets, through a cds, a total return swap or similar instrument, and sells to investors the securities issued by the spe. in some transactions, the firm may also enter into interest rate or currency swaps with the spe. upon the occurrence of a credit event related to the reference asset, the spe will deliver collateral securities as payment to the firm. the firm is generally exposed to price changes on the collateral securities in the event of a credit event and subsequent sale. these transactions are designed to provide investors with exposure to certain credit risk on the reference asset. in some transactions, the assets and liabilities of the spe are recognized in the firms balance sheets. in other transactions, the transfer of the collateral securities is accounted for as a sale of assets, and the spe is not consolidated. the structure of the transaction determines the accounting treatment.
derivative payments by the spe are collateralized. the risks associated with these and similar derivatives with spes are essentially the same as similar derivatives with non-spe counterparties and are managed as part of the firms overall exposure.
other structured financings the firm invests in interests issued by entities that develop and own low-income communities (including low-income housing projects) and entities that construct and own facilities that will generate energy from renewable resources. the interests entitle the firm to its share of tax credits and tax losses generated by these projects. in addition, the firm has issued guarantees to investors in certain low-income housing funds. the guarantees are designed to return an investors contribution to a fund and the investors share of tax losses and tax credits expected to be generated by the fund. the firm is also involved with entities designed to provide tax-efficient yields to the firm or its clients.
collateralized loan and debt obligations a clo or a cdo is an spe that purchases a pool of assets, consisting of corporate loans, corporate bonds, abs or synthetic exposures on similar assets through derivatives, and issues multiple tranches of debt and equity securities to investors. the firm underwrites the securities issued in clo transactions on behalf of unaffiliated sponsors and provides advisory services to these unaffiliated sponsors. the firm sells corporate loans to many of these spes, in some cases representing a significant portion of the total assets purchased. if necessary, the firm may retain unsold securities issued in these transactions. although not obligated, the firm generally makes a market in the securities issued by spes in these transactions. these beneficial interests are included in trading assets and are measured at fair value.
equity-linked notes in an eln transaction, the firm typically transfers to an spe either (1) a note issued by the firm, the payments on which are linked to the performance of a specific equity security, equity index, or other index or (2) debt securities issued by other companies and a derivative contract, the terms of which will relate to the performance of a specific equity security, equity index or other index. these transactions are designed to provide investors with exposure to certain risks related to the specific equity security, equity index or other index. eln transactions with spes were not consolidated at december 31, 2017 and december 31, 2016.
transactions with spes in which the firm, acting as principal, transferred financial assets with continuing involvement and received sales treatment are shown in the following tables.

14. regulatory requirements regulatory capital framework the firm is an fhc under the bank holding company act of 1956, as amended, and is subject to the regulation and oversight of the board of governors of the federal reserve system (federal reserve). the federal reserve establishes capital requirements for the firm, including well-capitalized standards, and evaluates the firms compliance with such capital requirements. the occ establishes similar capital requirements and standards for msbna and mspbna (collectively, our u.s. bank subsidiaries). the regulatory capital requirements are largely based on the basel iii capital standards
153     december 2017 form 10-k notes to consolidated financial statements established by the basel committee on banking supervision and also implement certain provisions of the dodd-frank wall street reform and consumer protection act.
regulatory capital requirements the firm is required to maintain minimum risk-based and leverage capital ratios under the regulatory capital requirements. a summary of the calculations of regulatory capital, rwas and transition provisions follows.
minimum risk-based capital ratio requirements apply to common equity tier 1 capital, tier 1 capital and total capital. certain adjustments to and deductions from capital are required for purposes of determining these ratios, such as goodwill, intangible assets, certain deferred tax assets, other amounts in aoci and investments in the capital instruments of unconsolidated financial institutions. certain of these adjustments and deductions are also subject to transitional provisions.
in addition to the minimum risk-based capital ratio requirements, on a fully phased-in basis by 2019, the firm will be subject to the following buffers:
   a greater than 2.5% common equity tier 1 capital conservation buffer;
   the common equity tier 1 g-sib capital surcharge, currently at 3%; and
the phase-in amount for each of the buffers was 50% of the fully phased-in buffer requirement in 2017, and increases to 75% in 2018. failure to maintain the buffers will result in restrictions on the firms ability to make capital distributions, including the payment of dividends and the repurchase of stock, and to pay discretionary bonuses to executive officers.
risk-weighted assets rwas reflect both the firms on- and off-balance sheet risk, as well as capital charges attributable to the risk of loss arising from the following:
   credit risk: the failure of a borrower, counterparty or issuer to meet its financial obligations to the firm;
   market risk: adverse changes in the level of one or more market prices, rates, indices, volatilities, correlations or other market factors, such as market liquidity; and
   operational risk: inadequate or failed processes or systems, from human factors or from external events
(e.g., fraud, theft, legal and compliance risks, cyber attacks or damage to physical assets).
the firms risk-based capital ratios for purposes of determining regulatory compliance are the lower of the capital ratios computed under (i) the standardized approaches for calculating credit risk and market risk rwas (standardized approach) and (ii) the applicable advanced approaches for calculating credit risk, market risk and operational risk rwas (advanced approach).
the firms regulatory capital and capital ratios at december 31, 2017, the firms ratios are based on the standardized approach transitional rules. at december 31, 2016, the firms ratios were based on the advanced approach transitional rules.

1.   percentages represent minimum regulatory capital ratios under the transitional rules.

u.s. bank subsidiaries regulatory capital and capital ratios the firms u.s. bank subsidiaries are subject to similar regulatory capital requirements as the firm. failure to meet minimum capital requirements can initiate certain mandatory and discretionary actions by regulators that, if undertaken, could have a direct material effect on the u.s. bank subsidiaries and the firms financial statements. under capital adequacy guidelines and the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action, each of the u.s. bank subsidiaries must meet specific capital guidelines that involve quantitative measures of its assets, liabilities and certain off-balance sheet items as calculated under regulatory accounting practices.
notes to consolidated financial statements each u.s. depository institution subsidiary of the firm must be well-capitalized in order for the firm to continue to qualify as an fhc and to continue to engage in the broadest range of financial activities permitted for financial holding companies. under regulatory capital requirements adopted by the u.s. federal banking agencies, u.s. depository institutions must maintain certain minimum capital ratios in order to be considered well-capitalized. at december 31, 2017 and december 31, 2016, the firms u.s. bank subsidiaries maintained capital at levels sufficiently in excess of the universally mandated well-capitalized requirements to address any additional capital needs and requirements identified by the u.s. federal banking regulators.

the firm generally amortizes into net periodic benefit expense (income) the unrecognized net gains and losses exceeding 10% of the greater of the projected benefit obligation or the market-related value of plan assets. the u.s. qualified plan and the serep amortize the unrecognized net gains and losses over the average life expectancy of participants. the remaining plans generally amortize the unrecognized net gains and losses and prior service credit over the average remaining service period of active participants.
weighted average assumptions used to determine net periodic benefit expense (income)
expected long-term rate of return on plan assets          3.52   %          3.61   %          3.59   %

the accounting for pension and postretirement plans involves certain assumptions and estimates. the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets is an assumption that generally is expected to remain the same from one year to the next unless there is a significant change in the target asset allocation, the fees and expenses paid by the plan or market conditions. the expected long-term rate of return for the u.s. qualified plan was estimated by computing a weighted average of the underlying long-term expected returns based on the investment managers target allocations. the u.s. qualified plan is primarily invested in fixed income securities and related derivative instruments, including interest rate swap contracts. this asset allocation is expected to help protect the plans funded status and limit volatility of the firms contributions. total u.s. qualified plan investment portfolio performance is assessed by comparing actual investment performance with changes in the estimated present value of the u.s. qualified plans benefit obligation.

plan assets the u.s. qualified plans assets represent 87% of the firms total pension plan assets. the u.s. qualified plan uses a combination of active and risk-controlled fixed income investment strategies. the fixed income asset allocation consists primarily of fixed income securities and related derivative instruments designed to approximate the expected cash flows of the plans liabilities in order to help reduce plan exposure to interest rate variation and to better align assets with the obligation. the longer-duration fixed income allocation is expected to help protect the plans funded status and maintain the stability of plan contributions over the long run.
derivative instruments are permitted in the u.s. qualified plans investment portfolio only to the extent that they comply with all of the plans investment policy guidelines and are consistent with the plans risk and return objectives. in addition, any investment in derivatives must meet the following conditions:
         may be used only if derivative instruments are deemed by the investment manager to be more attractive than a similar direct investment in the underlying cash market or if the vehicle is being used to manage risk of the portfolio.
   may not be used in a speculative manner or to leverage the portfolio under any circumstances.
   may not be used as short-term trading vehicles. the investment philosophy of the u.s. qualified plan is that investment activity is undertaken for long-term investment rather than short-term trading.
                                      may be used in the management of the u.s. qualified plans portfolio only when the derivative instruments possible effects can be quantified, shown to enhance the risk-return profile of the portfolio, and reported in a meaningful and understandable manner.
as a fundamental operating principle, any restrictions on the underlying assets apply to a respective derivative product. this includes percentage allocations and credit quality. derivatives are used solely for the purpose of enhancing investment in the underlying assets and not to circumvent portfolio restrictions.
plan assets are measured at fair value using valuation techniques that are consistent with the valuation techniques applied to the firms major categories of assets and liabilities as described in notes 2 and 3. otc derivative contracts consist of investments in interest rate swaps.
other investments consist of pledged insurance annuity contracts held by non-u.s.-based plans. the pledged insurance annuity contracts are valued based on the premium reserve of the insurer for a guarantee that the insurer has given to the employee benefit plan that approximates fair value. the pledged insurance annuity contracts are categorized in level 3 of the fair value hierarchy.
commingled trust funds are privately offered funds that are regulated, supervised and subject to periodic examination by a u.s. federal or state agency and available to institutional clients. the trust must be maintained for the collective investment or reinvestment of assets contributed to it from u.s. tax-qualified employee benefit plans maintained by more than one employer or controlled group of corporations. the sponsor of the commingled trust funds values the funds based on the fair value of the underlying securities. the underlying securities of the commingled trust funds held by the u.s. qualified plan consist mainly of long-duration fixed income instruments. commingled trust funds are redeemable at nav at the measurement date or in the near future.
some non-u.s.-based plans hold foreign funds that consist of investments in fixed income funds, target cash flow funds and liquidity funds. fixed income funds invest in individual securities quoted on a recognized stock exchange or traded in a regulated market. certain fixed income funds aim to produce returns consistent with certain financial times stock exchange indexes. target cash flow funds are designed to provide a series of fixed annual cash flows achieved by investing in government bonds and derivatives. liquidity funds place a high priority on capital preservation, stable value and a high liquidity of assets. foreign funds are readily redeemable at nav.
the firm generally considers the nav of commingled trust funds and foreign funds provided by the fund manager to be the best estimate of fair value.

notes to consolidated financial statements the firms effective tax rate from continuing operations for 2017 included an intermittent net discrete tax provision of $968 million, which included approximately $1.2 billion primarily related to the remeasurement of certain net deferred tax assets as a result of the tax act, partially offset by $233 million of net discrete tax benefits primarily associated with the remeasurement of reserves and related interest due to new information regarding the status of multi-year irs tax examinations.
the tax act, enacted on december 22, 2017, significantly revised u.s. corporate income tax law by, among other things, reducing the corporate income tax rate to 21%, and implementing a modified territorial tax system that includes a one-time transition tax on deemed repatriated earnings of foreign subsidiaries; imposes a minimum tax on gilti and an alternative base erosion and anti-abuse tax (beat) on u.s. corporations that make deductible payments to non-u.s. related persons in excess of specified amounts; and broadens the tax base by partially or wholly eliminating tax deductions for certain historically deductible expenses (e.g., fdic premiums and executive compensation).
the firms effective tax rate from continuing operations for 2016 included intermittent net discrete tax benefits of $68 million. these net discrete tax benefits were primarily related to the remeasurement of reserves and related interest due to new information regarding the status of multi-year irs tax examinations, partially offset by adjustments for other tax matters.
the firms effective tax rate from continuing operations for 2015 included intermittent net discrete tax benefits of $564 million. these net discrete tax benefits were primarily associated with the repatriation of non-u.s. earnings at a cost lower than originally estimated due to an internal restructuring to simplify the firms legal entity organization in the u.k.
deferred tax assets and liabilities deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when such differences are expected to reverse.

the firm had tax credit carryforwards for which a related deferred tax asset of $114 million and $465 million was recorded at december 31, 2017 and december 31, 2016, respectively. these carryforwards are subject to annual limitations on utilization, with the earliest expiration beginning in 2037, if not utilized.
the firm believes the recognized net deferred tax assets (after valuation allowance) at december 31, 2017 are more likely than not to be realized based on expectations as to future taxable income in the jurisdictions in which it operates.
the earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries are indefinitely reinvested due to regulatory and other capital requirements in foreign jurisdictions. as a result of the tax acts one-time transition tax on the earnings of foreign subsidiaries, as of december 31, 2017 the firm expects the unrecognized deferred tax liability attributable to indefinitely reinvested earnings to be immaterial.

interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits are classified as provision for income taxes. penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits for the years mentioned above were immaterial.
tax authority examinations the firm is under continuous examination by the irs and other tax authorities in certain countries, such as japan and the u.k., and in states in which it has significant business operations, such as new york. the firm has established a liability for unrecognized tax benefits, and associated interest, if applicable (tax liabilities), that it believes is adequate in relation to the potential for additional assessments. once established, the firm adjusts such tax liabilities only when new information is available or when an event occurs necessitating a change.
the firm is currently at various levels of field examination with respect to audits by the irs, as well as new york state and new york city, for tax years 2009-2012 and 2007-2014, respectively. during the fourth quarter of 2017, the firm agreed to proposed adjustments associated with the expected closure of the field audits for tax years 2006-2008.
the firm believes that the resolution of the above tax matters will not have a material effect on the annual financial statements, although a resolution could have a material impact in the income statements and effective tax rate for any period in which such resolution occurs.
additionally, during the fourth quarter of 2017, the firm received new information relating to the expected closure of the irs field audits for tax years 2009-2012 resulting in a remeasurement and an overall net decrease in the firms recorded tax liabilities.
also, during the fourth quarter of 2017, the firm reached agreement with the irs on resolution of claims filed with the irs to contest certain items associated with tax years 1999-2005, which did not have a material impact on the annual statements or effective tax rate. furthermore, during the fourth quarter of 2017, the firm reached a conclusion with the u.k. tax authorities on certain issues through tax year 2010, the resolution of which did not have a material impact on the annual financial statements or effective tax rate.
see note 12 regarding the dutch tax authoritys challenge, in the district court in amsterdam (matters styled case number 15/3637 and case number 15/4353), of the firms entitlement to certain withholding tax credits which may impact the balance of unrecognized tax benefits.
it is reasonably possible that significant changes in the balance of unrecognized tax benefits occur within the next 12 months. at this time, however, it is not possible to reasonably estimate the expected change to the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits and the impact on the firms effective tax rate over the next 12 months.

21. segment and geographic information segment information the firm structures its segments primarily based upon the nature of the financial products and services provided to customers and its management organization. the firm provides a wide range of financial products and services to its customers in each of the business segments: institutional securities, wealth management and investment management. for a further discussion of the business segments, see note 1.
revenues and expenses directly associated with each respective business segment are included in determining its operating results. other revenues and expenses that are not directly attributable to a particular business segment are allocated based upon the firms allocation methodologies, generally based on each business segments respective net revenues, non-interest expenses or other relevant measures.
as a result of revenues and expenses from transactions with other operating segments being treated as transactions with external parties, the firm includes an intersegment eliminations category to reconcile the business segment results to the consolidated results.

the firm waives a portion of its fees in the investment management business segment from certain registered money market funds that comply with the requirements of rule 2a-7 of the investment company act of 1940.
reduction of fees due to fee waivers
for certain management fee arrangements in the investment management business segment, the firm is entitled to receive performance-based fees (also referred to as incentive fees and includes carried interest) when the return on assets under management exceeds certain benchmark returns or other performance targets. in such arrangements, performance fee revenues are accrued (or reversed) quarterly based on measuring account/fund performance to date versus the performance benchmark stated in the investment management agreement. the firms portion of net unrealized cumulative performance-based fees (for which the firm is not obligated to pay compensation) are at risk of reversing if the fund performance falls below the stated investment management agreement benchmarks. see note 12 for information regarding general partner guarantees, which include potential obligations to return performance fee distributions previously received.

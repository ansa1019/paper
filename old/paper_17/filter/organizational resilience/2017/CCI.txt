item 1a. risk factors you should carefully consider all of the risks described below, as well as the other information contained in this document, when evaluating your investment in our securities.
risks relating to our business our business depends on the demand for our communications infrastructure, driven primarily by demand for data, and we may be adversely affected by any slowdown in such demand. additionally, a reduction in the amount or change in the mix of network investment by our customers may materially and adversely affect our business (including reducing demand for tenant additions or network services).
customer demand for our communications infrastructure depends on the demand for data. the willingness of our customers to utilize our communications infrastructure, or renew or extend existing contracts on our communications infrastructure, is affected by numerous factors, including:
•   consumers' and organizations' demand for data;
•   availability or capacity of our communications infrastructure or associated land interests;
•   location of our communications infrastructure;
•   financial condition of our customers, including their profitability and availability or cost of capital;
•   willingness of our customers to maintain or increase their network investment or changes in their capital allocation strategy;
•   need for integrated networks and organizations;
•   availability and cost of spectrum for commercial use;
•   increased use of network sharing, roaming, joint development, or resale agreements by our customers;
•   mergers or consolidations by and among our customers;
•   changes in, or success of, our customers' business models;
•   governmental regulations and initiatives, including local or state restrictions on the proliferation of communications infrastructure;
•   cost of constructing communications infrastructure;
•   our market competition;
•   technological changes, including those (1) affecting the number or type of communications infrastructure needed to provide data to a given geographic area or which may otherwise serve as substitute or alternative to our communications infrastructure or (2) resulting in the obsolescence or decommissioning of certain existing wireless networks; and
•   our ability to efficiently satisfy our customers' service requirements.
a slowdown in demand for data or our communications infrastructure may negatively impact our growth or otherwise have a material adverse effect on us. if our customers or potential customers are unable to raise adequate capital to fund their business plans, as a result of disruptions in the financial and credit markets or otherwise, they may reduce their spending, which could adversely affect our anticipated growth or the demand for our communications infrastructure or network services.
the amount, timing, and mix of our customers' network investment is variable and can be significantly impacted by the various matters described in these risk factors. changes in customer network investment typically impact the demand for our communications infrastructure. as a result, changes in customer plans such as delays in the implementation of new systems, new and emerging technologies (including small cells and fiber solutions), or plans to expand coverage or capacity may reduce demand for our communications infrastructure. furthermore, the industries in which our customers operate (particularly those in the wireless industry) could experience a slowdown or slowing growth rates as a result of numerous factors, including a reduction in consumer demand (including demand for wireless connectivity) or general economic conditions. there can be no assurances that weakness or uncertainty in the economic environment will not adversely impact our customers or their industries, which may materially and adversely affect our business, including by reducing demand for our communications infrastructure or network services. in addition, a slowdown may increase competition for site rental customers or network services. such an industry slowdown or a reduction in customer network investment may materially and adversely affect our business.
a substantial portion of our revenues is derived from a small number of customers, and the loss, consolidation or financial instability of any of such customers may materially decrease revenues or reduce demand for our communications infrastructure and network services.
our four largest customers are at&t, t-mobile, verizon wireless and sprint. collectively, these four customers accounted for 83% of our 2017 site rental revenues. the loss of any one of our large customers as a result of consolidation, merger, bankruptcy, insolvency, network sharing, roaming, joint development, resale agreements by our customers or otherwise may result in (1) a material decrease in our revenues, (2) uncollectible account receivables, (3) an impairment of our deferred site rental receivables, communications infrastructure assets, intangible assets, or (4) other adverse effects to our business. we cannot guarantee that contracts with our major customers will not be terminated or that these customers will renew their contracts with us. in addition to our four largest customers, we also derive a portion of our revenues and anticipated future growth from (1) fiber solutions customers and (2) new entrants offering or contemplating offering wireless services. such customers (including those dependent on government funding) may be smaller or have less financial resources than our four largest customers, may have business models which may not be successful, or may require additional capital. see also "item 1. business-the company" and note 16 to our consolidated financial statements.
consolidation among our customers will likely result in duplicate or overlapping parts of networks, for example, where they are co-residents on a tower, which may result in the termination or non-renewal of tenant contracts and negatively impact revenues from our communications infrastructure. due to the long-term nature of tenant contracts, we expect that any termination of tenant contracts as a result of this potential consolidation would be spread over multiple years. such consolidation may result in a reduction in such customers' future network investment in the aggregate because their expansion plans may be similar. customer consolidation could decrease the demand for our communications infrastructure, which in turn may result in a reduction in our revenues or cash flows.
see note 15 to our consolidated financial statements.
the expansion or development of our business, including through acquisitions, increased product offerings or other strategic growth opportunities, may cause disruptions in our business, which may have an adverse effect on our business, operations or financial results. additionally, we may fail to realize all of the anticipated benefits of the lightower acquisition, or those benefits may take longer to realize than expected.
we seek to expand and develop our business, including through acquisitions, increased product offerings (such as small cells and fiber solutions), or other strategic growth opportunities. in the ordinary course of our business, we review, analyze and evaluate various potential transactions or other activities in which we may engage. such transactions or activities could cause disruptions in, increase risk or otherwise negatively impact our business. among other things, such transactions and activities may:
•   disrupt our business relationships with our customers, depending on the nature of or counterparty to such transactions and activities;
•   divert the time or attention of management away from other business operations, including as a result of post-transaction integration activities;
•   fail to achieve revenue or margin targets, operational synergies or other benefits contemplated;
•   increase operational risk or volatility in our business;
•   not result in the benefits management had expected to realize from such expansion and development activities, or those benefits may take longer to realize than expected;
•   impact our cost structure and result in the need to hire additional employees;
•   increase demands on current employees or result in current or prospective employees experiencing uncertainty about their future roles with us, which might adversely affect our ability to retain or attract key employees; or
•   result in the need for additional trss or contributions of certain assets to trss, which are subject to federal and state corporate income taxes.
with respect to our recent lightower acquisition (see note 4 to our consolidated financial statements), we may encounter significant difficulties in integrating lightower's business. our ability to realize the anticipated benefits of the lightower acquisition will depend, to a large extent, on our ability to integrate the lightower business into ours. the integration of an independent business into our business is a complex, costly and time-consuming process. as a result, we will be required to devote significant management attention and resources to integrate lightower's business practices and operations with ours, including a larger fiber solutions business than we currently manage. the integration process may disrupt the businesses and, if implemented ineffectively, would reduce the realization of the full expected benefits. the failure to meet the challenges involved in integrating lightower's business and to realize the anticipated benefits of the transaction could cause an interruption of, or a loss of momentum in, the activities of our company and could adversely affect our results of operations. in addition, we could encounter additional
transaction-related costs or other factors, which could delay our realization of the expected benefits of the lightower acquisition and negatively impact our business.
our fiber segment has expanded rapidly, and the fiber business model contains certain differences from our towers business model, resulting in different operational risks. if we do not successfully operate our fiber business model or identify or manage the related operational risks, such operations may produce results that are less than anticipated.
in recent years, we have allocated a significant amount of capital to our fiber business, which is a much less mature business for us than our towers business (which we have operated since 1994). our fiber segment represented 21% and 12% of our site rental revenues for the years ended december 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. the business model for our fiber operations contains certain differences from our business model for our towers operations, including certain differences relating to customer base, competition, contract terms (including requirements for service level agreements regarding network performance and maintenance), upfront capital requirements, landlord demographics, ownership of certain network assets, operational oversight requirements, government regulations, growth rates and applicable laws.
while our fiber operations have certain risks that are similar to our towers operations, they also have certain operational risks that are different from our towers business, including:
•   the use of public rights-of-way and franchise agreements;
•   use of poles and conduits owned solely by, or jointly with, third parties;
•   risks relating to overbuilding;
•   risks relating to the specific markets that we choose to operate in or plan to operate in;
•   construction management risks;
•   risks relating to wireless carriers building their own small cell networks, or customers utilizing their own or alternative fiber assets;
•   risk of failing to optimize the use of our finite supply of fiber strands;
•   the risk of failing to properly maintain or operate highly specialized hardware and software;
•   network data security risks;
•   the risk of new technologies that could enable customers to realize the same benefits with less utilization of our fiber;
•   the use of competitive local exchange carrier status, which we refer to as "clec" status.
in addition, the rate at which customers adopt or prioritize small cells and fiber solutions may be lower or slower than we anticipate or may cease to exist altogether. our fiber operations will also expose us to different safety or liability risks or hazards than our towers business as a result of numerous factors, including the location or nature of the assets involved. there may be risks and challenges associated with small cells and fiber solutions being comparatively new and emerging technologies and continuing to evolve, and there may be other risks related to small cells and fiber solutions of which we are not yet aware.
failure to timely and efficiently execute on our construction projects could adversely affect our business.
our construction projects, some of which are long-term and complex in nature, can be challenging to execute. the quality of our performance on such construction projects depends in large part upon our ability to manage (1) the associated customer relationship and (2) the project itself by timely deploying and properly managing appropriate internal and external project resources.  in connection with our construction projects, we generally bear the risk of cost over-runs, labor availability and productivity, and contractor pricing and performance. additionally, contracts with our customers for these projects typically specify delivery dates, performance criteria and penalties for our failure to perform. our failure to manage such customer relationships, project resources, and project milestones in a timely and efficient manner could have a material adverse effect on our business.
our substantial level of indebtedness could adversely affect our ability to react to changes in our business, and the terms of our debt instruments and our 6.875% convertible preferred stock limit our ability to take a number of actions that our management might otherwise believe to be in our best interests. in addition, if we fail to comply with our covenants, our debt could be accelerated.
we have a substantial amount of indebtedness (approximately $16.2 billion as of february 21, 2018). see "item 7. md&a-liquidity and capital resources" for a tabular presentation of our contractual debt maturities. as a result of our substantial indebtedness:
•   we may be more vulnerable to general adverse economic or industry conditions;
•   we are or will be required to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flows from operations to the payment of principal or interest on our debt, thereby reducing the available cash flows to fund other projects, including the discretionary investments discussed in "item 1. business" and "item 7. md&amp;a-liquidity and capital resources";
•   we may have limited flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business or in the industry;
•   we may have a competitive disadvantage relative to other companies in our industry with less debt;
•   we may be adversely impacted by changes in interest rates;
•   we may be adversely impacted by changes to credit ratings related to our debt instruments;
•   we may be required to issue equity securities or securities convertible into equity or sell some of our assets, possibly on unfavorable terms, in order to meet payment obligations;
•   we may be limited in our ability to take advantage of strategic business opportunities, including communications infrastructure development or mergers and acquisitions; and
•   we could fail to remain qualified for taxation as a reit as a result of limitations on our ability to declare and pay dividends to stockholders as a result of restrictive covenants in our debt instruments or the terms of our 6.875% mandatory convertible preferred stock, series a, par value $0.01 per share ("6.875% convertible preferred stock").
currently we have debt instruments in place that limit in certain circumstances our ability to incur additional indebtedness, pay dividends, create liens, sell assets, or engage in certain mergers and acquisitions, among other things. in addition, the credit agreement governing our senior unsecured credit facility ("2016 credit facility") contains financial maintenance covenants. our ability to comply with these covenants or to satisfy our debt obligations will depend on our future operating performance. if we violate the restrictions in our debt instruments or fail to comply with our financial maintenance covenants, we will be in default under those instruments, which in some cases would cause the maturity of a substantial portion of our long-term indebtedness to be accelerated. furthermore, if the limits on our ability to pay dividends prevent us from satisfying our reit distribution requirements, we could fail to remain qualified for taxation as a reit. if these limits do not jeopardize our qualification for taxation as a reit but nevertheless prevent us from distributing 100% of our reit taxable income, we will be subject to federal and state corporate income taxes, and potentially a nondeductible excise tax, on our undistributed taxable income. if our operating subsidiaries were to default on their debt, the trustee could seek to foreclose the collateral securing such debt, in which case we could lose the communications infrastructure and the revenues associated with such communications infrastructure. see "item 7. md&a-liquidity and capital resources-debt covenants" for a further discussion of our debt covenants.
ccic is a holding company that conducts all of its operations through its subsidiaries. accordingly, ccic's sources of cash to pay interest or principal on its outstanding indebtedness are distributions relating to its respective ownership interests in its subsidiaries from the net earnings and cash flows generated by such subsidiaries or from proceeds of debt or equity offerings. earnings and cash flows generated by ccic's subsidiaries are first applied by such subsidiaries to conduct their operations, including servicing their respective debt obligations, after which any excess cash flows generally may be paid to such holding company, in the absence of any special conditions such as a continuing event of default. however, ccic's subsidiaries are legally distinct from the holding company and, unless they guarantee such debt, have no obligation to pay amounts due on their debt or to make funds available to us for such payment.
if we fail to pay scheduled dividends on our 6.875% convertible preferred stock, in cash, common stock, or any combination of cash and common stock, we will be prohibited from paying dividends on our common stock, which may jeopardize our status as a reit.
we have a substantial amount of indebtedness. in the event we do not repay or refinance such indebtedness, we could face substantial liquidity issues and might be required to issue equity securities or securities convertible into equity securities, or sell some of our assets to meet our debt payment obligations.
we have a substantial amount of indebtedness, which, upon final maturity, we will need to refinance or repay. see "item 7. md&a-liquidity and capital resources" for a tabular presentation of our contractual debt maturities. there can be no assurances we will be able to refinance our indebtedness (1) on commercially reasonable terms, (2) on terms, including with respect to interest rates, as favorable as our current debt, or (3) at all.
economic conditions and the credit markets have historically experienced, and may continue to experience, periods of volatility, uncertainty, or weakness that could impact the availability or cost of debt financing, including any refinancing of the obligations described above or on our ability to draw the full amount of our $3.5 billion senior unsecured revolving credit facility under our 2016 credit facility ("2016 revolver"), that, as of february 21, 2018, has $3.0 billion of undrawn availability.
if we are unable to repay or refinance our debt, we cannot guarantee that we will be able to generate enough cash flows from operations or that we will be able to obtain enough capital to service our debt, fund our planned capital expenditures or pay future dividends. in such an event, we could face substantial liquidity issues and might be required to issue equity securities or securities convertible into equity securities, or sell some of our assets to meet our debt payment obligations. failure to repay or refinance
indebtedness when required could result in a default under such indebtedness. if we incur additional indebtedness, any such indebtedness could exacerbate the risks described above.
sales or issuances of a substantial number of shares of our common stock or securities convertible into shares of our common stock may adversely affect the market price of our common stock.
future sales or issuances of common stock or other equity related securities may adversely affect the market price of our common stock, including any shares of our common stock issued to finance capital expenditures, finance acquisitions or repay debt. our business strategy contemplates access to external financing to fund certain discretionary investments, which may include issuances of common stock or other equity related securities. we maintain an "at-the-market" stock offering program ("atm program") through which we may, from time to time, issue and sell shares of our common stock having an aggregate gross sales price of up to $500.0 million to or through sales agents. as of february 21, 2018, we had approximately $150 million of gross sales of common stock remaining under our atm program. from time to time, we may refresh or implement a new "at-the-market" stock offering program. see note 12 to our consolidated financial statements. as of february 21, 2018, we had approximately 407 million shares of common stock outstanding.
we have reserved 11.2 million and 17.2 million shares of common stock, respectively, for issuance in connection with awards granted under our various stock compensation plans and our 6.875% convertible preferred stock, which will automatically convert into common stock on august 1, 2020. see "item 7. md&a-liquidity and capital resources-mandatory convertible preferred stock." the dividends on our 6.875% convertible preferred stock may also be paid in cash or, subject to certain limitations, shares of common stock or any combination of cash and shares of common stock.
further, a small number of common stockholders own a significant percentage of our outstanding common stock. if any one of these common stockholders, or any group of our common stockholders, sells a large quantity of shares of our common stock, or the public market perceives that existing common stockholders might sell a large quantity of shares of our common stock, the market price of our common stock may significantly decline.
as a result of competition in our industry, we may find it more difficult to negotiate favorable rates on our new or renewing tenant contracts.
our growth is dependent on our entering into new tenant contracts (including amendments to contracts upon modification of an existing tower, fiber, or small cell installation), as well as renewing or renegotiating tenant contracts when existing tenant contracts terminate. competition in our industry may make it more difficult for us to attract new customers, maintain or increase our gross margins, or maintain or increase our market share. we face competition for site rental tenants and associated contractual rates from various sources, including (1) other independent communications infrastructure owners or operators, including those that own, operate, or manage towers, rooftops, broadcast towers, utility poles, fiber (including non-traditional competitors such as cable providers) or small cells, or (2) new alternative deployment methods for communications infrastructure.
our fiber operations may have different competitors than our towers business, including other owners of fiber, as well as new entrants into small cells and fiber solutions, some of which may have larger networks or greater financial resources than we have.
new technologies may reduce demand for our communications infrastructure or negatively impact our revenues.
improvements in the efficiency, architecture, and design of wireless networks may reduce the demand for our communications infrastructure. for example, new technologies that may promote network sharing, joint development, wireless backhaul, or resale agreements by our customers, such as signal combining technologies or network functions virtualization, may reduce the need for our communications infrastructure. in addition, other technologies, such as wifi, distributed antenna systems ("das"), femtocells, other small cells, or satellite (such as low earth orbiting) and mesh transmission systems may, in the future, serve as substitutes for, or alternatives to, leasing on communications infrastructure that might otherwise be anticipated or expected had such technologies not existed. in addition, new technologies that enhance the range, efficiency, and capacity of wireless equipment could reduce demand for our communications infrastructure. any significant reduction in demand for our communications infrastructure resulting from the new technologies may negatively impact our revenues or otherwise have a material adverse effect on us.
if we fail to retain rights to our communications infrastructure, including the land interests under our towers and the right-of-way and other agreements related to our small cells and fiber solutions, our business may be adversely affected.
the property interests, on which our communications infrastructure resides, including the land interests under our towers, consist of leasehold and sub-leasehold interests, fee interests, easements, licenses, and rights-of-way. a loss of these interests may interfere with our ability to conduct our business or generate revenues. for various reasons, we may not always have the ability
to access, analyze, or verify all information regarding titles or other issues prior to acquiring communications infrastructure. further, we may not be able to renew ground leases on commercially viable terms. our ability to retain rights to the land interests on which our towers reside depends on our ability to purchase such land, including fee interests and perpetual easements, or renegotiate or extend the terms of the leases relating to such land. approximately 10% of our towers site rental gross margin for the year ended december 31, 2017 was derived from towers where the leases for the interests under such towers had final expiration dates of less than ten years. if we are unable to retain rights to the property interests on which our communications infrastructure resides, our business may be adversely affected.
as of december 31, 2017, approximately 53% of our towers were leased or subleased or operated and managed under master leases, subleases, or other agreements with at&t, sprint, and t-mobile. we have the option to purchase these towers at the end of their respective lease terms. we have no obligation to exercise such purchase options. we may not have the required available capital to exercise our right to purchase some or all of these towers at the time these options are exercisable. even if we do have available capital, we may choose not to exercise our right to purchase these towers or some or all of the t-mobile or at&t towers for business or other reasons. in the event that we do not exercise these purchase rights, or are otherwise unable to acquire an interest that would allow us to continue to operate these towers after the applicable period, we will lose the cash flows derived from such towers, which may have a material adverse effect on our business. in the event that we decide to exercise these purchase rights, the benefits of the acquisition of these towers may not exceed the costs, which could adversely affect our business. additional information concerning these towers and the applicable purchase options as of december 31, 2017 is as follows:
•   approximately 22% of our towers are leased or subleased or operated and managed under a master prepaid lease or other related agreements with at&amp;t for a weighted-average initial term of approximately 28 years, weighted on site rental gross margin. we have the option to purchase the leased and subleased towers from at&amp;t at the end of the respective lease or sublease terms for aggregate option payments of approximately $4.2 billion, which payments, if exercised, would be due between 2032 and 2048.
•   approximately 16% of our towers are leased or subleased or operated and managed for an initial period of 32 years (through may 2037) under master leases, subleases or other agreements with sprint. we have the option to purchase in 2037 all (but not less than all) of the leased and subleased sprint towers from sprint for approximately $2.3 billion.
•   approximately 15% of our towers are leased or subleased or operated and managed under a master prepaid lease or other related agreements with t-mobile for a weighted-average initial term of approximately 28 years, weighted on site rental gross margin. we have the option to purchase the leased and subleased towers from t-mobile at the end of the respective lease or sublease terms for aggregate option payments of approximately $2.0 billion, which payments, if exercised, would be due between 2035 and 2049. in addition, through the t-mobile acquisition, there are another approximately 1% of our towers subject to a lease and sublease or other related arrangements with at&amp;t. we have the option to purchase these towers that we do not otherwise already own at the end of their respective lease terms for aggregate option payments of up to approximately $405 million, which payments, if exercised, would be due between 2018 and 2032 (less than $10 million would be due before 2025).
under master lease or master prepaid lease arrangements we have with at&t, sprint and t-mobile, certain of our subsidiaries lease or sublease, or are otherwise granted the right to manage and operate, towers from bankruptcy remote subsidiaries of such carriers. if one of these bankruptcy remote subsidiaries should become a debtor in a bankruptcy proceeding and is permitted to reject the underlying ground lease, our subsidiaries could lose their interest in the applicable sites. if our subsidiaries were to lose their interest in the applicable sites or if the applicable ground leases were to be terminated, we would lose the cash flow derived from the towers on those sites, which may have a material adverse effect on our business. we have similar bankruptcy risks with respect to sites that we operate under management agreements.
for our small cells and fiber solutions, we must maintain rights-of-way, franchise, pole attachment, conduit use and other agreements to operate our assets. for various reasons, we may not always have the ability to maintain these agreements or obtain future agreements to construct, maintain and operate our fiber assets. access to rights-of-way depends in large part on our clec status, and we cannot be certain that jurisdictions will (1) recognize such clec status or (2) not change their laws concerning clec access to rights-of-way. if a material portion of these agreements are terminated or are not renewed, we might be forced to abandon our assets, which may adversely impact our business. in order to operate our assets, we must also maintain fiber agreements that we have with public and private entities. there is no assurance that we will be able to renew those agreements on favorable terms, or at all. if we are unable to renew those agreements on favorable terms, we may face increased costs or reduced revenues.
additionally, in order to expand our communications infrastructure footprint to new locations, we often need to obtain new or additional rights-of-way and other agreements. our failure to obtain these agreements in a prompt and cost-effective manner may prevent us from expanding our footprint, which may be necessary to meet our contractual obligations to our customers and could adversely impact our business.
our network services business has historically experienced significant volatility in demand, which reduces the predictability of our results.
the operating results of our network services business for any particular period may vary significantly and should not necessarily be considered indicative of longer-term results for this activity. our network services business is generally driven by demand for our communications infrastructure and may be adversely impacted by various factors, including:
•   the timing, mix and amount of customer network investments;
•   the rate and volume of customer deployment plans;
•   unforeseen delays or challenges relating to work performed;
•   economic weakness or uncertainty;
•   our market share; or
•   changes in the size, scope, or volume of work performed.
new wireless technologies may not deploy or be adopted by customers as rapidly or in the manner projected.
there can be no assurances that new wireless services or technologies will be introduced or deployed as rapidly or in the manner projected by the wireless carriers. in addition, demand or customer adoption rates for such new technologies may be lower or slower than anticipated for numerous reasons. as a result, growth opportunities or demand for our communications infrastructure arising from such technologies may not be realized at the times or to the extent anticipated.
if we fail to comply with laws or regulations which regulate our business and which may change at any time, we may be fined or even lose our right to conduct some of our business.
a variety of federal, state, local, and foreign laws and regulations apply to our business, including those discussed in "item 1. business." failure to comply with applicable requirements may lead to civil or criminal penalties, require us to assume indemnification obligations or breach contractual provisions. we cannot guarantee that existing or future laws or regulations, including federal, state, or local tax laws, will not adversely affect our business (including our reit status), increase delays or result in additional costs. we also may incur additional costs as a result of liabilities under applicable laws and regulations, such as those governing environmental and safety matters. these factors may have a material adverse effect on us.
if radio frequency emissions from wireless handsets or equipment on our communications infrastructure are demonstrated to cause negative health effects, potential future claims could adversely affect our operations, costs or revenues.
the potential connection between radio frequency emissions and certain negative health effects, including some forms of cancer, has been the subject of substantial study by the scientific community in recent years. we cannot guarantee that claims relating to radio frequency emissions will not arise in the future or that the results of such studies will not be adverse to us.
public perception of possible health risks associated with cellular or other wireless connectivity services may slow or diminish the growth of wireless companies, which may in turn slow or diminish our growth. in particular, negative public perception of, and regulations regarding, these perceived health risks may slow or diminish the market acceptance of wireless services. if a connection between radio frequency emissions and possible negative health effects were established, our operations, costs, or revenues may be materially and adversely affected. we currently do not maintain any significant insurance with respect to these matters.
certain provisions of our restated certificate of incorporation ("charter"), amended and restated by-laws ("by-laws") and operative agreements, and domestic and international competition laws may make it more difficult for a third party to acquire control of us or for us to acquire control of a third party, even if such a change in control would be beneficial to our stockholders.
we have a number of anti-takeover devices in place that will hinder takeover attempts or may reduce the market value of our common stock. our anti-takeover provisions include:
•   the authority of the board of directors to issue preferred stock without approval of the holders of our common stock;
•   a provision that the state courts or, in certain circumstances, the federal courts, in delaware shall be the sole and exclusive forum for certain actions involving us, our directors, officers, employees and stockholders.
our by-laws permit special meetings of the stockholders to be called only upon the request of our chief executive officer or a majority of the board of directors, and deny stockholders the ability to call such meetings. such provisions, as well as the provisions of section 203 of the delaware general corporation law, may impede a merger, consolidation, takeover, or other business combination or discourage a potential acquirer from making a tender offer or otherwise attempting to obtain control of us.
in addition, domestic or international competition laws may prevent or discourage us from acquiring communications infrastructure in certain geographical areas or impede a merger, consolidation, takeover, or other business combination or discourage a potential acquirer from making a tender offer or otherwise attempting to obtain control of us.
we may be vulnerable to security breaches that could adversely affect our operations, business, and reputation.
despite existing security measures, certain of our communications infrastructure may be vulnerable to damage, disruptions, or shutdowns due to unauthorized access, computer viruses, cyber-attacks, and other security breaches. an attack attempt or security breach, such as a distributed denial of service attack, could potentially result in (1) interruption or cessation of certain of our services to our customers, (2) our inability to meet expected levels of service to our customers, or (3) data transmitted over our customers' networks being compromised. we cannot guarantee that our security measures will not be circumvented, resulting in customer network failures or interruptions that could impact our customers' network availability and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or operational results. we may be required to expend significant resources to protect against or recover from such threats. we maintain an insurance policy that includes coverage over cyber-attacks and other security breaches; however, there can be no assurances that such coverage will be adequate to cover exposure for such incidents. if an actual or perceived breach of our security occurs, the market perception of the effectiveness of our security measures could be harmed, and we could lose customers. further, the perpetrators of cyber-attacks are not restricted to particular groups or persons. these attacks may be committed by our employees or external actors operating in any geography. in addition, our recent acquisitions, including the 2017 acquisitions, may alter our potential exposure to the risks described above. we are currently evaluating such risks with respect to these acquisitions. any such events could result in legal claims or penalties, disruption in operations, misappropriation of sensitive data, damage to our reputation, negative market perception, or costly response measures, which could adversely affect our business.
risks relating to our reit status future dividend payments to our stockholders will reduce the availability of our cash on hand available to fund future discretionary investments, and may result in a need to incur indebtedness or issue equity securities to fund growth opportunities.  in such event, the then current economic, credit market or equity market conditions will impact the availability or cost of such financing, which may hinder our ability to grow our per share results of operations.
during each of the first three quarters of 2017, we paid a quarterly common stock dividend of $0.95 per share, totaling approximately $1.1 billion. in october 2017, we increased our quarterly dividend, beginning in the fourth quarter of 2017, from an annual amount of $3.80 per share to an annual amount of $4.20 per share. as such, we declared a quarterly dividend of $1.05 per share in october 2017, which represented an increase of 11% from the quarterly dividend declared during each of the first three quarters of 2017. we currently expect such dividends to result in aggregate annual cash payments of at least $1.7 billion during the next 12 months. over time, we expect to increase our dividend per share generally commensurate with our realized growth in cash flows. any future dividends are subject to the approval of our board of directors. see notes 12 and 19 to our consolidated financial statements.
we operate as a reit for u.s. federal income tax purposes. to remain qualified and be taxed as a reit, we will generally be required to annually distribute at least 90% of our reit taxable income (determined without regard to the dividends paid deduction, excluding net capital gain and after the utilization of any available nols), to our stockholders. our quarterly cash common stock dividend will delay the utilization of our nols and may cause certain of the nols to expire without utilization. see also "item 7. md&a-general overview-common stock dividend" and "item 1. business-company developments, reit status and industry update-reit status."
as discussed in "item 1. md&a-business-strategy," we seek to invest our capital, including the net cash provided by our operating activities as well as external financing sources, in a manner that we believe will increase long-term stockholder value on a risk-adjusted basis. our historical discretionary investments have included the following (in no particular order): acquiring or constructing communications infrastructure; acquiring land interests under towers; improving or structurally enhancing our existing communications infrastructure; purchasing our common stock; or purchasing, repaying or redeeming our debt. external financing, including debt, equity, and equity-related issuances to fund future discretionary investments either (1) may not be available to us or (2) may not be accessible by us at terms that would result in the investment of the net proceeds raised yielding incremental growth in our per share operating results. as a result, future dividend payments may hinder our ability to grow our per share results of operations or otherwise adversely affect our ability to execute our business plan.
remaining qualified to be taxed as a reit involves highly technical and complex provisions of the code. failure to remain qualified as a reit would result in our inability to deduct dividends to stockholders when computing our taxable income, which would reduce our available cash.
while we intend to operate so that we remain qualified as a reit, given the highly complex nature of the rules governing reits, the importance of ongoing factual determinations, the possibility of future changes in our circumstances, and the potential impact of future changes to laws and regulations impacting reits, no assurance can be given that we will qualify as a reit for any particular year.
we do not expect the recently-enacted legislation commonly referred to as the tax reform act to significantly affect us, although we cannot predict with certainty how such legislation will affect us in the future. in addition, the present u.s. federal tax treatment of reits is subject to change, possibly with retroactive effect, by legislative, judicial or administrative action at any time, and any such change might adversely affect our reit status or benefits. we cannot predict the impact, if any, that such changes, if enacted, might have on our business. however, it is possible that such changes could adversely affect our business, including our reit status.
if, in any taxable year, we fail to qualify for taxation as a reit and are not entitled to relief under certain provisions of the the code, then:
although we may have federal nols available to reduce any taxable income, to the extent our federal nols have been utilized or are otherwise unavailable, any such corporate tax liability could be substantial, would reduce the amount of cash available for other purposes and might necessitate the borrowing of additional funds or the liquidation of some investments to pay any additional tax liability. accordingly, funds available for investment would be reduced.
under the code, for taxable years beginning before 2018, no more than 25% of the value of the assets of a reit may be represented by securities of one or more trss. for taxable years beginning in or after 2018, no more than 20% of the value of the assets of a reit may be represented by securities of one or more trss. these current or future limitations may affect our ability to make additional investments in non-reit qualifying operations or assets, or in any operations held through trss. the net income of our trss is not required to be distributed to us, and income that is not distributed to us generally will not be subject to the reit income distribution requirement. however, there may be limitations on our ability to accumulate earnings in our trss and the accumulation or reinvestment of significant earnings in our trss could result in adverse tax treatment. in particular, if the accumulation of cash in our trss causes the fair market value of our securities in our trss to exceed current or future limitations of the fair market value of our assets at the end of any quarter, then we may fail to remain qualified as a reit.
if we fail to pay scheduled dividends on our 6.875% convertible preferred stock, in cash, common stock, or any combination of cash and common stock, we will be prohibited from paying dividends on our common stock, which may jeopardize our status as a reit.
the terms of the 6.875% convertible preferred stock provide that, unless accumulated dividends have been paid or set aside for payment on all outstanding 6.875% convertible preferred stock for all past dividend periods, no dividends may be declared or paid on our common stock. if that were to occur, the inability to pay dividends on our common stock might jeopardize our status as a reit for u.s. federal income tax purposes. see note 12 to our consolidated financial statements.
complying with reit requirements, including the 90% distribution requirement, may limit our flexibility or cause us to forgo otherwise attractive opportunities, including certain discretionary investments and potential financing alternatives.
to remain qualified and be taxed as a reit, we are required to satisfy the 90% distribution requirement as described above. we commenced declaring regular quarterly dividends to our common stockholders beginning with the first quarter of 2014. see notes 12 and 19 to our consolidated financial statements. any such dividends, however, are subject to the determination and approval of our board of directors based on then-current and anticipated future conditions, including our earnings, net cash provided by operating activities, capital requirements, financial condition, our relative market capitalization, our existing federal nols of approximately $1.5 billion or other factors deemed relevant by our board of directors.
to the extent that we satisfy the 90% distribution requirement, but distribute less than 100% of our reit taxable income (determined without regard to the dividends paid deduction, excluding net capital gain and after the utilization of any available nols), we will be subject to federal corporate income tax on our undistributed taxable income. in addition, we will be subject to a 4% nondeductible excise tax if the actual amount that we pay out to our stockholders for a calendar year is less than a minimum amount specified under the code.
from time to time, we may generate reit taxable income greater than our cash flow as a result of differences in timing between the recognition of taxable income and the actual receipt of cash or the effect of nondeductible capital expenditures, the creation of reserves or required debt or amortization payments. if we do not have other funds available in these situations, we could be required to borrow funds on unfavorable terms, sell assets at disadvantageous prices, or distribute amounts that would otherwise be invested in future acquisitions to make distributions sufficient to enable us to pay out enough of our taxable income to satisfy the reit dividend requirement and to avoid corporate income tax and the 4% excise tax in a particular year. these alternatives could increase our costs or reduce our equity. thus, compliance with the reit requirements may hinder our ability to grow, which could adversely affect the value of our common stock. furthermore, the reit dividend requirements may increase the financing we need to fund capital expenditures, future growth, or expansion initiatives, which would increase our total leverage.
in addition to satisfying the 90% distribution requirement, to remain qualified as a reit for tax purposes, we will need to continually satisfy tests concerning, among other things, the sources of our income, the nature and diversification of our assets and the ownership of our capital stock. compliance with these tests will require us to refrain from certain activities and may hinder our ability to make certain attractive investments, including the purchase of non-qualifying assets, the expansion of non-real estate activities, or investments in the businesses to be conducted by our trss, and to that extent, limit our opportunities and our flexibility to change our business strategy. furthermore, acquisition opportunities in domestic or international markets may be adversely affected if we need or require the target company to comply with some reit requirements prior to completing any such acquisition. in addition, our conversion to a reit may result in investor pressures not to pursue growth opportunities that are not immediately accretive.
moreover, if we fail to comply with certain asset ownership tests, at the end of any calendar quarter, we must correct the failure within 30 days after the end of the calendar quarter or qualify for certain statutory relief provisions to avoid losing our reit qualification. as a result, we may be required to liquidate assets in adverse market conditions or forgo otherwise attractive investments. these actions may reduce our income and amounts available for distribution to our stockholders.
reit related ownership limitations and transfer restrictions may prevent or restrict certain transfers of our capital stock.
in order for us to continue to satisfy the requirements for reit qualification, our capital stock must be beneficially owned by 100 or more persons during at least 335 days of a taxable year of 12 months or during a proportionate part of a shorter taxable year. also, not more than 50% of the value of the outstanding shares of our capital stock may be owned, directly or indirectly, by five or fewer "individuals" (as defined in the code to include certain entities such as private foundations) during the last half of a taxable year. in order to facilitate compliance with the reit rules, our charter includes provisions that implement reit-related ownership limitations and transfer restrictions that generally prohibit any "person" (as defined in our charter) from beneficially or constructively owning, or being deemed to beneficially or constructively own by virtue of the attribution provisions of the code, more than 9.8%, by value or number of shares, whichever is more restrictive, of the outstanding shares of our common stock, or 9.8% in aggregate value of the outstanding shares of all classes and series of our capital stock, including our common stock and any shares of our 6.875% convertible preferred stock. in addition, our charter provides for certain other ownership limitations and transfer restrictions. under applicable constructive ownership rules, any shares of capital stock owned by certain affiliated owners generally would be added together for purposes of the ownership limitations. these ownership limitations and transfer restrictions could have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a transaction or a change in control of our company that might involve a premium price for our capital stock or otherwise might be in the best interest of our stockholders.

item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general overview overview we own, operate, and lease shared communications infrastructure. see "item 1. business" for a further discussion of our business, including our long-term strategy, our reit status, certain key terms of our contracts and growth trends in the demand for data. site rental revenues represented 84% of our 2017 consolidated net revenues. the vast majority of our site rental revenues is of a recurring nature and has been contracted for in a prior year.
business fundamentals and results the following are certain highlights of our business fundamentals and results:
•   we operate as a reit for u.s. federal income tax purposes (see "item 1. business-company developments, reit status and industry updates-reit status" and note 11 to our consolidated financial statements).
•   potential growth resulting from the increasing demand for data
◦   we expect wireless carriers will continue their focus on improving network quality and expanding capacity by utilizing a combination of towers and small cells. we believe our product offerings of towers and small cells provide a comprehensive solution to our wireless customers' growing communications infrastructure needs.
◦   we expect organizations will continue to increase the usage of high-bandwidth applications that will require the utilization of more fiber infrastructure and solutions such as those we provide.
◦   within our fiber segment, we are able to generate growth and returns for our stockholders by deploying our fiber for both small cells and fiber solutions customers.
◦   we expect existing and potential new customer demand for our communications infrastructure will result from (1) new technologies, (2) increased usage of mobile entertainment, mobile internet usage, and machine-to-machine applications, (3) adoption of other emerging and embedded wireless devices (including smartphones, laptops, tablets, and other devices), (4) increasing smartphone penetration, (5) wireless carrier focus on expanding both network quality and capacity, including the use of both towers and small cells, (6) the adoption of other bandwidth-intensive applications (such as cloud services and video communications) and (7) the availability of additional spectrum.
◦   tenant additions on our existing communications infrastructure are achieved at a low incremental operating cost, delivering high incremental returns.
•   substantially all of our communications infrastructure can accommodate additional tenancy, either as currently constructed or with appropriate modifications.
◦   u.s. wireless carriers continue to invest in their networks.
•   site rental revenues under long-term tenant contracts
◦   initial terms of five to 15 years for site rental revenues derived from wireless customers, with contractual escalations and multiple renewal periods at the option of the tenant of five to ten years each.
◦   initial terms that generally vary between three to 20 years for site rental revenues derived from our fiber solutions business (including from organizations with high-bandwidth and multi-location demands).
◦   weighted-average remaining term of approximately five years, exclusive of renewals at the tenants' option, currently representing approximately $22 billion of expected future cash inflows.
◦   approximately 83% of our site rental revenues were derived from at&amp;t, t-mobile, verizon wireless and sprint. see also "item 1a. risk factors" and note 16 to our consolidated financial statements.
•   majority of land interests under our towers are under long-term control
◦   approximately 90% of our towers site rental gross margin and more than 75% of our towers site rental gross margin is derived from towers that reside on land that we own or control for greater than ten and 20 years, respectively. the aforementioned amounts include towers that reside on land interests that are owned, including fee interests and perpetual easements, which represent over one-third of our towers site rental gross margin.
•   majority of our fiber assets are located on public rights-of-way
•   minimal sustaining capital expenditure requirements
◦   sustaining capital expenditures represented approximately 2% of net revenues.
•   debt portfolio with long-dated maturities extended over multiple years, with the majority of such debt having a fixed rate (see "item 7a. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk" for a further discussion of our debt)
◦   after giving effect to our january 2018 issuance of $750.0 million aggregate principal amount of 3.150% senior unsecured notes due july 2023 ("3.150% senior notes") and $1.0 billion aggregate principal amount of 3.800%
senior unsecured notes due february 2028 ("3.800% senior notes") (collectively, "january 2018 senior notes") and the application of the net proceeds therefrom, 82% of our debt has fixed rate coupons.
◦   our debt service coverage and leverage ratios were comfortably within their respective financial maintenance covenants. see "item 7. md&amp;a-liquidity and capital resources-debt covenants" for a further discussion of our debt covenants.
◦   during 2017, we completed several debt transactions in connection with our 2017 acquisitions and to refinance and extend the maturities of certain of our debt. as of december 31, 2017, after giving effect to our january 2018 senior notes offering and application of the net proceeds therefrom, our outstanding debt has a weighted average interest rate of 3.8% and weighted average maturity of greater than six years (assuming anticipated repayment dates where applicable). see "item 7. md&amp;a-liquidity and capital resources-financing activities" for further discussion of our debt transactions.
◦   net cash provided by operating activities was $2.0 billion.
◦   in addition to the positive impact of contractual escalators, we expect to grow our core business of providing access to our communications infrastructure as a result of future anticipated additional demand for our communications infrastructure.
•   returning cash flows provided by operations to stockholders in the form of dividends (see also "item 1. business-strategy")
◦   during 2017, we paid common stock dividends totaling approximately $1.5 billion. see "item 7. md&amp;a-general overview-common stock dividend" for a discussion of the increase to our quarterly dividend in the fourth quarter of 2017.
•   during 2017, we issued shares of our common stock and 6.875% convertible preferred stock in connection with our 2017 acquisitions (see "item 7. md&amp;a-liquidity and capital resources-financing activities" for further discussion).
•   investing capital efficiently to grow long-term dividends per share (see also "item 1. business")
◦   discretionary capital expenditures of $1.1 billion, including communications infrastructure improvements in order to support additional site rentals, construction of communications infrastructure and land purchases.
◦   see below and note 4 to our consolidated financial statements for a discussion of our 2017 acquisitions.
•   as a result of our 2017 acquisitions of fiber assets (as further described in note 4 to our consolidated financial statements), we changed the name of our "small cells" operating segment to "fiber." we changed the name of this segment to reflect our strategy of utilizing the same fiber assets to provide both small cells and fiber solutions to our customers. the name change did not impact the composition or the previously-reported operating results of the fiber segment. as such, our operating segments are now referred to as "towers" and "fiber."
common stock dividend in aggregate, we paid approximately $1.5 billion in common stock dividends in 2017. during each of the first three quarters of 2017, we paid a quarterly common stock dividend of $0.95 per share, totaling approximately $1.1 billion. in october 2017, we increased our quarterly dividend, beginning in the fourth quarter of 2017, from a quarterly amount of $0.95 per share to a quarterly amount of $1.05 per share. as such, we declared a quarterly dividend of $1.05 per share, or an annualized amount of $4.20 per share, in october 2017, which represented an increase of 11% from the quarterly dividend declared during each of the first three quarters of 2017. we currently expect such dividends to result in aggregate annual cash payments of at least $1.7 billion during the next 12 months, or an annualized amount of $4.20 per share. over time, we expect to increase our dividend per share generally commensurate with our realized growth in cash flows. any future dividends are subject to the approval of our board of directors. see notes 12 and 19 to our consolidated financial statements.
fibernet acquisition on november 1, 2016, we entered into a definitive agreement to acquire fpl fibernet holdings, llc and certain other subsidiaries of nextera energy, inc. (collectively, "fibernet") for approximately $1.5 billion in cash, subject to certain limited adjustments. fibernet is a fiber services provider in florida and texas that owns or has rights to approximately 11,500 route miles of fiber installed and under construction, inclusive of approximately 6,000 route miles in top metro markets. on january 17, 2017, we closed the fibernet acquisition, which was financed using proceeds from our november 2016 common stock offering and borrowings under the 2016 revolver. see notes 4, 8 and 12 to our consolidated financial statements.
wilcon acquisition on april 17, 2017, we entered into a definitive agreement to acquire wilcon holdings llc ("wilcon") from pamlico holdings and other unit holders of wilcon for approximately $600 million in cash, subject to certain limited adjustments ("wilcon acquisition"). wilcon is a fiber services provider that owns approximately 1,900 route miles of fiber, primarily in los angeles
and san diego. on june 26, 2017, we closed the wilcon acquisition, which was financed using proceeds from the may 2017 common stock offering and the 4.750% senior notes (as defined in note 8 to our consolidated financial statements) offering. see notes 4, 8 and 12 to our consolidated financial statements.
lightower acquisition on july 18, 2017, we entered into a definitive agreement to acquire lts group holdings llc ("lightower") for approximately $7.1 billion in cash, subject to certain limited adjustments. lightower owns or has rights to approximately 32,000 route miles of fiber located primarily in top metro markets in the northeast, including boston, new york and philadelphia. on november 1, 2017, we closed the lightower acquisition, which was financed using (1) cash on hand, including the proceeds from the july 2017 equity offerings (as defined in note 12 to our consolidated financial statements) and august 2017 senior notes (as defined in note 8 to our consolidated financial statements) offering, and (2) borrowings under the 2016 revolver. see notes 4, 8 and 12 to our consolidated financial statements.
outlook highlights the following are certain highlights of our 2018 outlook that impact our business fundamentals described above.
•   we expect that our full year 2018 site rental revenue growth will be impacted by (1) the 2017 acquisitions (see note 4 to our consolidated financial statements) and (2) a healthy environment for tenant additions, as large wireless carriers and fiber solutions customers attempt to meet the increasing demand for data. see note 15 to our consolidated financial statements.
•   we expect discretionary capital expenditures for 2018 to exceed 2017 levels with a continued increase in the construction of new small cells and fiber as a result of the anticipated returns on such discretionary investments. we also expect sustaining capital expenditures of approximately 2% of net revenues for full year 2018.
results of operations the following discussion of our results of operations should be read in conjunction with "item 1. business," "item 7. md&a-liquidity and capital resources" and our consolidated financial statements.
the following discussion of our results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the u.s. ("gaap") which require us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts (see "item 7. md&a-accounting and reporting matters-critical accounting policies and estimates" and note 2 to our consolidated financial statements).
our operating segments consist of (1) towers and (2) fiber. see note 16 to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion of our operating segments.
see "item 7. md&a-accounting and reporting matters-non-gaap and segment financial measures" for a discussion of our use of (1) segment site rental gross margin, (2) segment network services and other gross margin, (3) segment operating profit, including their respective definitions and (4) adjusted ebitda, including its definition, and a reconciliation to net income.

total site rental revenues for 2017 grew $435.9 million, or 13%, from 2016. this increase was predominately comprised of the factors depicted in the chart below:
(a)   includes amortization of upfront payments received from long-term tenant contracts and other deferred credits (commonly referred to as prepaid rent).
(b)   represents initial contribution of acquisitions and tower builds until the one-year anniversary of the acquisition or build.
towers site rental revenues for 2017 were approximately $2.9 billion and increased by $68.8 million, or 2%, from approximately $2.8 billion during 2016. the increase in towers site rental revenues was impacted by the following items, inclusive of straight-line accounting: tenant additions across our entire portfolio, renewals or extensions of tenant contracts, escalations, and non-renewals of tenants contracts. tenant additions were influenced by our customers' ongoing efforts to improve network quality and capacity.
fiber site rental revenues for 2017 were $769.6 million and increased by $367.0 million, or 91%, from $402.6 million from 2016. the increase in fiber site rental revenues was predominately impacted by (1) $144.6 million from the fibernet acquisition in january 2017, (2) $26.3 million from the wilcon acquisition in june 2017, (3) $140.3 million from the lightower acquisition in november 2017 and (4) the increased demand for small cells and fiber solutions. increased demand for small cells and fiber solutions was influenced by our customers' growing adoption of small cells and fiber solutions as an important component of their network strategy in an effort to provide capacity, relieve network congestion and meet the increasing demand for data.
towers network services and other gross margin was $262.4 million for 2017 and increased by $3.3 million, or 1%, from $259.1 million in 2016, which is a reflection of (1) the volume of activity from carrier network enhancements and (2) the volume and mix of network services and other work. our network services and other offerings are of a variable nature as these revenues are not under long-term contracts.
general and administrative expenses for 2017 were $426.7 million and increased by $55.7 million, or 15%, from $371.0 million during 2016. the increase in general and administrative expenses was primarily related to the growth in our fiber business, including the 2017 acquisitions.
towers operating profit for 2017 increased by $66.8 million, or 3%, from 2016. towers operating profit was primarily reflecting the growth in our towers site rental revenues and relatively fixed costs to operate our towers.
fiber operating profit for 2017 increased by $211.9 million, or 99%, from 2016. fiber operating profit was positively impacted by the previously-mentioned 2017 acquisitions and the increased demand for small cells and fiber solutions as described above.
depreciation, amortization and accretion was approximately $1.2 billion for the 2017 and increased by $133.9 million, or 12%, from approximately $1.1 billion during 2016. this increase predominately resulted from a corresponding increase in our gross property and equipment due to capital expenditures and acquisitions, including the 2017 acquisitions as discussed above.
interest expense and amortization of deferred financing costs were $590.7 million for 2017 and increased by $75.7 million, or 15%, from $515.0 million during 2016. the increase predominately resulted from a corresponding increase in our outstanding indebtedness due to the financing of our 2017 acquisitions. see notes 4 and 8 to our consolidated financial statements.
as a result of repaying certain of our debt, in conjunction with our refinancing activities, we incurred losses of $3.5 million and $52.3 million during 2017 and 2016, respectively. for a further discussion of the debt refinancings, see note 8 to our consolidated financial statements, "item 7. md&a-liquidity and capital resources" and "item 7a. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk."
the provision for income taxes for 2017 and 2016 were $26.0 million and $16.9 million, respectively. for both 2017 and 2016, the effective tax rate differs from the federal statutory rate predominately due to (1) our reit status, including the dividends paid deduction and (2) a non-cash tax provision of $14.6 million as a result of the enactment of the tax reform act. see "item 1. business--company developments, reit status and industry update-reit status," "item 7. md&a-accounting and reporting matters-critical accounting policies and estimates" and note 11 to our consolidated financial statements.
net income (loss) attributable to ccic stockholders was income of $444.6 million during 2017 compared to income of $357.0 million during 2016. the increase was predominately related to net growth in both our towers and fiber segments as well as a decrease in the losses on retirement of long-term obligations, partially offset by an increase in expenses, including (1) interest expense and amortization of deferred financing costs, (2) depreciation, amortization and accretion and (3) general and administrative expenses.
adjusted ebitda increased $254.2 million, or 11%, from 2016 to 2017, reflecting the growth in our site rental activities in both towers and fiber, including the 2017 acquisitions as discussed above.
total site rental revenues for 2016 grew $214.9 million, or 7%, from 2015. this increase was predominately comprised of the factors depicted in the chart below:
(a)   includes amortization of upfront payments received from long-term tenant contracts and other deferred credits (commonly referred to as prepaid rent).
(b)   represents initial contribution of acquisitions and tower builds until the one-year anniversary of the acquisition or build.
towers site rental revenues for 2016 were approximately $2.8 billion and increased by $96.7 million, or 4%, from approximately $2.7 billion during 2015. the increase in towers site rental revenues was impacted by the following items, inclusive of straight-line accounting: tenant additions across our entire portfolio, renewals or extensions of tenant contracts, acquisitions (including the tdc acquisition (as defined in note 4 to our consolidated financial statements) in april 2016), escalations and non-renewals of tenant contracts predominately arising from our customers' decommissioning of the acquired networks. tenant additions were influenced by our customers' ongoing efforts to improve network quality and capacity.
fiber site rental revenues for 2016 were $402.6 million and increased by $118.2 million, or 42%, from $284.4 million in 2015. the increase in fiber site rental revenues was predominately impacted by (1) the sunesys acquisition completed in august 2015 and (2) the increased demand for newly-constructed small cells. increased demand for small cells was influenced by our customers' growing adoption of small cells as an important component of their network strategy to provide capacity and relieve network congestion.
towers network services and other gross margin was $259.1 million for 2016 and decreased by $23.5 million, or 8%, from $282.6 million in 2015, which is a reflection of (1) the volume of activity from carrier network enhancements and (2) the volume and mix of network services and other work. our network services and other offerings are of a variable nature as these revenues are not under long-term contracts.
general and administrative expenses for 2016 were $371.0 million and increased by $60.1 million, or 19%, from 2015. general and administrative expenses are inclusive of stock-based compensation charges, which increased $29.4 million from 2015 to 2016. the increase in general and administrative expenses was primarily related to the growth in our fiber business, including the sunesys acquisition.
towers operating profit for 2016 increased by $59.1 million, or 3%, from 2015. towers operating profit was primarily reflecting the growth in our towers site rental revenues and relatively fixed costs to operate our towers.
fiber operating profit for 2016 increased by $64.4 million, or 43%, from 2015 and was positively impacted by the previously-mentioned sunesys acquisition and the leasing of newly constructed small cells.
depreciation, amortization and accretion was approximately $1.1 billion for 2016 and increased by $72.4 million, or 7%, from approximately $1.0 billion during 2015. this increase predominately resulted from a corresponding increase in our gross property and equipment due to capital expenditures and acquisitions, including the sunesys acquisition.
interest expense and amortization of deferred financing costs were $515.0 million for 2016 and decreased by $12.1 million, or 2%, from $527.1 million during 2015. this decrease is predominately the result of a $18.7 million decrease in the amortization of interest rate swaps.
as a result of repaying and redeeming certain of our debt, in conjunction with our refinancing activities, we incurred net losses of $52.3 million and $4.2 million for 2016 and 2015, respectively. for a further discussion of the debt refinancings, see note 8 to our consolidated financial statements, "item 7. md&a-liquidity and capital resources" and "item 7a. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk."
other income (expense) for 2016 was income of $8.8 million, compared to income of $57.0 million for 2015. this change was predominately a result of gains recorded during 2015 on foreign currency swaps that we entered into to manage and reduce our foreign currency risk related to our may 2015 sale of ccal. see note 9 to our consolidated financial statements.
the benefit (provision) for income taxes for 2016 was a provision of $16.9 million compared to a benefit of $51.5 million for 2015. for 2016, the effective tax rate differed from the federal statutory rate predominately due to our reit status, including the dividends paid deduction. for 2015, the effective tax rate differed from the federal statutory rate predominately due to (1) our reit status, including the dividends paid deduction, and (2) the de-recognition of net deferred tax liabilities related to the inclusion of small cells in the reit in january 2016, which resulted in a non-cash income tax benefit of $33.8 million. see "item 7. md&a-accounting and reporting matters-critical accounting policies and estimates" and note 11 to our consolidated financial statements.
income from discontinued operations, net of tax, decreased from 2015 to 2016 due to the sale of ccal occurring mid-period on may 28, 2015. in addition, during 2015, we recorded a gain on the sale of discontinued operations, net of tax, of approximately $1.0 billion.
net income (loss) attributable to ccic stockholders for 2016 was income of $357.0 million compared to income of approximately $1.5 billion for 2015. the decrease in net income was predominately due to the gain recorded on the sale of ccal of approximately $1.0 billion.
adjusted ebitda increased by $108.3 million, or 5%, from 2015 to 2016. adjusted ebitda was (1) positively impacted by the growth in our site rental activities in both towers and fiber and (2) negatively impacted by a decrease in towers network services and other gross margin.
liquidity and capital resources overview general. our core business generates revenues under long-term contracts (see "item 1. business-overview" and "item 7. md&a-general overview-overview") from the largest u.s. wireless carriers and fiber solutions customers. our strategy is to create long-term stockholder value via a combination of (1) growing cash flows generated from our portfolio of communications infrastructure, (2) returning a meaningful portion of our cash provided by operating activities to our stockholders in the form of dividends and (3) investing capital efficiently to grow cash flows and long-term dividends per share. we measure our efforts to create "long-term stockholder value" by the combined payment of dividends to stockholders and growth in our per share results. see "item 1. business-strategy" for a further discussion of our strategy.
we have engaged and expect to continue to engage in discretionary investments that we believe will maximize long-term stockholder value. our historical discretionary investments include (in no particular order): acquiring or constructing communications infrastructure, acquiring land interests under towers, improving and structurally enhancing our existing communications infrastructure, purchasing our common stock, and purchasing, repaying or redeeming our debt. we have recently spent and expect to continue to spend a significant percentage of our discretionary investments on the construction of new small cells and fiber. we seek to fund our discretionary investments with both net cash provided by operating activities and cash available
from financing capacity, such as the use of our undrawn availability from the 2016 revolver, debt financings and issuances of equity or equity related securities, including under our atm program.
we seek to maintain a capital structure that we believe drives long-term stockholder value and optimizes our weighted-average cost of capital.  we target a leverage ratio of approximately four to five times adjusted ebitda and interest coverage of approximately three times adjusted ebitda, subject to various factors such as the availability and cost of capital and the potential long-term return on our discretionary investments. we may choose to increase or decrease our leverage or coverage from these targets for various periods of time.
we operate as a reit for u.s. federal income tax purposes. we expect to continue to pay minimal cash income taxes as a result of our reit status and our nols. see "item 1. business-company developments, reit status and industry update-reit status," "item 7. md&a-general overview" and note 11 to our consolidated financial statements.
liquidity position. the following is a summary of our capitalization and liquidity position as of december 31, 2017, after giving effect to the january 2018 senior notes offering and the application of proceeds therefrom. see "item 7a. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk" and notes 8 and 19 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding our debt.

(a)   exclusive of restricted cash.
(b)   availability at any point in time is subject to certain restrictions based on the maintenance of financial covenants contained in the 2016 credit facility.
see "item 7. md&a-liquidity and capital resources-financing activities" and "item 7. md&a-liquidity and capital resources-debt covenants."
•   our liquidity sources may include (1) cash on hand, (2) net cash provided by operating activities, (3) undrawn availability from our 2016 revolver and (4) issuances of equity pursuant to our atm program. our liquidity uses over the next 12 months are expected to include (1) debt service obligations of approximately $116.0 million (principal payments), (2) common stock dividend payments expected to be at least $4.20 per share, or an aggregate of at least $1.7 billion, subject to future approval by our board of directors (see "item 7. md&amp;a-general overview-common stock dividend"), (3) 6.875% convertible preferred stock dividend payments of approximately $113 million and (4) capital expenditures (expected to be greater than current levels). during the next 12 months, while our liquidity uses are expected to exceed our net cash provided by our operating activities, we expect that our liquidity sources described above should be sufficient to cover our expected uses. as ccic is a holding company, this cash flow from operations is generated by our operating subsidiaries.
•   we have no scheduled contractual debt maturities other than principal payments on amortizing debt. see "item 7a. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk" for a tabular presentation of our debt maturities as of december 31, 2017 and a discussion of anticipated repayment dates.

operating activities. the increase in net cash provided by operating activities for 2017 from 2016 was due primarily to growth in our core business, including a net benefit from changes in working capital. the decrease in net cash provided by operating activities for 2016 from 2015 was due primarily to a net decrease in working capital, partially offset by growth in our core business. changes in working capital (including changes in accounts receivable, deferred site rental receivables, deferred rental revenues, prepaid ground leases, restricted cash and accrued interest) can have a significant impact on net cash provided by operating activities, largely due to the timing of advanced payments by us and advanced receipts. we expect to grow our net cash provided by operating activities in the future (exclusive of movements in working capital) if we realize expected growth in our core business.
investing activities. historically, our capital expenditures have been categorized as discretionary or sustaining, as described below.
•   discretionary capital expenditures are those capital expenditures made with respect to activities which we believe exhibit sufficient potential to enhance long-term stockholder value. they consist of expansion or development of existing communications infrastructure, construction of new communications infrastructure, and, to a lesser extent, purchases of land assets under towers as we seek to manage our interests in the land beneath our towers. the expansion or development of existing communications infrastructure to accommodate tenant additions typically vary based on, among other factors: (1) the type of communications infrastructure, (2) the scope, volume, and mix of work performed on the communications infrastructure, (3) existing capacity prior to installation or (4) changes in structural engineering regulations and standards. construction of new communications infrastructure is predominately comprised of the construction of small cells and fiber. our decisions regarding discretionary capital expenditures are influenced by the availability and cost of capital and expected returns on alternative uses of cash, such as payments of dividends and investments.
•   sustaining capital expenditures consist of (1) corporate capital expenditures and (2) capital improvements on our communications infrastructure assets that enable our customers' ongoing quiet enjoyment of the communications infrastructure.
we anticipate incurring initial capital expenditures related to integrating lightower into our existing business. we anticipate that the majority of these expected capital expenditures will be incurred beginning in 2018 and will primarily relate to the integration of lightower's information technology assets into our business. integration capital expenditures were $3.6 million and $0.1 million for the years ended december 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. as such, for periods presented prior to 2018, integration capital expenditures were included within sustaining capital expenditures. for periods presented beginning january 1, 2018, we will no longer reflect integration capital expenditures within sustaining capital expenditures and will consider integration capital expenditures as its own component of our capital expenditures.
we define integration capital expenditures as those capital expenditures made specifically with respect to recent acquisitions that are essential to integrating acquired companies into our business.
a summary of our capital expenditures for the last three years is as follows (in thousands of dollars):
capital expenditures increased from 2016 to 2017 and were impacted by the construction of small cells and fiber (including certain construction projects that may take 12 to 24 months to complete) to address our customers' growing demand for data partially offset by lower amounts of improvements to existing towers and lower sustaining capital expenditures in 2017 due to expansion of office facilities in 2016. our sustaining capital expenditures have historically been less than 2% of net revenues annually and were approximately 2% of net revenues in 2017. see "item 7. md&a-general overview-outlook highlights" for a discussion of our expectations surrounding 2018 capital expenditures.
sale of ccal. see note 3 to our consolidated financial statements for a discussion of our sale of ccal in may 2015.
foreign currency swaps. during may 2015, in conjunction with our sale of ccal, we entered into foreign currency swaps to manage and reduce our foreign currency risk associated with the sale of ccal. see note 9 to our consolidated financial statements.
acquisitions.  recent acquisitions consist of the acquisition of businesses such as towers and fiber. see notes 4 and 6 to our consolidated financial statements for a discussion of our acquisitions during the years ended december 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015.
we seek to allocate cash generated by our operations in a manner that will enhance long-term stockholder value, which may include various financing activities, such as (in no particular order) paying dividends on our common stock (currently expected to total at least $4.20 per share over the next 12 months, or an aggregate of approximately $1.7 billion, subject to future approval by our board of directors), paying dividends on our 6.875% convertible preferred stock (expected to total approximately $113 million over the next 12 months), purchasing our common stock, or purchasing, repaying, or redeeming our debt. see notes 8 and 12 to our consolidated financial statements.
see "item 7. md&a-liquidity and capital resources-overview" and note 8 to our consolidated financial statements.

incurrences, purchases and repayments of debt. see notes 8 and 19 to our consolidated financial statements for a discussion of our recent issuances, purchases and repayments of debt. our debt issuances extended the maturities of our debt portfolio, provided funding for our acquisitions and our repayment of previously existing debt, and lowered our cost of debt. see "item 7. md&a-liquidity and capital resources-overview-liquidity position." certain of our communications infrastructure is held in subsidiaries whose equity interests have been pledged, directly or indirectly, along with other collateral to secure such indebtedness. see notes 8 and 19 to our consolidated financial statements.
common stock. as of december 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, we had 406.3 million, 360.5 million, and 333.8 million common shares outstanding, respectively.
in may 2017, we completed the may 2017 common stock offering. we utilized the net proceeds from the offering to partially fund the wilcon acquisition. in july 2017, we completed the july 2017 common stock offering. we utilized the net proceeds from the offering to partially fund the lightower acquisition.
in november 2016, we completed the november 2016 common stock offering. we utilized the net proceeds from the offering to partially fund the fibernet acquisition in january 2017.
during the year ended december 31, 2017, we paid an aggregate of $1.5 billion in dividends on our common stock. see "item 1a. risk factors" for a descriptions of our limitations by our debt instruments and our 6.875% mandatory preferred stock on our ability to pay dividends on our common stock. see also "mandatory convertible preferred stock,"  "item 1. business-strategy" and note 12 to our consolidated financial statements.
atm program. we maintain an atm program through which we may, from time to time, issue and sell shares of our common stock having an aggregate cumulative gross sales price of up to $500.0 million to or through sales agents. sales, if any, under the atm program may be made by means of ordinary brokers' transactions on the nyse or otherwise at market prices prevailing at the time of sale, at prices related to prevailing market prices or, subject to our specific instructions, at negotiated prices. we intend to use the net proceeds from any sales under the atm program for general corporate purposes, which may include the funding of future acquisitions or investments and the repayment or repurchase of any outstanding indebtedness. during the year ended december 31, 2017, 0.2 million shares of our common stock were sold under the atm program, generating net proceeds of $22.0 million after giving effect to sales commissions of $0.2 million. during the year ended december 31, 2016, 3.8 million shares of our common stock were sold under the atm program generating net proceeds of $323.8 million, which we used, in part, to fund the tdc acquisition.
as of february 21, 2018, we had approximately $150 million of gross sales of common stock availability remaining on our atm program. see note 12 to our consolidated financial statements.
mandatory convertible preferred stock. in july 2017, we issued 1.65 million shares of 6.875% convertible preferred stock and utilized the proceeds to partially fund the lightower acquisition. unless converted earlier, each outstanding share of the 6.875% convertible preferred stock will automatically convert on august 1, 2020 into between 8.6806 and 10.4167 shares of our common stock, depending on the applicable market value of the common stock and subject to certain anti-dilution adjustments. at any time prior to august 1, 2020, holders of the 6.875% convertible preferred stock may elect to convert all or a portion of their shares into our common stock at the minimum conversion rate of 8.6806, subject to certain anti-dilution adjustments during october and november 2016, our approximately 9.8 million shares of 4.50% convertible preferred stock converted to approximately 11.6 million shares of our common stock at a conversion rate (based on the applicable market value of the common stock and subject to certain anti-dilutive adjustments) of 1.188 common shares for each share of then outstanding 4.50% convertible preferred stock.
see note 12 to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the 6.875% convertible preferred stock dividends declared and paid during 2017 and the october and november 2016 conversion of the 4.50% convertible preferred stock to common stock.
credit facility. in january 2016, we completed the 2016 credit facility, consisting of (1) a $2.5 billion 2016 revolver maturing on january 21, 2021, (2) a $1.0 billion senior unsecured 364-day revolving credit facility ("364-day facility") maturing in january 2017, and (3) a $2.0 billion senior unsecured term loan a facility ("2016 term loan a") maturing in january 2021. in february 2016, the 364-day facility was terminated. see note 8 to our consolidated financial statements.
the 2016 credit facility bears interest at a per annum rate equal to libor plus 1.125% to 2.000%, based on our senior unsecured debt rating. the proceeds of the initial borrowings under the 2016 credit facility, together with cash on hand, were used to repay all outstanding borrowings under the 2012 credit facility.
the 2016 revolver may be used for general corporate purposes, which may include the financing of capital expenditures, acquisitions and purchases of our common stock. see notes 4 and 8 to our consolidated financial statements.
in february 2017, we entered into a first amendment to the 2016 credit facility to (1) incur additional term loans in an aggregate principal amount of $500.0 million and (2) extend the maturity of both the 2016 term loan a and the 2016 revolver to january 2022. during august 2017, we entered into a second amendment to the 2016 credit facility to (1) increase the commitments under the 2016 revolver by $1.0 billion, for total commitments of $3.5 billion and (2) extend the maturity of both the 2016 term loan a and the 2016 revolver to august 2022.
as of february 21, 2018, there was approximately $3.0 billion in availability under the 2016 revolver.
restricted cash. pursuant to the indentures governing certain of our operating companies' debt securities, all rental cash receipts of the issuers of these debt instruments and their subsidiaries are restricted and held by an indenture trustee. the restricted cash in excess of required reserve balances is subsequently released to us in accordance with the terms of the indentures. see also note 2 to our consolidated financial statements.
contractual cash obligations the following table summarizes our contractual cash obligations as of december 31, 2017, after giving effect to our january 2018 senior notes offering and application of the net proceeds therefrom. these contractual cash obligations relate primarily to our outstanding borrowings or lease obligations for land interests under our towers. the debt maturities reflect contractual maturity dates and do not consider the impact of the principal payments that will commence following the anticipated repayment dates on the tower revenue notes (see footnote (b)).
(in thousands of dollars)
•   we have a legal obligation to perform certain asset retirement activities, including requirements upon lease and easement terminations to remove communications infrastructure or remediate the land upon which our communications infrastructure resides. the cash obligations disclosed in the above table, as of december 31, 2017, are exclusive of estimated undiscounted future cash outlays for asset retirement obligations of approximately $1.2 billion. as of december 31, 2017, the net present value of these asset retirement obligations was approximately $173.7 million. see note 7 to our consolidated financial statements.
•   we have the option to purchase approximately 53% of our towers that are leased or subleased or operated and managed under master leases, subleases and other agreements with at&amp;t, sprint and t-mobile at the end of their respective lease terms. we have no obligation to exercise such purchase options. see note 1 to our consolidated financial statements.
•   we have legal obligations for open purchase order commitments obtained in the ordinary course of business that have not yet been fulfilled.
(b)   the impact of principal payments that will commence following the anticipated repayment dates of our tower revenue notes are not considered. the tower revenue notes have principal amounts of $1.0 billion, $300.0 million and $700.0 million, with anticipated repayment dates in 2020, 2022 and 2025, respectively. see notes 8 and 19 to our consolidated financial statements.
(c)   if the tower revenue notes are not repaid in full by the applicable anticipated repayment dates, the applicable interest rate increases by approximately 5% per annum and monthly principal payments commence using the excess cash flow (as defined in the indenture governing the applicable tower revenue notes) of the issuers of the tower revenue notes. the tower revenue notes are presented based on their contractual maturity dates ranging from 2040 to 2045 and include the impact of an assumed 5% increase in interest rate that would occur following the anticipated repayment dates but exclude the impact of monthly principal payments that would commence using excess cash flow (as defined in the indenture governing the applicable tower revenue notes) of the issuers of the tower revenue notes. the full year 2017 excess cash flow (as defined in the indenture governing the applicable tower revenue notes) of the issuers of the tower revenue notes was approximately $599.8 million. we currently expect to refinance these notes on or prior to the respective anticipated repayment dates.
(e)   amounts relate primarily to lease obligations for the land interests on which our towers reside and are based on the assumption that payments will be made for certain renewal periods at our option up to the estimated communications infrastructure useful life of 20 years and an estimate of contingent payments based on revenues and gross margins derived from existing tenant leases. see table below summarizing remaining terms to expiration.
(f)   amounts relate primarily to access agreement obligations for rights-of-way, franchise pole attachments and other agreements to operate our fiber assets and are based on the assumption that payments will be made for certain renewal periods at our option up to the estimated communications infrastructure useful life of 20 years and an estimate of contingent payments based on revenues and gross margins derived from existing tenant contracts.
the following chart summarizes our rights to the land interests under our towers, including renewal terms at our option, as of december 31, 2017. as of december 31, 2017, the leases for land interests under our towers had an average remaining life in excess of 30 years, weighted based on towers site rental gross margin. see "item 1a. risk factors."
(a)   inclusive of fee interests and perpetual easements.
(b)   for the year ended december 31, 2017, without consideration of the term of the tenant contract.
debt covenants the credit agreement governing the 2016 credit facility contains financial maintenance covenants. we are currently in compliance with these financial maintenance covenants and, based upon our current expectations, we believe we will continue to comply with these financial maintenance covenants. in addition, certain of our debt agreements also contain restrictive covenants that place restrictions on us and may limit our ability to, among other things, incur additional debt and liens, purchase our securities, make capital expenditures, dispose of assets, undertake transactions with affiliates, make other investments, pay dividends or distribute excess cash flow. see note 8 to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion of our debt covenants. see "item 1a. risk factors." the following are ratios applicable to the financial maintenance covenants under the credit agreement governing our 2016 credit facility as of december 31, 2017.
borrower / issuer   financial maintenance covenant(a)(b)      covenant level requirement   as of december 31, 2017
(a)   failure to comply with the financial maintenance covenants would, absent a waiver, result in an event of default under the credit agreement governing our 2016 credit facility.
(c)   applicable solely to the extent that the senior unsecured debt rating by any two of s&amp;p, moody's and fitch is lower than bbb-, baa3 or bbb-, respectively. if applicable, the consolidated interest coverage ratio must be greater than or equal to 2.50.
off-balance sheet arrangements we have no off-balance sheet arrangements as defined in item 303(a)(4)(ii) of regulation s-k.
accounting and reporting matters critical accounting policies and estimates the following is a discussion of the accounting policies and estimates that we believe (1) are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations or (2) require our most difficult, subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. the critical accounting policies and estimates for 2017 are not intended to be a comprehensive list of our accounting policies and estimates. see note 2 to our consolidated financial statements for a summary of our significant accounting policies. in many cases, the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically prescribed by gaap. in other cases, management is required to exercise judgment in the application of accounting principles with respect to particular transactions.
revenue recognition. 84% of our total revenue for 2017 consists of site rental revenues, which are recognized on a monthly basis over the fixed, non-cancelable term of the relevant contract (generally ranging from five to 15 years for site rental revenues derived from wireless customers and three to 20 years for site rental revenues derived from our fiber solutions business), regardless of whether the payments from the tenant are received in equal monthly amounts. if the payment terms call for fixed escalations (as in fixed dollar or fixed percentage increases), upfront payments or rent free periods, the revenue is recognized on a straight-line basis over the fixed, non-cancelable term of the contract. when calculating our straight-line rental revenues, we consider all fixed elements of tenant contractual escalation provisions, even if such escalation provisions contain a variable element (such as an escalator tied to an inflation-based index) in addition to a minimum. to the extent we acquire below-market tenant leases for contractual interests with tenants on the acquired communications infrastructure (for example with respect to small cells and fiber), we record the fair value as deferred credits and amortize such deferred credits to site rental revenues over their estimated lease term. since we recognize revenue on a straight-line basis, a portion of the site rental revenue in a given period represents cash collected or contractually collectible in other periods. our assets related to straight-line site rental revenues are included in "other current assets" and "deferred site rental receivables." amounts billed or received prior to being earned are deferred and reflected in "deferred revenues" and "other long-term liabilities." see notes 2 and 7 to our consolidated financial statements.
as part of our effort to provide comprehensive communications infrastructure solutions, we also offer certain network services primarily relating to our towers and small cells, which represent approximately 16% of our total revenues for 2017. network services and other revenue consists of (1) site development services and (2) installation services. network services revenues are recognized after completion of the applicable service. we account for network services separately from the customer's site rental. see "item 1. business-the company" for a further discussion of our business.
accounting for acquisitions - general. as described in "item 1. business," the majority of our communications infrastructure has been acquired directly or indirectly from the four largest wireless carriers (or their predecessors) through transactions consummated since 1999. we evaluate each of our acquisitions to determine if it should be accounted for as a business combination or as an acquisition of assets. for our business combinations, we allocate the purchase price to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair value at the date of acquisition. any purchase price in excess of the net fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed is allocated to goodwill. see "item 7. md&a-accounting and reporting matters-accounting for acquisitions-valuation" below and note 2 to our consolidated financial statements.
the determination of the final purchase price allocation could extend over several quarters resulting in the use of preliminary estimates that are subject to adjustment until finalized. such changes could have a significant impact on our financial statements.
accounting for acquisitions - leases. with respect to business combinations that include towers that we lease and operate, such as the at&t, t-mobile and sprint leased and subleased towers, we evaluate such agreements to determine treatment as capital or operating leases. the evaluation of such agreements for capital or operating lease treatment includes consideration of each of the lease classification criteria under asc 840-10-25, namely (1) the transfer of ownership provisions, (2) the existence of bargain purchase options, (3) the length of the remaining lease term, and (4) the present value of the minimum lease payments. with respect to the at&t acquisition, t-mobile acquisition, and the sprint towers acquired in the global signal acquisition, we determined that the tower leases were capital leases and the underlying land leases were operating leases based upon the lease term criterion, after considering the fragmentation criteria applicable under asc 840-10-25 to leases involving both land and buildings (i.e., towers). we determined that the fragmentation criteria was met, and the tower leases could be accounted for as capital leases apart from the land leases, which are accounted for as operating leases, since (1) the fair value of the land in the aforementioned business combinations was greater than 25% of the total fair value of the leased property at inception and (2) the tower lease expirations occur beyond 75% of the estimated economic life of the tower assets.
accounting for acquisitions - valuation. as of december 31, 2017, our largest asset was property and equipment, which primarily consists of communications infrastructure, followed by goodwill and intangible assets. our identifiable intangible assets predominately relate to the site rental contracts and customer relationships intangible assets. see note 2 to our consolidated financial statements for further information regarding the nature and composition of the site rental contracts and customer relationships intangible assets.
the fair value of the vast majority of our assets and liabilities is determined by using either:
(1)   estimates of replacement costs (for tangible fixed assets such as towers) or
(2)   discounted cash flow valuation methods (for estimating identifiable intangibles such as site rental contracts and customer relationships and above-market and below-market leases).
the purchase price allocation requires subjective estimates that, if incorrectly estimated, could be material to our consolidated financial statements, including the amount of depreciation, amortization and accretion expense. the most important estimates for measurement of tangible fixed assets are (1) the cost to replace the asset with a new asset and (2) the economic useful life after giving effect to age, quality, and condition. the most important estimates for measurement of intangible assets are (1) discount rates and (2) timing and amount of cash flows including estimates regarding customer renewals and cancellations. the most important estimates for measurement of above and below-market leases is the determination of (1) favorability or unfavorability to the current market terms and (2) applicable lease term, including whether renewals or extensions should be measured. with respect to business combinations that include towers that we lease and operate, such as the t-mobile, sprint and at&t leased and subleased towers, we evaluate such agreements to determine treatment as capital or operating leases and identification of any bargain purchase options.
we record the fair value of obligations to perform certain asset retirement activities, including requirements, pursuant to our ground lease, easements, and leased facility agreements to remove communications infrastructure or remediate the space upon which our communications infrastructure resides. in determining the fair value of these asset retirement obligations we must make several subjective and highly judgmental estimates such as those related to: (1) timing of cash flows; (2) future costs; (3) discount rates; and (4) the probability of enforcement to remove the towers or small cells or remediate the land. see note 2 to our consolidated financial statements.
accounting for long-lived assets - useful lives. we are required to make subjective assessments as to the useful lives of our tangible and intangible assets for purposes of determining depreciation, amortization and accretion expense that, if incorrectly estimated, could be material to our consolidated financial statements. depreciation expense for our property and equipment is computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of our various classes of tangible assets. the substantial portion of our property and equipment represents the cost of our communications infrastructure, which is depreciated with an estimated useful life equal to the shorter of (1) 20 years or (2) the term of the lease (including optional renewals) for the land interests under the communications infrastructure.
the useful life of our intangible assets is estimated based on the period over which the intangible asset is expected to benefit us and gives consideration to the expected useful life of other assets to which the useful life may relate. we review the expected useful lives of our intangible assets on an ongoing basis and adjust if necessary. amortization expense for intangible assets is computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful life of each of the intangible assets. the useful life of the site rental contracts and customer relationships intangible assets is limited by the maximum depreciable life of the communications infrastructure (20 years), as a result of the interdependency of the communications infrastructure and site rental contracts and customer relationships. in contrast, the site rental contracts and customer relationships are estimated to provide economic benefits for several decades because of the low rate of tenant cancellations and high rate of renewals experienced to date. thus, while site rental contracts and customer relationships are valued based upon the fair value of the site rental contracts and customer relationships which includes assumptions regarding both (1) tenants' exercise of optional renewals contained in the acquired leases and (2) renewals of the acquired leases past the contractual term including exercisable options, the site rental contracts are amortized over a period not to exceed 20 years as a result of the useful life being limited by the depreciable life of the communications infrastructure.
accounting for long-lived assets - impairment evaluation. we review the carrying values of property and equipment, intangible assets, or other long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts may not be recoverable. we utilize the following dual grouping policy for purposes of determining the unit of account for testing impairment of the site rental contracts and customer relationships:
(1)   we pool site rental contracts and customer relationships intangible assets and property and equipment into portfolio groups; and
(2)   we separately pool site rental contracts and customer relationships by significant tenant or by tenant grouping for individually insignificant tenants, as appropriate.
we first pool site rental contracts and customer relationships intangible assets and property and equipment into portfolio groups for purposes of determining the unit of account for impairment testing, because we view communications infrastructure as portfolios and communications infrastructure in a given portfolio and its related tenant contracts are not largely independent of the other communications infrastructure in the portfolio. we re-evaluate the appropriateness of the pooled groups at least annually. this use of grouping is based in part on (1) our limitations regarding disposal of communications infrastructure, (2) the interdependencies of communications infrastructure portfolios, and (3) the manner in which communications infrastructure is traded in the marketplace. the vast majority of our site rental contracts and customer relationships intangible assets and property and equipment are pooled into the u.s. owned communications infrastructure group. secondly, and separately, we pool site rental contracts and customer relationships by significant tenant or by tenant grouping for individually insignificant tenants, as appropriate, for purposes of determining the unit of account for impairment testing because we associate the value ascribed to site rental contracts and customer relationships intangible assets to the underlying contracts and related customer relationships acquired.
our determination that an adverse event or change in circumstance has occurred that indicates that the carrying amounts may not be recoverable will generally involve (1) a deterioration in an asset's financial performance compared to historical results, (2) a shortfall in an asset's financial performance compared to forecasted results, or (3) changes affecting the utility and estimated future demands for the asset. when considering the utility of our assets, we consider events that would meaningfully impact (1) our communications infrastructure or (2) our customer relationships. for example, consideration would be given to events that impact (1) the structural integrity and longevity of our communications infrastructure or (2) our ability to derive benefit from our existing customer relationships, including events such as tenant's bankruptcy or insolvency or loss of a significant customer. during 2017, there were no events or circumstances that caused us to review the carrying value of our intangible assets or property and equipment due in part to our assets performing consistently with or better than our expectations.
if the sum of the estimated future cash flows (undiscounted) from an asset, or portfolio group, significant tenant or tenant group (for individually insignificant tenants), as applicable, is less than its carrying amount, an impairment loss may be recognized. if the carrying value were to exceed the undiscounted cash flows, measurement of an impairment loss would be based on the fair value of the asset, which is based on an estimate of discounted future cash flows. the most important estimates for such calculations of undiscounted cash flows are (1) the expected additions of new tenants and equipment on our communications infrastructure and (2) estimates regarding tenant cancellations and renewals of contracts. we could record impairments in the future if changes in long-term market conditions, expected future operating results or the utility of the assets results in changes for our impairment test calculations which negatively impact the fair value of our property and equipment and intangible assets, or if we changed our unit of account in the future.
approximately 3% of our total towers currently have no tenants. we continue to pay operating expenses on these towers in anticipation of obtaining tenants on these towers in the future, primarily because of the individual tower site demographics. we estimate, based on current visibility, potential tenants on approximately half of these towers. to the extent we do not believe there are long-term prospects of obtaining tenants on an individual asset and all other possible avenues for recovering the carrying value has been exhausted, including sale of the asset, we appropriately reduce the carrying value of such assets to fair value.
accounting for goodwill - impairment evaluation. we test goodwill for impairment on an annual basis, regardless of whether adverse events or changes in circumstances have occurred. the annual test begins with goodwill and all intangible assets being allocated to applicable reporting units. we then perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is "more likely than not" that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. if we conclude that it is "more likely than not" that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, we would be required to perform the two-step goodwill impairment test. otherwise, the two-step goodwill impairment test is not required. our reporting units are the same as our operating segments (towers and fiber). see note 16. we performed our most recent annual goodwill impairment test as of october 1, 2017, which resulted in no impairments. this assessment included consideration of our market capitalization, which was approximately four times the aggregate carrying amount of the reporting units as of december 31, 2017.
deferred income taxes. we operate as a reit for u.s. federal income tax purposes. our reit taxable income is generally not subject to federal and state income taxes as a result of the deduction for dividends paid and any usage of our remaining nols. accordingly, the only provision or benefit for federal income taxes for the year ended december 31, 2017 relates to trss.  furthermore, as a result of the deduction for dividends paid, some or all of our nols related to our reit may expire without utilization.  see "item 1. business-company developments, reit status and industry update-reit status" for a discussion of the impact of our reit status.
our trss will continue to be subject, as applicable, to federal and state income taxes and foreign taxes in the jurisdictions in which such assets and operations are located.  our ability to utilize our nols is dependent, in part, upon us having sufficient future earnings to utilize our nols before they expire. if market conditions change materially and we determine that we will be unable to generate sufficient taxable income in the future to utilize our nols, we would be required to record an additional valuation allowance, which would reduce our earnings. such adjustments could cause a material effect on our results of operations for the period of the adjustment. the change in our valuation allowance has no effect on our cash flows. for a further discussion of our benefit (provision) for income taxes, see "item 7. md&a-results of operations" and note 11 to our consolidated financial statements.

non-gaap and segment financial measures in addition to the non-gaap measures used herein and as discussed in note 16 to our consolidated financial statements, we also provide (1) segment site rental gross margin, (2) segment network services and other gross margin, and (3) segment operating profit, which are key measures used by management to evaluate our operating segments for purposes of making decisions about allocating capital and assessing performance. these segment measures are provided pursuant to gaap requirements related to segment reporting.
we define segment site rental gross margin as segment site rental revenues less segment site rental cost of operations, which excludes stock-based compensation expense and prepaid lease purchase price adjustments recorded in consolidated site rental cost of operations. we define segment network services and other gross margin as segment network services and other revenues less segment network services and other cost of operations, which excludes stock-based compensation expense recorded in consolidated network services and other cost of operations. we define segment operating profit as segment revenues less segment cost of operations and segment general and administrative expenses, excluding stock-based compensation (recorded in cost of operations and general and administrative expenses) and prepaid purchase price adjustments (recorded in cost of operations).
we use earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization, and accretion, as adjusted ("adjusted ebitda"), which is a non-gaap financial measure, as an indicator of consolidated financial performance. our measure of adjusted ebitda may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies, including companies in the communications infrastructure sector or other reits, and is not a measure of performance calculated in accordance with gaap. adjusted ebitda should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for operating income (loss), net income (loss), net cash provided by (used for) operating, investing and financing activities or other income statement or cash flow statement data prepared in accordance with gaap and should be considered only as a supplement to net income (loss) computed in accordance with gaap as a measure of our performance. there are material limitations to using a measure such as adjusted ebitda, including the difficulty associated with comparing results among more than one company, including our competitors, and the inability to analyze certain significant items, including depreciation and interest expense, that directly affect our net income or loss. management compensates for these limitations by considering the economic effect of the excluded expense items independently as well as in connection with their analysis of net income (loss).
we define adjusted ebitda as net income (loss) plus restructuring charges (credits), asset write-down charges, acquisition and integration costs, depreciation, amortization and accretion, amortization of prepaid lease purchase price adjustments, interest expense and amortization of deferred financing costs, (gains) losses on retirement of long-term obligations, net (gain) loss on interest rate swaps, (gains) losses on foreign currency swaps, impairment of available-for-sale securities, interest income, other (income) expense, (benefit) provision for income taxes, cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle, (income) loss from discontinued operations and stock-based compensation expense. the reconciliation of adjusted ebitda to our net income (loss) is set forth below and excludes items in our adjusted ebitda definition which are not applicable to the periods shown.
adjustments to increase (decrease) net income (loss):
amortization of prepaid lease purchase price adjustments               20,120                    21,312                    20,531
interest expense and amortization of deferred financing costs         590,682                   515,032                   527,128
(gains) losses on retirement of long-term obligations                   3,525                    52,291                     4,157
(benefit) provision for income taxes                                   26,043                    16,881                   (51,457    )
we believe adjusted ebitda is useful to investors or other interested parties in evaluating our financial performance because:
•   it is the primary measure used by our management to evaluate (1) the economic productivity of our operations and (2) for purposes of making decisions about allocating resources to, and assessing the performance of, our operations;
•   although specific definitions may vary, it is widely used by investors or other interested parties in evaluation of the communications infrastructure sector and other reits to measure financial performance without regard to items such as depreciation, amortization and accretion which can vary depending upon accounting methods and the book value of assets;
•   we believe it helps investors and other interested parties meaningfully evaluate and compare the results of our operations (1) from period to period and (2) to our competitors by removing the impact of our capital structure (primarily interest charges from our outstanding debt) and asset base (primarily depreciation, amortization and accretion) from our financial results; and
•   it is similar to the measure of current financial performance generally used in our debt covenant calculations.
our management uses adjusted ebitda:
•   as a performance goal in employee annual incentive compensation;
•   as a measurement of financial performance because it assists us in comparing our financial performance on a consistent basis as it removes the impact of our capital structure (primarily interest charges from our outstanding debt) and asset base (primarily depreciation, amortization, and accretion) from our operating results;
•   in presentations to our board of directors to enable it to have the same measurement of financial performance used by management;
•   for planning purposes, including preparation of our annual operating budget;
•   as a valuation measure in strategic analyses in connection with the purchase and sale of assets;
•   in determining self-imposed limits on our debt levels, including the evaluation of our leverage ratio and interest coverage ratio; and
•   with respect to compliance with our debt covenants, which require us to maintain certain financial ratios that incorporate concepts such as, or similar to, adjusted ebitda.

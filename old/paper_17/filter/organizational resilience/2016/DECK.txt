part ii item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation certain amounts reflected in millions in the original filing, included under the following captions, should have been reflected in thousands:
•   "results of operations - year ended march 31, 2017 compared to year ended march 31, 2016 - income taxes"
•   "results of operations - year ended march 31, 2016 compared to year ended march 31, 2015 - income taxes"
•   "critical accounting policies and estimates - valuation of goodwill, intangible and other long-lived assets"
the presentation of these amounts in millions was the result of a clerical error. the convention used throughout part ii, item 7 of the original filing, that all amounts are expressed in thousands, was intended to apply to these amounts as well.
references to these amounts in the consolidated financial statements and related notes (to the extent such numbers are included therein) in part ii, item 8 of the original filing are correct.

item 1a.   risk factors if any of the following risks actually occur, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be harmed. in that case, the trading price of our common stock could decline, and you could lose all or part of your investment.
risks related to our business if our efforts to attract and retain members are not successful, our business will be adversely affected.
we have experienced significant membership growth over the past several years. our ability to continue to attract members will depend in part on our ability to consistently provide our members with compelling content choices, as well as a quality experience for selecting and viewing tv shows and movies. furthermore, the relative service levels, content offerings, pricing and related features of competitors to our service may adversely impact our ability to attract and retain memberships. competitors include other entertainment video providers, such as mvpds, internet-based movie and tv content providers (including those that provide pirated content) and dvd rental outlets. if consumers do not perceive our service offering to be of value, including if we introduce new or adjust existing features, adjust pricing or service offerings, or change the mix of content in a manner that is not favorably received by them, we may not be able to attract and retain members. in addition, many of our members rejoin our service or originate from word-of-mouth advertising from existing members. if our efforts to satisfy our existing members are not successful, we may not be able to attract members, and as a result, our ability to maintain and/or grow our business will be adversely affected. members cancel our service for many reasons, including a perception that they do not use the service sufficiently, the need to cut household expenses, availability of content is unsatisfactory, competitive services provide a better value or experience and customer service issues are not satisfactorily resolved. we must continually add new memberships both to replace canceled memberships and to grow our business beyond our current membership base. if we do not grow as expected, given, in particular that our content costs are largely fixed in nature and contracted over several years, we may not be able to adjust our expenditures or increase our (per membership) revenues commensurate with the lowered growth rate such that our margins, liquidity and results of operation may be adversely impacted. if we are unable to successfully compete with current and new competitors in both retaining our existing memberships and attracting new memberships, our business will be adversely affected. further, if excessive numbers of members cancel our service, we may be required to incur significantly higher marketing expenditures than we currently anticipate to replace these members with new members.
changes in competitive offerings for entertainment video, including the potential rapid adoption of piracy-based video offerings, could adversely impact our business.
the market for entertainment video is intensely competitive and subject to rapid change. through new and existing distribution channels, consumers have increasing options to access entertainment video. the various economic models underlying these channels include subscription, transactional, ad-supported and piracy-based models. all of these have the potential to capture meaningful segments of the entertainment video market. piracy, in particular, threatens to damage our business, as its fundamental proposition to consumers is so compelling and difficult to compete against: virtually all content for free. furthermore, in light of the compelling consumer proposition, piracy services are subject to rapid global growth. traditional providers of entertainment video, including broadcasters and cable network operators, as well as internet based e-commerce or entertainment video providers are increasing their internet-based video offerings.  several of these competitors have long operating histories, large customer bases, strong brand recognition and significant financial, marketing and other resources. they may secure better terms from suppliers, adopt more aggressive pricing and devote more resources to product development, technology, infrastructure, content acquisitions and marketing. new entrants may enter the market or existing providers may adjust their services with unique offerings or approaches to providing entertainment video. companies also may enter into business combinations or alliances that strengthen their competitive positions. if we are unable to successfully or profitably compete with current and new competitors, our business will be adversely affected, and we may not be able to increase or maintain market share, revenues or profitability.
the long-term and fixed cost nature of our content commitments may limit our operating flexibility and could adversely affect our liquidity and results of operations.
in connection with obtaining streaming content, we typically enter into multi-year commitments with studios and other content providers, the payment terms of which are not tied to member usage or the size of our membership base ("fixed cost") but which may be tied to such factors as titles licensed and/or theatrical exhibition receipts. such commitments are included in the contractual obligations section of item 7, management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and note 5, commitments and contingencies in item 8. given the multiple-year duration and largely fixed cost nature of content commitments, if membership acquisition and retention do not meet our expectations, our margins may be
adversely impacted. payment terms for certain content commitments, such as programming that is initially available in the applicable territory on our service ("original programming"), will typically require more up-front cash payments than other licensing agreements. to the extent membership and/or revenue growth do not meet our expectations, our liquidity and results of operations could be adversely affected as a result of content commitments and accelerated payment requirements of certain agreements. in addition, the long-term and fixed cost nature of our content commitments may limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to changes in our business and the market segments in which we operate. if we license content that is not favorably received by consumers in a territory, or is unable to be shown in a territory, acquisition and retention may be adversely impacted and given the long-term and fixed cost nature of our content commitments, we may not be able to adjust our content offering quickly and our results of operation may be adversely impacted.
we are devoting more resources toward the development, production, marketing and distribution of original programming, including tv series and movies. we believe that original programming can help differentiate our service from other offerings, enhance our brand and otherwise attract and retain members. to the extent our original programming does not meet our expectations, in particular, in terms of costs, viewing and popularity, our business, including our brand and results of operations may be adversely impacted.
if we are not able to manage change and growth, our business could be adversely affected.
we are expanding our operations internationally, scaling our streaming service to effectively and reliably handle anticipated growth in both members and features related to our service, ramping up our ability to produce original content, as well as continuing to operate our dvd service within the u.s. as our international offering evolves, we are managing and adjusting our business to address varied content offerings, consumer customs and practices, in particular those dealing with e-commerce and internet video, as well as differing legal and regulatory environments. as we scale our streaming service, we are developing technology and utilizing third-party "cloud" computing services. as we ramp up our original content production, we are building out expertise in a number of disciplines, including creative, marketing, legal, finance and other resources related to the development and physical production of content. if we are not able to manage the growing complexity of our business, including improving, refining or revising our systems and operational practices related to our streaming operations and original content, our business may be adversely affected.
we could be subject to economic, political, regulatory and other risks arising from our international operations.
operating in international markets requires significant resources and management attention and will subject us to regulatory, economic and political risks that may be different from or incremental to those in the u.s. in addition to the risks that we face in the u.s., our international operations involve risks that could adversely affect our business, including:
•   the need to adapt our content and user interfaces for specific cultural and language differences, including licensing a certain portion of our content assets before we have developed a full appreciation for its performance within a given territory;
•   management distraction;
•   political or social unrest and economic instability;
•   compliance with u.s. laws such as the foreign corrupt practices act, export controls and economic sanctions, and local laws prohibiting corrupt payments to government officials;
•   difficulties in understanding and complying with local laws, regulations and customs in foreign jurisdictions;
•   regulatory requirements or government action against our service, whether in response to enforcement of actual or purported legal and regulatory requirements or otherwise, that results in disruption or non-availability of our service or particular content in the applicable jurisdiction;
•   adverse domestic or international tax consequences such as those related to repatriation of cash from foreign jurisdictions into the united states, non-income related taxes such as value-added tax or other indirect taxes, changes in tax laws or tax rates or their interpretations and the related application of judgment in determining our global provision for income taxes, deferred tax assets or liabilities or other tax liabilities given the ultimate tax determination is uncertain;
•   fluctuations in currency exchange rates, which we do not use foreign exchange contracts or derivatives to hedge against and which could impact revenues and expenses of our international operations and expose us to foreign currency exchange rate risk;
•   profit repatriation and other restrictions on the transfer of funds;
•   differing payment processing systems as well as consumer use and acceptance of electronic payment methods, such as payment cards;
•   new and different sources of competition;
•   censorship requirements that cause us to remove or edit popular content, leading to consumer disappointment or dissatisfaction with our service;
•   low usage and/or penetration of internet-connected consumer electronic devices;
•   availability of reliable broadband connectivity and wide area networks in targeted areas for expansion;
•   integration and operational challenges as well as potential unknown liabilities in connection with companies we may acquire or control; and
•   differing, and often more lenient, laws and consumer understanding/attitudes regarding the illegality of piracy.
our failure to manage any of these risks successfully could harm our international operations and our overall business, and results of our operations.
if we fail to maintain or, in newer markets establish, a positive reputation with consumers concerning our service, including the content we offer, we may not be able to attract or retain members, and our operating results may be adversely affected.
we believe that a positive reputation with consumers concerning our service is important in attracting and retaining members who have a number of choices from which to obtain entertainment video. to the extent our content, in particular, our original programming, is perceived as low quality, offensive or otherwise not compelling to consumers, our ability to establish and maintain a positive reputation may be adversely impacted. furthermore, to the extent our marketing, customer service and public relations efforts are not effective or result in negative consumer reaction, our ability to establish and maintain a positive reputation may likewise be adversely impacted. with newer markets, we also need to establish our reputation with consumers and to the extent we are not successful in creating positive impressions, our business in these new markets may be adversely impacted.
changes in how we market our service could adversely affect our marketing expenses and membership levels may be adversely affected.
we utilize a broad mix of marketing and public relations programs, including social media sites such as facebook and twitter, to promote our service to potential new members. we may limit or discontinue use or support of certain marketing sources or activities if advertising rates increase or if we become concerned that members or potential members deem certain marketing practices intrusive or damaging to our brand. if the available marketing channels are curtailed, our ability to attract new members may be adversely affected.
if companies that promote our service decide that we negatively impact their business, that they want to compete more directly with our business or enter a similar business or decide to exclusively support our competitors, we may no longer have access to such marketing channels. we also acquire a number of members who rejoin our service having previously cancelled their membership. if we are unable to maintain or replace our sources of members with similarly effective sources, or if the cost of our existing sources increases, our member levels and marketing expenses may be adversely affected we face risks, such as unforeseen costs and potential liability in connection with content we acquire, produce, license and/or distribute through our service.
as a distributor of content, we face potential liability for negligence, copyright and trademark infringement, or other claims based on the nature and content of materials that we acquire, produce, license and/or distribute. we also may face potential liability for content used in promoting our service, including marketing materials and features on our web site such as member reviews. as we expand our original programming, we have become responsible for production costs and other expenses, such as ongoing guild payments. we also take on risks associated with production, such as completion and key talent risk. negotiations or renewals related to entertainment industry collective bargaining agreements could negatively impact timing and costs associated with our productions. to the extent we do not accurately anticipate costs or mitigate risks, including for content that we obtain but ultimately does not appear on our service, or if we become liable for content we acquire, produce, license and/or distribute, our business may suffer. litigation to defend these claims could be costly and the expenses and
damages arising from any liability or unforeseen production risks could harm our results of operations. we may not be indemnified against claims or costs of these types and we may not have insurance coverage for these types of claims.
if studios, content providers or other rights holders refuse to license streaming content or other rights upon terms acceptable to us, our business could be adversely affected.
our ability to provide our members with content they can watch depends on studios, content providers and other rights holders licensing rights to distribute such content and certain related elements thereof, such as the public performance of music contained within the content we distribute. the license periods and the terms and conditions of such licenses vary. if the studios, content providers and other rights holders are not or are no longer willing or able to license us content upon terms acceptable to us, our ability to stream content to our members will be adversely affected and/or our costs could increase. many of the licenses for content provide for the studios or other content providers to withdraw content from our service relatively quickly. because of these provisions as well as other actions we may take, content available through our service can be withdrawn on short notice. as competition increases, we may see the cost of programming increase. as we seek to differentiate our service, we are increasingly focused on securing certain exclusive rights when obtaining content, including original content. we are also focused on programming an overall mix of content that delights our members in a cost efficient manner. within this context, we are selective about the titles we add and renew to our service. if we do not maintain a compelling mix of content, our membership acquisition and retention may be adversely affected.
music contained within content we distribute may require us to obtain licenses for such distribution. in this regard, we engage in negotiations with collection management organizations ("cmos") that hold certain rights to music interests in connection with streaming content into various territories. if we are unable to reach mutually acceptable terms with these organizations, we could become involved in litigation and/or could be enjoined from distributing certain content, which could adversely impact our business. additionally, pending and ongoing litigation as well as negotiations between certain cmos and other third parties in various territories could adversely impact our negotiations with cmos, or result in music publishers represented by certain cmos unilaterally withdrawing rights, and thereby adversely impact our ability to reach licensing agreements reasonably acceptable to us. failure to reach such licensing agreements could expose us to potential liability for copyright infringement or otherwise increase our costs.
we rely upon a number of partners to make our service available on their devices.
we currently offer members the ability to receive streaming content through a host of internet-connected screens, including tvs, digital video players, television set-top boxes and mobile devices. we have agreements with various cable, satellite and telecommunications operators to make our service available through the television set-top boxes of these service providers.  we intend to continue to broaden our capability to instantly stream tv shows and movies to other platforms and partners over time. if we are not successful in maintaining existing and creating new relationships, or if we encounter technological, content licensing, regulatory or other impediments to delivering our streaming content to our members via these devices, our ability to grow our business could be adversely impacted. our agreements with our device partners are typically between one and three years in duration and our business could be adversely affected if, upon expiration, a number of our partners do not continue to provide access to our service or are unwilling to do so on terms acceptable to us, which terms may include the degree of accessibility and prominence of our service. furthermore, devices are manufactured and sold by entities other than netflix and while these entities should be responsible for the devices' performance, the connection between these devices and netflix may nonetheless result in consumer dissatisfaction toward netflix and such dissatisfaction could result in claims against us or otherwise adversely impact our business. in addition, technology changes to our streaming functionality may require that partners update their devices. if partners do not update or otherwise modify their devices, our service and our members' use and enjoyment could be negatively impacted.
any significant disruption in or unauthorized access to our computer systems or those of third parties that we utilize in our operations, including those relating to cybersecurity or arising from cyber-attacks, could result in a loss or degradation of service, unauthorized disclosure of data, including member and corporate information, or theft of intellectual property, including digital content assets, which could adversely impact our business.
our reputation and ability to attract, retain and serve our members is dependent upon the reliable performance and security of our computer systems and those of third parties that we utilize in our operations. these systems may be subject to damage or interruption from earthquakes, adverse weather conditions, other natural disasters, terrorist attacks, power loss, telecommunications failures, and cybersecurity risks. interruptions in these systems, or with the internet in general, could make our service unavailable or degraded or otherwise hinder our ability to deliver streaming content or fulfill dvd selections. service interruptions, errors in our software or the unavailability of computer systems used in our operations could diminish the overall attractiveness of our membership service to existing and potential members.
our computer systems and those of third parties we use in our operations are vulnerable to cybersecurity risks, including cyber-attacks such as computer viruses, denial of service attacks, physical or electronic break-ins and similar disruptions. these systems periodically experience directed attacks intended to lead to interruptions and delays in our service and operations as well as loss, misuse or theft of data. any attempt by hackers to obtain our data (including member and corporate information) or intellectual property (including digital content assets), disrupt our service, or otherwise access our systems, or those of third parties we use, if successful, could harm our business, be expensive to remedy and damage our reputation. we have implemented certain systems and processes to thwart hackers and protect our data and systems. to date hackers have not had a material impact on our service or systems however this is no assurance that hackers may not be successful in the future. our insurance does not cover expenses related to such disruptions or unauthorized access. efforts to prevent hackers from disrupting our service or otherwise accessing our systems are expensive to implement and may limit the functionality of or otherwise negatively impact our service offering and systems. any significant disruption to our service or access to our systems could result in a loss of memberships and adversely affect our business and results of operation.
we utilize our own communications and computer hardware systems located either in our facilities or in that of a third-party web hosting provider. in addition, we utilize third-party "cloud" computing services in connection with our business operations. we also utilize our own and third-party content delivery networks to help us stream tv shows and movies in high volume to netflix members over the internet. problems faced by us or our third-party web hosting, "cloud" computing, or other network providers, including technological or business-related disruptions, as well as cybersecurity threats, could adversely impact the experience of our members.
we rely upon amazon web services to operate certain aspects of our service and any disruption of or interference with our use of the amazon web services operation would impact our operations and our business would be adversely impacted.
amazon web services ("aws") provides a distributed computing infrastructure platform for business operations, or what is commonly referred to as a "cloud" computing service. we have architected our software and computer systems so as to utilize data processing, storage capabilities and other services provided by aws. currently, we run the vast majority of our computing on aws. given this, along with the fact that we cannot easily switch our aws operations to another cloud provider, any disruption of or interference with our use of aws would impact our operations and our business would be adversely impacted. while the retail side of amazon competes with us, we do not believe that amazon will use the aws operation in such a manner as to gain competitive advantage against our service.
if the technology we use in operating our business fails, is unavailable, or does not operate to expectations, our business and results of operation could be adversely impacted.
we utilize a combination of proprietary and third party technology to operate our business. this includes the technology that we have developed to recommend and merchandise content to our consumers as well as enable fast and efficient delivery of content to our members and their various consumer electronic devices. for example, we have built and deployed our own content-delivery network ("cdn"). to the extent internet service providers ("isps") do not interconnect with our cdn, or if we experience difficulties in its operation, our ability to efficiently and effectively deliver our streaming content to our members could be adversely impacted and our business and results of operation could be adversely affected. likewise, if our recommendation and merchandising technology does not enable us to predict and recommend titles that our members will enjoy, our ability to attract and retain members may be adversely affected. we also utilize third party technology to help market our service, process payments, and otherwise manage the daily operations of our business. if our technology or that of third parties we utilize in our operations fails or otherwise operates improperly, our ability to operate our service, retain existing members and add new members may be impaired. also, any harm to our members' personal computers or other devices caused by software used in our operations could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.
if government regulations relating to the internet or other areas of our business change, we may need to alter the manner in which we conduct our business, or incur greater operating expenses.
the adoption or modification of laws or regulations relating to the internet or other areas of our business could limit or otherwise adversely affect the manner in which we currently conduct our business. in addition, the continued growth and development of the market for online commerce may lead to more stringent consumer protection laws, which may impose additional burdens on us. if we are required to comply with new regulations or legislation or new interpretations of existing regulations or legislation, this compliance could cause us to incur additional expenses or alter our business model.
changes in laws or regulations that adversely affect the growth, popularity or use of the internet, including laws impacting net neutrality, could decrease the demand for our service and increase our cost of doing business. certain laws
intended to prevent network operators from discriminating against the legal traffic that traverse their networks have been implemented in many countries, including the united states and the european union. in others, the laws may be nascent or non-existent. given uncertainty around these rules, including changing interpretations, amendments or repeal, coupled with potentially significant political and economic power of local network operators, we could experience discriminatory or anti-competitive practices that could impede our growth, cause us to incur additional expense or otherwise negatively affect our business.
changes in how network operators handle and charge for access to data that travel across their networks could adversely impact our business.
we rely upon the ability of consumers to access our service through the internet. if network operators block, restrict or otherwise impair access to our service over their networks, our service and business could be negatively affected. to the extent that network operators implement usage based pricing, including meaningful bandwidth caps, or otherwise try to monetize access to their networks by data providers, we could incur greater operating expenses and our membership acquisition and retention could be negatively impacted. furthermore, to the extent network operators create tiers of internet access service and either charge us for or prohibit us from being available through these tiers, our business could be negatively impacted.
most network operators that provide consumers with access to the internet also provide these consumers with multichannel video programming. as such, many network operators have an incentive to use their network infrastructure in a manner adverse to our continued growth and success. while we believe that consumer demand, regulatory oversight and competition will help check these incentives, to the extent that network operators are able to provide preferential treatment to their data as opposed to ours or otherwise implement discriminatory network management practices, our business could be negatively impacted. in some international markets, these same incentives apply however, the consumer demand, regulatory oversight and competition may not be as strong as in our domestic market.
privacy concerns could limit our ability to collect and leverage our membership data and disclosure of membership data could adversely impact our business and reputation.
in the ordinary course of business and in particular in connection with merchandising our service to our members, we collect and utilize data supplied by our members. we currently face certain legal obligations regarding the manner in which we treat such information. other businesses have been criticized by privacy groups and governmental bodies for attempts to link personal identities and other information to data collected on the internet regarding users' browsing and other habits. increased regulation of data utilization practices, including self-regulation or findings under existing laws that limit our ability to collect, transfer and use data, could have an adverse effect on our business. in addition, if we were to disclose data about our members in a manner that was objectionable to them, our business reputation could be adversely affected, and we could face potential legal claims that could impact our operating results. internationally, we may become subject to additional and/or more stringent legal obligations concerning our treatment of customer and other personal information, such as laws regarding data localization and/or restrictions on data export. failure to comply with these obligations could subject us to liability, and to the extent that we need to alter our business model or practices to adapt to these obligations, we could incur additional expenses.
we maintain personal data regarding our members, including names and billing data. this data is maintained on our own systems as well as that of third parties we use in our operations. with respect to billing data, such as credit card numbers, we rely on licensed encryption and authentication technology to secure such information. we take measures to protect against unauthorized intrusion into our members' data. despite these measures we, our payment processing services or other third party services we use such as aws, could experience an unauthorized intrusion into our members' data. in the event of such a breach, current and potential members may become unwilling to provide the information to us necessary for them to become members. additionally, we could face legal claims or regulatory fines or penalties for such a breach. the costs relating to any data breach could be material, and we currently do not carry insurance against the risk of a data breach. for these reasons, should an unauthorized intrusion into our members' data occur, our business could be adversely affected.
we are subject to payment processing risk.
our members pay for our service using a variety of different payment methods, including credit and debit cards, gift cards, direct debit and online wallets.  we rely on internal systems as well as those of third parties to process payment.  acceptance and processing of these payment methods are subject to certain rules and regulations and require payment of interchange and other fees.  to the extent there are disruptions in our payment processing systems, increases in payment processing fees, material changes in the payment ecosystem, such as large re-issuances of payment cards, delays in receiving payments from payment processors and/or changes to rules or regulations concerning payment processing, our revenue, operating expenses and results of operation could be adversely impacted.   in addition, from time to time, we encounter fraudulent use of payment methods, which could impact our results of operation and if not adequately controlled and managed could create negative consumer perceptions of our service.
if our trademarks and other proprietary rights are not adequately protected to prevent use or appropriation by our competitors, the value of our brand and other intangible assets may be diminished, and our business may be adversely affected.
we rely and expect to continue to rely on a combination of confidentiality and license agreements with our employees, consultants and third parties with whom we have relationships, as well as trademark, copyright, patent and trade secret protection laws, to protect our proprietary rights. we may also seek to enforce our proprietary rights through court proceedings. we have filed and we expect to file from time to time for trademark and patent applications. nevertheless, these applications may not be approved, third parties may challenge any copyrights, patents or trademarks issued to or held by us, third parties may knowingly or unknowingly infringe our intellectual property rights, and we may not be able to prevent infringement or misappropriation without substantial expense to us. if the protection of our intellectual property rights is inadequate to prevent use or misappropriation by third parties, the value of our brand and other intangible assets may be diminished, competitors may be able to more effectively mimic our service and methods of operations, the perception of our business and service to members and potential members may become confused in the marketplace, and our ability to attract members may be adversely affected.
we currently hold various domain names relating to our brand, including netflix.com. failure to protect our domain names could adversely affect our reputation and brand and make it more difficult for users to find our web site and our service. we may be unable, without significant cost or at all, to prevent third parties from acquiring domain names that are similar to, infringe upon or otherwise decrease the value of our trademarks and other proprietary rights.
intellectual property claims against us could be costly and result in the loss of significant rights related to, among other things, our web site, streaming technology, our recommendation and merchandising technology, title selection processes and marketing activities.
trademark, copyright, patent and other intellectual property rights are important to us and other companies. our intellectual property rights extend to our technology, business processes and the content on our web site. we use the intellectual property of third parties in merchandising our products and marketing our service through contractual and other rights. from time to time, third parties allege that we have violated their intellectual property rights. if we are unable to obtain sufficient rights, successfully defend our use, or develop non-infringing technology or otherwise alter our business practices on a timely basis in response to claims against us for infringement, misappropriation, misuse or other violation of third-party intellectual property rights, our business and competitive position may be adversely affected. many companies are devoting significant resources to developing patents that could potentially affect many aspects of our business. there are numerous patents that broadly claim means and methods of conducting business on the internet. we have not searched patents relative to our technology. defending ourselves against intellectual property claims, whether they are with or without merit or are determined in our favor, results in costly litigation and diversion of technical and management personnel. it also may result in our inability to use our current web site, streaming technology, our recommendation and merchandising technology or inability to market our service or merchandise our products. as a result of a dispute, we may have to develop non-infringing technology, enter into royalty or licensing agreements, adjust our merchandising or marketing activities or take other actions to resolve the claims. these actions, if required, may be costly or unavailable on terms acceptable to us.
we are engaged in legal proceedings that could cause us to incur unforeseen expenses and could occupy a significant amount of our management's time and attention.
from time to time, we are subject to litigation or claims that could negatively affect our business operations and financial position. as we have grown, we have seen a rise in the number of litigation matters against us. these matters have included patent infringements as well as consumer and securities class actions, each of which are typically expensive to defend. litigation disputes could cause us to incur unforeseen expenses, could occupy a significant amount of our management's time and attention and could negatively affect our business operations and financial position.
we may seek additional capital that may result in stockholder dilution or that may have rights senior to those of our common stockholders.
from time to time, we may seek to obtain additional capital, either through equity, equity-linked or debt securities. the decision to obtain additional capital will depend on, among other things, our business plans, operating performance and condition of the capital markets. if we raise additional funds through the issuance of equity, equity-linked or debt securities, those securities may have rights, preferences or privileges senior to the rights of our common stock, and our stockholders may experience dilution.
we have a substantial amount of indebtedness and other obligations, including streaming content obligations, which could adversely affect our financial position.
we have a substantial amount of indebtedness and other obligations, including streaming content obligations. as of december 31, 2016, we had $3.4 billion aggregate principal amount of senior notes outstanding ("notes"). as of december 31, 2016, we had approximately $6.5 billion of total content liabilities as reflected on our consolidated balance sheet. such amount does not include streaming content commitments that do not meet the criteria for liability recognition, the amounts of which are significant. for more information on our streaming content obligations, including those not on our consolidated balance sheet, see note 5, commitments and contingencies. our substantial indebtedness and other obligations, including streaming content obligations, may:
•   make it difficult for us to satisfy our financial obligations, including making scheduled principal and interest payments on our notes and our other obligations;
•   limit our ability to borrow additional funds for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions or other general business purposes;
•   limit our ability to use our cash flow or obtain additional financing for future working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions or other general business purposes;
•   require us to use a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to make debt service payments and pay our other obligations when due;
•   limit our flexibility to plan for, or react to, changes in our business and industry;
•   place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our less leveraged competitors; and
•   increase our vulnerability to the impact of adverse economic and industry conditions.
we may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service our debt and other obligations.
our ability to make payments on our indebtedness, including our notes, and our other obligations will depend on our financial and operating performance, which is subject to prevailing economic and competitive conditions and to certain financial, business and other factors beyond our control. we may be unable to maintain a level of cash flows from operating activities sufficient to permit us to pay the principal, premium, if any, and interest on our indebtedness, including the notes, and other obligations, including amounts due under our streaming content obligations.
if our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt service and other obligations, we may be forced to reduce or delay investments and capital expenditures, or to sell assets, seek additional capital or restructure or refinance our indebtedness, including the notes and obligations such as our streaming content obligations. these alternative measures may not be successful and may not permit us to meet our scheduled debt service and other obligations. we cannot assure you that we would be able to implement any of these alternatives on satisfactory terms or at all. in the absence of such operating results and resources, we could face substantial liquidity problems and might be required to dispose of material assets or operations to meet our debt service and other obligations. we may not be able to consummate those dispositions or to obtain the proceeds that we could realize from them, and these proceeds may not be adequate to meet any debt service obligations or other obligations then due.
if we are unable to service our debt obligations from cash flows, we may need to refinance all or a portion of our debt obligations prior to maturity. our ability to refinance or restructure our debt will depend upon the condition of the capital markets and our financial condition at such time. any refinancing of our debt could be at higher interest rates and may require us to comply with more onerous covenants, which could further restrict our business operations. we may not be able to refinance any of our indebtedness on commercially reasonable terms or at all.
we rely on the continued service of our senior management, including our chief executive officer and co-founder reed hastings, members of our executive team and other key employees and the hiring of new qualified employees. in our industry, there is substantial and continuous competition for highly-skilled business, product development, technical and other personnel. we may not be successful in recruiting new personnel and in retaining and motivating existing personnel, which may be disruptive to our operations.
if our domestic dvd segment declines faster than anticipated, our business could be adversely affected.
the number of memberships to our dvd-by-mail offering is declining, and we anticipate that this decline will continue. we believe, however, that the domestic dvd business will continue to generate significant contribution profit for our business. the contribution profit generated by our domestic dvd business will help provide capital resources to fund our growth internationally. to the extent that the rate of decline in our dvd-by-mail business is greater than we anticipate, our business could be adversely affected. we do not anticipate increasing resources to our dvd operations and the technology used in its operations will not be meaningfully improved. to the extent that we experience service interruptions or other degradations in our dvd-by-mail service, members' satisfaction could be negatively impacted and we could experience an increase in dvd-by-mail member cancellations, which could adversely impact our business.
if the u.s. postal service were to increase postal delivery rates or implement other changes to improve its financial position, such as closing mail processing facilities or service reductions, such changes could lead to a decrease in customer satisfaction and our domestic dvd segment's contribution profit could be adversely affected.
risks related to our stock ownership provisions in our charter documents and under delaware law could discourage a takeover that stockholders may consider favorable.
our charter documents may discourage, delay or prevent a merger or acquisition that a stockholder may consider favorable because they:
•   authorize our board of directors, without stockholder approval, to issue up to 10,000,000 shares of undesignated preferred stock;
•   provide for a classified board of directors;
•   prohibit stockholders from calling a special meeting of stockholders.
as a delaware corporation, we are also subject to certain delaware anti-takeover provisions. under delaware law, a corporation may not engage in a business combination with any holder of 15% or more of its capital stock unless the holder has held the stock for three years or, among other things, the board of directors has approved the transaction. our board of directors could rely on delaware law to prevent or delay an acquisition of us.
in addition, a merger or acquisition may trigger retention payments to certain executive employees under the terms of our amended and restated executive severance and retention incentive plan, thereby increasing the cost of such a transaction.
the price at which our common stock has traded has fluctuated significantly. the price may continue to be volatile due to a number of factors including the following, some of which are beyond our control:
•   variations in our operating results, including our membership acquisition and retention, revenues, contribution profits, net income and free cash flow;
•   variations between our actual operating results and the expectations of securities analysts, investors and the financial community;
•   announcements of developments affecting our business, systems or expansion plans by us or others;
•   competition, including the introduction of new competitors, their pricing strategies and services;
•   market volatility in general;
•   the level of demand for our stock, including the amount of short interest in our stock; and
•   the operating results of our competitors.
as a result of these and other factors, investors in our common stock may not be able to resell their shares at or above their original purchase price.
following certain periods of volatility in the market price of our securities, we became the subject of securities litigation. we may experience more such litigation following future periods of volatility. this type of litigation may result in substantial costs and a diversion of management's attention and resources.
financial forecasting may differ materially from actual results.
given the dynamic nature of our business, and the inherent limitations in predicting the future, forecasts of our revenues, contribution margins, net income and number of total and paid membership additions and other financial and operating data may differ materially from actual results. such discrepancies could cause a decline in the trading price of our common stock.
item 7.   management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview and results of operations the following represents our consolidated performance highlights:
as of/ year ended december 31,                                          change
operating income                                                          $379,793                    $305,826                    $402,648                   24        %            (24   )%
consolidated revenues for the year ended december 31, 2016 increased as compared to the year ended december 31, 2015 due to growth in the average number of paid streaming memberships globally, the majority of which was growth in our international memberships reflecting our expansion and focus on netflix as a global internet tv network. the impact from membership growth was coupled with an increase in global streaming average monthly revenue per paying membership resulting from price changes and plan mix partially offset by unfavorable foreign currency fluctuations impacting our international streaming segment. the increase in operating income and net income is due primarily to increased revenues partially offset by increased content expenses as we continue to acquire, license and produce content, including more netflix originals, as well as increased marketing and headcount costs to support our international expansion. net income was further impacted by the increase in interest expense associated with our debt issuances as well as to an increase in our effective tax rate, slightly offset by gains on foreign currency denominated transactions. we intend to focus on growing our global operating margin in 2017.
we offer three types of streaming membership plans. in the u.s. our "basic" plan is priced at $7.99 per month and includes access to standard definition quality streaming on a single screen at a time. our "standard" plan is our most popular streaming plan and is priced at $9.99 per month and includes access to high definition quality streaming on two screens concurrently. our "premium" plan is priced at $11.99 per month and includes access to high definition and ultra-high definition quality content on four screens concurrently. internationally, the membership plans are structured similarly to the u.s. and range in price from the u.s. dollar equivalent of approximately $5.00 to $18.00 per month.
we expect that from time to time the prices of our membership plans in each country may change. for instance, in may 2014, in the u.s., we increased the price of our standard plan from $7.99 per month to $8.99 per month with existing memberships grandfathered for a two year period. in october 2015, in the u.s., we increased the price of this same standard plan from $8.99 per month to $9.99 per month with existing memberships grandfathered for a one year period. in 2016, we phased out grandfathered pricing, giving members the option of electing the basic streaming plan at $7.99 per month, continuing on the standard streaming plan at the higher price of $9.99 per month, or electing the premium plan at $11.99 per month.
the following represents the key elements to our segment results of operations:
•   we define contribution profit (loss) as revenues less cost of revenues and marketing expenses incurred by the segment. we believe this is an important measure of our operating segment performance as it represents each segment's performance before global corporate costs.
•   for the domestic and international streaming segments, content expenses, which include the amortization of the streaming content assets and other expenses associated with the licensing and acquisition of streaming content, represent the vast majority of cost of revenues. streaming content rights were generally obtained for our current geographic regions. as we expanded internationally, we obtained additional rights for the new geographies. with our global expansion, we now aspire to obtain global rights for our content. we allocate this content between the domestic and international segments based on estimated fair market value. other cost of revenues such as streaming delivery expenses, customer service and payment processing fees, including those we pay to our integrated payment partners, tend to be lower as a percentage of total cost of revenues . we have built our own global content delivery network ("open connect") to help us efficiently stream a high volume of content to our members over the internet. streaming
delivery expenses, therefore, include equipment costs related to open connect and all third-party costs, such as cloud computing costs, associated with delivering streaming content over the internet. cost of revenues in the domestic dvd segment consist primarily of delivery expenses, content expenses, including amortization of dvd content assets and revenue sharing expenses, and other expenses associated with our dvd processing and customer service centers. delivery expenses for the domestic dvd segment consist of the postage costs to mail dvds to and from our members and the packaging and label costs for the mailers.
•   for the domestic and international streaming segments, marketing expenses consist primarily of advertising expenses and payments made to our partners including device partners, mvpd's, mobile platforms and isp's. advertising expenses include promotional activities such as digital and television advertising. payments to our partners include fixed fee and /or revenue sharing payments. marketing expenses are incurred by our domestic and international streaming segments given our focus on building consumer awareness of the streaming offerings, and in particular our original content. marketing expenses incurred by our international streaming segment have been significant and fluctuate dependent upon the number of international territories in which our streaming service is offered and the timing of the launch of new territories.
•   we have demonstrated our ability to grow domestic streaming contribution margin as evidenced by the increase in contribution margin from 17% in 2012 to 36% in 2016. as a result of our focus on growing the streaming segments, contribution margins for the domestic and international streaming segments are lower than for our domestic dvd segment.

in the domestic streaming segment, we derive revenues from monthly membership fees for services consisting solely of streaming content to our members in the united states. the increase in our domestic streaming revenues was due to a 12% growth in the average number of paid memberships and an 8% increase in average monthly revenue per paying membership. the average monthly revenue per paying membership for the fourth quarter of 2016 increased by 15% compared to the same quarter in prior year. these increases in average monthly revenue per paying membership resulted from our price changes and plan mix. in 2016, we phased out grandfathered pricing and cancellations by members whose grandfathered pricing expired were not material. our standard plan continues to be the most popular plan choice for new memberships.
the increase in domestic streaming cost of revenues was primarily due to a $335.4 million increase in content expenses relating to our existing and new streaming content, including more exclusive and original programming. in addition, we had a $33.2 million increase in other costs, such as payment processing fees and customer service call centers, due to our growing member base.
domestic marketing expenses increased primarily due to an increase in advertising and public relations spending as well as increased payments to our partners.
our domestic streaming segment had a contribution margin of 36% for the year ended december 31, 2016, which increased as compared to the contribution margin of 33% for the year ended december 31, 2015 due to growth in paid memberships and revenue, which continued to outpace content and marketing spending.

in the international streaming segment, we derive revenues from monthly membership fees for services consisting solely of streaming content to our members outside the united states. we launched our streaming service in canada in september 2010 and have expanded our services internationally as shown below.
the increase in our international revenues was due to the 57% growth in the average number of paid international memberships and a 4% increase in average monthly revenue per paying membership. the average monthly revenue per paying membership for the fourth quarter of 2016 increased by 10% compared to the same quarter in prior year. these increases in average monthly revenue per paying membership were due to price changes and plan mix, offset partially by unfavorable fluctuations in foreign exchange rates. we estimate that international revenues would have been approximately $174 million higher in the year ended december 31, 2016 if foreign exchange rates had remained consistent with those for the year ended december 31, 2015. if foreign currency exchange rates fluctuate more than expected, revenues and average revenue per paying membership may differ from our expectations. average paid international streaming memberships accounted for 43% of total average paid streaming memberships as of december 31, 2016, as compared to 35% of total average paid streaming memberships as of december 31, 2015.
the increase in international cost of revenues was primarily due to a $998.5 million increase in content expenses relating to our existing and new streaming content, including more exclusive and original programming. other costs increased $132.5 million primarily due to increases in our streaming delivery expenses, costs associated with our customer service call centers and payment processing fees, all driven by our growing member base, partially offset by decreases resulting from exchange rate
international marketing expenses increased mainly due to expenses for territories launched in the last eighteen months.
international contribution losses decreased $24.9 million year over year due to growth in paid memberships and revenue, which outpaced the growth in marketing spending.
the increase in our international revenues was due to the 66% growth in the average number of paid international memberships offset partially by a 10% decrease in average monthly revenue per paying membership. the decrease in average monthly revenue per paying membership was due to the impact of exchange rate fluctuations and to a lesser extent the impact of absorbing higher vat rates across our european markets beginning january 1, 2015. these decreases were partially offset by our pricing changes and plan mix. we believe international revenues would have been approximately $331 million higher in 2015 if foreign exchange rates had remained consistent with those for the year ended december 31, 2014.
the increase in international cost of revenues was primarily due to a $522.1 million increase in content expenses primarily relating to expenses for territories launched in the last eighteen months, coupled with existing and new streaming content, including more exclusive and original programming. other costs increased $104.2 million primarily due to increases in our streaming delivery expenses, costs associated with our customer service call centers and payment processing fees, all driven by our growing member base, partially offset by decreases resulting from exchange rate fluctuations. average paid international streaming memberships accounted for 35% of total average paid streaming memberships as of december 31, 2015, as compared to 27% of total average paid streaming memberships as of december 31, 2014.
international marketing expenses for the year ended december 31, 2015 increased as compared to the year ended december 31, 2014 mainly due to expenses for territories launched in the last eighteen months.

in the domestic dvd segment, we derive revenues from our dvd-by-mail membership services. the price per plan for dvd-by-mail varies from $4.99 to $14.99 per month according to the plan chosen by the member. dvd-by-mail plans differ by the number of dvds that a member may have out at any given point. members electing access to high definition blu-ray discs, in addition to standard definition dvds, pay a surcharge ranging from $2 to $4 per month for our most popular plans.

provision for income taxes year ended december 31,       change
the increase in our effective tax rate is mainly due to a $13.4 million release of tax reserves in 2015 and an increase in foreign taxes. in 2016, the difference between our 28% effective tax rate and the federal statutory rate of 35% was $17.3 million primarily due to the 2016 federal and california research and development ("r&d") credits partially offset by state income taxes, foreign taxes, and nondeductible expenses.
the decrease in our effective tax rate is mainly due to an increase in r&d credits and a decrease in state and local income taxes. in 2015, the difference between our 14% effective tax rate and the federal statutory rate of 35% was $30.4 million primarily due to a $13.4 million release of tax reserves on previously unrecognized tax benefits as a result of an irs audit settlement leading to the reassessment of our reserves for all open years, $16.5 million related to the retroactive reinstatement of the 2015 federal r&d credit, as well as the california r&d credit; partially offset by state income taxes, foreign taxes and nondeductible expenses. on december 18, 2015, the protecting americans from tax hikes act of 2015 (h.r. 2029) was signed into law which retroactively and permanently extended the federal r&d credit from january 1, 2015. as a result, we recognized the retroactive benefit of the 2015 r&d credit as a discrete item in the fourth quarter of 2015, the period in which the legislation was enacted.
liquidity and capital resources cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments decreased $576.9 million from $2,310.7 million as of december 31, 2015 to $1,733.8 million as of december 31, 2016. in october 2016, we issued $1,000.0 million of long-term debt. the decrease in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments in the year ended december 31, 2016 was primarily driven by an increase in cash used in operations, partially offset by cash received from the issuance of debt. long-term debt, net of debt issuance costs, was $3,364.3 million and $2,371.4 million as of december 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. see note 4 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.
our primary uses of cash include the acquisition, licensing and production of content, streaming delivery, marketing programs and personnel-related costs. investments in original content, and in particular content that we produce and own, require more cash upfront relative to licensed content. we expect to significantly increase our investments in global streaming content, particularly in original content, which will impact our liquidity and may result in future negative free cash flows even after we achieve material global profitability.
we currently anticipate that cash flows from operations, together with available funds and access to financing sources, will continue to be sufficient to meet our cash needs for at least the next twelve months. our ability to obtain any additional financing that we may choose to, or need to, obtain will depend on, among other things, our development efforts, business plans, operating performance, financial condition and the condition of the capital markets at the time we seek financing. we may not be able to obtain such financing on terms acceptable to us or at all. if we raise additional funds through the issuance of equity, equity-linked or debt securities, those securities may have rights, preferences or privileges senior to the rights of our common stock, and our stockholders may experience dilution.
as of december 31, 2016, cash and cash equivalents held by our foreign subsidiaries amounted to $278.5 million. if these funds are needed for our operations in the u.s., we would be required to accrue and pay u.s. income taxes and foreign withholding taxes on the portion associated with undistributed earnings for certain foreign subsidiaries.
free cash flow we define free cash flow as cash provided by (used in) operating and investing activities excluding the non-operational cash flows from purchases, maturities and sales of short-term investments. we believe free cash flow is an important liquidity metric because it measures, during a given period, the amount of cash generated that is available to repay debt obligations, make investments in content and for certain other activities or the amount of cash used in operations, including investments in global streaming content. free cash flow is considered a non-gaap financial measure and should not be considered in isolation
of, or as a substitute for, net income, operating income, cash flow (used in) provided by operating activities, or any other measure of financial performance or liquidity presented in accordance with gaap.
in assessing liquidity in relation to our results of operations, we compare free cash flow to net income, noting that the three major recurring differences are excess content payments over expense, non-cash stock-based compensation expense and other working capital differences. the excess content payments over expense is variable based on the payment terms of our content agreements and is expected to increase as we enter into more agreements with upfront cash payments, such as licensing and production of original content. in the last 12 months, the ratio of content payments over content expense was 1.4. working capital differences include deferred revenue, taxes and semi-annual interest payments on our outstanding debt. our receivables from members generally settle quickly and deferred revenue is a source of cash flow.

cash used in operating activities increased $724.5 million resulting in net cash used in operating activities of $1,474.0 million for the year ended december 31, 2016. the significant net cash used in operations is due primarily to the increase in investments in streaming content that require more upfront payments. the payments for streaming content assets increased $2,271.4 million, from $4,609.2 million to $6,880.6 million, or 49%. in addition, we had increased payments associated with higher operating expenses. the increased use of cash was partially offset by a $2,051.2 million or 30% increase in revenues.
cash provided by investing activities increased $229.0 million, primarily due to an increase of $243.6 million in the proceeds from sales and maturities of short-term investments, net of purchases, partially offset by a $16.4 million increase in the purchases of property and equipment, primarily driven by the expansion of our los gatos, california headquarters, as well as our new office space in los angeles, california.
cash provided by financing activities decreased $548.6 million primarily due to the $1,482.4 million net proceeds from the issuance of the 5.50% notes and the 5.875% notes in the year ended december 31, 2015 as compared to the $989.3 million net proceeds from the issuance of the 4.375% notes in the year ended december 31, 2016.
free cash flow was $1,846.4 million lower than net income for the year ended december 31, 2016 primarily due to $2,092.1 million of cash payments for streaming content assets over streaming amortization expense partially offset by $173.7 million of non-cash stock-based compensation expense and $72.0 million of favorable other working capital differences.
cash provided by operating activities decreased $765.9 million resulting in net cash used in operating activities of $749.4 million for the year ended december 31, 2015. the significant net cash used in operations is due primarily to the increase in investments in streaming content that require more upfront payments. the payments for streaming assets increased $1,429.3 million, from $3,179.9 million to $4,609.2 million or 45%. in addition, we had increased payments associated with higher operating expenses. the increased use of cash was partially offset by a $1,274.9 million or 23% increase in revenues.
cash used in investing activities increased $136.3 million, primarily due to a decrease of $108.4 million in the proceeds from sales and maturities of short-term investments, net of purchases. in addition, purchases of property and equipment increased by $21.5 million, primarily driven by the expansion of our los gatos, california headquarters.
cash provided by financing activities increased $1,098.6 million primarily due to the $1,482.4 million net proceeds from the issuance of the 5.50% notes and the 5.875% notes in the year ended december 31, 2015 as compared to the $392.9 million net proceeds from the issuance of the 5.750% notes in the year ended december 31, 2014.
free cash flow was $1,043.2 million lower than net income for the year ended december 31, 2015 primarily due to $1,203.9 million of cash payments for streaming content assets over streaming amortization expense partially offset by $124.7 million of non-cash stock-based compensation expense and $36.0 million of favorable other working capital differences.
free cash flow was $393.5 million lower than net income for the year ended december 31, 2014 primarily due to $523.6 million of cash payments for streaming content assets over streaming amortization expense partially offset by $115.2 million of non-cash stock-based compensation expense and $14.9 million of favorable other working capital differences.
contractual obligations for the purpose of this table, contractual obligations for purchases of goods or services are defined as agreements that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed, minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. the expected timing of the payment of the obligations discussed below is estimated based on information available to us as of december 31, 2016. timing of payments and actual amounts paid may be different depending on the time of receipt of goods or services or changes to agreed-upon amounts for some obligations. the following table summarizes our contractual obligations at december 31, 2016:
(1)   as of december 31, 2016, streaming content obligations were comprised of $3.6 billion included in "current content liabilities" and $2.9 billion of "non-current content liabilities" on the consolidated balance sheets and $8.0 billion of obligations that are not reflected on the consolidated balance sheets as they did not then meet the criteria for recognition.
streaming content obligations increased $3.6 billion from $10.9 billion as of december 31, 2015 to $14.5 billion as of december 31, 2016 primarily due to multi-year commitments associated with the continued expansion of our exclusive and original programming.
streaming content obligations include amounts related to the acquisition, licensing and production of streaming content. an obligation for the production of content includes non-cancelable commitments under creative talent and employment agreements. an obligation for the acquisition and licensing of content is incurred at the time we enter into an agreement to obtain future titles. once a title becomes available, a content liability is recorded on the consolidated balance sheets. certain agreements include the obligation to license rights for unknown future titles, the ultimate quantity and/or fees for which are not yet determinable as of the reporting date. traditional film output deals, like the u.s. output deal with disney, or certain tv series license agreements where the number of seasons to be aired is unknown, are examples of these types of agreements. the contractual obligations table above does not include any estimated obligation for the unknown future titles, payment for which could range from less than one year to more than five years. however, these unknown obligations are expected to be significant and we believe could include approximately $3 billion to $5 billion over the next three years, with the payments for the vast majority of such amounts expected to occur after the next twelve months. the foregoing range is based on considerable management judgments and the actual amounts may differ. once we know the title that we will receive and the license fees, we include the amount in the contractual obligations table above.
(2)   long-term debt obligations include our notes consisting of principal and interest payments. see note 4 to the consolidated financial statements for further details.
(3)   lease obligations include lease financing obligations of $18.5 million related to our current los gatos, california headquarters for which we are the deemed owner for accounting purposes, commitments of $530.2 million for our expanded headquarters in los gatos, california, and our new office space in los angeles, california and other commitments of $92.1 million for facilities under non-cancelable operating leases. these leases have expiration dates varying through approximately 2027.
(4)   other purchase obligations include all other non-cancelable contractual obligations. these contracts are primarily related to streaming delivery, dvd content acquisition, and miscellaneous open purchase orders for which we have not received the related services or goods.
as of december 31, 2016, we had gross unrecognized tax benefits of $19.7 million which was classified in "other non-current liabilities" and a reduction to deferred tax assets which was classified as "other non-current assets" in the consolidated balance sheets. at this time, an estimate of the range of reasonably possible adjustments to the balance of unrecognized tax benefits cannot be made.
off-balance sheet arrangements we do not have transactions with unconsolidated entities, such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities, whereby we have financial guarantees, subordinated retained interests, derivative instruments, or other contingent arrangements that expose us to material continuing risks, contingent liabilities, or any other obligation under a variable interest in an unconsolidated entity that provides financing, liquidity, market risk, or credit risk support to us.
indemnifications the information set forth under note 6 to the consolidated financial statements under the caption "indemnification" is incorporated herein by reference.
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reported periods. the securities and exchange commission ("sec") has defined a company's critical accounting policies as the ones that are most important to the portrayal of a company's financial condition and results of operations, and which require a company to make its most difficult and subjective judgments. based on this definition, we have identified the critical accounting policies and judgments addressed below. we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. actual results may differ from these estimates.
streaming content we acquire, license and produce content, including original programing, in order to offer our members unlimited viewing of tv shows and films. the content licenses are for a fixed fee and specific windows of availability. payment terms for certain content licenses and the production of content require more upfront cash payments relative to the amortization expense. payments for content, including additions to streaming assets and the changes in related liabilities, are classified within "net cash used in (provided by) operating activities" on the consolidated statements of cash flows.
for licenses we capitalize the fee per title and record a corresponding liability at the gross amount of the liability when the license period begins, the cost of the title is known and the title is accepted and available for streaming. the portion available for streaming within one year is recognized as "current content assets, net" and the remaining portion as "non-current content assets, net" on the consolidated balance sheets.
for productions, we capitalize costs associated with the production, including development cost and direct costs. we include these amounts in "non-current content assets, net" on the consolidated balance sheets. participations and residuals are expensed in line with the amortization of production costs.
based on factors including historical and estimated viewing patterns, we amortize the content assets (licensed and produced) in "cost of revenues" on the consolidated statements of operations, over the shorter of each title's contractual window of availability or estimated period of use, beginning with the month of first availability. the amortization period typically ranges from six months to five years. for content where we expect more upfront viewing, for instance due to additional merchandising and marketing efforts, we amortize on an accelerated basis. we review factors that impact the
amortization of the content assets on a regular basis. our estimates related to these factors require considerable management judgment. in the third quarter of 2016, we changed the amortization method of certain content given changes in estimated viewing patterns of this content. the effect of this change in estimate was a $19.8 million decrease in operating income and a $12.3 million decrease in net income for the year ended december 31, 2016. the effect on both basic and diluted earnings per share was a decrease of $0.03 for the year ended december 31, 2016. changes in our estimates could have a significant impact on our future results of operations.
our business model is subscription based as opposed to a model generating revenues at a specific title level. therefore, content assets, both licensed and produced, are reviewed in aggregate at the operating segment level when an event or change in circumstances indicates a change in the expected usefulness or that the fair value may be less than amortized cost. to date, we have not identified any such event or changes in circumstances. if such changes are identified in the future, these aggregated content assets will be stated at the lower of unamortized cost, net realizable value or fair value. in addition, unamortized costs for assets that have been, or are expected to be, abandoned are written off. no material write-down from unamortized cost was recorded in any of the periods presented.
income taxes we record a provision for income taxes for the anticipated tax consequences of our reported results of operations using the asset and liability method. deferred income taxes are recognized by applying enacted statutory tax rates applicable to future years to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases as well as net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. the measurement of deferred tax assets is reduced, if necessary, by a valuation allowance for any tax benefits for which future realization is uncertain. there was no significant valuation allowance as of december 31, 2016 or 2015.
although we believe our assumptions, judgments and estimates are reasonable, changes in tax laws or our interpretation of tax laws and the resolution of any tax audits could significantly impact the amounts provided for income taxes in our consolidated financial statements.
in evaluating our ability to recover our deferred tax assets, in full or in part, we consider all available positive and negative evidence, including our past operating results, and our forecast of future earnings, future taxable income and prudent and feasible tax planning strategies. the assumptions utilized in determining future taxable income require significant judgment and are consistent with the plans and estimates we are using to manage the underlying businesses. actual operating results in future years could differ from our current assumptions, judgments and estimates. however, we believe that it is more likely than not that substantially all deferred tax assets recorded on our consolidated balance sheets will ultimately be realized. in the event we were to determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax assets in the future, an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would be charged to earnings in the period in which we make such determination.
we did not recognize certain tax benefits from uncertain tax positions within the provision for income taxes. we may recognize a tax benefit only if it is more likely than not the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. the tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such positions are then measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon settlement. at december 31, 2016, our estimated gross unrecognized tax benefits were $19.7 million of which $17.0 million, if recognized, would favorably impact our future earnings. due to uncertainties in any tax audit outcome, our estimates of the ultimate settlement of our unrecognized tax positions may change and the actual tax benefits may differ significantly from the estimates. see note 9 to the consolidated financial statements for further information regarding income taxes.
stock-based compensation we grant fully vested non-qualified stock options to our employees on a monthly basis. as a result of immediate vesting, stock-based compensation expense is fully recognized on the grant date, and no estimate is required for post-vesting option forfeitures. stock-based compensation expense at the grant date is based on the total number of options granted and an estimate of the fair value of the awards.
•   expected volatility: the company calculates expected volatility based solely on implied volatility. we believe that implied volatility of publicly traded options in our common stock is more reflective of market conditions and, given consistently high trade volumes of the options, can reasonably be expected to be a better indicator of expected volatility than historical volatility of our common stock. an increase/decrease of 10% in our computation of expected volatility would increase/decrease the total stock-based compensation expense by approximately $14.4 million for the year ended december 31, 2016.
•   suboptimal exercise factor: our computation of the suboptimal exercise factor is based on historical and estimated option exercise behavior. an increase/decrease in the suboptimal exercise factor of 10% would increase/decrease the total stock-based compensation expense by approximately $6.0 million for the year ended december 31, 2016.

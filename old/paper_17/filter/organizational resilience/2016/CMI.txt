as previously announced, beginning with the second quarter of 2016, we realigned certain of our reportable segments to be consistent with changes to our organizational structure and how the codm monitors the performance of our segments. we reorganized our business to combine our power generation segment and our high-horsepower engine business to create the new power systems segment. our reportable operating segments consist of engine, distribution, components and power systems. we began to report results for our new reporting structure in the second quarter of 2016 and also reflected this change for historical periods. the formation of the power systems segment combined two businesses that were already strongly interdependent, which will allow us to streamline business and technical processes to accelerate innovation, grow market share and more efficiently manage our supply chain and manufacturing operations.

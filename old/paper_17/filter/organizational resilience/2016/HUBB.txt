item 1a    risk factors our business, operating results, financial condition, and cash flows may be impacted by a number of factors including, but not limited to those set forth below. any one of these factors could cause our actual results to vary materially from recent results or future anticipated results. see also item 7. management's discussion and analysis - "executive overview of the business", "outlook", and "results of operations".
global economic uncertainty could adversely affect us.
during periods of prolonged slow growth, or a downturn in conditions in the worldwide or domestic economies, we could experience reduced orders, payment delays, supply chain disruptions or other factors caused by economic challenges faced by our customers, prospective customers and suppliers. depending upon their severity and duration, these conditions could have an adverse impact on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.
we operate in markets that are subject to competitive pressures that could affect selling prices or demand for our products.
we compete on the basis of product performance, quality, service and/or price. competitors' behavior related to these areas could potentially have significant impacts on our financial results. our competitive strategy is to design and manufacture high quality products at the lowest possible cost. our strategy is to also increase selling prices to offset rising costs of raw materials and components. competitive pricing pressures may not allow us to offset some or all of our increased costs through pricing actions. alternatively, if raw material and component costs decline, the company may not be able to maintain current pricing levels. competition could also affect future selling prices or demand for our products which could have an adverse impact on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.
we may not be able to successfully implement initiatives, including our restructuring activities, that improve productivity and streamline operations to control or reduce costs.
achieving our long-term profitability goals depends significantly on our ability to control or reduce our operating costs. because many of our costs are affected by factors outside, or substantially outside, our control, we generally must seek to control or reduce costs through productivity initiatives. if we are not able to identify and implement initiatives that control or reduce costs and increase operating efficiency, or if the cost savings initiatives we have implemented to date do not generate expected cost savings, our financial results could be adversely impacted. our efforts to control or reduce costs may include restructuring activities involving workforce reductions, facility consolidations and other cost reduction initiatives. if we do not successfully manage our current restructuring activities, or any other restructuring activities that we may undertake in the future, expected efficiencies and benefits may be delayed or not realized, and our operations and business could be disrupted.
we manufacture and source products and materials from various countries throughout the world. a disruption in the availability, price or quality of these products or materials could impact our operating results.
our business is subject to risks associated with global manufacturing and sourcing. we use a variety of raw materials in the production of our products including steel, aluminum, brass, copper, bronze, zinc, nickel and plastics. we also purchase certain electrical and electronic components, including solenoids,lighting ballasts, printed circuit boards and integrated circuit chips and cord sets from a number of suppliers. significant shortages in the availability of these materials or significant price increases could increase our operating costs and adversely impact the competitive positions of our products, which could adversely impact our results of operations.
we rely on materials, components and finished goods that are sourced from or manufactured in foreign countries including mexico, china, and other international countries. political instability in any country where we do business could have an adverse impact on our results of operations.
we rely on our suppliers to produce high quality materials, components and finished goods according to our specifications. although we have quality control procedures in place, there is a risk that products may not meet our specifications which could impact our ability to ship quality products to our customers on a timely basis, which could adversely impact our results of operations.
future tax law changes could increase our prospective tax expense. in addition, tax payments may ultimately differ from amounts currently recorded by the company.
we are subject to income taxes as well as non-income based taxes, in both the united states and numerous foreign jurisdictions. the determination of the company's worldwide provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities requires judgment and is based on diverse legislative and regulatory structures that exist in the various jurisdictions where the company operates. as a result of the u.s. federal elections, there may be changes in tax policy pursued by the new administration, and the nature and outcome of those potential changes is uncertain at this time. although management believes its estimates are reasonable, the ultimate tax outcome may differ from the amounts recorded in its financial statements and may adversely affect the company's financial results for the period when such determination is made. we are subject to ongoing tax audits in various jurisdictions. tax authorities may disagree with certain positions we have taken and assess additional taxes. we regularly assess the likely outcomes of these audits in order to determine the appropriateness of our tax provisions. however, there can be no assurance that we will accurately predict the outcomes of these audits, and the future outcomes of these audits could adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.
8   hubbell incorporated - form 10-k significant developments stemming from the recent u.s. federal elections could have a material adverse effect on us.
as a result of the recent u.s. federal elections, there may be changes to existing trade agreements, like the north american free trade agreement ("nafta"), and proposed trade agreements, like the trans-pacific partnership ("tpp"), greater restrictions on free trade generally, significant increases in tariffs on goods imported into the united states particularly tariffs on products manufactured in mexico, among other possible changes. changes in u.s. social, political, regulatory and economic conditions or in laws and policies governing foreign trade, manufacturing, development and investment in the territories and countries where we currently manufacture and sell products, and any resulting negative sentiments towards the united states as a result of such changes, could have an adverse effect on our business.
we engage in acquisitions and strategic investments and may encounter difficulty in obtaining appropriate acquisitions and in integrating these businesses.
part of the company's growth strategy involves acquisitions. we have pursued and will continue to seek acquisitions and other strategic investments to complement and expand our existing businesses. the rate and extent to which acquisitions become available may impact our growth rate. the success of these transactions will depend on our ability to integrate these businesses into our operations and realize the planned synergies. we may encounter difficulties in integrating acquisitions into our operations and in managing strategic investments and foreign acquisitions and joint ventures may also present additional risk related to the integration of operations across different cultures and languages. failure to effectively complete or manage acquisitions may adversely affect our existing businesses as well as our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.
we are subject to risks surrounding our information systems failures, network, disruptions and breaches in data security.
the proper functioning of hubbell's information systems is critical to the successful operation of our business. although our information systems are protected with robust backup and security systems, these systems are still susceptible to cyber threats, outages due to fire, floods, power loss, telecommunications failures, viruses, break-ins and similar events, or breaches of physical security. a failure of our information technology systems could impact our ability to process orders, maintain proper levels of inventory, collect accounts receivable and pay expenses; all of which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. in addition, security breaches could result in unauthorized disclosure of confidential information that may result in financial or reputational damage to the company.
we have continued to work on improving our utilization of our enterprise resource planning system, expanding standardization of business processes and performing implementations at our remaining businesses. we expect to incur additional costs related to future implementations, process reengineering efforts as well as enhancements and upgrades to the system. these system modifications and implementations could result in operating inefficiencies which could adversely impact our operating results and/or our ability to perform necessary business transactions.
our success depends on attracting and retaining qualified personnel.
our ability to sustain and grow our business requires us to hire, retain and develop a highly skilled and diverse management team and workforce. failure to ensure that we have the depth and breadth of personnel with the necessary skill set and experience, or the loss of key employees, could impede our ability to deliver our growth objectives and execute our strategy.
deterioration in the credit quality of our customers could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition.
we have an extensive customer base of distributors, wholesalers, electric utilities, oems, electrical contractors, telecommunications companies and retail and hardware outlets. we are not dependent on a single customer, however, our top ten customers account for approximately one-third of our net sales. deterioration in the credit quality of several major customers could adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.
inability to access capital markets or failure to maintain our credit ratings may adversely affect our business.
our ability to invest in our business and make strategic acquisitions may require access to the capital markets. if general economic and capital market conditions deteriorate significantly, it could impact our ability to access capital. failure to maintain our credit ratings could also impact our ability to access credit markets and could adversely impact our cost of borrowing. while we have not encountered significant financing difficulties recently, the capital and credit markets have experienced significant volatility in recent years. market conditions could make it more difficult for us to access capital to finance our investments and acquisitions. this could adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.
if the underlying investments of our defined benefit plans do not perform as expected, we may have to make additional contributions to these plans.
we sponsor certain pension and other postretirement defined benefit plans. the performance of the financial markets and interest rates impact these plan expenses and funding obligations. significant changes in market interest rates, investment losses on plan assets and reductions in discount rates may increase our funding obligations and could adversely impact our results of operations, cash flows, and financial condition. furthermore, there can be no assurance that the value of the defined benefit plan assets will be sufficient to meet future funding requirements.
volatility in currency exchange rates may adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
our international operations accounted for approximately 10% of our net sales in 2016. we are exposed to the effects (both positive and negative) that fluctuating exchange rates have on translating the financial statements of our international operations, most of which are denominated in local currencies, into the u.s. dollar. fluctuations in exchange rates may affect product demand and reported profits in our international operations. in addition, currency fluctuations may affect the prices we pay suppliers for materials used in our products. as a result, fluctuating exchange rates may adversely impact our results of operations and cash flows.
our reputation and our ability to conduct business may be impaired by improper conduct by any of our employees, agents or business partners.
we cannot provide absolute assurance that our internal controls and compliance systems will always protect us from acts committed by our employees, agents or business partners that would violate u.s. and/or non-u.s. laws, including the laws governing payments to government officials, bribery, fraud, anti-kickback and false claims rules, competition, export and import compliance, money laundering and data privacy. in particular, the u.s. foreign corrupt practices act, the u.k. bribery act, and similar anti-bribery laws in other jurisdictions generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business, and we operate in parts of the world that have experienced governmental corruption to some degree. despite meaningful measures that we undertake to facilitate lawful conduct, which include training and internal control policies, these measures may not always prevent reckless or criminal acts by our employees or agents. any such improper actions could damage our reputation and subject us to civil or criminal investigation in the united states and in other jurisdictions, could lead to substantial civil and criminal, monetary and non-monetary penalties and could cause us to incur significant legal and investigative fees.
new product introductions and enhancement of existing products and services are key to the company's competitive strategy. the success of new product introductions is dependent on a number of factors, including, but not limited to, timely and successful development of new products, market acceptance of these products and the company's ability to manage the risks associated with these introductions. these risks include production capabilities, management of inventory levels to support anticipated demand, the risk that new products may have quality defects in the early stages of introduction, and obsolescence risk of existing products. the company cannot predict with certainty the ultimate impact new product introductions could have on our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows.
we could incur significant and/or unexpected costs in our efforts to successfully avoid, manage, defend and litigate intellectual property matters.
the company relies on certain patents, trademarks, copyrights, trade secrets and other intellectual property of which the company cannot be certain that others have not and will not infringe upon. although management believes that the loss or expiration of any single intellectual property right would not have a material impact on its operating results, intellectual property litigation could be costly and time consuming and the company could incur significant legal expenses pursuing these claims against others.
from time to time, we receive notices from third parties alleging intellectual property infringement. any dispute or litigation involving intellectual property could be costly and time-consuming due to the complexity and the uncertainty of intellectual property litigation. our intellectual property portfolio may not be useful in asserting a counterclaim, or negotiating a license, in response to a claim of infringement or misappropriation. in addition, as a result of such claims, the company may lose its rights to utilize critical technology or may be required to pay substantial damages or license fees with respect to the infringed rights or be required to redesign our products at a substantial cost, any of which could negatively impact our operating results. even if we successfully defend against claims of infringement, we may incur significant costs that could adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and cash flow. see item 3 "legal proceedings" for a discussion of our legal proceedings.
we may be required to recognize impairment charges for our goodwill and other intangible assets.
as of december 31, 2016, the net carrying value of our goodwill and other intangible assets totaled approximately $1.4 billion. as required by generally accepted accounting principles, we periodically assess these assets to determine if they are impaired. impairment of intangibles assets may be triggered by developments both within and outside the company's control. deteriorating economic conditions, technological changes, disruptions to our business, inability to effectively integrate acquired businesses, unexpected significant changes or planned changes in use of the assets, intensified competition, divestitures, market capitalization declines and other factors may impair our goodwill and other intangible assets. any charges relating to such impairments could adversely affect our results of operations in the periods an impairment is recognized.
10   hubbell incorporated - form 10-k we are subject to litigation and environmental regulations that may adversely impact our operating results.
we are a party to a number of legal proceedings and claims, including those involving product liability, intellectual property and environmental matters, which could be significant. it is not possible to predict with certainty the outcome of every claim and lawsuit. in the future, we could incur judgments or enter into settlements of lawsuits and claims that could have a materially adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flows. and financial condition. in addition, while we maintain insurance coverage with respect to certain claims, such insurance may not provide adequate coverage against such claims. we establish reserves based on our assessment of contingencies, including contingencies related to legal claims asserted against us. subsequent developments in legal proceedings may affect our assessment and estimates of the loss contingency recorded as a reserve and require us to make additional payments, which could have a materially adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flow.
we are also subject to various laws and regulations relating to environmental protection and the discharge of materials into the environment, and we could incur substantial costs as a result of the noncompliance with or liability for clean up or other costs or damages under environmental laws. in addition, we could be affected by future laws or regulations, including those imposed in response to climate change concerns. compliance with any future laws and regulations could result in a materially adverse effect on our business and financial results. see item 3 "legal proceedings" for a discussion of our legal proceedings.
regulations related to conflict-free minerals may cause us to incur additional expenses and may create challenges with our customers.
the dodd-frank wall street reform and consumer protection act contains provisions to improve transparency and accountability regarding the use of "conflict" minerals mined from the democratic republic of congo and adjoining countries ("drc"). the sec has established annual disclosure and reporting requirements for those companies who use "conflict" minerals sourced from the drc in their products. these new requirements could limit the pool of suppliers who can provide conflict-free minerals and as a result, we cannot ensure that we will be able to obtain these conflict-free minerals at competitive prices. compliance with these new requirements may also increase our costs. in addition, we may face challenges with our customers if we are unable to sufficiently verify the origins of the minerals used in our products.
we face the potential harms of natural disasters, terrorism, acts of war, international conflicts or other disruptions to our operations.
natural disasters, acts or threats of war or terrorism, international conflicts, and the actions taken by the united states and other governments in response to such events could cause damage to or disrupt our business operations, our suppliers or our customers, and could create political or economic instability, any of which could have an adverse effect on our business. although it is not possible to predict such events or their consequences, these events could decrease demand for our products, make it difficult or impossible for us to deliver products, or disrupt our supply chain.
item 7    management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations executive overview of the business the company is primarily engaged in the design, manufacture and sale of quality electrical and electronic products for a broad range of non-residential and residential construction, industrial and utility applications. products are either sourced complete, manufactured or assembled by subsidiaries in the united states, canada, switzerland, puerto rico, china, mexico, italy, the united kingdom, brazil, australia and ireland. the company also participates in joint ventures in taiwan and hong kong, and maintains offices in singapore, china, india, mexico, south korea and countries in the middle east. the company employs approximately 17,400 individuals worldwide.
the company's reporting segments consist of the electrical segment and the power segment. results for 2016, 2015 and 2014 by segment are included under "segment results" within this management's discussion and analysis.
the company's long-term strategy is to serve its customers with reliable and innovative solutions delivered through a competitive cost structure; to complement organic growth with acquisitions that enhance its product offerings; and to allocate capital effectively to create shareholder value. in executing this strategy the company is focused on growing profits and delivering attractive returns to shareholders by executing a business plan focused on the following key initiatives: growing revenue, aligning the cost structure, improving productivity, and deploying capital effectively.
our strategy to grow revenue is focused on complementing organic growth with acquisitions that expand our product offerings and present opportunities to compete in core, adjacent or complementary markets. our organic growth initiatives remain focused on expanding market share through new product introductions and more effective utilization of sales and marketing efforts across the organization. acquisitions are a key component of our revenue growth strategy, not only to expand our reach into new markets and further into existing markets with new products, but also to advance our revenue growth objectives during periods of weakness or inconsistency in our end-markets.
aligning our cost structure with the needs of our business is a key initiative and has resulted in the restructuring and related activities we have initiated, beginning in 2014. our restructuring and related efforts include the consolidation of manufacturing and distribution facilities, workforce actions, as well as streamlining and consolidating our back-office functions. the primary objectives of our restructuring and related activities are to optimize our manufacturing footprint, cost structure, and effectiveness and efficiency of our workforce.
productivity improvement also continues to be a key area of focus for the company and efforts to drive productivity work with our restructuring and related activities to minimize the impact of rising material costs and administrative cost inflation. material costs are approximately two-thirds of our cost of goods sold therefore volatility in this area can significantly impact profitability. our goal is to have pricing and productivity programs that offset material and other inflationary cost increases as well as pay for investments in key growth areas.
productivity programs impact virtually all functional areas within the company by reducing or eliminating waste and improving processes. we continue to expand our efforts surrounding global product and component sourcing and supplier cost reduction programs. value engineering efforts, product transfers and the use of lean process improvement techniques are expected to continue to increase manufacturing efficiency. in addition, we continue to build upon the benefits of our enterprise resource planning system across all functions.
18   hubbell incorporated - form 10-k outlook in 2017, we expect growth across our end markets to be more consistent than in 2016. we expect modest end market growth of approximately two percent in the aggregate, with two to four percent growth in the non-residential market and four to six percent growth in the residential market. we expect the electrical transmission and distribution market, the industrial market, and the oil and gas market to each be flat-to-up by two percent.
we expect our organic net sales growth to outperform end markets and that acquisitions will continue to be a key driver of growth, however we anticipate pricing pressure in our lighting business group could continue to be a challenge.
we expect our operating margins in 2017 will benefit from cost structure improvements, through incremental savings from our restructuring and related activities, and that our operating margins will also reflect lower restructuring and related costs as well as incremental profit from higher sales. however, we also expect our operating margins in 2017 will reflect continued pricing challenges in our lighting business and headwinds from foreign exchange and material costs across the company.
we anticipate earnings per diluted share in the range of $5.60 to $5.80 in 2017, including approximately $0.25 of restructuring and related costs as well as $0.20 of incremental savings in 2017 from restructuring and related actions initiated prior to december 31, 2016.
finally, with our strong financial position and cash flows provided by operating activities, we expect to continue to enhance shareholder value through capital deployment. we expect free cash flow (defined as cash flows from operating activities less capital expenditures) equal to net income attributable to hubbell in 2017.
results of operations our operations are classified into two reportable segments: electrical and power. for a complete description of the company's segments, see part i, item 1 of this annual report on form 10-k. within these segments, hubbell primarily serves customers in the non-residential and residential construction, industrial, energy-related markets (also referred to as oil and gas markets) and utility markets (also referred to as the electrical transmission and distribution market). in order of magnitude of net sales, the company's served markets are primarily non-residential construction, industrial, utility, oil and gas, and residential construction.
our overall end markets were mixed in 2016 leading to organic growth in the year of one percent and a continuation of pressure on operating margins from business and product mix, as lower margin non-residential and residential markets grew, while higher margin industrial and oil markets continued to decline, although at rates that moderated as compared to 2015. the utility market was approximately flat in 2016 driven by project delays.
considering these overall market conditions, we continued our focus on productivity and the restructuring and related program that began in 2014. the savings from our productivity and restructuring and related actions have helped to reduce the impact of unfavorable sales mix on operating margins as well as headwinds from pricing in certain markets and foreign exchange. our productivity measures are aimed to offset inflationary cost increases, while our restructuring and related actions are focused on reducing structural costs of the business, aligning our cost structure with market demand, and achieving greater back-office efficiencies.

our consolidated results of operations in 2016, 2015 and 2014 include what we refer to as "restructuring and related costs". restructuring actions support our cost reduction efforts involving the consolidation of manufacturing and distribution facilities as well as workforce reductions and the sale or exit of business units we determine to be non-strategic. restructuring costs include severance and employee benefits, asset impairments, as well as facility closure, contract termination and certain pension costs that are directly related to restructuring actions. restructuring-related costs are costs associated with our business transformation initiatives, including the consolidation of back-office functions and streamlining our processes, and certain other costs and gains associated with restructuring actions. in the fourth quarter of 2016 restructuring-related costs include a gain on the sale of a property associated with restructuring activities.
our consolidated results of operations in 2015 also include costs associated with the reclassification of the company's common stock to eliminate its two-class structure (the "reclassification" and the "reclassification costs"). reclassification costs are primarily professional fees associated with the reclassification and are recognized in other expense, net in the consolidated statement of income. only a portion of the reclassification costs were tax deductible.
we believe certain non-gaap measures that exclude the impact of these costs may provide investors with useful information regarding our underlying performance from period to period and allow investors to assess the impact of the company's restructuring and related activities and business transformation initiatives on the results of operations. adjusted gross profit, adjusted selling & administrative ("s&a") expense, and adjusted operating income each exclude restructuring and related costs. adjusted net income attributable to hubbell and adjusted earnings per diluted share exclude restructuring and related costs as well as reclassification costs. management uses these adjusted measures when assessing the performance of the business.
additional information about the reclassification is included in note 15 - capital stock of the notes to consolidated financial statements as well as the company's current reports on form 8-k filed on august 24, 2015 and december 23, 2015 and the company's registration statement on form s-4 (file no. 333-206898), initially filed with the sec on september 11, 2015 and declared effective on november 23, 2015.

of the $35.0 million of restructuring and related costs incurred in 2016, $32.1 million is recorded in the electrical segment and $2.9 million is recorded in the power segment. of the $38.9 million of restructuring and related costs incurred in 2015, $32.8 million is recorded in the electrical segment and $6.1 million is recorded in the power segment. restructuring and related costs in cost of goods sold increased in 2016 primarily due to a $12.5 million charge in the fourth quarter of 2016 to record an estimated liability associated with the anticipated withdrawal from a multi-employer pension plan associated with the consolidation of two of our lighting facilities. restructuring related costs in s&a expense declined as compared to the prior year as 2016 includes a $7.2 million gain on the sale of a property associated with a restructuring action.
net sales net sales of $3.5 billion in 2016 increased three percent as compared to 2015. acquisitions added three percentage points to net sales in 2016 and organic volume, including pricing headwinds, added one percentage point, while foreign currency translation reduced net sales by one percentage point. within our electrical segment, organic net sales of products sold into the non-residential and residential construction markets grew, but was mostly offset by lower organic net sales of products into the energy-related and industrial markets, which experienced continued, but moderating, weakness in 2016, primarily impacting our harsh and hazardous products. within our power segment, organic net sales were slightly higher, by less than one percentage point, in 2016.
cost of goods sold as a percentage of net sales, cost of goods sold increased to 68.6% for 2016 compared to 67.8% in 2015. the increase was primarily due to unfavorable business and product mix, pricing headwinds in our electrical segment, the impact of our acquisitions, as well as foreign exchange headwinds. we also incurred $6.4 million of higher restructuring and related costs within cost of goods sold in 2016, primarily relating to the proposed consolidation of two of our lighting facilities. those unfavorable impacts were partially offset by higher realized savings from our restructuring and related actions in 2016, and favorable material costs.
gross profit the gross profit margin for 2016 declined to 31.4% compared to 32.2% in 2015. restructuring and related costs in cost of goods sold were $6.4 million higher in 2016 as compared to 2015. excluding restructuring and related costs, the adjusted gross profit margin was 32.3% in 2016 as compared to 32.9% in 2015. the decrease in the adjusted gross margin is primarily due to unfavorable business and product mix, pricing headwinds in our electrical segment, the impact of our acquisitions, as well as foreign exchange headwinds. those unfavorable impacts were partially offset by higher realized savings from our restructuring and related actions in 2016, and favorable material costs.
selling & administrative expenses s&a expense in 2016 was $622.9 million and increased one percent compared to 2015 as we added s&a costs in 2016 from our acquisitions, made investments in our business, and experienced higher pension costs. those increases were almost completely offset by realized savings from our restructuring and related actions, $10.3 million lower restructuring and related costs in s&a expense in 2016 and foreign currency translation. s&a expense as a percentage of net sales declined by 40 basis points to 17.8% in 2016. excluding restructuring and related costs, adjusted s&a expense as a percentage of net sales declined by 20 basis points to 17.6% in 2016 primarily due to realized savings from our restructuring and related actions and the favorable impact of higher volume, partially offset by higher pension costs and investments in our business in 2016.
operating income operating income increased one percent in 2016 to $477.8 million while operating margin declined by 40 basis points to 13.6%. excluding restructuring and related costs, adjusted operating income of $512.8 million was flat as compared to 2015 and the adjusted operating margin declined by 50 basis points to 14.6%. the adjusted operating margin decreased primarily due to unfavorable product and business mix, pricing headwinds in our electrical segment, foreign exchange headwinds and cost increases that were greater than productivity gains. those unfavorable impacts to the adjusted operating margin were partially offset by realized savings from our restructuring and related actions and lower material costs.
total other expense total other expense was $47.4 million in 2016 compared to $56.0 million in 2015. excluding reclassification costs that were incurred in 2015, adjusted total other expense was $47.4 in 2016 compared to $36.3 million in 2015 and increased largely due to a $12.4 million increase in interest expense primarily related to the $400 million debt offering we completed in march 2016.
income taxes the effective tax rate was 30.8% in 2016 as compared to 32.6% in 2015. the effective tax rate was higher in 2015 as compared to 2016 due to certain costs of the reclassification that were not deductible partially offset by international reorganization actions in 2015 as well as certain discrete items in 2016. additional information related to the company's effective tax rate is included in note 12 - income taxes in the notes to consolidated financial statements.
net income attributable to hubbell and earnings per diluted share net income attributable to hubbell was $293.0 million in 2016 and increased 6% as compared to 2015. excluding restructuring and related costs and reclassification costs, adjusted net income attributable to hubbell was $316.8 million in 2016 and decreased 1% as compared to 2015, which reflects flat adjusted operating earnings, higher interest expense in 2016, partially offset by the benefit of a lower effective tax rate as compared to 2015. earnings per diluted share in 2016 increased 10% compared to 2015. adjusted earnings per diluted share in 2016, increased 3% and reflects a lower average number of diluted shares outstanding for the year, which declined by approximately 2.3 million as compared to 2015.

net sales in the electrical segment were $2.5 billion, up three percent in 2016 as compared with 2015 due to the contribution of net sales from acquisitions. organic volume was higher, despite pricing headwinds, and was offset by the unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation. net sales were three percentage points higher due to the contribution of acquisitions. organic volume, including pricing headwinds, added one percentage point to net sales and foreign currency translation reduced net sales by one percentage point.
within the segment, net sales of our lighting business group increased four percent in 2016 due to organic net sales growth of six percent, partially offset by a two percentage point headwind on pricing. within the lighting business group, organic net sales of residential lighting products increased by thirteen percent, partially offset by a three percentage point headwind on pricing, and commercial and industrial lighting products increased by four percent, partially offset by a two percentage point headwind on pricing. the aggregate net sales of our other business groups in the electrical segment increased by three percentage points, primarily due to five percentage points of net sales growth from acquisitions partially offset by two percentage points from foreign currency translation. the aggregate organic net sales volume of those other business groups was lower, by less than one percent, as lower net sales of products in industrial and energy-related markets, primarily our harsh and hazardous products, were almost entirely offset by net sales growth in construction-related businesses.
operating income in the electrical segment for 2016 was $267.4 million and decreased four percent compared to 2015. operating margin in 2016 decreased by approximately 80 basis points to 10.9%. excluding restructuring and related costs, the adjusted operating margin decreased by 90 basis points to 12.2% in 2016 . the decrease in the adjusted operating margin is primarily due to unfavorable product and business mix, foreign exchange headwinds, cost increases that were mostly offset by productivity gains, and pricing headwinds in our lighting business group. those unfavorable impacts were partially offset by realized savings from our restructuring and related actions and lower material costs.

net sales net sales for the year ended 2015 were $3.4 billion, an increase of one percent over 2014. acquisitions added three percentage points to net sales in 2015, offset by the impact of foreign currency translation which reduced net sales by two percentage points. organic volume was flat as net sales growth in our power segment and in our electrical segment products in the non-residential and residential construction markets was offset by lower organic net sales of our electrical segment products in the energy-related and industrial markets, primarily our harsh and hazardous products.
cost of goods sold as a percentage of net sales, cost of goods sold increased to 67.8% for 2015 compared to 67.0% in 2014. the increase was primarily due to higher restructuring and related costs in 2015 as compared to 2014, contributing approximately 60 basis points to the increase, unfavorable product and business mix, and the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange, partially offset by the favorable net impact of price and material costs as well as productivity in excess of cost inflation.

net sales in the electrical segment were approximately flat in 2015 compared with 2014 as the contribution of net sales from acquisitions were more than offset by the impact of foreign currency translation and lower organic net sales volume. acquisitions contributed three percentage points to net sales offset by two percentage points due to foreign currency translation and one percentage point due to lower organic volume.
within the segment, net sales of our lighting business group increased six percent in 2015 compared to 2014, while the aggregate net sales of our other business groups in the electrical segment declined by four percent in the same period. net sales of the lighting business group increased five percent due to organic growth in both the non-residential and residential construction markets, and one percent due to acquisitions. the aggregate net sales of our other business groups in the electrical segment declined by four percent due to a four percentage point decline in organic volume and three percentage points of unfavorable foreign currency translation, partially offset by three percent net sales growth from completed acquisitions. the decline in organic net sales volume is primarily due to lower net sales of products in the energy-related and industrial markets, primarily our harsh and hazardous products, partially offset by net sales growth in our other products, primarily in the non-residential and residential construction markets.

the following table reconciles our cash flows from operating activities to free cash flows for 2016, 2015 and 2014 (in millions):
net cash provided by operating activities (gaap measure)               $398.2          $331.1          $391.5

free cash flow as a percent of net income attributable to hubbell       113.0   %        92.0   %       102.0   %
free cash flow is a non-gaap measure and is defined as cash flow from operations less capital expenditures. management believes that free cash flow provides useful information regarding hubbell's ability to generate cash without reliance on external financing. in addition, management uses free cash flow to evaluate the resources available for investments in the business, strategic acquisitions and further strengthening the balance sheet.
cash provided by operating activities for 2016 increased compared to 2015 primarily due to higher net income after adjusting for the non-cash impacts of depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation and deferred income taxes and by lower uses of cash for working capital and cash spent for restructuring and related activities. cash used for working capital was $10.1 million in 2016 compared to $32.3 million in 2015 primarily due to lower inventories partially offset by higher accounts receivable in 2016.
cash used for investing activities of $230.0 million in 2016 decreased compared to cash used of $249.2 million in 2015. this decrease is primarily due to $9.9 million of lower capital expenditures and $9.6 million of proceeds from the sale of a real estate asset in our lighting business. those decreases in the use of cash for investing activities are partially offset by higher cash used for acquisitions in 2016 as compared to 2015.
cash used for financing activities of $46.8 million in 2016 decreased compared to $371.1 million of cash used in 2015. the decrease in cash used in 2016 as compared to 2015 is primarily the result of $393.4 million of net proceeds received from the $400 million public note offering the company completed in march 2016, as well as $200.7 million of class a cash consideration paid in connection with the reclassification in 2015. those decreases in cash used were partially offset by a $167.7 million increase in shares repurchased in 2016, as well as $97.1 million change year over year in cash flows from short term borrowings and a $8.1 million increase in dividends paid in 2016. for more information about the $400 million public note offering refer to note 11 - debt, in the notes to consolidated financial statements.
the unfavorable impact of foreign currency exchange rates on cash increased to $27.3 million in 2016 as compared to $21.2 million in 2015. the unfavorable impact in 2016 and 2015 was primarily related to the u.s. dollar strengthening against the british pound, australian dollar, and mexican peso.
cash provided by operating activities for 2015 decreased compared to 2014 primarily due to lower net income after adjusting for the non-cash impacts of depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation and deferred income taxes, offset partially by lower use of cash for working capital. cash used for working capital was $32.3 million in 2015 compared to $44.7 million in 2014 primarily due to increased collection of accounts receivable and increased current liabilities, offset partially by higher inventories.
cash used for investing activities of $249.2 million in 2015 increased compared to cash used of $242.6 million in 2014. this increase is primarily due to an approximately $22 million increase in investments in our business, including a $16.8 million increase in capital expenditures as well as a $5.0 million investment in a privately-held electrical utility substation security provider as well as lower proceeds from the disposition of assets in 2015. those increases in the use of cash for investing activities are partially offset by lower cash used for acquisitions in 2015 as compared to 2014.
cash used for financing activities of $371.1 million in 2015 increased compared to $215.6 million of cash used in 2014. the increase in cash used is primarily the result of $200.7 million of class a cash consideration paid in connection with the reclassification and a $15.8 million increase in dividends paid, partially offset by cash provided by $48.0 million of commercial paper outstanding at december 31, 2015 and lower cash used on the repurchase of common shares. there was no commercial paper outstanding at december 31, 2014.
the unfavorable impact of foreign currency exchange rates on cash increased to $21.2 million in 2015 as compared to $20.1 million in 2014. the unfavorable impact in 2015 and 2014 was primarily related to the u.s. dollar strengthening against the british pound, australian dollar, canadian dollar, and mexican peso.
investments in the business investments in our business include cash outlays for the acquisition of businesses as well as expenditures to support our restructuring and related activities and to maintain the operation of our equipment and facilities.

beginning in the fourth quarter of 2014 and continuing through 2016 we have initiated certain restructuring and related actions, primarily to align our cost structure with the needs of our business and also in response to weakness in certain of our end markets. as a result of those restructuring and related actions
26   hubbell incorporated - form 10-k we have exited a total of 20 manufacturing and warehousing facilities and have exceeded our expected cost savings in 2016 associated with restructuring and related activities. we expect to initiate additional restructuring actions in 2017.
in connection with our restructuring and related actions we have incurred restructuring costs, which are primarily severance and employee benefits, asset impairments, as well as facility closure, contract termination and certain pension costs that are directly related to restructuring actions. these restructuring costs are predominantly settled in cash from our operating activities and are generally settled within one year, with the exception of asset impairments, which are non-cash. restructuring costs also include a $12.5 million charge in the fourth quarter of 2016 to recognize the estimated liability associated with the anticipated withdrawal from a multi-employer pension plan, which is anticipated to be settled in periodic payments over several years, subject to negotiations expected to occur in 2017.
costs incurred in 2016 relating to 2016 restructuring actions in the preceding table include the previously mentioned $12.5 million charge representing the estimated withdrawal liability from a multi-employer pension plan. any potential future liability in excess of the amount already recognized in 2016 is not included in the additional expected costs relating to 2016 restructuring actions referred to in the preceding table. additional information about the estimated withdrawal liability is included in note 10 - retirement benefits in the notes to consolidated financial statements.
in connection with our restructuring and related actions we also incur restructuring-related costs. restructuring-related costs are costs associated with our business transformation initiatives, including the consolidation of back-office functions and streamlining our processes, and certain other costs and gains associated with restructuring actions. in 2016 restructuring-related costs include a fourth quarter gain on the sale of a property associated with restructuring activities. we refer to restructuring costs (which is a gaap measure) and restructuring-related costs on a combined basis as "restructuring and related costs", which is a non-gaap measure. refer to management's discussion and analysis - results of operations, for further detail of the costs associated with our restructuring and related activities and reconciliations of our non-gaap measures.
during 2016, we used cash of $67.2 million for capital expenditures, a decrease of $9.9 million from 2015 as we made higher investments in facilities and equipment during 2015.

liquidity we measure liquidity on the basis of our ability to meet short-term and long-term operational funding needs, fund additional investments, including acquisitions, and make dividend payments to shareholders. significant factors affecting the management of liquidity are cash flows from operating activities, capital expenditures, cash dividend payments, stock repurchases, access to bank lines of credit and our ability to attract long-term capital with satisfactory terms.
in 2016, we invested in acquisitions and also returned capital to our shareholders through share repurchases and shareholder dividends. these activities were funded primarily with the proceeds of our $400 million public debt offering completed on march 1, 2016, short-term borrowings, and cash flows from operations.
◦   cash used for the acquisition of businesses in 2016, net of cash acquired was $173.4 million. further discussion of our acquisitions can be found in note 2 - business acquisitions, of the notes to condensed consolidated financial statements.
we also require cash outlays to fund our operations, our capital expenditures, and an increase in working capital that would be required to accommodate a higher level of business activity for the foreseeable future, as well as our rate of cash dividends, potential future acquisitions, and the remaining longbow acquisition purchase price. we also have contractual obligations for long-term debt, operating leases, purchase obligations, and certain other long-term liabilities that are summarized in the table of contractual obligations as of december 31, 2016.
our sources of funds and available resources to meet these funding needs are as follows:
◦   cash flows from operations and existing cash resources: we are targeting free cash flow (defined as cash flows from operations less capital expenditures) equal to net income attributable to hubbell in 2017. we also have $437.6 million of cash and cash equivalents at december 31, 2016, of which approximately 25% was held inside the united states and the remainder held internationally. the company's intent is to indefinitely reinvest all of its undistributed international earnings and cash internationally.
◦   we have the ability to issue commercial paper for general corporate purposes and our $750 million revolving credit facility, which expires in december 2020, serves as a backup to our commercial paper program. we maintain investment grade credit ratings from the major u.s. rating agencies.
◦   on december 16, 2015 the company entered into a five-year revolving credit agreement (the "credit agreement") with a syndicate of lenders that provides a $750 million committed revolving credit facility. commitments under the credit agreement may be increased to an aggregate amount not to exceed
$1.250 billion. the interest rate applicable to borrowing under the credit agreement is generally either the adjusted libor plus an applicable margin (determined by reference to a ratings based grid) or the alternate base rate. the single financial covenant in the credit agreement, which the company is in compliance with at december 31, 2016, requires that total debt not exceed 55% of total capitalization as of the last day of each fiscal quarter of the company. annual commitment fees to support availability under the credit facility are not material. although not the principal source of liquidity, we believe our credit facility is capable of providing significant financing flexibility at reasonable rates of interest. however, in the event of a significant deterioration in the results of our operations or cash flows, leading to deterioration in financial condition, our borrowing costs could increase and/or our ability to borrow could be restricted. we have not entered into any guarantees that could give rise to material unexpected cash requirements. as of december 31, 2016 the credit facility had not been drawn against.
◦   in addition to our commercial paper program and existing revolving credit facility we also have the ability to obtain additional financing through the issuance of long-term debt. considering our current credit rating, historical earnings performance, and financial position we believe that we would be able to obtain additional long-term debt financing on attractive terms.
◦   the company also maintains other lines of credit that are primarily used to support the issuance of letters of credit. interest rates and other terms of borrowing under these lines of credit vary from country to country, depending on local market conditions. at december 31, 2016 and 2015 these lines totaled $51.4 million and $54.6 million, respectively, of which $21.0 million million and $22.5 million was utilized to support letters of credit and the remaining amount was unused. the annual commitment fees associated with these lines of credit are not material.
pension funding status we have a number of funded and unfunded non-contributory u.s. and foreign defined benefit pension plans. benefits under these plans are generally provided based on either years of service and final average pay or a specified dollar amount per year of service. the funded status of our qualified, defined benefit pension plans is dependent upon many factors including future returns on invested pension assets, the level of market interest rates, employee earnings and employee demographics.
in december 2016, the company approved amendments to the domestic qualified defined benefit pension plan and non-qualified defined benefit plan, which will freeze service accruals for active participants effective february 28, 2017 and further will freeze compensation accruals effective december 31, 2020. the company also froze all accruals in a second non-qualified defined benefit plan effective december 31, 2016. as a result of the amendments, the company has recognized a $34.1 million curtailment gain in accumulated other comprehensive income as of december 31, 2016 and recognized $0.2 million of pension expense in 2016 associated with previously unrecognized prior service costs. in addition, effective january 1, 2017, the amortization of unrecognized gains and losses of these plans will be recognized over the remaining life expectancy of participants, as all participants are considered inactive as a result of the amendments.
in 2016, we also completed a transaction with a third-party insurer to settle approximately $40 million of projected benefit obligations of our domestic qualified defined benefit pension plans.
changes in the value of the defined benefit plan assets and liabilities will affect the amount of pension expense ultimately recognized. although differences between actuarial assumptions and actual results are no longer deferred for balance sheet purposes, deferral is still permitted for pension expense purposes. unrecognized gains and losses in excess of an annual calculated minimum amount (the greater of 10% of the projected benefit obligation or 10% of the market value of assets) have been amortized and recognized in net periodic pension cost. for our primary defined benefit plans that amortization in 2016 is over the average remaining service period of our active employees, which approximates 9-15 years. effective january 1, 2017, the amortization of unrecognized gains and losses of our primary domestic defined benefit plan will be recognized over the remaining life expectancy of participants, which is approximately 22 years. during 2016 and 2015, we recorded $13.9 million and $12.1 million, respectively, of pension expense related to the amortization of these unrecognized losses. we expect to record $11.1 million of expense related to unrecognized losses and prior service cost in 2017.
in 2016, 2015 and 2014, we contributed $18.0 million, $22.6 million, and $23.5 million, respectively, to our qualified foreign and domestic defined benefit pension plans. these contributions have improved the funded status of all of our plans. although not required by erisa and the internal revenue code, the company may elect to make a voluntary contribution to its qualified domestic defined benefit pension plan in 2017. the company expects to contribute approximately $1.7 million to its foreign plans in 2017. the anticipated 2017 level of pension funding is not expected to have a significant impact on our overall liquidity.
assumptions the following assumptions were used to determine projected pension and other benefit obligations at the measurement date and the net periodic benefit costs for the year:

expected return on plan assets                                                                          6.04   %      6.36   %           n/a          n/a rate of compensation increase                                                                           3.59   %      3.15   %          3.92     %   3.60   %
at the end of each year, we estimate the expected long-term rate of return on pension plan assets based on the strategic asset allocation for our plans. in making this determination, we utilize expected rates of return for each asset class based upon current market conditions and expected risk premiums for each asset class. a one percentage point change in the expected long-term rate of return on pension fund assets would have an impact of approximately $7.1 million on 2017 pretax pension expense. the expected long-term rate of return is applied to the fair market value of pension fund assets to produce the expected return on fund assets that is included in pension expense. the difference between this expected return and the actual return on plan assets was recognized at december 31, 2016 for balance sheet purposes, but continues to be deferred for expense purposes. the net deferral of past asset gains (losses) ultimately affects future pension expense through the amortization of gains (losses) with an offsetting adjustment to hubbell shareholders' equity through accumulated other comprehensive loss.
at the end of each year, we determine the discount rate to be used to calculate the present value of our pension plan liabilities. for our u.s. and canadian pension plans, this discount rate is determined by matching the expected cash flows associated with our benefit obligations to a yield curve based on high quality, fixed income debt instruments with maturities that closely match the expected funding period of our pension liabilities. this yield curve is derived using a bond matching approach which incorporates a selection of bonds that align with our projected benefit obligations. as of december 31, 2016, we used a discount rate of 4.30% for our u.s. pension plans compared to a discount rate of 4.80% used in 2015. for our canadian pension plan, we used a discount rate of 3.85% in 2016, compared to the 3.90% discount rate used in 2015.
for our uk pension plan the discount rate was derived using a yield curve fitted to the yields on aa bonds in the barclays capital sterling aggregate corporate index and uses sample plan cash flow data as a proxy to plan specific liability cash flows. the derived discount rate is the single discount rate equivalent to discounting these liability cash flows at the term-dependent spot rates of aa corporate bonds. this methodology resulted in a december 31, 2016 discount rate for the uk pension plan of 2.70% as compared to a discount rate of 4.00% used in 2015.
an increase of one percentage point in the discount rate would lower our 2017 pretax pension expense by approximately $2.1 million. a discount rate decline of one percentage point would increase our 2017 pretax pension expense by approximately $2.1 million.
in 2014 we changed the mortality table used to calculate the present value of our pension plan liabilities from the rp-2000 mortality table to the rp-2000 mortality table with generational projection using scale bb-2d. that change resulted in an approximately $40 million increase in the projected benefit obligation of our u.s. defined benefit pension plans upon remeasurement at december 31, 2014. the same mortality assumption was used to calculate the present value of pension plan liabilities as of december 31, 2015 and 2016. the rp-2000 mortality table with generational projection using scale bb-2d was chosen as the best estimate based on the observed and anticipated experience of the plans after considering alternative tables, including rp-2014 and generational projection using scale mp-2016.
other post employment benefits ("opeb")
the company also has a number of health care and life insurance benefit plans covering eligible employees who reached retirement age while working for the company. these benefits have been discontinued for substantially all future retirees. these plans are not funded and, therefore, no assumed rate of return on assets is required. we use a similar methodology to derive the yield curve for our post employment benefit plan obligations that we use for our pension plans. as of december 31, 2016, the company used a discount rate of 4.10% to determine the projected benefit obligation compared to a discount rate of 4.60% used in 2015. in accordance with the accounting guidance for retirement benefits, we recorded to accumulated other comprehensive loss, within hubbell shareholders' equity, a charge, net of tax, of approximately $0.7 million in 2016 and a charge, net of tax, of approximately $1.1 million in 2015, related to the annual remeasurement of the opeb plans and the amortization of prior service credits and net actuarial gains.
30   hubbell incorporated - form 10-k off-balance sheet arrangements off-balance sheet arrangements are defined as any transaction, agreement or other contractual arrangement to which an entity that is not included in our consolidated results is a party, under which we, whether or not a party to the arrangement, have, or in the future may have: (1) an obligation under a direct or indirect guarantee or similar arrangement, (2) a retained or contingent interest in assets or (3) an obligation or liability, including a contingent obligation or liability, to the extent that it is not fully reflected in the financial statements.
we do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements as defined above which have or are likely to have a material effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.
contractual obligations a summary of our contractual obligations and commitments at december 31, 2016 is as follows (in millions):
operating lease obligations                            87.8            18.7            29.7              16.3                    23.1

(a)   amounts exclude unamortized discount and capitalized debt issuance costs.
(b)   amounts above reflect projected funding related to the company's non-qualified defined benefit plans. projected funding obligations of the company's qualified defined benefit pension plans are excluded from the table as there are significant factors, such as the future market value of plan assets and projected investment return rates, which could cause actual funding requirements to differ materially from projected funding.
(c)   amounts above reflect a $12.5 million obligation based on an assessment it is probable the company will withdraw from a multi-employer plan. see note 10 - retirement benefits in the notes to consolidated financial statements for further information.
our purchase obligations include amounts committed under legally enforceable contracts or purchase orders for goods and services with defined terms as to price, quantity, delivery and termination liability. these obligations primarily consist of inventory purchases made in the normal course of business to meet operational requirements and commitments for equipment purchases. as of december 31, 2016, we have $20.2 million of uncertain tax positions reflected in our consolidated balance sheet. we are unable to make a reasonable estimate regarding the timing of settlement of these uncertain tax positions and, as a result, they have been excluded from the table. see note 12 - income taxes in the notes to consolidated financial statements.
critical accounting estimates note 1 - significant accounting policies of the notes to consolidated financial statements describes the significant accounting policies used in the preparation of our financial statements.
use of estimates we are required to make assumptions and estimates and apply judgments in the preparation of our financial statements that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses and related disclosures. we base our assumptions, estimates and judgments on historical experience, current trends and other factors deemed relevant by management. we continually review these estimates and their underlying assumptions to ensure they are appropriate for the circumstances. changes in estimates and assumptions used by us could have a material impact on our financial results. we believe that the following estimates are among the most critical in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results. these items utilize assumptions and estimates about the effect of future events that are inherently uncertain and are based on our judgment.
revenue recognition we recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, the price is fixed and determinable and collection is probable. product is considered delivered to the customer once it has been shipped and title and risk of loss have been transferred. the majority of our revenue is recognized at the time of shipment. certain of our businesses account for sales discounts and allowances based on sales volumes, specific programs and customer deductions as is customary in the electrical products industry. these items primarily relate to sales volume incentives, special pricing allowances, and returned goods. this requires us to estimate at the time of sale the amounts that should not be recorded as revenue as these amounts are not expected to be collected from customers. we principally rely on historical experience, specific customer agreements, and anticipated future trends to estimate these amounts at the time of shipment.
inventory valuation inventories in the u.s. are primarily valued at the lower of lifo cost or market, while non-u.s. inventories are valued at the lower of fifo cost or market. we routinely evaluate the carrying value of our inventories to ensure they are carried at the lower of lifo or fifo cost or market value. such evaluation is based on our judgment and use of estimates, including sales forecasts, gross margins for particular product groupings, planned dispositions of product lines, technological events and overall industry trends. in addition, the evaluation is based on changes in inventory management practices which may influence the timing of exiting products and method of disposing of excess inventory.
excess inventory is generally identified by comparing future expected inventory usage to actual on-hand quantities. inventory values are reduced for on-hand inventory in excess of pre-defined usage forecasts. forecast usage is primarily determined by projecting historical (actual) sales and inventory usage levels forward to future periods. changes in these estimates may necessitate future adjustments to inventory values.
customer credit and collections we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts receivable in order to reflect the potential uncollectability of receivables related to purchases of products on open credit. if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate, resulting in their inability to make required payments, we may be required to record additional allowances for doubtful accounts.
accrued insurance we retain a significant portion of the risks associated with workers' compensation, medical, automobile and general liability insurance. we estimate self-insurance liabilities using a number of factors, including historical claims experience, demographic factors, severity factors and other actuarial assumptions. the accrued liabilities associated with these programs are based on our estimates of ultimate costs to settle known claims as well as claims incurred but not reported as of the balance sheet date. these assumptions are periodically reviewed with a third-party actuary to determine the adequacy of these self-insurance reserves. changes in these assumptions may necessitate future adjustments to these self-insurance liabilities.
employee benefits costs and funding we sponsor domestic and foreign defined benefit pension, defined contribution and other postretirement plans. major assumptions used in the accounting for these employee benefit plans include the discount rate, expected return on the pension fund assets, rate of increase in employee compensation levels and health care cost increase projections. these assumptions are determined based on company data and appropriate market indicators, and are evaluated each year as of the plans' measurement date. further discussion of the assumptions used in 2016 and 2015 are included above under "pension funding status" and in note 10 - retirement benefits of the notes to consolidated financial statements.
taxes we account for income taxes in accordance with the applicable accounting guidance which requires that deferred tax assets and liabilities be recognized using enacted tax rates for the effect of temporary differences between the book and tax basis of recorded assets and liabilities. additionally, deferred tax assets are required to be reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more-likely-than-not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. the factors used to assess the likelihood of realization of deferred tax assets are the forecast of future taxable income, available tax planning strategies that could be implemented to realize the net deferred tax assets, and future reversals of deferred tax liabilities. failure to achieve forecasted taxable income can affect the ultimate realization of net deferred tax assets.
we operate within multiple taxing jurisdictions and are subject to audit in these jurisdictions. the internal revenue service ("irs") and other tax authorities routinely review our tax returns. these audits can involve complex issues, which may require an extended period of time to resolve. the company records uncertain tax positions only when it has determined that it is more-likely-than-not that a tax position will be sustained upon examination by taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position. the company uses the criteria established in the accounting guidance to determine whether an item meets the definition of more-likely-than-not. the company's policy is to recognize these uncertain tax positions when the more-likely-than-not threshold is met, when the statute of limitations has expired or upon settlement. in management's opinion, adequate provision has been made for potential adjustments arising from any examinations. see also note 12 - income taxes in the notes to consolidated financial statements.
contingent liabilities we are subject to proceedings, lawsuits, and other claims or uncertainties related to environmental, legal, product and other matters. we routinely assess the likelihood of an adverse judgment or outcome to these matters, as well as the range of potential losses. we record a liability when it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated. a determination of the reserves required, if any, is made after careful analysis, including consultations with outside advisors, where applicable. where no amount within a range of estimates is more likely, the minimum is accrued. the required reserves may change in the future due to new developments.
valuation of long-lived assets our long-lived assets include land, buildings, equipment, molds and dies, software, goodwill and other intangible assets. long-lived assets, other than land, goodwill and indefinite-lived intangibles, are depreciated over their estimated useful lives. the assets and liabilities of acquired businesses are recorded under the acquisition method of accounting at their estimated fair values at the dates of acquisition. goodwill represents purchase price in excess of fair values assigned to the underlying identifiable net assets of acquired businesses. intangible assets primarily consist of patents, tradenames and customer related intangibles.
32   hubbell incorporated - form 10-k we review depreciable long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be fully recoverable. if such a change in circumstances occurs, the related estimated future undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset group and its eventual disposition is compared to the carrying amount. if the sum of the expected cash flows of the asset group is less than the carrying amount, an impairment charge is recorded. the impairment charge is measured as the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the fair value of the asset. the fair value of impaired assets is determined using expected cash flow estimates, quoted market prices when available and appraisals as appropriate. we did not record any material impairment charges related to long-lived assets in 2016, 2015, or 2014.
goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are reviewed annually for impairment unless circumstances dictate the need for more frequent assessment. we perform our goodwill impairment testing as of april 1st of each year unless circumstances dictate the need for more frequent assessments. the accounting guidance provides entities an option of performing a qualitative assessment before performing a quantitative analysis. if the entity determines, on the basis of certain qualitative factors, that it is more-likely-than-not that the goodwill is not impaired, the entity would not need to proceed to the two step goodwill impairment testing process as prescribed in the guidance. the company performed a qualitative assessment of its hubbell power systems ("hps") reporting unit. the company elected to bypass the qualitative assessment and proceeded directly to the quantitative analysis for its remaining reporting units. the goodwill impairment test requires judgment, including the identification of reporting units, assigning assets and liabilities to reporting units, and determining the fair value of each reporting unit. significant judgments required to estimate the fair value of reporting units include estimating future discounted cash flows, determining appropriate discount rates and other assumptions. we use internal discounted cash flow estimates to determine fair value. these cash flow estimates are derived from historical experience and future long-term business plans and the application of an appropriate discount rate. changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value and/or goodwill impairment for each reporting unit. as of april 1, 2016, our goodwill testing resulted in fair values for each reporting unit that substantially exceeded the reporting unit's carrying value. we have not recorded any goodwill impairments since the initial adoption of the accounting guidance in 2002.
the identification and measurement of impairment of indefinite-lived intangible assets involves an assessment of qualitative factors to determine whether events or circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that an indefinite-lived intangible asset is impaired. if it is more likely than not that the asset is imparied, the fair value of the indefinite lived intangibles will be determined using discounted cash flow estimates. if the carrying value of these assets exceeds the estimated fair value, the carrying value will be reduced to the estimated fair value. we did not record any impairments related to indefinite-lived intangible assets in 2016, 2015, or 2014.
stock-based compensation we determine the grant date fair value of certain stock-based compensation awards using either a lattice model or the black-scholes option pricing model. both of these models require management to make certain assumptions with respect to selected model inputs. these inputs include assumptions for the expected term, stock volatility, dividend yield and risk-free interest rate. changes in these inputs impact fair value and could impact our stock-based compensation expense in the future. in addition, we are required to estimate the expected forfeiture rate and recognize expense only for those awards expected to meet the service and performance vesting conditions. if our actual forfeiture rate is different from our estimate, adjustments to stock-based compensation expense may be required. see also note 16 - stock-based compensation in the notes to consolidated financial statements.

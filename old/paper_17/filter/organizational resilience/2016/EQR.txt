item 1a. risk factors general references to "eqr" mean equity residential, a maryland real estate investment trust ("reit"), and references to "erpop" mean erp operating limited partnership, an illinois limited partnership. unless otherwise indicated, when used in this section, the terms "company," "we," "us" or "our" mean collectively eqr, erpop and those entities/subsidiaries owned or controlled by eqr and/or erpop and the term "operating partnership" means collectively erpop and those entities/subsidiaries owned or controlled by erpop. this item 1a. includes forward-looking statements. you should refer to our discussion of the qualifications and limitations on forward-looking statements included in item 7, management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations.
the occurrence of the events discussed in the following risk factors could adversely affect, possibly in a material manner, our business, financial condition or results of operations, which could adversely affect the value of our common shares of beneficial interest or preferred shares of beneficial interest (which we refer to collectively as "shares"), preference units, op units, restricted units and our public unsecured debt. in this section, we refer to the shares, preference units, op units, restricted units and public unsecured debt together as our "securities" and the investors who own such securities as our "security holders".
our performance and securities value are subject to risks associated with the real estate industry.
general real property investments are subject to varying degrees of risk and are relatively illiquid. numerous factors may adversely affect the economic performance and value of our properties and the ability to realize that value. these factors include changes in the global, national, regional and local political and economic climates, local conditions such as an oversupply of multifamily properties or a reduction in demand for our multifamily properties, the attractiveness of our properties to residents, competition from other multifamily properties and single family homes (both as rentals and owned housing) and changes in market rental rates. our performance also depends on our ability to collect rent from residents and to pay for adequate maintenance, insurance and other operating costs, including real estate taxes, all of which could increase over time. these operating expenses could rise faster than our revenues causing our income to decline. in circumstances where we buy or sell properties, including large portfolios of properties, overhead (property management expense and general and administrative expense) may not increase/decrease proportionally with the associated changes in revenue. costs of labor and materials required for maintenance, repair, capital expenditure or development may be more expensive than anticipated. also, the expenses of owning and operating a property are not necessarily reduced when circumstances such as market factors and competition cause a reduction in income from the property.
when our residents decide to leave our apartments, we may not be able to relet their apartment units. even if the residents do renew or we can relet the apartment units, the terms of renewal or reletting may be less favorable than current lease terms. if we are unable to promptly renew the leases or relet the apartment units, or if the rental rates upon renewal or reletting are significantly lower than expected rates, then our results of operations and financial condition will be adversely affected. if residents do not experience increases in their income, we may be unable to increase rent and/or delinquencies may increase. occupancy levels and market rents may be adversely affected by national and local political, economic and market conditions including, without limitation, new construction and excess inventory of multifamily and owned housing/condominiums, increasing portions of owned housing/condominium stock being converted to rental use, rental housing subsidized by the government, other government programs that favor single family rental housing or owner occupied housing over multifamily rental housing, governmental
regulations, slow or negative employment growth and household formation, the availability of low-interest mortgages or the availability of mortgages requiring little or no down payment for single family home buyers, changes in social preferences and the potential for geopolitical instability, all of which are beyond our control. in addition, various state and local municipalities have enacted and may continue to enact rent control legislation or take other actions which could limit our ability to raise rents. finally, the federal government's policies, many of which may encourage home ownership, can increase competition and possibly limit our ability to raise rents. consequently, our cash flow and ability to service debt and make distributions to security holders could be reduced.
the retail/commercial space at our properties primarily serves as an additional amenity for our residents and neighbors. the long term nature of our retail/commercial leases (generally five to ten years with market based renewal options) and the characteristics of many of our tenants (generally small, local businesses) may subject us to certain risks. we may not be able to lease new space for rents that are consistent with our projections or for market rates. also, when leases for our existing retail/commercial space expire, the space may not be relet or the terms of reletting, including the cost of allowances and concessions to tenants, may be less favorable than the current lease terms. our properties compete with other properties with retail/commercial space. the presence of competitive alternatives may affect our ability to lease space and the level of rents we can obtain. if our retail/commercial tenants experience financial distress or bankruptcy, they may fail to comply with their contractual obligations, seek concessions in order to continue operations or cease their operations which could adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition. the revenues from our retail/commercial space represent approximately 4.5% of our total rental income.
we have increased our concentration of properties in our core markets, which could have an adverse effect on our operations if a particular market is adversely affected by economic or other conditions.
over the past ten years, the company has exited its non-core markets as part of its strategy to reposition its portfolio, leaving the company highly concentrated in its six core coastal markets. if any one or more of our core markets (boston, new york, washington d.c., southern california, san francisco and seattle) is adversely affected by local or regional economic conditions (such as business layoffs, industry slowdowns, changing demographics and other factors) or local real estate conditions (such as oversupply of or reduced demand for multifamily properties), such conditions may have an increased adverse impact on our results of operations than if our portfolio were more geographically diverse.
because real estate investments are illiquid, we may not be able to sell properties when appropriate.
real estate investments generally cannot be sold quickly. we may not be able to reconfigure our portfolio promptly in response to economic or other conditions. we may be unable to consummate such dispositions in a timely manner, on attractive terms, or at all. this inability to reallocate our capital promptly could adversely affect our financial condition and ability to make distributions to our security holders.
new acquisitions, development projects and/or rehabs may fail to perform as expected and competition for acquisitions may result in increased prices for properties that we would like to acquire.
we intend to actively acquire, develop and rehab multifamily properties for rental operations as market conditions dictate. we may also acquire multifamily properties that are unoccupied or in the early stages of lease up. we may be unable to lease up these apartment properties on schedule, resulting in decreases in expected rental revenues and/or lower yields due to lower occupancy and rental rates as well as higher than expected concessions or higher than expected operating expenses. we may not be able to achieve rents that are consistent with expectations for acquired, developed or rehabbed properties. we may underestimate the costs necessary to bring an acquired property up to standards established for its intended market position, to complete a development property or to complete a rehab. additionally, we expect that other real estate investors with capital will compete with us for attractive investment opportunities or may also develop properties in markets where we focus our development and acquisition efforts. this competition (or lack thereof) may increase (or depress) prices for multifamily properties. we may not be in a position or have the opportunity in the future to make suitable property acquisitions on favorable terms. we have acquired in the past and intend to continue to pursue the acquisition of properties, including large portfolios of properties, that could increase our size and result in alterations to our capital structure. the total number of apartment units under development, costs of development and estimated completion dates are subject to uncertainties arising from changing economic conditions (such as the cost of labor and construction materials), competition and local government regulation.
in connection with such government regulation, we may incur liability if our properties are not constructed and operated in compliance with the accessibility provisions of the americans with disabilities act, the fair housing act or other federal, state or local requirements. noncompliance could result in fines, subject us to lawsuits and require us to remediate or repair the noncompliance.
development and construction risks could affect our profitability.
we intend to continue to develop multifamily properties. these activities can include long planning and entitlement timelines and can involve complex and costly activities, including significant environmental remediation or construction work in high-density urban and close-in suburban areas. we may abandon opportunities (including land that we have optioned for purchase) that we have already begun to explore for a number of reasons, including changes in local market conditions or increases in construction or financing costs, and, as a result, we may fail to recover expenses or option payments already incurred in exploring those opportunities. the occupancy rates and rents at a property may fail to meet our original expectations for a number of reasons, including changes in market and economic conditions beyond our control and the development by competitors of competing properties. we may be unable to obtain, or experience delays in obtaining, necessary zoning, occupancy, or other required governmental or third party permits and authorizations, which could result in increased costs or the delay or abandonment of opportunities.
we own certain properties subject to ground leases that may limit our use of the properties, restrict our ability to finance, sell or otherwise transfer our interests in these properties and expose us to loss of the properties if such agreements are breached by us or terminated.
the company owns the building and improvements and leases the land underlying the improvements under several long-term ground leases. these ground leases may impose limitations on our use of the properties, restrict our ability to finance, sell or otherwise transfer our interests in the properties or restrict the leasing of the properties. these restrictions may limit our ability to timely sell or exchange the properties, impair the properties' value or negatively impact our ability to find suitable residents for the properties. in addition, we could lose our interests in the properties if the ground leases are breached by us or terminated. certain of these ground leases have payments subject to annual escalations and/or periodic fair market value adjustments which could adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations.
our investments in joint ventures could be adversely affected by our lack of sole decision-making authority regarding major decisions, our reliance on our joint venture partners' financial condition, any disputes that may arise between us and our joint venture partners and our exposure to potential losses from the actions of our joint venture partners.
we currently do and may continue in the future to develop and acquire properties in joint ventures with other persons or entities when we believe circumstances warrant the use of such structures. we have several joint ventures with other real estate investors. joint venture investments involve risks not present with respect to our wholly owned properties, including the following:
•   our joint venture partners might experience financial distress, become bankrupt or fail to fund their share of required capital contributions, which may delay construction or development of a property or increase our financial commitment to the joint venture;
•   our joint venture partners may have business interests or goals with respect to a property that conflict with our business interests and goals, which could increase the likelihood of disputes regarding the ownership, management or disposition of the property;
•   we may be unable to take actions that are opposed by our joint venture partners under arrangements that require us to share decision-making authority over major decisions affecting the ownership or operation of the joint venture and any property owned by the joint venture, such as the sale or financing of the property or the making of additional capital contributions for the benefit of the property;
•   our ability to sell or transfer our interest in a joint venture to a third party may be restricted without prior consent of our joint venture partners;
•   we may disagree with our joint venture partners about decisions affecting a property or the joint venture, which could result in litigation or arbitration that increases our expenses, distracts our officers and disrupts the day-to-day operations of the property, including by delaying important decisions until the dispute is resolved; and
•   we may suffer losses as a result of actions taken by our joint venture partners with respect to our joint venture investments.
at times we have entered into agreements providing for joint and several liability with our partners. we also have in the past and could choose in the future to guarantee part of or all of certain joint venture debt. frequently, we and our partners may each have the right to trigger a buy-sell arrangement, which could cause us to sell our interest, or acquire our partners' interest, at a time when we otherwise would not have initiated such a transaction. any of these risks could materially and adversely affect
our ability to generate and recognize attractive returns on our joint venture investments, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and distributions to our shareholders.
several of the assets we acquired in the archstone transaction along with certain preferred interests acquired in joint ventures as part of the archstone transaction, as well as certain other tax protected properties we have acquired over the years, are subject to tax protection agreements, which could limit our flexibility with respect to our ownership of such assets or cause us to incur material costs.
several of the assets we acquired from archstone enterprise lp ("archstone") in february 2013 were contributed to archstone subject to various agreements limiting the ability of the owner of the property to take actions that would trigger income tax liability for the contributing owner of the property, including a taxable disposition of the property. in addition, we will also be required to maintain a certain amount of qualified nonrecourse financing on the tax protected properties during their respective restricted periods. our obligations relating to these tax protected properties (as well as certain other tax protected properties we have acquired over the years) may affect the way in which we conduct our business, including whether, when and under what circumstances we sell properties or interests therein and the timing and nature of our financings and refinancing transactions. as a result, we may not be able to dispose of or refinance the tax protected properties when to do so may have otherwise been favorable to us and our shareholders, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. certain preferred interests acquired in joint ventures as part of the archstone transaction have complex tax requirements that, if violated, may cause us to be required to indemnify the preferred stockholders or our joint venture partner for certain tax protection costs.
changes in market conditions and volatility of share prices could adversely affect the market price of our common shares.
the stock markets, including the new york stock exchange, on which we list our common shares, have experienced significant price and volume fluctuations over time. as a result, the market price of our common shares could be similarly volatile, and investors in our common shares may experience a decrease in the value of their shares, including decreases unrelated to our operating performance or prospects. the market price of our common shares may decline or fluctuate significantly in response to many factors, including but not limited to the following:
•   general political, market and economic conditions;
•   actual or anticipated variations in our guidance, quarterly operating results or dividends;
•   changes in our net operating income ("noi"), earnings, funds from operations or normalized funds from operations estimates;
•   difficulties or inability to access capital or extend or refinance debt;
•   decreasing (or uncertainty in) real estate valuations;
•   rising crime rates in markets where our primarily urban and close-in suburban portfolio is concentrated;
•   a change in analyst and/or credit ratings;
•   adverse market reaction to any additional debt we incur in the future;
•   governmental regulatory action, including changes or proposed changes to the mandates of fannie mae or freddie mac, and changes in tax laws;
•   the payment of any special dividends;
•   the issuance of additional common shares, or the perception that such issuances might occur, including under eqr's at-the-market ("atm") share offering program; and
•   the resale of substantial amounts of our common shares, or the anticipation of the resale of such shares, by large holders of our securities.
issuances or sales of our common shares may be dilutive.
the issuance or sale of substantial amounts of our common shares, whether directly by us or in the secondary market, the perception that such issuances or sales of our common shares could occur or the availability for future issuance or sale of our common shares or securities convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable for our common shares could have a dilutive effect on our actual and expected earnings per share, funds from operations ("ffo") per share and normalized ffo per share.  the actual amount of dilution cannot be determined at this time and would be dependent upon numerous factors which are not currently known to us.
we may not have sufficient cash flows from operations after capital expenditures to cover our distributions and our dividend policy may lead to quicker dividend reductions.
we generally consider our cash flows provided by operating activities after capital expenditures to be adequate to meet operating requirements and payment of regular distributions to our security holders. while our current dividend policy makes it less likely that we will over distribute, it will also lead to a dividend reduction more quickly should operating results deteriorate or large portfolio sales occur. however, whether due to changes in the dividend policy or otherwise, there may be times when we experience shortfalls in our coverage of distributions, which may cause us to consider reducing our distributions and/or using the proceeds from property dispositions or additional financing transactions to make up the difference. should these shortfalls occur for lengthy periods of time or be material in nature, our financial condition may be adversely affected and we may not be able to maintain our current distribution levels. see item 7, management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations, for additional discussion regarding our dividend policy.
the value of investment securities could result in losses to the company.
from time to time, the company holds investment securities and/or cash investments that have various levels of repayment and liquidity risk, including government obligations and bond funds, money market funds or bank deposits. on occasion we also may purchase securities of companies in our own industry as a means to invest funds. there may be times when we experience declines in the value of these investment securities, which may result in losses to the company and our financial condition or results of operations could be adversely affected. sometimes the cash we deposit at a bank substantially exceeds the fdic insurance limit or we invest cash in money market or similar type funds with investment management institutions that may be subject to, now or in the future, liquidity and/or withdrawal restrictions, resulting in risk to the company of loss or lack of immediate availability of funds if these banks or institutions fail to meet their obligations.
any weaknesses identified in our internal control over financial reporting could have an adverse effect on our share price.
section 404 of the sarbanes-oxley act of 2002 requires us to evaluate and report on our internal control over financial reporting. if we identify one or more material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, we could lose investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports, which in turn could have an adverse effect on our share price.
the occurrence of cyber incidents, or a deficiency in our cybersecurity, could negatively impact our business by causing a disruption to our operations, a compromise or corruption of our confidential information, and/or damage to our reputation and business relationships, all of which could negatively impact our financial results.
a cyber incident is considered to be any adverse event that threatens the confidentiality, integrity or availability of our information resources. more specifically, a cyber incident is an intentional attack or an unintentional event that can include gaining unauthorized access to systems to disrupt operations, corrupt data or steal confidential information, including information regarding our residents and employees. as our reliance on technology has increased, so have the risks posed to our systems, both internal and those we have outsourced to third party service providers. in addition, information security risks have generally increased in recent years due to the rise in new technologies and the increased sophistication and activities of perpetrators of cyber attacks. our primary risks that could directly result from the occurrence of a cyber incident include operational interruption, damage to our reputation, damage to our business relationships and private data exposure. we have implemented processes, procedures and controls to help mitigate these risks, but these measures, as well as our increased awareness of a risk of a cyber incident, do not guarantee that our financial results will not be negatively impacted by such an incident.
changes in laws and litigation risk could affect our business.
we are generally not able to pass through to our residents under existing leases any real estate or other federal, state or local taxes. consequently, any such tax increases may adversely affect our financial condition and limit our ability to make distributions to our security holders.
we may become involved in legal proceedings, including but not limited to, proceedings related to consumer, shareholder, securities, employment, environmental, development, condominium conversion, tort and commercial legal issues that, if decided adversely to or settled by us, could result in liability material to our financial condition or results of operations.
environmental problems are possible and can be costly.
federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment may require a current or previous owner or operator of real estate to investigate and clean up hazardous or toxic substances or petroleum product releases at such property. the owner or operator may have to pay a governmental entity or third parties for property damage and for investigation and clean-up costs incurred by such parties in connection with the contamination. these laws typically impose clean-up responsibility and liability without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of or caused the presence of the contaminants. even if more than one person may have been responsible for the contamination, each person covered by the environmental laws may be held responsible for all of the clean-up costs incurred. in addition, third parties may sue the owner or operator of a site for damages and costs resulting from environmental contamination emanating from that site.
substantially all of our properties have been the subject of environmental assessments completed by qualified independent environmental consulting companies. while these environmental assessments have not revealed, nor are we aware of, any environmental liability that our management believes would have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition or liquidity, there can be no assurance that we will not incur such liabilities in the future.
we are aware that some of our properties have lead paint and have implemented an operations and maintenance program at each of those properties. while we do not currently anticipate that we will incur any material liabilities as a result of the presence of lead paint at our properties, there can be no assurance that we will not incur such liabilities in the future.
there have been a number of lawsuits against owners and managers of multifamily properties alleging personal injury and property damage caused by the presence of mold in residential real estate. while we have adopted programs designed to minimize the existence of mold in any of our properties as well as guidelines for promptly addressing and resolving reports of mold to minimize any impact mold might have on our residents or the property, should mold become an issue in the future, our financial condition or results of operations may be adversely affected.
we cannot be assured that existing environmental assessments of our properties reveal all environmental liabilities, that any prior owner of any of our properties did not create a material environmental condition not known to us, or that a material environmental condition does not otherwise exist as to any of our properties.
insurance policies can be costly and may not cover all losses, which may adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations.
as of december 31, 2016, the company's property insurance policies provide for a per occurrence deductible of $250,000. earthquake losses are subject to a 2% deductible in the state of washington and a 5% deductible in california, applied to the values of the buildings involved in the loss. the company also typically self-insures a substantial portion of the first $50 million of a property loss in excess of these base deductibles. should a claim exceed these amounts, it would be 100% covered by insurance. furthermore, the company purchased additional coverage in the event that the company suffers multiple non-catastrophic occurrences with losses from $25 million to $50 million within the same policy year. the company's general liability and worker's compensation policies at december 31, 2016 provide for a $2.0 million and $1.0 million per occurrence deductible, respectively. these higher deductible and self-insured retention amounts do expose the company to greater potential for uninsured losses. the company also has become more susceptible to large losses as it has transformed its portfolio, becoming more concentrated in fewer, more valuable assets over a smaller geographical footprint. furthermore, the potential impact of climate change, increased severe weather or earthquakes could cause a significant increase in insurance premiums and deductibles, or a decrease in the availability of coverage, either of which could expose the company to even greater uninsured losses which may adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations.
the company also has $750.0 million in terrorism insurance coverage, with a $100,000 deductible. this coverage excludes losses from nuclear, biological and chemical attacks. in the event of a terrorist attack impacting one or more of our properties, we could lose the revenues from the property, our capital investment in the property and possibly face liability claims from residents or others suffering injuries or losses.
as of december 31, 2016, the company's cyber liability insurance policy provides for a $5.0 million policy aggregate limit and a per occurrence deductible of $250,000. cyber liability insurance generally covers costs associated with the wrongful release, through inadvertent breach or network attack, of personally identifiable information such as social security or credit card numbers. this cyber policy would cover the cost of victim notification, credit monitoring and other crisis response expenses.
the company relies on third party insurance providers for its property, general liability and worker's compensation insurance. while there has yet to be any non-performance by these major insurance providers, should any of them experience liquidity issues or other financial distress, it could negatively impact the company. in addition, the company annually assesses its insurance needs based on the cost of coverage and other factors. we may choose to self insure a greater portion of this risk in the future or may choose to have higher deductibles or lesser policy terms.
damage from catastrophic weather and other natural events and climate change could result in losses to the company.
certain of our properties are located in areas that may experience catastrophic weather and other natural events from time to time, including fires, snow or ice storms, windstorms or hurricanes, earthquakes, flooding or other severe weather. these adverse weather and natural events could cause substantial damages or losses to our properties which could exceed our insurance coverage. in the event of a loss in excess of insured limits, we could lose our capital invested in the affected property, as well as anticipated future revenue from that property. we could also continue to be obligated to repay any mortgage indebtedness or other obligations related to the property. any such loss could materially and adversely affect our business and our financial condition and results of operations.
to the extent that significant changes in the climate occur in areas where our properties are located, we may experience extreme weather and changes in precipitation and temperature, all of which may result in physical damage to or a decrease in demand for properties located in these areas or affected by these conditions. should the impact of climate change be material in nature, including destruction of our properties, or occur for lengthy periods of time, our financial condition or results of operations may be adversely affected.
in addition, changes in federal and state legislation and regulation on climate change could result in increased capital expenditures to improve the energy efficiency of our existing properties and could also require us to spend more on our new development properties without a corresponding increase in revenue.
the inability of lehman to fulfill its indemnification obligations to us under the purchase agreement for the archstone transaction could increase our liabilities and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.
in addition to certain indemnification obligations of each party to the purchase agreement for the archstone transaction relating to breaches of fundamental representations and warranties and breaches of covenants and certain other specified matters, we negotiated as a term in the purchase agreement that lehman brothers holdings inc. ("lehman") retain responsibility for and indemnify us against damages resulting from certain third-party claims or other liabilities. these third-party claims and other liabilities include, without limitation, costs associated with various litigation matters. lehman filed for bankruptcy protection under chapter 11 of the bankruptcy code in september 2008 and is currently in the process of post-petition liquidation. if lehman completes its liquidation prior to the termination of their indemnity obligations to us under the purchase agreement, or otherwise distributes substantially all of its assets to its creditors prior to such time, lehman may not be able to satisfy its obligations with respect to claims and retained liabilities covered by the purchase agreement. the failure of lehman to satisfy such obligations could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition because claimants may successfully assert that we are liable for those claims and/or retained liabilities. in addition, we expect that certain obligations of lehman to indemnify us will terminate upon expiration of the applicable indemnification period (generally no more than four years following the closing, which will be february 27, 2017). the assertion of third-party claims after the expiration of the applicable indemnification period, or the failure of lehman to satisfy its indemnification obligations, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.
non-performance by our operating counterparties could adversely affect our performance.
we have relationships with and, from time to time, we execute transactions with or receive services from many counterparties. as a result, defaults by counterparties could result in services not being provided, or volatility in the financial markets could affect counterparties' ability to complete transactions with us as intended, both of which could result in disruptions to our operations that may adversely affect our business and results of operations.
debt financing and preferred shares/preference units could adversely affect our performance.
general please refer to item 7, management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations, for the company's total debt and unsecured debt summaries as of december 31, 2016.
in addition to debt, we have a liquidation value of $37.3 million of outstanding preferred shares of beneficial interest/preference units with a dividend preference of 8.29% per annum as of december 31, 2016. our use of debt and preferred equity financing creates certain risks, including the following:
disruptions in the financial markets could adversely affect our ability to obtain debt financing and impact our acquisitions and dispositions.
dislocations and liquidity disruptions in capital and credit markets could impact liquidity in the debt markets, resulting in financing terms that are less attractive to us and/or the unavailability of certain types of debt financing. should the capital and credit markets experience volatility and the availability of funds again become limited, or be available only on unattractive terms, we will incur increased costs associated with issuing debt instruments. in addition, it is possible that our ability to access the capital and credit markets may be limited or precluded by these or other factors at a time when we would like, or need, to do so, which would adversely impact our ability to refinance maturing debt and/or react to changing economic and business conditions. uncertainty in the credit markets could negatively impact our ability to make acquisitions and make it more difficult or not possible for us to sell properties or may adversely affect the price we receive for properties that we do sell, as prospective buyers may experience increased costs of debt financing or difficulties in obtaining debt financing. potential continued disruptions in the financial markets could also have other unknown adverse effects on us or the economy generally and may cause the price of our securities to fluctuate significantly and/or to decline.
potential reforms to fannie mae and freddie mac could adversely affect our performance.
through their lender originator networks, fannie mae and freddie mac (the "government sponsored enterprises" or "gses") are significant lenders and enhancers of tax-exempt bonds both to the company and to buyers of the company's properties. the gses have a mandate to support multifamily housing through their financing activities. any changes to their mandates, reductions in their size or the scale of their activities or loss of key personnel could have an impact on the company and may, among other things, lead to lower values for our assets and higher interest rates on our secured borrowings. disruptions in the floating rate tax-exempt bond market (where interest rates reset weekly) and in the credit market's perception of the gses, which guarantee and provide liquidity for many of these bonds, have been experienced in the past and may be experienced in the future and could result in an increase in interest rates on our tax-exempt debt obligations. these bonds could also be put to our consolidated subsidiaries if the gses fail to satisfy their guaranty obligations. while this obligation is in almost all cases non-recourse to us, this could cause the company to have to repay these obligations on short notice or risk foreclosure actions on the collateralized assets.
non-performance by our financial counterparties could adversely affect our performance.
although we have not experienced any material counterparty non-performance, disruptions in financial and credit markets could, among other things, impede the ability of our counterparties to perform on their contractual obligations. there are multiple financial institutions that are individually committed to lend us varying amounts as part of our revolving credit facility. should any of these institutions fail to fund their committed amounts when contractually required, our financial condition could be adversely affected. should several of these institutions fail to fund, we could experience significant financial distress.
the company also has developed assets with joint venture partners which were financed by financial institutions that have experienced varying degrees of distress in the past and could experience similar distress as economic conditions change. if one or more of these lenders fail to fund when contractually required, the company or its joint venture partner may be unable to complete construction of its development properties.
a significant downgrade in our credit ratings could adversely affect our performance.
a significant downgrade in our credit ratings, while not affecting our ability to draw proceeds under the revolving credit facility, would cause our borrowing costs to increase under the revolving credit facility, impact our ability to borrow secured and unsecured debt, impair our ability to access the commercial paper market or otherwise limit our access to capital. in addition, a downgrade below investment grade would require us to post cash collateral and/or letters of credit in favor of some of our secured lenders to cover our self-insured property and liability insurance deductibles or to obtain lower deductible insurance compliant with the lenders' requirements at the lower ratings level.
scheduled debt payments could adversely affect our financial condition.
in the future, our cash flow could be insufficient to meet required payments of principal and interest or to pay distributions on our securities at expected levels.
we may not be able to refinance existing debt, including joint venture indebtedness (which in virtually all cases requires substantial principal payments at maturity) and, if we can, the terms of such refinancing might not be as favorable as the terms of existing indebtedness. if principal payments due at maturity cannot be refinanced, extended or paid with proceeds of other capital transactions, such as new equity capital, our operating cash flow will not be sufficient in all years to repay all maturing debt. as a result, certain of our other debt may cross default, we may be forced to postpone capital expenditures necessary for the maintenance of our properties, we may have to dispose of one or more properties on terms that would otherwise be unacceptable to us or we may be forced to allow the mortgage holder to foreclose on a property. foreclosure on mortgaged properties or an inability to refinance existing indebtedness would likely have a negative impact on our financial condition and results of operations.
please refer to item 7, management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations, for the company's debt maturity schedule as of december 31, 2016.
financial covenants could adversely affect the company's financial condition.
the mortgages on our properties may contain customary negative covenants that, among other things, limit our ability, without the prior consent of the lender, to further mortgage the property and to reduce or change insurance coverage. in addition, our revolving credit facility contains certain restrictions, requirements and other limitations on our ability to incur debt. the indentures under which a substantial portion of our unsecured debt was issued also contain certain financial and operating covenants including, among other things, maintenance of certain financial ratios, as well as limitations on our ability to incur secured and unsecured debt (including acquisition financing), and to sell all or substantially all of our assets. our revolving credit facility and indentures are cross-defaulted and also contain cross default provisions with other material debt. while the company believes it was in compliance with its unsecured public debt covenants for both the years ended december 31, 2016 and 2015, should it fall out of compliance, it would likely have a negative impact on our financial condition and results of operations.
some of the properties were financed with tax-exempt bonds or otherwise contain certain restrictive covenants or deed restrictions, including affordability requirements. the company, and from time to time its consultants, monitor compliance with the restrictive covenants and deed restrictions that affect these properties. if these compliance requirements restrict our ability to increase our rental rates to low or moderate-income residents, or eligible/qualified residents, then our income from these properties may be limited. while we generally believe that the interest rate benefit attendant to properties with tax-exempt bonds more than outweighs any loss of income due to restrictive covenants or deed restrictions, this may not always be the case. some of these requirements are complex and our failure to comply with them may subject us to material fines or liabilities.
our degree of leverage could limit our ability to obtain additional financing.
our degree of leverage could have important consequences to security holders. for example, the degree of leverage could affect our ability to obtain additional financing in the future for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, development or other general corporate purposes, making us more vulnerable to a downturn in business or the economy in general. our consolidated debt-to-total market capitalization ratio was 26.8% as of december 31, 2016. in addition, our most restrictive unsecured public debt covenants are as follows:
consolidated income available for debt service to maximum annual service charges
advances under our revolving credit facility bear interest at a variable rate based upon libor at various interest periods, plus a spread dependent upon the operating partnership's credit rating, or based upon bids received from the lending group. borrowings under our commercial paper program also bear interest at variable rates. certain public issuances of our senior unsecured debt instruments may also, from time to time, bear interest at floating rates or be swapped to a floating rate of interest.
we may also borrow additional money with variable interest rates in the future. increases in interest rates would increase our interest expense under these debt instruments and would increase the costs of refinancing existing debt and of issuing new debt. accordingly, higher interest rates could adversely affect cash flow and our ability to service our debt and make distributions to security holders.
in the normal course of business, we use derivatives to manage our exposure to interest rate volatility on debt instruments, including hedging for future debt issuances. at other times we may utilize derivatives to increase our exposure to floating interest rates. we may also use derivatives to manage commodity prices in the daily operations of our business. there can be no assurance that these hedging arrangements will have the desired beneficial impact. these arrangements, which can include a number of counterparties, may expose us to additional risks, including failure of any of our counterparties to perform under these contracts, and may involve extensive costs, such as transaction fees or breakage costs, if we terminate them. no strategy can completely insulate us from the risks associated with interest rate or commodity pricing fluctuations.
we depend on the efforts of the chairman of our board of trustees, samuel zell, and our executive officers, particularly david j. neithercut, our president and chief executive officer ("ceo"). if they resign or otherwise cease to be employed by us, our operations could be temporarily adversely affected. mr. zell has entered into retirement benefit and noncompetition agreements with the company.
shareholders' ability to effect changes in control of the company is limited.
provisions of our declaration of trust and bylaws could inhibit changes in control.
certain provisions of our declaration of trust and bylaws may delay or prevent a change in control of the company or other transactions that could provide the security holders with a premium over the then-prevailing market price of their securities or which might otherwise be in the best interest of our security holders. this includes the 5% ownership limit described below. while our existing preferred shares/preference units do not have these provisions, any future series of preferred shares/preference units may have certain voting provisions that could delay or prevent a change in control or other transactions that might otherwise be in the interest of our security holders. our bylaws require certain information to be provided by any security holder, or persons acting in concert with such security holder, who proposes business or a nominee at an annual meeting of shareholders, including disclosure of information related to hedging activities and investment strategies with respect to our securities. these requirements could delay or prevent a change in control or other transactions that might otherwise be in the interest of our security holders.
to remain qualified as a reit for federal income tax purposes, not more than 50% in value of our outstanding shares may be owned, directly or indirectly, by five or fewer individuals at any time during the last half of any year. to facilitate maintenance of our reit qualification, our declaration of trust, subject to certain exceptions, prohibits ownership by any single shareholder of more than 5% of the lesser of the number or value of any outstanding class of common or preferred shares. we refer to this restriction as the "ownership limit." absent any exemption or waiver granted by our board of trustees, securities acquired or held in violation of the ownership limit will be transferred to a trust for the exclusive benefit of a designated charitable beneficiary, and the security holder's rights to distributions and to vote would terminate. a transfer of shares may be void if it causes a person to violate the ownership limit. the ownership limit could delay or prevent a change in control and, therefore, could adversely affect our security holders' ability to realize a premium over the then-prevailing market price for their shares. to reduce the ability of the board to use the ownership limit as an anti-takeover device, the company's ownership limit requires, rather than permits, the board to grant a waiver of the ownership limit if the individual seeking a waiver demonstrates that such ownership would not jeopardize the company's status as a reit. we have issued several of these waivers in the past.
our preferred shares may affect changes in control.
our declaration of trust authorizes the board of trustees to issue up to 100 million preferred shares, and to establish the preferences and rights (including the right to vote and the right to convert into common shares) of any preferred shares issued. the board of trustees may use its powers to issue preferred shares and to set the terms of such securities to delay or prevent a change in control of the company, even if a change in control were in the interest of security holders.
inapplicability of maryland law limiting certain changes in control.
certain provisions of maryland law applicable to real estate investment trusts prohibit "business combinations" (including certain issuances of equity securities) with any person who beneficially owns ten percent or more of the voting power of outstanding securities, or with an affiliate who, at any time within the two-year period prior to the date in question, was the beneficial owner of ten percent or more of the voting power of the company's outstanding voting securities (an "interested shareholder"), or with an affiliate of an interested shareholder. these prohibitions last for five years after the most recent date on which the interested shareholder became an interested shareholder. after the five-year period, a business combination with an interested shareholder must be approved by two super-majority shareholder votes unless, among other conditions, holders of common shares receive a minimum price for their shares and the consideration is received in cash or in the same form as previously paid by the interested shareholder for its common shares. as permitted by maryland law, however, the board of trustees of the company has opted out of these restrictions with respect to any business combination involving mr. zell and certain of his affiliates and persons acting in concert with them. consequently, the five-year prohibition and the super-majority vote requirements will not apply to a business combination involving us and/or any of them. such business combinations may not be in the best interest of our security holders.
we believe that we have qualified for taxation as a reit for federal income tax purposes since our taxable year ended december 31, 1992 based, in part, upon opinions of tax counsel received whenever we have issued equity securities or engaged in significant merger transactions. we plan to continue to meet the requirements for taxation as a reit. many of these requirements, however, are highly technical and complex. we cannot, therefore, guarantee that we have qualified or will qualify as a reit in the future. the determination that we are a reit requires an analysis of various factual matters that may not be totally within our control. for example, to qualify as a reit, our gross income must generally come from rental and other real estate or passive related sources that are itemized in the reit tax laws. we are also required to distribute to security holders at least 90% of our reit taxable income excluding net capital gains. the fact that we hold our assets through the operating partnership further complicates the application of the reit requirements. in addition, certain of our subsidiary entities have elected to be taxed as reits. as such, each must separately satisfy all of the requirements to qualify for reit status. our failure to comply with the complex reit rules at the subsidiary reit level can materially and adversely impact eqr's reit status.
even a technical or inadvertent mistake could jeopardize our reit status; however, the reit qualification rules permit reits in certain circumstances to pay a monetary penalty for inadvertent mistakes rather than lose reit status. there is also risk that congress and the irs might make changes to the tax laws and regulations, and the courts might issue new rulings that make it more difficult, or impossible, for us to remain qualified as a reit. we do not believe, however, that any pending or proposed tax law changes would jeopardize our reit status.
if we fail to qualify as a reit, we would be subject to federal income tax at regular corporate rates. also, unless the irs granted us relief under certain statutory provisions, we would remain disqualified from taxation as a reit for four years following the year in which we failed to qualify as a reit. if we fail to qualify as a reit, we would have to pay significant income taxes. we therefore would have less money available for investments or for distributions to security holders. this would likely have a significant adverse effect on the value of our securities. in addition, we would no longer be required to make any distributions to security holders. even if we qualify as a reit, we are and will continue to be subject to certain federal, state and local taxes on our income and property. in addition, various business activities which generate income that is not qualifying income for a reit are conducted through taxable reit subsidiaries and will be subject to federal and state income tax at regular corporate rates to the extent they generate taxable income.
if any of our prior merger partners had failed to qualify as a reit throughout the duration of their existence, then they might have had undistributed "subchapter c corporation earnings and profits" at the time of their merger with us. if that were the case and we did not distribute those earnings and profits prior to the end of the year in which the merger took place, we might not qualify as a reit. we believe, based in part upon opinions of legal counsel received pursuant to the terms of our merger agreements as well as our own investigations, among other things, that each of our prior merger partners qualified as a reit and that, in any event, none of them had any undistributed "subchapter c corporation earnings and profits" at the time of their merger with us. if any of our prior merger partners failed to qualify as a reit, an additional concern would be that they could have been required to recognize taxable gain at the time they merged with us. we would be liable for the tax on such gain. we also could
have to pay corporate income tax on any gain existing at the time of the applicable merger on assets acquired in the merger if the assets are sold within ten years of the merger.
compliance with reit distribution requirements may affect our financial condition and our shareholders' liquidity.
distribution requirements may increase the indebtedness of the company.
we may be required from time to time, under certain circumstances, to accrue as income for tax purposes interest and rent earned but not yet received. in such event, or upon our repayment of principal on debt, we could have taxable income without sufficient cash to enable us to meet the distribution requirements of a reit. accordingly, we could be required to borrow funds or liquidate investments on adverse terms in order to meet these distribution requirements.
tax elections regarding distributions may impact future liquidity of the company or our shareholders.
under certain circumstances we have made and/or may consider making again in the future, a tax election to treat future distributions to shareholders as distributions in the current year. this election, which is provided for in the internal revenue code, may allow us to avoid increasing our dividends or paying additional income taxes in the current year. however, this could result in a constraint on our ability to decrease our dividends in future years without creating risk of either violating the reit distribution requirements or generating additional income tax liability.
the internal revenue service has published several rulings that allow reits to offer shareholders the choice of stock or cash with respect to the receipt of a dividend (an "elective stock dividend"). however, reits are also permitted to limit the amount of cash paid to all shareholders to 20% of the total dividend paid. therefore, it is possible that the total tax burden to shareholders resulting from an elective stock dividend may exceed the amount of cash received by the shareholder.
federal income tax considerations general the following discussion summarizes the federal income tax considerations material to a holder of common shares. it is not exhaustive of all possible tax considerations. for example, it does not give a detailed discussion of any state, local or foreign tax considerations. the following discussion also does not address all tax matters that may be relevant to prospective shareholders in light of their particular circumstances. moreover, it does not address all tax matters that may be relevant to shareholders who are subject to special treatment under the tax laws, such as insurance companies, tax-exempt entities, financial institutions or broker-dealers, foreign corporations, persons who are not citizens or residents of the united states and persons who own shares through a partnership or other entity treated as a flow-through entity for federal income tax purposes.
the specific tax attributes of a particular shareholder could have a material impact on the tax considerations associated with the purchase, ownership and disposition of common shares. therefore, it is essential that each prospective shareholder consult with his or her own tax advisors with regard to the application of the federal income tax laws to the shareholder's personal tax situation, as well as any tax consequences arising under the laws of any state, local or foreign taxing jurisdiction.
the information in this section is based on the current internal revenue code, current, temporary and proposed treasury regulations, the legislative history of the internal revenue code, current administrative interpretations and practices of the internal revenue service, including its practices and policies as set forth in private letter rulings, which are not binding on the internal revenue service, and existing court decisions. future legislation, regulations, administrative interpretations and court decisions could change current law or adversely affect existing interpretations of current law. any change could apply retroactively. thus, it is possible that the internal revenue service could challenge the statements in this discussion, which do not bind the internal revenue service or the courts, and that a court could agree with the internal revenue service.
comprehensive tax reform the potential enactment of comprehensive u.s. federal tax reform legislation may adversely impact the taxation of the reit, its subsidiaries or its shareholders. tax reform legislation could result in a material increase in both our federal and state tax liabilities and may change the size and tax character of our distributions in a way that increases our shareholders' tax liabilities as compared to current law or requires the company to distribute more than it otherwise would have. in addition, comprehensive tax reform could increase the complexity of our compliance efforts and increase tax compliance costs and could have a material impact on our operations.
our taxation we elected reit status beginning with the year that ended december 31, 1992. in any year in which we qualify as a reit, we generally will not be subject to federal income tax on the portion of our reit taxable income or capital gain that we distribute to our shareholders. this treatment substantially eliminates the double taxation that applies to most corporations, which pay a tax on their income and then distribute dividends to shareholders who are in turn taxed on the amount they receive. we elected taxable reit subsidiary status for certain of our corporate subsidiaries engaged in activities which cannot be performed directly by a reit, such as condominium conversion and sale activities. as a result, we will be subject to federal income tax on the taxable income generated by these activities in our taxable reit subsidiaries.
we will be subject to federal income tax at regular corporate rates upon our reit taxable income or capital gains that we do not distribute to our shareholders. in addition, we will be subject to a 4% excise tax if we do not satisfy specific reit distribution requirements. we could also be subject to the "alternative minimum tax" on our items of tax preference. in addition, any net income from "prohibited transactions" (i.e., dispositions of property, other than property held by a taxable reit subsidiary, held primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business) will be subject to a 100% tax. we could also be subject to a 100% penalty tax on certain payments received from or on certain expenses deducted by a taxable reit subsidiary if any such transaction is not respected by the internal revenue service. if we fail to satisfy the 75% gross income test or the 95% gross income test (described below) but have maintained our qualification as a reit because we satisfied certain other requirements, we will still generally be subject to a 100% penalty tax on the taxable income attributable to the gross income that caused the income test failure. if we fail to satisfy any of the reit asset tests (described below) by more than a de minimis amount, due to reasonable cause, and we nonetheless maintain our reit qualification because of specified cure provisions, we will be required to pay a tax equal to the greater of $50,000 or the highest marginal corporate tax rate multiplied by the net income generated by the non-qualifying assets. if we fail to satisfy any provision of the internal revenue code that would result in our failure to qualify as a reit (other than a violation of the reit gross income or asset tests described below) and the violation is due to reasonable cause, we may retain our reit qualification but we will be required to pay a penalty of $50,000 for each such failure. moreover, we may be subject to taxes in certain situations and on certain transactions that we do not presently contemplate.
we believe that we have qualified as a reit for all of our taxable years beginning with 1992. we also believe that our current structure and method of operation is such that we will continue to qualify as a reit. however, given the complexity of the reit qualification requirements, we cannot provide any assurance that the actual results of our operations have satisfied or will satisfy the requirements under the internal revenue code for a particular year.
if we fail to qualify for taxation as a reit in any taxable year and the relief provisions described herein do not apply, we will be subject to tax on our taxable income at regular corporate rates. we also may be subject to the corporate "alternative minimum tax." as a result, our failure to qualify as a reit would significantly reduce the cash we have available to distribute to our shareholders. unless entitled to statutory relief, we would not be able to re-elect to be taxed as a reit until our fifth taxable year after the year of disqualification. it is not possible to state whether we would be entitled to statutory relief.
our qualification and taxation as a reit depend on our ability to satisfy various requirements under the internal revenue code. we are required to satisfy these requirements on a continuing basis through actual annual operating and other results. accordingly, there can be no assurance that we will be able to continue to operate in a manner so as to remain qualified as a reit.
ownership of taxable reit subsidiaries by us. the internal revenue code provides that reits may own greater than ten percent of the voting power and value of the securities of a "taxable reit subsidiary" or "trs", provided that the aggregate value of all of the trs securities held by the reit does not exceed 25% of the reit's total asset value (20% for taxable years beginning january 1, 2018). trss are corporations subject to tax as a regular "c" corporation that have elected, jointly with a reit, to be a trs. generally, a taxable reit subsidiary may own assets that cannot otherwise be owned by a reit and can perform impermissible tenant services (discussed below), which would otherwise taint our rental income under the reit income tests. however, the reit will be obligated to pay a 100% penalty tax on some payments that we receive or on certain expenses deducted by our trss if the economic arrangements between us, our tenants and the trs are not comparable to similar arrangements among unrelated parties. a trs may also receive income from prohibited transactions without incurring the 100% federal income tax liability imposed on reits. income from prohibited transactions may include the purchase and sale of land, the purchase and sale of completed development properties and the sale of condominium units.
trss pay federal and state income tax at the full applicable corporate rates. the amount of taxes paid on impermissible tenant services income and the sale of real estate held primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business may be
material in amount. the trss will attempt to reduce, if possible, the amount of these taxes, but we cannot guarantee whether, or the extent to which, measures taken to reduce these taxes will be successful. to the extent that these companies are required to pay taxes, less cash may be available for distributions to shareholders.
share ownership test and organizational requirement. in order to qualify as a reit, our shares of beneficial interest must be held by a minimum of 100 persons for at least 335 days of a taxable year that is 12 months, or during a proportionate part of a taxable year of less than 12 months. also, not more than 50% in value of our shares of beneficial interest may be owned directly or indirectly by applying certain constructive ownership rules, by five or fewer individuals during the last half of each taxable year. in addition, we must meet certain other organizational requirements, including, but not limited to, that (i) the beneficial ownership in us is evidenced by transferable shares and (ii) we are managed by one or more trustees. we believe that we have satisfied all of these tests and all other organizational requirements and that we will continue to do so in the future. in order to ensure compliance with the 100 person test and the 50% share ownership test discussed above, we have placed certain restrictions on the transfer of our shares that are intended to prevent further concentration of share ownership. however, such restrictions may not prevent us from failing these requirements, and thereby failing to qualify as a reit.
(1)   at least 75% of our gross income for each taxable year must generally be derived directly or indirectly from rents from real property, interest on obligations secured by mortgages on real property or on interests in real property, gain from the sale or other disposition of non-dealer real property and shares of reit stock, dividends paid by another reit and from some types of temporary investments (excluding certain hedging income).
(2)   at least 95% of our gross income for each taxable year must generally be derived from sources qualifying under the 75% test described in (1) above, non-reit dividends, non-real estate mortgage interest and gain from the sale or disposition of non-reit stock or securities (excluding certain hedging income).
to qualify as rents from real property for the purpose of satisfying the gross income tests, rental payments must generally be received from unrelated persons and not be based on the net income of the resident. also, the rent attributable to personal property must not exceed 15% of the total rent. we may generally provide services to residents without "tainting" our rental income only if such services are "usually or customarily rendered" in connection with the rental of real property and not otherwise considered "impermissible services". if such services are impermissible, then we may generally provide them only if they are considered de minimis in amount, or are provided through an independent contractor from whom we derive no revenue and that meets other requirements, or through a taxable reit subsidiary. we believe that services provided to residents by us either are usually or customarily rendered in connection with the rental of real property and not otherwise considered impermissible, or, if considered impermissible services, will meet the de minimis test or will be provided by an independent contractor or taxable reit subsidiary. however, we cannot provide any assurance that the internal revenue service will agree with these positions.
if we fail to satisfy one or both of the gross income tests for any taxable year, we may nevertheless qualify as a reit for the year if we are entitled to relief under certain provisions of the internal revenue code. in this case, a penalty tax would still be applicable as discussed above. generally, it is not possible to state whether in all circumstances we would be entitled to the benefit of these relief provisions and in the event these relief provisions do not apply, we will not qualify as a reit.
asset tests. in general, on the last day of each quarter of our taxable year, we must satisfy five tests relating to the nature of our assets:
(1)   at least 75% of the value of our total assets must consist of real estate assets (which include for this purpose shares in other real estate investment trusts) and certain cash related items;
(2)   not more than 25% of the value of our total assets may consist of securities other than those in the 75% asset class;
(3)   except for securities included in item 1 above, equity investments in other reits, qualified reit subsidiaries (i.e., corporations owned 100% by a reit that are not trss or reits), or taxable reit subsidiaries: (a) the value of any one issuer's securities owned by us may not exceed 5% of the value of our total assets and (b) we may not own securities representing more than 10% of the voting power or value of the outstanding securities of any one issuer;
(4)   not more than 25% of the value of our total assets may consist of securities of one or more taxable reit subsidiaries (20% for taxable years beginning january 1, 2018); and
(5)   not more than 25% of the value of our total assets may be represented by nonqualified publicly offered reit debt instruments.
the 10% value test described in clause (3)(b) above does not apply to nonqualified publicly offered reit debt instruments or to certain securities that fall within a safe harbor under the code. under the safe harbor, the following are not considered "securities" held by us for purposes of this 10% value test: (i) straight debt securities, (ii) any loan of an individual or an estate, (iii) certain rental agreements for the use of tangible property, (iv) any obligation to pay rents from real property, (v) any security issued by a state or any political subdivision thereof, foreign government or puerto rico only if the determination of any payment under such security is not based on the profits of another entity or payments on any obligation issued by such other entity, or (vi) any security issued by a reit. the timing and payment of interest or principal on a security qualifying as straight debt may be subject to a contingency provided that (a) such contingency does not change the effective yield to maturity, not considering a de minimis change which does not exceed the greater of 1⁄4 of 1% or 5% of the annual yield to maturity or we own $1,000,000 or less of the aggregate issue price or value of the particular issuer's debt and not more than 12 months of unaccrued interest can be required to be prepaid or (b) the contingency is consistent with commercial practice and the contingency is effective upon a default or the exercise of a prepayment right by the issuer of the debt. if we hold indebtedness from any issuer, including a reit, the indebtedness will be subject to, and may cause a violation of, the asset tests, unless it is a qualifying real estate asset or otherwise satisfies the above safe harbor. we currently own equity interests in certain entities that have elected to be taxed as reits for federal income tax purposes and are not publicly traded. if any such entity were to fail to qualify as a reit, we would not meet the 10% voting stock limitation and the 10% value limitation and we would, unless certain relief provisions applied, fail to qualify as a reit. we believe that we and each of the reits we own an interest in have and will comply with the foregoing asset tests for reit qualification. however, we cannot provide any assurance that the internal revenue service will agree with our determinations.
if we fail to satisfy the 5% or 10% asset tests described above after a 30-day cure period provided in the internal revenue code, we will be deemed to have met such tests if the value of our non-qualifying assets is de minimis (i.e., does not exceed the lesser of 1% of the total value of our assets at the end of the applicable quarter or $10,000,000) and we dispose of the non-qualifying assets within six months after the last day of the quarter in which the failure to satisfy the asset tests is discovered. for violations due to reasonable cause and not willful neglect that are in excess of the de minimis exception described above, we may avoid disqualification as a reit under any of the asset tests, after the 30-day cure period, by disposing of sufficient assets to meet the asset test within such six month period, paying a tax equal to the greater of $50,000 or the highest corporate tax rate multiplied by the net income generated by the non-qualifying assets and disclosing certain information to the internal revenue service. if we cannot avail ourselves of these relief provisions, or if we fail to timely cure any noncompliance with the asset tests, we would cease to qualify as a reit.
annual distribution requirements. to qualify as a reit, we are generally required to distribute dividends, other than capital gain dividends, to our shareholders each year in an amount at least equal to 90% of our reit taxable income. these distributions must be paid either in the taxable year to which they relate, or in the following taxable year if declared before we timely file our tax return for the prior year and if paid with or before the first regular dividend payment date after the declaration is made. we intend to make timely distributions sufficient to satisfy our annual distribution requirements. to the extent that we do not distribute all of our net capital gain or distribute at least 90%, but less than 100% of our reit taxable income, as adjusted, we are subject to tax on these amounts at regular corporate rates. we will be subject to a 4% excise tax on the excess of the required distribution over the sum of amounts actually distributed and amounts retained for which federal income tax was paid, if we fail to distribute during each calendar year at least the sum of: (1) 85% of our reit ordinary income for the year; (2) 95% of our reit capital gain net income for the year; and (3) any undistributed taxable income from prior taxable years. a reit may elect to retain rather than distribute all or a portion of its net capital gains and pay the tax on the gains. in that case, a reit may elect to have its shareholders include their proportionate share of the undistributed net capital gains in income as long-term capital gains and receive a credit for their share of the tax paid by the reit. for purposes of the 4% excise tax described above, any retained amounts would be treated as having been distributed.
ownership of partnership interests by us. as a result of our ownership of the operating partnership, we will be considered to own and derive our proportionate share of the assets and items of income of the operating partnership, respectively, for purposes of the reit asset and income tests, including its share of assets and items of income of any subsidiaries that are partnerships or limited liability companies.
state and local taxes. we may be subject to state or local taxation in various jurisdictions, including those in which we transact business or reside. generally reits have seen increases in state and local taxes in recent years. our state and local tax treatment may not conform to the federal income tax treatment discussed above and any changes in the federal tax code may not be adopted by the states, potentially leading to material tax liabilities for the company and its shareholders. consequently, prospective shareholders should consult their own tax advisors regarding the effect of state and local tax laws on an investment in common shares.
taxation of domestic shareholders subject to u.s. tax general. if we qualify as a reit, distributions made to our taxable domestic shareholders with respect to their common shares, other than capital gain distributions and distributions attributable to taxable reit subsidiaries, will be treated as ordinary income to the extent that the distributions come out of earnings and profits. these distributions will not be eligible for the dividends received deduction for shareholders that are corporations nor will they constitute "qualified dividend income" under the internal revenue code, meaning that such dividends will be taxed at marginal rates applicable to ordinary income rather than the special capital gain rates currently applicable to qualified dividend income distributed to shareholders who satisfy applicable holding period requirements. in determining whether distributions are out of earnings and profits, we will allocate our earnings and profits first to preferred shares and second to the common shares. the portion of ordinary dividends which represent ordinary dividends we receive from a trs, will be designated as "qualified dividend income" to reit shareholders. these qualified dividends are eligible for preferential tax rates if paid to our non-corporate shareholders.
to the extent we make distributions to our taxable domestic shareholders in excess of our earnings and profits, such distributions will be considered a return of capital. such distributions will be treated as a tax-free distribution and will reduce the tax basis of a shareholder's common shares by the amount of the distribution so treated. to the extent such distributions cumulatively exceed a taxable domestic shareholder's tax basis, such distributions are taxable as gain from the sale of shares. shareholders may not include in their individual income tax returns any of our net operating losses or capital losses.
dividends declared by a reit in october, november, or december are deemed to have been paid by the reit and received by its shareholders on december 31 of that year, so long as the dividends are actually paid during january of the following year. however, this treatment only applies to the extent of the reit's earnings and profits existing on december 31. to the extent the shareholder distribution paid in january exceeds available earnings and profits as of december 31, the excess will be treated as a distribution taxable to shareholders in the year paid. as such, for tax reporting purposes, january distributions paid to our shareholders may be split between two tax years.
a reit may make an election under the internal revenue code to treat certain dividends that are paid in a taxable year, as being made by the reit in the previous taxable year. a shareholder is required to include the amount of the dividend in the taxable year that it is paid by the reit.
distributions made by us that we properly designate as capital gain dividends will be taxable to taxable domestic shareholders as gain from the sale or exchange of a capital asset held for more than one year. this treatment applies only to the extent that the designated distributions do not exceed our actual net capital gain for the taxable year or the amount of distributions treated as dividends for the taxable year. it applies regardless of the period for which a domestic shareholder has held his or her common shares. despite this general rule, corporate shareholders may be required to treat up to 20% of certain capital gain dividends as ordinary income.
generally, our designated capital gain dividends will be broken out into net capital gains distributions (which are taxable to taxable domestic shareholders that are individuals, estates or trusts at a maximum rate of 20% for individual taxpayers in the highest tax bracket) and unrecaptured section 1250 gain distributions (which are taxable to taxable domestic shareholders that are individuals, estates or trusts at a maximum rate of 25%).
certain u.s. shareholders that are taxed as individuals, estates or trusts may also be required to pay an additional 3.8% tax on, among other things, dividends on and capital gains from the sale or other disposition of shares.
if, for any taxable year, we elect to designate as capital gain dividends any portion of the dividends paid or made available for the year to holders of all classes of shares of beneficial interest, then the portion of the capital gains dividends that will be allocable to the holders of common shares will be the total capital gain dividends multiplied by a fraction. the numerator of the fraction will be the total dividends paid or made available to the holders of the common shares for the year. the denominator of the fraction will be the total dividends paid or made available to holders of all classes of shares of beneficial interest.
we may elect to retain (rather than distribute as is generally required) net capital gain for a taxable year and pay the income tax on that gain. if we make this election, shareholders must include in income, as long-term capital gain, their proportionate share of the undistributed net capital gain. shareholders will be treated as having paid their proportionate share of the tax paid by us on these gains. accordingly, they will receive a tax credit or refund for the amount. shareholders will increase the basis in their common shares by the difference between the amount of capital gain included in their income and the amount of the tax they are treated as having paid. our earnings and profits will be adjusted appropriately.
in general, a shareholder will recognize gain or loss for federal income tax purposes on the sale or other disposition of common shares in an amount equal to the difference between:
(a)   the amount of cash and the fair market value of any property received in the sale or other disposition; and
the gain or loss will be capital gain or loss if the common shares were held as a capital asset. generally, the capital gain or loss will be long-term capital gain or loss if the common shares were held for more than one year.
in general, a loss recognized by a shareholder upon the sale of common shares that were held for six months or less, determined after applying certain holding period rules, will be treated as long-term capital loss to the extent that the shareholder received distributions that were treated as long-term capital gains. for shareholders who are individuals, trusts and estates, the long-term capital loss will be apportioned among the applicable long-term capital gain rates to the extent that distributions received by the shareholder were previously so treated.
taxation of domestic tax-exempt shareholders most tax-exempt organizations are not subject to federal income tax except to the extent of their unrelated business taxable income, which is often referred to as ubti. unless a tax-exempt shareholder holds its common shares as debt financed property or uses the common shares in an unrelated trade or business, distributions to the shareholder should not constitute ubti. similarly, if a tax-exempt shareholder sells common shares, the income from the sale should not constitute ubti unless the shareholder held the shares as debt financed property or used the shares in a trade or business.
however, for tax-exempt shareholders that are social clubs, voluntary employee benefit associations, supplemental unemployment benefit trusts, and qualified group legal services plans, income from owning or selling common shares will constitute ubti unless the organization is able to properly deduct amounts set aside or placed in reserve so as to offset the income generated by its investment in common shares. these shareholders should consult their own tax advisors concerning these set aside and reserve requirements which are set forth in the internal revenue code.
in addition, certain pension trusts that own more than 10% of a "pension-held reit" must report a portion of the distributions that they receive from the reit as ubti. we have not been and do not expect to be treated as a pension-held reit for purposes of this rule.
taxation of foreign shareholders the following is a discussion of certain anticipated united states federal income tax consequences of the ownership and disposition of common shares applicable to a foreign shareholder. for purposes of this discussion, a "foreign shareholder" is any person other than:
(a)   a citizen or resident of the united states;
(b)   a corporation or partnership created or organized in the united states or under the laws of the united states or of any state thereof; or
(c)   an estate or trust whose income is includable in gross income for united states federal income tax purposes regardless of its source.
distributions by us. distributions by us to a foreign shareholder that are neither attributable to gain from sales or exchanges by us of united states real property interests nor designated by us as capital gains dividends will be treated as dividends of ordinary income to the extent that they are made out of our earnings and profits. these distributions ordinarily will be subject to withholding of united states federal income tax on a gross basis at a 30% rate, or a lower treaty rate, unless the dividends are treated as effectively connected with the conduct by the foreign shareholder of a united states trade or business. please note that under certain treaties lower withholding rates generally applicable to dividends do not apply to dividends from reits. dividends that are effectively connected with a united states trade or business will be subject to tax on a net basis at graduated rates, and are generally not subject to withholding. certification and disclosure requirements must be satisfied before a dividend is exempt from withholding under this exemption. a foreign shareholder that is a corporation also may be subject to an additional branch profits tax at a 30% rate or a lower treaty rate.
we expect to withhold united states income tax at the rate of 30% on any such distributions made to a foreign shareholder unless:
if such distribution is in excess of our current or accumulated earnings and profits, it will not be taxable to a foreign shareholder to the extent that the distribution does not exceed the adjusted basis of the shareholder's common shares. instead, the distribution will reduce the adjusted basis of the common shares. to the extent that the distribution exceeds the adjusted basis of the common shares, it will give rise to gain from the sale or exchange of the shareholder's common shares. the tax treatment of this gain is described below.
we intend to withhold at a rate of 30%, or a lower applicable treaty rate, on the entire amount of any distribution not designated as a capital gain distribution. in such event, a foreign shareholder may seek a refund of the withheld amount from the irs if it is subsequently determined that the distribution was, in fact, in excess of our earnings and profits, and the amount withheld exceeded the foreign shareholder's united states tax liability with respect to the distribution.
distributions to a foreign shareholder that we designate at the time of the distributions as capital gain dividends, other than those arising from the disposition of a united states real property interest, generally will not be subject to united states federal income taxation unless:
(a)   the investment in the common shares is effectively connected with the foreign shareholder's united states trade or business, in which case the foreign shareholder will be subject to the same treatment as domestic shareholders, except that a shareholder that is a foreign corporation may also be subject to the branch profits tax, as discussed above; or
(b)   the foreign shareholder is a nonresident alien individual who is present in the united states for 183 days or more during the taxable year and has a "tax home" in the united states, in which case the nonresident alien individual will be subject to a 30% tax on the individual's capital gains.
under the foreign investment in real property tax act, which is known as firpta, distributions to a foreign shareholder (other than certain qualified shareholders and qualified foreign pension funds discussed below) that are attributable to gain from sales or exchanges of united states real property interests will cause the foreign shareholder to be treated as recognizing the gain as income effectively connected with a united states trade or business. this rule applies whether or not a distribution is designated as a capital gain dividend. accordingly, foreign shareholders generally would be taxed on these distributions at the same rates applicable to u.s. shareholders, subject to a special alternative minimum tax in the case of nonresident alien individuals. in addition, a foreign corporate shareholder might be subject to the branch profits tax discussed above, as well as u.s. federal income tax return filing requirements. we are required to withhold 35% of these distributions. the withheld amount can be credited against the foreign shareholder's united states federal income tax liability.
although the law is not entirely clear on the matter, it appears that amounts we designate as undistributed capital gains in respect of the common shares held by u.s. shareholders would be treated with respect to foreign shareholders in the same manner as actual distributions of capital gain dividends. under that approach, foreign shareholders would be able to offset as a credit against their united states federal income tax liability their proportionate share of the tax paid by us on these undistributed capital gains. in addition, if timely requested, foreign shareholders might be able to receive from the irs a refund to the extent their proportionate share of the tax paid by us were to exceed their actual united states federal income tax liability.
foreign shareholders' sales of common shares. gain recognized by a foreign shareholder upon the sale or exchange of common shares generally will not be subject to united states taxation unless the shares constitute a "united states real property interest" within the meaning of firpta. the common shares will not constitute a united states real property interest so long as we are a domestically controlled reit. a domestically controlled reit is a reit in which at all times during a specified testing period less than 50% in value of its stock is held directly or indirectly by foreign shareholders. we believe that we are a domestically controlled reit. therefore, we believe that the sale of common shares will not be subject to taxation under firpta. however, because common shares and preferred shares are publicly traded, we cannot guarantee that we will continue to be a domestically controlled reit. in any event, gain from the sale or exchange of common shares not otherwise subject to firpta will be subject to u.s. tax, if either:
(a)   the investment in the common shares is effectively connected with the foreign shareholder's united states trade or business, in which case the foreign shareholder will be subject to the same treatment as domestic shareholders with respect to the gain; or
(b)   the foreign shareholder is a nonresident alien individual who is present in the united states for 183 days or more during the taxable year and has a tax home in the united states, in which case the nonresident alien individual will be subject to a 30% tax on the individual's capital gains.
even if we do not qualify as or cease to be a domestically controlled reit, gain arising from the sale or exchange by a foreign shareholder of common shares still would not be subject to united states taxation under firpta as a sale of a united states real property interest if:
(a)   the class or series of shares being sold is "regularly traded," as defined by applicable irs regulations, on an established securities market such as the new york stock exchange; and
(b)   the selling foreign shareholder owned 10% or less of the value of the outstanding class or series of shares being sold throughout the five-year period ending on the date of the sale or exchange.
if gain on the sale or exchange of common shares were subject to taxation under firpta, the foreign shareholder would be subject to regular united states income tax with respect to the gain in the same manner as a taxable u.s. shareholder, subject to any applicable alternative minimum tax, a special alternative minimum tax in the case of nonresident alien individuals and the possible application of the branch profits tax in the case of foreign corporations. the purchaser of the common shares would be required to withhold and remit to the irs 15% of the purchase price.
exception to firpta for qualified shareholders. for dispositions and distributions after december 18, 2015, stock of a reit held (directly or through partnerships) by a "qualified shareholder" will not be treated as united states real property interest, and capital gain dividends from such a reit will not be treated as gain from the sale of a united states real property interest. this exception does not apply to persons that hold an interest, taking into account applicable constructive ownership rules, more than 10% of the stock of the reit (unless that interest is solely as a creditor (an "applicable investor")). if the qualified shareholder has such an "applicable investor," the portion of reit stock indirectly owned through the qualified shareholder by the applicable investor will be treated as gains from the sale of united states real property interests. for these purposes, a "qualified shareholder" is a foreign person which is in a treaty jurisdiction and satisfies certain publicly traded requirements, is a "qualified collective investment vehicle" and maintains records on the identity of certain 5% owners. a "qualified collective investment vehicle" is a foreign person that is eligible for a reduced withholding rate with respect to ordinary reit dividends even if such person holds more than 10% of the reit's stock, a publicly traded partnership that is a withholding foreign partnership that would be a united states real property holding corporation if it were a united states corporation, or is designated as a qualified collective investment vehicle by the secretary of the treasury and is either fiscally transparent within the meaning of the code or required to include dividends in its gross income but entitled to a deduction for distribution to its investors. finally, capital gain dividends and nondividend redemption and liquidating distributions to a qualified shareholder that are not allocable to an applicable investor will be treated as ordinary dividends.
exception to firpta withholding for qualified foreign pension funds. for distributions or disposition of reit stock after december 18, 2015, "qualified foreign pension funds" and entities that are wholly owned by a qualified foreign pension fund are exempted from firpta withholding. for these purposes, a "qualified foreign pension fund" is any trust, corporation, or other organization or arrangement if (i) it was created or organized under foreign law, (ii) it was established to provide retirement or pension benefits to participants or beneficiaries that are current or former employees (or persons designated by such employees) of one or more employers in consideration for services rendered, (iii) it does not have a single participant or beneficiary with a right to more than 5% of its assets or income, (iv) it is subject to government regulation and provides annual information reporting about its beneficiaries to the relevant tax authorities in the country in which it is established or operates, and (v) under the laws of the country in which it is established or operates, either contributions to such fund which would otherwise be subject to tax under such laws are deductible or excluded from the gross income of such fund or taxed at a reduced rate, or taxation of any investment income of such fund is deferred or such income is taxed at a reduced rate.
information reporting requirement and backup withholding we will report to our domestic shareholders and the internal revenue service the amount of distributions paid during each calendar year and the amount of tax withheld, if any. under certain circumstances, domestic shareholders may be subject to backup withholding. backup withholding will apply only if such domestic shareholder fails to furnish certain information to us or the internal revenue service. backup withholding will not apply with respect to payments made to certain exempt recipients, such as corporations and tax-exempt organizations. domestic shareholders should consult their own tax advisors regarding their qualification for exemption from backup withholding and the procedure for obtaining such an exemption. backup withholding is not an additional tax. rather, the amount of any backup withholding with respect to a payment to a domestic shareholder will be allowed as a credit against such person's united states federal income tax liability and may entitle such person to a refund,
provided that the required information is timely furnished to the internal revenue service.
withholding on foreign financial institutions and non-u.s. shareholders the foreign account tax compliance act ("fatca") imposes a u.s. withholding tax at a 30% rate on dividends and on proceeds from the sale of our shares paid beginning january 1, 2019 to "foreign financial institutions" (as defined under fatca) and certain other foreign entities if certain due diligence and disclosure requirements related to u.s. accounts with, or ownership of, such entities are not satisfied or an exemption does not apply. if fatca withholding is imposed, non-u.s. beneficial owners that are otherwise eligible for an exemption from, or a reduction of, u.s. withholding tax with respect to such distributions and sale proceeds would be required to seek a refund from the internal revenue service to obtain the benefit of such exemption or reduction. any payment made by us that is subject to withholding under fatca or otherwise will be net of the amount required to be withheld.
item 7.   management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis of the results of operations and financial condition of the company and the operating partnership should be read in connection with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto. due to the company's ability to control the operating partnership and its subsidiaries, the operating partnership and each such subsidiary entity has been consolidated with the company for financial reporting purposes, except for two unconsolidated operating properties. capitalized terms used herein and not defined are as defined elsewhere in this annual report on form 10-k for the year ended december 31, 2016.
forward-looking statements forward-looking statements in this item 7 as well as elsewhere in this annual report on form 10-k are intended to be made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of 1995. these statements are based on current expectations, estimates, projections and assumptions made by management. while the company's management believes the assumptions underlying its forward-looking statements are reasonable, such information is inherently subject to uncertainties and may involve certain risks, which could cause actual results, performance or achievements of the company to differ materially from anticipated future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. many of these uncertainties and risks are difficult to predict and beyond management's control. forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance, results or events. the forward-looking statements contained herein are made as of the date hereof and the company undertakes no obligation to update or supplement these forward-looking statements. factors that might cause such differences include, but are not limited to the following:
•   we intend to actively acquire, develop and rehab multifamily properties for rental operations as market conditions dictate. we may also acquire multifamily properties that are unoccupied or in the early stages of lease up. we may
be unable to lease up these apartment properties on schedule, resulting in decreases in expected rental revenues and/or lower yields due to lower occupancy and rental rates as well as higher than expected concessions or higher than expected operating expenses. we may not be able to achieve rents that are consistent with expectations for acquired, developed or rehabbed properties. we may underestimate the costs necessary to bring an acquired property up to standards established for its intended market position, to complete a development property or to complete a rehab. additionally, we expect that other real estate investors with capital will compete with us for attractive investment opportunities or may also develop properties in markets where we focus our development and acquisition efforts. this competition (or lack thereof) may increase (or depress) prices for multifamily properties. we may not be in a position or have the opportunity in the future to make suitable property acquisitions on favorable terms. we have acquired in the past and intend to continue to pursue the acquisition of properties, including large portfolios of properties, that could increase our size and result in alterations to our capital structure. the total number of apartment units under development, costs of development and estimated completion dates are subject to uncertainties arising from changing economic conditions (such as the cost of labor and construction materials), competition and local government regulation;
•   debt financing and other capital required by the company may not be available or may only be available on adverse terms;
•   labor and materials required for maintenance, repair, capital expenditure or development may be more expensive than anticipated;
•   occupancy levels and market rents may be adversely affected by national and local political, economic and market conditions including, without limitation, new construction and excess inventory of multifamily and owned housing/condominiums, increasing portions of owned housing/condominium stock being converted to rental use, rental housing subsidized by the government, other government programs that favor single family rental housing or owner occupied housing over multifamily rental housing, governmental regulations, slow or negative employment growth and household formation, the availability of low-interest mortgages or the availability of mortgages requiring little or no down payment for single family home buyers, changes in social preferences and the potential for geopolitical instability, all of which are beyond the company's control; and
•   additional factors as discussed in part i of this annual report on form 10-k, particularly those under "item 1a. risk factors".
forward-looking statements and related uncertainties are also included in the notes to consolidated financial statements in this report.
overview equity residential ("eqr"), a maryland real estate investment trust ("reit") formed in march 1993, is an s&p 500 company focused on the acquisition, development and management of rental apartment properties in urban and high-density suburban coastal gateway markets where today's affluent renters want to live, work and play. erp operating limited partnership ("erpop"), an illinois limited partnership, was formed in may 1993 to conduct the multifamily residential property business of equity residential. eqr has elected to be taxed as a reit. references to the "company," "we," "us" or "our" mean collectively eqr, erpop and those entities/subsidiaries owned or controlled by eqr and/or erpop. references to the "operating partnership" mean collectively erpop and those entities/subsidiaries owned or controlled by erpop.
eqr is the general partner of, and as of december 31, 2016 owned an approximate 96.2% ownership interest in, erpop. all of the company's property ownership, development and related business operations are conducted through the operating partnership and eqr has no material assets or liabilities other than its investment in erpop. eqr issues equity from time to time, the net proceeds of which it is obligated to contribute to erpop, but does not have any indebtedness as all debt is incurred by the operating partnership. the operating partnership holds substantially all of the assets of the company, including the company's ownership interests in its joint ventures. the operating partnership conducts the operations of the business and is structured as a partnership with no publicly traded equity.
the company's corporate headquarters is located in chicago, illinois and the company also operates property management offices in each of its six core coastal markets. as of december 31, 2016, the company had approximately 2,700 employees who provided real estate operations, leasing, legal, financial, accounting, acquisition, disposition, development and other support functions.
business objectives and operating and investing strategies the company invests in apartment communities located in strategically targeted markets with the goal of maximizing our risk adjusted total return (operating income plus capital appreciation) on invested capital.
we seek to maximize the income and capital appreciation of our properties by investing in markets that are characterized by conditions favorable to multifamily property operations and appreciation. we are focused on the six coastal markets of boston, new york, washington d.c., southern california (including los angeles, orange county and san diego), san francisco and seattle. these markets generally feature one or more of the following characteristics that allow us to increase rents:
•   strong economic growth leading to job growth and household formation, which in turn leads to high demand for our apartments;
•   urban core and high-density suburban locations with an attractive quality of life leading to high resident demand and retention;
•   favorable demographics contributing to a larger pool of target residents with a high propensity to rent apartments; and
•   higher barriers to entry where, because of land scarcity or government regulation, it is typically more difficult or costly to build new apartment properties, creating limits on new supply.
we believe our strategy also capitalizes on the increasing preference of renters of all ages to live in the urban core of cities or dense suburban locations near transit, entertainment and cultural amenities. millennials, the 83 million people between ages 18 and 34, are a prime apartment rental demographic. reports also show a growing trend among aging baby boomers, a demographic of more than 76 million people between the ages of 53 and 71, toward apartment rentals. we believe that both groups appreciate the locational values described above as well as the flexibility that rental apartments offer.
our operating focus is on balancing occupancy and rental rates to maximize our revenue while exercising tight cost control to generate the highest possible return to our shareholders. revenue is maximized by attracting qualified prospects to our properties, cost-effectively converting these prospects into new residents and keeping our residents satisfied so they will renew their leases upon expiration. while we believe that it is our high-quality, well-located assets that bring our customers to us, it is the customer service and superior value provided by our on-site personnel that keeps them renting with us and recommending us to their friends.
we use technology to engage our customers in the way that they want to be engaged. many of our residents utilize our web-based resident portal which allows them to sign and renew their leases, review their accounts and make payments, provide feedback and make service requests on-line.
acquisitions and developments may be financed from various sources of capital, which may include retained cash flow, issuance of additional equity and debt, sales of properties and joint venture agreements. in addition, the company may acquire properties in transactions that include the issuance of partnership interests in the operating partnership ("op units") as consideration for the acquired properties. such transactions may, in certain circumstances, enable the sellers to defer, in whole or in part, the recognition of taxable income or gain that might otherwise result from the sales. as part of its strategy, the company purchases completed and fully occupied apartment properties, partially completed or partially occupied properties and may acquire land parcels to hold and/or sell based on market opportunities as well as options to buy more land in the future. the company may also seek to acquire properties by purchasing defaulted or distressed debt that encumbers desirable properties in the hope of obtaining title to property through foreclosure or deed-in-lieu of foreclosure proceedings.
over the past several years, the company has done an extensive repositioning of its portfolio into urban and highly walkable, close-in suburban assets. since 2005, the company has sold nearly 198,000 apartment units primarily located in the less dense portion of suburban markets for an aggregate sales price of approximately $23.5 billion, acquired nearly 69,000 apartment units primarily located in urban and high-density suburban markets for approximately $20.0 billion and began approximately $5.7 billion of development projects primarily located in urban and high-density suburban markets. we are currently seeking to acquire and develop assets in the following six core coastal metropolitan areas: boston, new york, washington d.c., southern california, san francisco and seattle. the sale of the starwood portfolio combined with the other 2016 dispositions has resulted in the company's exit from the south florida, denver and new england (excluding boston) markets and has substantially completed the company's portfolio transformation which started approximately ten years ago. see further discussion below regarding the company's 2016 disposition activity.
we endeavor to attract and retain the best employees by providing them with the education, resources and opportunities to succeed. we have a commitment to diversity in all of its forms and strive to promote and maintain a work environment where all employees are treated with dignity and respect, offered opportunities for professional development and valued for their unique contributions to the company's success. we provide many classroom and on-line training courses to assist our employees in interacting with prospects and residents as well as extensively train our customer service specialists in maintaining our properties and improvements, equipment and appliances. we actively promote from within and many senior corporate and property leaders have risen from entry level or junior positions. we monitor our employees' engagement by surveying them annually and have consistently received high engagement scores.
we have a commitment to sustainability and consider the environmental impacts of our business activities. sustainability and social responsibility are key drivers of our focus on creating the best apartment communities for residents to live, work and play. we have a dedicated in-house team that initiates and applies sustainable practices in all aspects of our business, including investment activities, development, property operations and property management activities. with its high density, multifamily housing is, by its nature, an environmentally friendly property type. our recent acquisition and development activities have been primarily concentrated in pedestrian-friendly urban and close-in suburban locations near public transportation. when developing and renovating our properties, we strive to reduce energy and water usage by investing in energy saving technology while positively impacting the experience of our residents and the value of our assets. we continue to implement a combination of irrigation, lighting, hvac and renewable energy improvements at our properties that will reduce energy and water consumption. the company was named the 2016 global residential listed sector leader in sustainability by gresb, a globally recognized analysis of the sustainability indicators of more than 750 real estate portfolios worldwide. the company was also recently awarded the residential leader in the light award for sustainability by nareit. for additional information regarding our sustainability efforts, see our december 2016 corporate social responsibility and sustainability report at our website, www.equityapartments.com. for 2017, we continue to have an express company-wide goal regarding enhanced sustainability efforts. employees, including our executives, will have their performance against our various social responsibility goals evaluated as part of our annual performance review process.
current environment following the approval by the company's board of trustees, the company executed an agreement with controlled affiliates of starwood capital group ("starwood") on october 23, 2015 to sell a portfolio of 72 operating properties consisting of 23,262 apartment units located in five markets across the united states for $5.365 billion (the "starwood transaction" or "starwood portfolio"). on january 26 and 27, 2016, the company closed on the sale of the entire portfolio described above. the sale of the starwood portfolio, combined with the other 2016 dispositions, has resulted in the company's exit from the south florida, denver and new england (excluding boston) markets and has substantially completed the company's portfolio transformation which started approximately ten years ago. these sales have narrowed the company's focus, which is now entirely directed towards our six coastal markets. we believe the assets sold will have lower long-term returns (as compared to investments in our six coastal markets) and that we sold them for prices that are favorable. given the strong demand for multifamily assets in our six coastal markets from institutional investors and the challenge in recycling $6.8 billion of capital in this competitive marketplace, the company believed the best risk-adjusted use of the sale proceeds was to distribute a portion to our shareholders and use the remainder to repay outstanding debt (see further discussion below).
the company used the majority of the proceeds from the starwood transaction and other 2016 dispositions to pay two special dividends to its shareholders and holders of op units of $11.00 per share/unit in the aggregate. the company paid special dividends of $8.00 per share/unit (approximately $3.0 billion) on march 10, 2016 and $3.00 per share/unit (approximately $1.1 billion) on october 14, 2016. the company used the majority of the remaining proceeds to reduce aggregate indebtedness in order to make the transaction leverage neutral. the company retired approximately $2.0 billion in secured and unsecured debt, the majority of which was scheduled to mature in 2016 and 2017, improving the company's already strong credit metrics.
as a result of the starwood transaction and the other 2016 completed dispositions, the company's portfolio has changed significantly from the portfolio summary included in the company's 2015 annual report on form 10-k. the following table sets forth certain information by market relating to the company's properties at december 31, 2016 as compared to december 31, 2015:

during the year ended december 31, 2016, the company acquired four consolidated rental properties consisting of 573 apartment units for $249.3 million. the company acquired these properties primarily in order to protect the tax status of certain unaffiliated third parties arising from the starwood transaction. during the year ended december 31, 2016, the company sold 98 consolidated rental properties consisting of 29,440 apartment units for $6.8 billion, which includes the sale of the starwood portfolio described above. the company also sold one unconsolidated rental property consisting of 336 apartment units for $74.5 million, with the company's share of the net sales proceeds approximating $12.4 million. in addition, the company sold three land parcels for $57.5 million during the year ended december 31, 2016. the company currently budgets consolidated rental acquisitions of approximately $500.0 million during the year ending december 31, 2017 to be funded with proceeds from rental dispositions. the company currently budgets consolidated rental dispositions of approximately $500.0 million during the year ending december 31, 2017.
the company has been reducing its development spending and starts in response to high land prices and low projected returns on investment. during the year ended december 31, 2016, the company started construction on one project representing 222 apartment units totaling approximately $88.0 million of development costs and substantially completed construction on five projects representing 2,141 apartment units totaling approximately $1.1 billion of development costs. the company currently budgets no development starts during the year ending december 31, 2017. we currently budget spending approximately $300.0 million on development costs during the year ending december 31, 2017, primarily for projects currently under construction. we currently anticipate having only $40.0 million remaining to spend during the year ending december 31, 2018 for projects currently under construction. we expect that this capital will be primarily sourced with excess operating cash flow, future debt offerings and borrowings on our revolving credit facility and/or commercial paper program.
we currently have access to multiple sources of capital including the equity markets as well as both the secured and unsecured debt markets. in february 2015, the company entered into a $500.0 million commercial paper program, which allows for daily, weekly or monthly borrowings at low floating rates of interest. we believe this commercial paper program allows the
company to continue to reduce its already low cost of capital and we generally use the program to replace a portion of the amount that otherwise would have been outstanding under our revolving line of credit (see further discussion below). in october 2016, the company completed a $500.0 million unsecured ten year note offering with a coupon of 2.85% and an all-in effective interest rate of approximately 3.10%. the company has budgeted $300.0 million to $500.0 million of secured or unsecured debt offerings during 2017, excluding usage of the commercial paper program.
on november 3, 2016, the company replaced its existing $2.5 billion facility with a $2.0 billion unsecured revolving credit facility maturing january 10, 2022. the company has the ability to increase available borrowings by an additional $750.0 million by adding additional banks to the facility or obtaining the agreement of existing banks to increase their commitments. the interest rate on advances under the facility will generally be libor plus a spread (currently 0.825%), or based on bids received from the lending group, and the company pays an annual facility fee (currently 12.5 basis points). both the spread and the facility fee are dependent on the credit rating of the company's long-term debt. we reduced the size of the facility to reflect the reduction in the size of the company and the prepayment of a significant amount of debt during the first quarter of 2016. in the process, we were able to reduce the borrowing costs associated with this facility.
we believe that cash and cash equivalents, securities readily convertible to cash, excess operating cash flow, current availability on our revolving credit facility and commercial paper program, future debt offerings and disposition proceeds for 2017 will provide sufficient liquidity to meet our funding obligations relating to asset acquisitions, debt maturities and/or prepayments and existing development projects through 2017. we expect that our remaining longer-term funding requirements will be met through some combination of new borrowings, equity issuances, property dispositions, joint ventures and cash generated from operations.
through their lender originator networks, fannie mae and freddie mac (the "government sponsored enterprises" or "gses") are significant lenders and enhancers of tax-exempt bonds both to the company and to buyers of the company's properties. the gses have a mandate to support multifamily housing through their financing activities. any changes to their mandates, reductions in their size or the scale of their activities or loss of key personnel could have an impact on the company and may, among other things, lead to lower values for our assets and higher interest rates on our secured borrowings. the company has access to multiple other forms of public and private capital and over time, we would expect that other lenders, including banks, the commercial mortgage-backed securities market and life insurance companies, will become larger sources of secured debt capital to the multifamily market, particularly as it relates to the company's high quality apartment properties.
same store revenues increased 3.7% during the year ended december 31, 2016 as compared to the same period in 2015. the full year 2016 results were below our original expectations due primarily to elevated levels of new luxury supply combined with slower job growth in the financial services and technology sectors in the new york and san francisco markets, which made up approximately 38% of our noi. we anticipate these trends continuing into 2017 and as a result currently estimate same store revenue increases ranging from 1.00% to 2.25% for 2017 as compared to 2016. although occupancy rates remain strong across our portfolio, increased supply and slowing growth in higher paying jobs in many of our markets causes the company to anticipate revenue growth in 2017 will be lower than 2016.
washington d.c. continues to slowly and steadily improve, driven primarily by strong job growth. while the new administration issued a federal hiring freeze, we remain confident that demographics will continue to drive strong demand for apartments. though new supply levels remain elevated, only about one-third of that supply is located in our submarkets. we expect continued slow improvement and expect to produce same store revenue growth of approximately 1.8% in this market in 2017.
in the new york market, elevated deliveries of new luxury supply in the upper west side and brooklyn submarkets are having an impact on our ability to raise rents as renters trend towards affordability over neighborhood loyalty. there has also been a reduction in the rate of job growth in the financial services sector and technology sector, which are important demand drivers in the market. in order to remain competitive with this new supply, we offered rent concessions and increased leasing and advertising expenses throughout 2016 and will likely continue to do so during 2017. as a result, we expect there to be a decline in same store revenues of approximately 1.5% in 2017.
we have a cautious outlook for boston as the market continues to feel the impact from an elevated level of deliveries of new supply in the downtown and cambridge submarkets with approximately 75% of this new supply competing with our properties. job growth has continued to improve in the market which is a positive sign that the additional supply may be absorbed without significant disruption. we expect to produce same store revenue growth of approximately 1.5% in this market in 2017.
seattle is producing solid rental rate growth. strong demand is being driven by the continued growth in technology jobs in the market. while new supply remains elevated in this market, the strong job growth has enabled that supply to be fully absorbed with little disruption. therefore, we would expect seattle to perform well through 2017, producing same store revenue growth of
san francisco experienced significant volatility during peak leasing season as certain submarkets experienced elevated levels of new luxury supply combined with slower job growth in the technology sector. currently, the market seems relatively stable, though with minimal pricing power on new leases. the market still features good demand as evidenced by how rapidly our newly completed development projects are leasing up. however, consumers have more choices as new supply continues to be delivered into most of our submarkets during 2017, limiting our pricing power. as a result, we expect to produce same store revenue growth of approximately 1.0% in this market in 2017.
los angeles is performing well and is positioned to be one of our better performing markets in 2017. widely dispersed new supply, very good economic growth and a high level of job growth in the market are driving strong revenue growth. we expect to produce same store revenue growth of approximately 3.6% in this market in 2017. we expect our remaining markets in southern california (orange county and san diego) to perform slightly better than los angeles.
•   real estate taxes increased 5.9% for the full year 2016 primarily due to rate and value increases in certain states and municipalities, reflecting those states' and municipalities' continued economic challenges and the dramatic improvement in apartment values and fundamentals, the contractual annual reduction in the benefits of 421-a tax abatements in new york city and an adverse legal decision regarding the calculation of property taxes for certain properties in new jersey; and
•   payroll costs increased by 3.1% in 2016 over 2015 primarily due to an increase in on-site staffing to remain competitive within challenging markets, as well as higher on-site wages due to competition from new supply.
•   real estate taxes are estimated to increase between 4.0% and 5.0% due primarily to increased values in most markets partially offset by declining rates. we expect 1.8 percentage points of the increase coming from 421-a tax abatement benefits expiring in new york;
•   payroll costs are estimated to increase between 4.0% and 5.0% primarily due to an increase in on-site staffing to remain competitive within challenging markets, as well as higher on-site wages due to competition from new supply;
•   repair and maintenance expenses are estimated to be approximately $1.0 million higher due to increases in the minimum wage that impact our outside cleaning and landscaping vendors.
we anticipate same store noi increases ranging from 0.0% to 2.0% for 2017 as compared to 2016 as a result of the above same store revenue and expense expectations.
the company expects total overhead costs (property management expense and general and administrative expense) to decline approximately $3.0 million in 2017 over 2016 as we have largely completed right sizing our overhead platform to our smaller asset size. as certain of the company's overhead costs are fixed and/or not quickly scalable, the company anticipates overhead costs as a percentage of total revenues will remain elevated as compared to 2015 levels, though slightly lower as compared to 2016 levels.
we believe that the company is well-positioned in the long-term as a result of favorable demographics and increasing consumer preferences for the flexibility of rental housing. as of december 31, 2016, the company's same store occupancy was 95.7% and its total portfolio-wide occupancy was 94.6%. we believe our markets/metro areas will continue to see increased luxury multifamily supply, especially in our urban core locations, and there will continue to be periods of disruption as new development projects lease up. we believe over the longer term that our markets will absorb future supply because of the strong long-term demand in these markets as exhibited by our current high occupancy levels and increasing household formations. we have seen evidence of this in seattle as elevated levels of new supply have been absorbed and rental rates continue to grow. we also anticipate supply declining in our markets beginning in 2018, with the possible exception of new york, because of high construction costs, lower revenue growth and development lenders materially reducing their lending activities due to regulatory pressures and concerns over markets being overbuilt.
the current environment information presented above is based on current expectations and is forward-looking.
results of operations in conjunction with our business objectives and operating strategy, the company continued to invest in apartment properties located in our six coastal markets and sell apartment properties located primarily in the less dense portion of suburban markets during the years ended december 31, 2016 and december 31, 2015. in summary, we:
•   acquired four consolidated apartment properties consisting of 573 apartment units for $249.3 million at a weighted average acquisition cap rate (see definition below) of 4.8%;
•   sold 98 consolidated apartment properties consisting of 29,440 apartment units for $6.8 billion, which includes the sale of the starwood portfolio consisting of 72 consolidated rental properties containing 23,262 apartment units for $5.365 billion, at a weighted average disposition yield (see definition below) of 5.4% and generating an unlevered irr (see definition below) of 11.8%;
•   sold one unconsolidated property consisting of 336 apartments units for $74.5 million (our share of the net sales proceeds approximated $12.4 million), generating a disposition yield of 5.6%;
•   sold our entire interest in the management contracts and related rights associated with the military housing ventures at joint base lewis mcchord consisting of 5,161 apartment units for approximately $63.3 million and sold three land parcels for $57.5 million; and
•   started the construction on one project consisting of 222 apartment units totaling approximately $88.0 million of development costs and substantially completed construction on five projects consisting of 2,141 apartment units totaling approximately $1.1 billion of development costs.
•   acquired four consolidated apartment properties consisting of 625 apartment units for $296.0 million at a weighted average acquisition cap rate of 4.5% and three contiguous land parcels for $27.8 million;
•   sold eight consolidated apartment properties consisting of 1,857 apartments units as well as a 193,230 square foot medical office building for $513.3 million at a weighted average disposition yield of 5.3% and generating an unlevered irr of 13.4%; and
•   started construction on two projects consisting of 623 apartment units totaling approximately $377.2 million of development costs and substantially completed construction on seven projects consisting of 1,546 apartments units totaling approximately $831.7 million of development costs.
the company's primary financial measure for evaluating each of its apartment communities is net operating income ("noi"). noi represents rental income less direct property operating expenses (including real estate taxes and insurance). the company believes that noi is helpful to investors as a supplemental measure of its operating performance because it is a direct measure of the actual operating results of the company's apartment properties.
the definitions of certain terms described above are as follows:
•   acquisition cap rate - noi that the company anticipates receiving in the next 12 months (or the year two or three stabilized noi for properties that are in lease-up at acquisition) less an estimate of property management costs/management fees allocated to the project (generally ranging from 2.0% to 4.0% of revenues depending on the size and income streams of the asset) and less an estimate for in-the-unit replacement capital expenditures (generally ranging from $100-$450 per apartment unit depending on the age and condition of the asset) divided by the gross purchase price of the asset. the weighted average acquisition cap rate for acquired properties is weighted based on the projected noi streams and the relative purchase price for each respective property.
•   disposition yield - noi that the company anticipates giving up in the next 12 months less an estimate of property management costs/management fees allocated to the project (generally ranging from 2.0% to 4.0% of revenues depending on the size and income streams of the asset) and less an estimate for in-the-unit replacement capital expenditures (generally ranging from $100-$450 per apartment unit depending on the age and condition of the asset) divided by the gross sale price of the asset. the weighted average disposition yield for sold properties is weighted based on the projected noi streams and the relative sales price for each respective property.
•   unlevered internal rate of return ("irr") - the unlevered irr on sold properties refers to the internal rate of return calculated by the company based on the timing and amount of (i) total revenue earned during the period owned by the
company and (ii) the gross sales price net of selling costs, offset by (iii) the undepreciated capital cost of the properties at the time of sale and (iv) total direct property operating expenses (including real estate taxes and insurance) incurred during the period owned by the company. each of the items (i), (ii), (iii) and (iv) is calculated in accordance with gaap.
properties that the company owned and were stabilized (see definition below) for all of both 2016 and 2015 (the "2016 same store properties"), which represented 69,879 apartment units, impacted the company's results of operations. properties that the company owned for all of both 2015 and 2014 (the "2015 same store properties"), which represented 96,286 apartment units, also impacted the company's results of operations. both the 2016 same store properties and 2015 same store properties are discussed in the following paragraphs.
the following tables provide a rollforward of the apartment units included in same store properties and a reconciliation of apartment units included in same store properties to those included in total properties for the year ended december 31, 2016:

note: properties are considered "stabilized" when they have achieved 90% occupancy for three consecutive months. properties are included in same store when they are stabilized for all of the current and comparable periods presented.
(1)   includes one property containing 285 apartment units (playa pacifica in hermosa beach, california) which was removed from the same store portfolio in 2015 due to a major renovation in which significant portions of the property were taken offline for extended time periods and one property containing 71 apartment units (acton courtyard in berkeley, california) which was removed from the same store portfolio in 2016 due to an affordable housing dispute which required significant portions of the property to be vacant for an extended releasing period. as of december 31, 2016, playa pacifica had an occupancy of only 66.2% and acton courtyard had an occupancy of 69.0%. these properties will not return to the same store portfolio until they are stabilized for all of the current and comparable periods presented.
(2)   includes three properties containing 853 apartment units that are owned by the company but the entire projects are master leased to a third party corporate housing provider and the company earns monthly net rental income.
(3)   includes properties in various stages of lease-up and properties where lease-up has been completed but the properties were not stabilized for the comparable periods presented.
the company's acquisition, disposition and completed development activities also impacted overall results of operations for the years ended december 31, 2016 and 2015. the impacts of these activities are discussed in greater detail in the following
comparison of the year ended december 31, 2016 to the year ended december 31, 2015
for the year ended december 31, 2016, the company reported diluted earnings per share/unit of $11.68 compared to $2.36 per share/unit for the year ended december 31, 2015. the difference is primarily due to approximately $3.7 billion in higher gains on property sales and lower depreciation expense in 2016 compared to the same period in 2015 as a direct result of the significant sales activity in 2016, partially offset by significantly higher debt extinguishment costs in 2016 compared to 2015.
for the year ended december 31, 2016, consolidated rental income decreased 11.5%, consolidated operating expenses (comprising of property and maintenance and real estate taxes and insurance) decreased 11.6% and consolidated noi decreased 11.5% when compared to the year ended december 31, 2015. the declines are all primarily a result of the company's significant disposition activity in 2016.
revenues from the 2016 same store properties increased $78.1 million primarily as a result of an increase in average rental rates charged to residents. expenses from the 2016 same store properties increased $20.2 million primarily as a result of an increase in real estate taxes, on-site payroll costs, repairs and maintenance expenses and leasing and advertising expenses, partially offset by lower utility costs. the following tables provide comparative same store results and statistics for the 2016 same store properties:

the following tables present reconciliations of operating income per the consolidated statements of operations to noi, along with rental income, operating expenses and noi per the consolidated statements of operations allocated between same store and non-same store results:

for properties that the company acquired or completed that were stabilized prior to january 1, 2016 and that the company expects to continue to own through december 31, 2017, the company anticipates the following same store results for the full year ending december 31, 2017:
revenue change                   1.0% to 2.25%
expense change                    3.0% to 4.0%
noi change                        0.0% to 2.0%
the company anticipates consolidated rental acquisitions of $500.0 million and consolidated rental dispositions of $500.0 million and expects that the acquisition cap rate will be 0.75% lower than the disposition yield for the full year ending december 31, 2017.
non-same store noi results decreased approximately $277.5 million compared to the same period in 2015 and consist primarily of properties acquired in calendar years 2015 and 2016, operations from the company's development properties and operations prior to disposition from 2016 sold properties (including the starwood portfolio). this decrease primarily resulted from:
•   the lost noi from 2015 and 2016 dispositions of $333.2 million;
•   a decrease in operating activities from other miscellaneous properties (including three master-leased properties) of $1.2 million;
•   a decrease in operating activities from other miscellaneous operations; and
•   a partial offset from development and newly stabilized development properties in lease-up of $50.8 million and
operating properties acquired in 2015 and 2016 of $15.2 million.
see also note 17 in the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional discussion regarding the company's segment disclosures.
fee and asset management revenues decreased approximately $4.8 million or 57.5% primarily as a result of lower revenue earned on management of the company's military housing ventures at joint base lewis mcchord due to the sale of the company's entire interest in the management contracts and related rights associated with these ventures in the second quarter of 2016 as well as lower fees earned on management of the company's unconsolidated joint ventures.
property management expenses from continuing operations include off-site expenses associated with the self-management of the company's properties as well as management fees paid to any third party management companies. these expenses decreased approximately $4.2 million or 4.9%. this decrease is primarily attributable to a decrease in payroll-related costs, office rent and education conference fees, partially offset by increases in computer operations costs. the company anticipates that property management expenses will approximate $83.0 million to $85.0 million for the year ending december 31, 2017. the above assumption is based on current expectations and is forward-looking.
general and administrative expenses from continuing operations, which include corporate operating expenses, decreased approximately $6.8 million or 10.6% primarily due to a decrease in payroll-related costs, partially offset by an increase in directors fees and office rent. the company anticipates that general and administrative expenses will approximate $50.0 million to $52.0 million for the year ending december 31, 2017, excluding charges of approximately $0.4 million related to the company's current executive compensation program. the above assumption is based on current expectations and is forward-looking.
depreciation expense from continuing operations, which includes depreciation on non-real estate assets, decreased approximately $60.2 million or 7.9% primarily as a result of no depreciation or a partial period of depreciation expense during the year ended december 31, 2016 related to the significant property sales in 2016 (including the starwood portfolio), partially offset by additional depreciation expense on properties acquired in 2016 and development properties placed in service.
interest and other income from continuing operations increased approximately $58.4 million primarily due to the approximate $52.4 million gain from the sale of the company's entire interest in the management contracts and related rights associated with the military housing ventures at joint base lewis mcchord and approximate $6.0 million gain from the sale of 421-a real estate tax certificates during the year ended december 31, 2016, neither of which occurred in 2015. the company anticipates that interest and other income will approximate $0.5 million for the year ending december 31, 2017. the above assumption is based on current expectations and is forward-looking.
other expenses from continuing operations increased approximately $7.4 million primarily due to increases in litigation/environmental reserve and/or settlement costs, property acquisition costs incurred in conjunction with the company's 2016 acquisitions and the expensing of overhead (pursuit cost write-offs) as a result of fewer new development opportunities.
interest expense from continuing operations, including amortization of deferred financing costs, increased approximately $39.6 million or 8.7% primarily as a result of prepayment penalties and debt extinguishment costs associated with the repayment of approximately $1.7 billion in debt principal prior to scheduled maturity, partially offset by lower interest expense as a result of these repayments. during the year ended december 31, 2016, the company capitalized interest costs of approximately $51.5 million as compared to $59.9 million for the year ended december 31, 2015. this capitalization of interest relates to consolidated projects under development. the effective interest cost on all indebtedness for the year ended december 31, 2016 was 4.68% as compared to 4.72% for the year ended december 31, 2015. the company anticipates that interest expense from continuing operations, excluding debt extinguishment costs/prepayment penalties, will approximate $362.6 million to $379.0 million and capitalized interest will approximate $23.0 million to $28.0 million for the year ending december 31, 2017. the above assumptions are based on current expectations and are forward-looking.
income from investments in unconsolidated entities decreased approximately $10.2 million or 68.0% primarily due to $18.6 million in favorable litigation settlements which occurred during the year ended december 31, 2015, partially offset by a gain on the sale of one unconsolidated apartment property totaling $8.8 million which occurred during the year ended december 31, 2016.
net gain on sales of real estate properties increased approximately $3.7 billion as a result of the sale of 98 consolidated apartment properties (including the starwood portfolio) during the year ended december 31, 2016 as compared to only eight consolidated apartment property sales during the year ended december 31, 2015, all of which did not meet the new criteria for reporting discontinued operations. see note 11 in the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion.
net gain on sales of land parcels increased approximately $15.7 million due to the gain on sale of three land parcels during the year ended december 31, 2016 as compared to no land sales during the year ended december 31, 2015.
discontinued operations, net increased approximately $0.1 million or 30.5% between the periods under comparison. this increase is primarily due to the timing of trailing activity for properties sold in 2013 and prior years. the company adopted the new discontinued operations standard effective january 1, 2014 and as a result, none of the properties sold during the year ended december 31, 2016 and 2015 met the new criteria for reporting discontinued operations.  see note 11 in the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion.
comparison of the year ended december 31, 2015 to the year ended december 31, 2014
for the year ended december 31, 2015, the company reported diluted earnings per share/unit of $2.36 compared to $1.73 per share/unit for the year ended december 31, 2014. the difference is primarily due to approximately $122.3 million in higher gains on property sales as well as improved operations in 2015 vs. 2014.
revenues from the 2015 same store properties increased $125.3 million primarily as a result of an increase in average rental rates charged to residents, higher occupancy and a decrease in turnover. expenses from the 2015 same store properties increased $20.5 million primarily due to increases in real estate taxes, repairs and maintenance expenses and payroll/property management costs, partially offset by lower utility costs. the following tables provide comparative same store results and statistics for the 2015 same store properties:

the following table presents a reconciliation of operating income per the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income to noi for the 2015 same store properties:
operating income                          $1,009,238                    $921,644

fee and asset management revenue              (8,387     )                (9,437     )
fee and asset management expense               5,021                       5,429
non-same store operating results increased approximately $4.5 million and consist primarily of properties acquired in calendar years 2014 and 2015 as well as operations from the company's completed development properties. this increase primarily resulted from:
•   development and newly stabilized development properties in lease-up of $27.8 million;
•   operating properties acquired in 2014 and 2015 of $18.1 million;
•   operating activities from other miscellaneous operations; and
•   was mostly offset by lost noi from 2014 and 2015 dispositions of $41.8 million as well as a decrease in operating activities from other miscellaneous properties (including three master-leased properties) of $2.2 million.
see also note 17 in the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional discussion regarding the company's segment disclosures.
fee and asset management revenues decreased approximately $1.1 million or 11.1% primarily as a result of lower revenue earned on management of the company's military housing ventures at joint base lewis mcchord and lower fees earned on management of the company's unconsolidated development joint ventures.
property management expenses from continuing operations include off-site expenses associated with the self-management of the company's properties as well as management fees paid to any third party management companies. these expenses increased approximately $1.1 million or 1.3%. this increase is primarily attributable to an increase in payroll-related costs and education/conferences fees.
general and administrative expenses from continuing operations, which include corporate operating expenses, increased approximately $14.0 million or 27.6% primarily due to an increase in payroll-related costs, including an additional $8.0 million related to the company's revised executive compensation program.
depreciation expense from continuing operations, which includes depreciation on non-real estate assets, increased approximately $7.0 million or 0.9% primarily as a result of additional depreciation expense on properties acquired in 2014 and 2015, development properties placed in service and capital expenditures for all properties owned, partially offset by no depreciation or a partial period of depreciation expense during the year ended december 31, 2015 for properties sold in 2015 and 2014 and properties classified as held for sale at december 31, 2015.
interest and other income from continuing operations increased approximately $2.9 million or 65.2% primarily due to the settlement of various litigation/insurance claims during the year ended december 31, 2015.
other expenses from continuing operations decreased approximately $6.1 million or 67.6% primarily due to litigation settlement costs recorded during the year ended december 31, 2014 that did not reoccur in 2015 as well as a reduction in the reserve for a litigation matter recorded during the year ended december 31, 2015, partially offset by an increase in the expensing of overhead (pursuit cost write-offs) as a result of a more active focus on sourcing new development opportunities.
interest expense from continuing operations, including amortization of deferred financing costs, decreased approximately $13.3 million or 2.8% primarily as a result of the repayment of $300.0 million of 6.584% unsecured notes in april 2015, the repayment of $500.0 million of 5.25% unsecured notes in september 2014, the repayment of the company's $750.0 million unsecured term loan facility in june 2014, mortgage payoffs and higher capitalized interest, partially offset by interest expense on $750.0 million of unsecured notes that closed in may 2015 and $1.2 billion of unsecured notes that closed in june 2014. during the year ended december 31, 2015, the company capitalized interest costs of approximately $59.9 million as compared to $52.8 million for the year ended december 31, 2014. this capitalization of interest primarily relates to consolidated projects under development. the effective interest cost on all indebtedness for the year ended december 31, 2015 was 4.72% as compared to 4.74% for the year ended december 31, 2014.
income and other tax expense from continuing operations decreased approximately $0.5 million or 34.2% primarily due to decreases in estimated taxes related to properties sold and/or operated by the company's trs in 2015 vs. 2014.
income from investments in unconsolidated entities increased approximately $23.0 million primarily due to gains on the sale of certain assets owned by the company's joint ventures with a joint venture partner and due to $18.6 million in favorable litigation settlements, neither of which occurred during the year ended december 31, 2014.
net gain on sales of real estate properties increased approximately $122.4 million or 57.6% as a result of higher gains on the sale of eight consolidated apartment properties during the year ended december 31, 2015 as compared to ten consolidated property sales during the year ended december 31, 2014, all of which did not meet the new criteria for reporting discontinued operations. see note 11 in the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion.
net gain on sales of land parcels decreased approximately $5.3 million due to the gain on sale of three land parcels during the year ended december 31, 2014 as compared to no land sales during the year ended december 31, 2015.
discontinued operations, net decreased approximately $1.2 million or 74.9% between the periods under comparison. this decrease is primarily due to the company's adoption of the new discontinued operations standard effective january 1, 2014. none of the properties sold during the years ended december 31, 2015 and 2014 met the new criteria for reporting discontinued operations and as a result, the amounts included in discontinued operations for the years ended december 31, 2015 and 2014 represent trailing activity for properties sold in 2013 and prior years.  see note 11 in the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion.
liquidity and capital resources eqr issues public equity from time to time and guarantees certain debt of the operating partnership. eqr does not have any indebtedness as all debt is incurred by the operating partnership.
as of january 1, 2016, the company had approximately $42.3 million of cash and cash equivalents and the amount available on its revolving credit facility was $2.07 billion (net of $45.1 million which was restricted/dedicated to support letters of credit and net of $387.5 million outstanding on the commercial paper program). after taking into effect the various transactions discussed in the following paragraphs and the net cash provided by operating activities, the company's cash and cash equivalents balance at december 31, 2016 was approximately $77.2 million and the amount available on its revolving credit facility was $1.96 billion (net of $20.6 million which was restricted/dedicated to support letters of credit and net of the $20.0 million outstanding on the commercial paper program).
•   disposed of 98 consolidated rental properties (including the starwood portfolio) and three land parcels, receiving net proceeds of approximately $6.8 billion;
•   disposed of one unconsolidated rental property, receiving net proceeds of approximately $12.4 million;
•   disposed of its entire interest in the management contracts and related rights associated with the military housing ventures at joint base lewis mcchord along with the sale of certain 421-a real estate tax certificates, receiving net proceeds of approximately $72.8 million;

•   issued approximately 0.9 million common shares related to share option exercises and espp purchases and received net proceeds of $39.5 million, which were contributed to the capital of the operating partnership in exchange for additional op units (on a one-for-one common share per op unit basis).
during the year ended december 31, 2016 , the above proceeds along with net cash flow from operations and availability on the company's revolving line of credit and commercial paper program were primarily utilized to:
•   acquire four consolidated rental properties for approximately $205.9 million in cash;
•   invest $566.8 million primarily in development projects;
•   pay a special dividend of $8.00 per share/unit (approximately $3.0 billion) on march 10, 2016 to shareholders/unitholders of record as of march 3, 2016 and a special dividend of $3.00 per share/unit (approximately $1.1 billion) on october 14, 2016 to shareholders/unitholders of record as of september 26, 2016;
•   repay $591.7 million of mortgage loans and incur a prepayment penalty of approximately $31.7 million;

in september 2009, eqr announced the establishment of an at-the-market ("atm") share offering program which would allow eqr to sell common shares from time to time into the existing trading market at current market prices as well as through negotiated transactions. per the terms of erpop's partnership agreement, eqr contributes the net proceeds from all equity offerings to the capital of erpop in exchange for additional op units (on a one-for-one common share per op unit basis). eqr may, but shall have no obligation to, sell common shares through the atm share offering program in amounts and at times to be determined by eqr. actual sales will depend on a variety of factors to be determined by eqr from time to time, including (among others) market conditions, the trading price of eqr's common shares and determinations of the appropriate sources of funding for eqr. the program currently has a maturity of june 2019. eqr has the authority to issue 13.0 million shares but has
not issued any shares under this program since september 2012. through february 17, 2017, eqr has cumulatively issued approximately 16.7 million common shares at an average price of $48.53 per share for total consideration of approximately $809.9 million.
depending on its analysis of market prices, economic conditions and other opportunities for the investment of available capital, eqr may repurchase its common shares pursuant to its existing share repurchase program authorized by the board of trustees. the company may repurchase up to 13.0 million common shares under this program. eqr repurchased approximately $1.8 million (31,240 shares at a price of $56.87 per share) of its common shares (all related to the vesting of employees' restricted shares) during the year ended december 31, 2014. no open market repurchases have occurred since 2008. as of february 17, 2017, eqr has remaining authorization to repurchase up to 13.0 million of its shares. see note 3 in the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion.
depending on its analysis of prevailing market conditions, liquidity requirements, contractual restrictions and other factors, the company may from time to time seek to repurchase and retire its outstanding debt in open market or privately negotiated transactions.

the company generally expects to meet its short-term liquidity requirements, including capital expenditures related to maintaining its existing properties and scheduled unsecured note and mortgage note repayments, through its working capital, net cash provided by operating activities and borrowings under the company's revolving credit facility and commercial paper program. under normal operating conditions, the company considers its cash provided by operating activities to be adequate to meet operating requirements and payments of distributions.
the company has a flexible dividend policy which it believes will generate payouts closely aligned with the actual annual operating results of the company's core business and provide transparency to investors. beginning in 2014, the company began paying its annual dividend based on 65% of the midpoint of the range of normalized ffo guidance customarily provided as part of the company's fourth quarter earnings release. the company's 2016 regular annual dividend payout was $2.015 per share/unit and the company paid four regular quarterly dividends of $0.50375 per share/unit in 2016. in addition to the regular quarterly dividends, the company paid two special dividends to its shareholders and holders of op units of $11.00 per share/unit in the aggregate. the company paid special dividends of $8.00 per share/unit (approximately $3.0 billion) on march 10, 2016 and $3.00 per share/unit (approximately $1.1 billion) on october 14, 2016. all future dividends remain subject to the discretion of the board of trustees.
while our current dividend policy makes it less likely that we will over distribute, it will also lead to a dividend reduction more quickly should operating results deteriorate or large portfolio sales occur. however, whether due to changes in the dividend policy or otherwise, there may be times when the company experiences shortfalls in its coverage of distributions, which may cause the company to consider reducing its distributions and/or using the proceeds from property dispositions or additional financing transactions to make up the difference. should these shortfalls occur for lengthy periods of time or be material in nature, the company's financial condition may be adversely affected and it may not be able to maintain its current distribution levels. the company believes that its expected 2017 operating cash flow will be sufficient to cover capital expenditures and regular dividends/distributions.
the company also expects to meet its long-term liquidity requirements, such as lump sum unsecured note and mortgage debt maturities, property acquisitions, financing of construction and development activities through the issuance of secured and unsecured debt and equity securities, including additional op units, proceeds received from the disposition of certain properties and joint ventures and cash generated from operations after all distributions. in addition, the company has significant unencumbered properties available to secure additional mortgage borrowings in the event that the public capital markets are unavailable or the cost of alternative sources of capital is too high. the fair value of and cash flow from these unencumbered properties are in excess of the requirements the company must maintain in order to comply with covenants under its unsecured notes, line of credit and commercial paper program. of the $25.4 billion in investment in real estate on the company's balance sheet at december 31, 2016, $18.7 billion or 73.8% was unencumbered. however, there can be no assurances that these sources of capital will be available to the company in the future on acceptable terms or otherwise.
erpop's long-term senior debt ratings and short-term commercial paper ratings as well as eqr's long-term preferred equity ratings as of february 17, 2017 are as follows:
(1)   moody's rated erpop's long-term senior debt with a positive outlook.
(2)   moody's rated eqr's long-term preferred equity with a positive outlook.
the long-term ratings listed above were reaffirmed following the company's announcement of the starwood transaction and other 2016 dispositions.
on november 3, 2016, the company replaced its existing $2.5 billion facility with a $2.0 billion unsecured revolving credit facility maturing january 10, 2022. the company has the ability to increase available borrowings by an additional $750.0 million by adding additional banks to the facility or obtaining the agreement of existing banks to increase their commitments. the interest rate on advances under the facility will generally be libor plus a spread (currently 0.825%), or based on bids received from the lending group, and the company pays an annual facility fee (currently 12.5 basis points). both the spread and the facility fee are dependent on the credit rating of the company's long-term debt.
the company's previous $2.5 billion unsecured revolving credit facility was set to mature on april 2, 2018. the company had the ability to increase available borrowings by an additional $500.0 million by adding additional banks to the facility or obtaining the agreement of existing banks to increase their commitments. the interest rate on advances under the facility was generally libor plus a spread (was 0.95% at termination), or based on bids received from the lending group, and the company paid an annual facility fee (was 15 basis points at termination). both the spread and the facility fee were dependent on the credit rating of the company's long-term debt.
on february 2, 2015, the company entered into an unsecured commercial paper note program in the united states. the company may borrow up to a maximum of $500.0 million under this program subject to market conditions. the notes will be sold under customary terms in the united states commercial paper note market and will rank pari passu with all of the company's other unsecured senior indebtedness. the company does not intend to borrow more than $2.0 billion on the commercial paper program and new revolving credit facility combined. as of february 17, 2017, there was a balance of $100.0 million outstanding on the commercial paper program.
as of february 17, 2017, no amounts were outstanding and the amount available on the revolving credit facility was $1.88 billion (net of $20.6 million which was restricted/dedicated to support letters of credit and net of the $100.0 million outstanding on the commercial paper program). this facility may, among other potential uses, be used to fund property acquisitions, costs for certain properties under development and short-term liquidity requirements.
see note 18 in the notes to consolidated financial statements for discussion of the events which occurred subsequent to december 31, 2016.
capitalization of fixed assets and improvements to real estate our policy with respect to capital expenditures is generally to capitalize expenditures that improve the value of the property or extend the useful life of the component asset of the property. we track improvements to real estate in two major categories and several subcategories:
all replacements are depreciated over a five to ten-year estimated useful life. we expense as incurred all make-ready maintenance and turnover costs such as cleaning, interior painting of individual apartment units and the repair of any replacement item noted above.
•   roof replacement and major repairs;
•   paving or major resurfacing of parking lots, curbs and sidewalks;
•   amenities and common areas such as pools, exterior sports and playground equipment, lobbies, clubhouses, laundry rooms, alarm and security systems and offices;
•   major building mechanical equipment systems;
•   major landscaping and grounds improvement; and
•   vehicles and office and maintenance equipment.
all building improvements are depreciated over a five to fifteen-year estimated useful life. we capitalize building improvements and upgrades only if the item: (i) exceeds $2,500 (selected projects must exceed $10,000); (ii) extends the useful life of the asset; and (iii) improves the value of the asset.

(5)   non-same store properties - primarily includes all properties acquired during 2014 and 2015, plus any properties in lease-up and not stabilized as of january 1, 2014. per apartment unit amounts are based on a weighted average of 5,582 apartment units.
(6)   other - primarily includes expenditures for properties sold and properties under development.
the company estimates that during 2017 it will spend approximately $2,600 per apartment unit of capital expenditures, inclusive of apartment unit renovation/rehab costs, or $1,900 per apartment unit excluding apartment unit renovation/rehab costs. during 2017, the company expects to spend approximately $50.0 million for all unit renovation/rehab costs (primarily on same store properties) at a weighted average cost of $11,000 per apartment unit rehabbed. these anticipated amounts represent an
increase as a percentage of rental revenues, in the cost per unit and in the absolute dollar amounts over 2016. these increases include approximately $17.0 million of additional estimated expenditures for resident focused renovation projects such as common areas and exercise rooms in order to remain competitive with the new luxury supply being delivered in many of our markets. we will continue to create value from our properties by doing those rehabs that meet our investment parameters. the above assumptions are based on current expectations and are forward-looking.
during the year ended december 31, 2016, the company's total non-real estate capital additions, such as computer software, computer equipment, and furniture and fixtures and leasehold improvements to the company's property management offices and its corporate offices, were approximately $5.7 million. the company expects to fund approximately $3.1 million in total non-real estate capital additions in 2017. these anticipated fundings represent a decrease over 2016, which is primarily driven by the substantial completion of the implementation of new systems during 2016. the above assumption is based on current expectations and is forward-looking.
capital expenditures to real estate and non-real estate capital additions are generally funded from net cash provided by operating activities and from investment cash flow.
derivative instruments in the normal course of business, the company is exposed to the effect of interest rate changes. the company seeks to manage these risks by following established risk management policies and procedures including the use of derivatives to hedge interest rate risk on debt instruments. the company may also use derivatives to manage commodity prices in the daily operations of the business.
the company has a policy of only entering into contracts with major financial institutions based upon their credit ratings and other factors. when viewed in conjunction with the underlying and offsetting exposure that the derivatives are designed to hedge, the company has not sustained a material loss from these instruments nor does it anticipate any material adverse effect on its net income or financial position in the future from the use of derivatives it currently has in place.
see note 9 in the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional discussion of derivative instruments at december 31, 2016.
other total distributions paid in january 2017 amounted to $192.3 million (excluding distributions on partially owned properties), which included certain distributions declared during the fourth quarter ended december 31, 2016.
off-balance sheet arrangements and contractual obligations the company has various unconsolidated interests in certain joint ventures. the company does not believe that these unconsolidated investments have a materially different impact on its liquidity, cash flows, capital resources, credit or market risk than its consolidated operating and/or other activities.
operating properties the company has a 75% equity interest in the wisconsin place joint venture. the project contains a mixed-use site located in chevy chase, maryland consisting of residential, retail, office and accessory uses, including underground parking facilities. the joint venture owns the 432 unit residential component, but has no ownership interest in the retail and office components. the joint venture also retains an unconsolidated interest in an entity that owns the land underlying the entire project and owns and operates the parking facility. at december 31, 2016, the basis of this investment was $46.9 million. the joint venture, as a limited partner, does not have substantive kick-out or participating rights in the entity. as a result, the entity qualifies as a vie. the joint venture does not have a controlling financial interest in the vie and is not the vie's primary beneficiary. the joint venture does not have the power to direct the activities of the vie that most significantly impact the vie's economic performance or the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits from the vie that could potentially be significant to the vie. as a result, the entity that owns the land and owns and operates the parking facility is unconsolidated and recorded using the equity method of accounting.
the company has a 20% equity interest in each of the nexus sawgrass and domain joint ventures. the nexus sawgrass joint venture owns a 501 unit apartment property located in sunrise, florida and the company's interest had a basis of $5.0 million at december 31, 2016. the domain joint venture owns a 444 unit apartment property located in san jose, california and the
company's interest had a basis of $9.3 million at december 31, 2016. nexus sawgrass and domain were completed and stabilized during the quarters ended september 30, 2014 and march 31, 2015, respectively. construction on both properties was predominantly funded with long-term, non-recourse secured loans from the partner. the mortgage loan on nexus sawgrass has a current unconsolidated outstanding balance of $48.6 million, bears interest at 5.60% and matures january 1, 2021. the mortgage loan on domain has a current unconsolidated outstanding balance of $96.8 million, bears interest at 5.75% and matures january 1, 2022. while the company is the managing member of both of the joint ventures, was responsible for constructing both of the properties and gave certain construction cost overrun guarantees, the joint venture partner has significant participating rights and has active involvement in and oversight of the operations. as a result, the entities do not qualify as vies. the company alone does not have the power to direct the activities of the entities that most significantly impact the entities' economic performance and as a result, the entities are unconsolidated and recorded using the equity method of accounting. the company currently has no further funding obligations related to these properties.
other on february 27, 2013, in connection with the acquisition of archstone, subsidiaries of the company entered into three limited liability company agreements (collectively, the "residual jv"). the residual jv owned certain archstone assets and succeeded to certain residual archstone liabilities/litigation. the residual jv is owned 60% by the company and 40% by its joint venture partner. the company's initial investment was $147.6 million and the company's basis at december 31, 2016 was a net obligation of $1.1 million. the residual jv is managed by a management committee consisting of two members from each of the company and its joint venture partner. both partners have equal participation in the management committee and all significant participating rights are shared by both partners. as a result, the residual jv does not qualify as a vie. the company alone does not have the power to direct the activities of the residual jv that most significantly impact the residual jv's economic performance and as a result, the residual jv is unconsolidated and recorded using the equity method of accounting. the residual jv has sold all of the real estate assets that were acquired as part of the acquisition of archstone, including all of the german assets, and is in the process of winding down all remaining activities.
on february 27, 2013, in connection with the acquisition of archstone, a subsidiary of the company entered into a limited liability company agreement (the "legacy jv"), through which they assumed obligations of archstone in the form of preferred interests, some of which are governed by tax protection arrangements. at december 31, 2016, the remaining preferred interests had an aggregate liquidation value of $39.9 million, our share of which is included in other liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. obligations of the legacy jv are borne 60% by the company and 40% by its joint venture partner. the legacy jv is managed by a management committee consisting of two members from each of the company and its joint venture partner. both partners have equal participation in the management committee and all significant participating rights are shared by both partners. as a result, the legacy jv does not qualify as a vie. the company alone does not have the power to direct the activities of the legacy jv that most significantly impact the legacy jv's economic performance and as a result, the legacy jv is unconsolidated and recorded using the equity method of accounting.
as of december 31, 2016, the company has six wholly owned projects totaling 2,064 apartment units in various stages of development with estimated completion dates ranging through december 31, 2018, as well as other completed development projects that are in various stages of lease up or are stabilized. see also note 16 in the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional discussion regarding the company's development projects.
see also notes 2 and 6 in the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional discussion regarding the company's investments in partially owned entities.
the following table summarizes the company's contractual obligations for the next five years and thereafter as of december 31, 2016:
operating leases:
(b)   amounts include interest expected to be incurred on the company's secured and unsecured debt based on obligations outstanding at december 31, 2016 and inclusive of capitalized interest. for floating rate debt, the current rate in effect for the most recent payment through december 31, 2016 is assumed to be in effect through the respective maturity date of each instrument.
(c)   minimum basic rent due for various office space the company leases and fixed base rent due on ground leases for 11 properties.
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to use judgment in the application of accounting policies, including making estimates and assumptions. if our judgment or interpretation of the facts and circumstances relating to various transactions had been different or different assumptions were made, it is possible that different accounting policies would have been applied, resulting in different financial results or different presentation of our financial statements.
the company'significant accounting policies are described in note 2 in the notes to consolidated financial statements. these policies were followed in preparing the consolidated financial statements at and for the year ended december 31, 2016 and are consistent with the year ended december 31, 2015.
the company has identified five significant accounting policies as critical accounting policies. these critical accounting policies are those that have the most impact on the reporting of our financial condition and those requiring significant judgments and estimates. with respect to these critical accounting policies, management believes that the application of judgments and estimates is consistently applied and produces financial information that fairly presents the results of operations for all periods presented. the five critical accounting policies are:
acquisition of investment properties the company allocates the purchase price of properties to net tangible and identified intangible assets acquired based on their fair values. in making estimates of fair values for purposes of allocating purchase price, the company utilizes a number of sources, including independent appraisals that may be obtained in connection with the acquisition or financing of the respective property, our own analysis of recently acquired and existing comparable properties in our portfolio and other market data. the company also considers information obtained about each property as a result of its pre-acquisition due diligence, marketing and leasing activities in estimating the fair value of the tangible and intangible assets acquired.
impairment of long-lived assets the company periodically evaluates its long-lived assets, including its investments in real estate, for indicators of impairment. the judgments regarding the existence of impairment indicators are based on factors such as operational performance, market conditions and legal and environmental concerns, as well as the company's ability to hold and its intent with regard to each asset. future events could occur which would cause the company to conclude that impairment indicators exist and an impairment loss is warranted.
depreciation of investment in real estate the company depreciates the building component of its investment in real estate over a 30-year estimated useful life, building improvements over a 5-year to 15-year estimated useful life and both the furniture, fixtures and equipment and replacement components over a 5-year to 10-year estimated useful life, all of which are judgmental determinations.
cost capitalization see the capitalization of fixed assets and improvements to real estate section for a discussion of the company's policy with respect to capitalization vs. expensing of fixed asset/repair and maintenance costs. in addition, the company capitalizes an allocation of the payroll and associated costs of employees directly responsible for and who spend their time on the execution and supervision of major capital and/or renovation projects. these costs are reflected on the balance sheets as increases to depreciable property.
for all development projects, the company uses its professional judgment in determining whether such costs meet the criteria for capitalization or must be expensed as incurred. the company capitalizes interest, real estate taxes and insurance and
payroll and associated costs for those individuals directly responsible for and who spend their time on development activities, with capitalization ceasing no later than 90 days following issuance of the certificate of occupancy. these costs are reflected on the balance sheets as construction-in-progress for each specific property. the company expenses as incurred all payroll costs of on-site employees working directly at our properties, except as noted above on our development properties prior to certificate of occupancy issuance and on specific major renovations at selected properties when additional incremental employees are hired.
during the years ended december 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, the company capitalized $18.7 million, $22.3 million and $22.4 million, respectively, of payroll and associated costs of employees directly responsible for and who spend their time on the execution and supervision of development activities as well as major capital and/or renovation projects.
fair value of financial instruments, including derivative instruments the valuation of financial instruments requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the fair value of the instruments. the company, where possible, bases the fair values of its financial instruments, including its derivative instruments, on listed market prices and third party quotes. where these are not available, the company bases its estimates on current instruments with similar terms and maturities or on other factors relevant to the financial instruments.

(1)   the national association of real estate investment trusts ("nareit") defines funds from operations ("ffo") (april 2002 white paper) as net income (computed in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states ("gaap")), excluding gains (or losses) from sales and impairment write-downs of depreciable operating properties, plus depreciation and amortization, and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures. adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures will be calculated to reflect funds from operations on the same basis. the april 2002 white paper states that gain or loss on sales of property is excluded from ffo for previously depreciated operating properties only.
•   the impact of any expenses relating to non-operating asset impairment and valuation allowances;
•   property acquisition and other transaction costs related to mergers and acquisitions and pursuit cost write-offs;
•   gains and losses from early debt extinguishment, including prepayment penalties, preferred share/preference unit redemptions and the cost related to the implied option value of non-cash convertible debt discounts;
•   gains and losses on the sales of non-operating assets, including gains and losses from land parcel sales, net of the effect of income tax benefits or expenses; and
(3)   the company believes that ffo and ffo available to common shares and units / units are helpful to investors as supplemental measures of the operating performance of a real estate company, because they are recognized measures of performance by the real estate industry and by excluding gains or losses related to dispositions of depreciable property and excluding real estate depreciation (which can vary among owners of identical assets in similar condition based on historical cost accounting and useful life estimates), ffo and ffo available to common shares and units / units can help compare the operating performance of a company's real estate between periods or as compared to different companies. the company also believes that normalized ffo and normalized ffo available to common shares and units / units are helpful to investors as supplemental measures of the operating performance of a real estate company because they allow investors to compare the company's operating performance to its performance in prior reporting periods and to the operating performance of other real estate companies without the effect of items that by their nature are not comparable from period to period and tend to obscure the company's actual operating results. ffo, ffo available to common shares and units / units, normalized ffo and normalized ffo available to common shares and units / units do not represent net income, net income available to common shares / units or net cash flows from operating activities in accordance with gaap. therefore, ffo, ffo available to common shares and units / units, normalized ffo and normalized ffo available to common shares and units / units should not be exclusively considered as alternatives to net income, net income available to common shares / units or net cash flows from operating activities as determined by gaap or as a measure of liquidity. the company's calculation of ffo, ffo available to common shares and units / units, normalized ffo and normalized ffo available to common shares and units / units may differ from other real estate companies due to, among other items, variations in cost capitalization policies for capital expenditures and, accordingly, may not be comparable to such other real estate companies.
(4)   ffo available to common shares and units / units and normalized ffo available to common shares and units / units are calculated on a basis consistent with net income available to common shares / units and reflects adjustments to net income for preferred distributions and premiums on redemption of preferred shares/preference units in accordance with gaap. the equity positions of various individuals and entities that contributed their properties to the operating partnership in exchange for op units are collectively referred to as the "noncontrolling interests - operating partnership". subject to certain restrictions, the noncontrolling interests - operating partnership may exchange their op units for common shares on a one-for-one basis.

item 1a.   risk factors set forth below are the risks that we believe are material to our investors. this section contains forward-looking statements. you should refer to the explanation of the qualifications and limitations on forward-looking statements in item 1. business under the caption "forward-looking statements".
we must develop new products, adapt to rapid and significant technological change and respond to introductions of new products by competitors to remain competitive. our growth strategy includes significant investment in and expenditures for product development. we sell our products in several industries that are characterized by rapid and significant technological changes, frequent new product and service introductions and enhancements and evolving industry standards. competitive factors include technological innovation, price, service and delivery, breadth of product line, customer support, e-business capabilities and the ability to meet the special requirements of customers. our competitors may adapt more quickly to new technologies and changes in customers' requirements than we can. without the timely introduction of new products, services and enhancements, our products and services will likely become technologically obsolete over time, in which case our revenue and operating results would suffer.
many of our existing products and those under development are technologically innovative and require significant planning, design, development and testing at the technological, product and manufacturing-process levels. our customers use many of our products to develop, test and manufacture their own products. as a result, we must anticipate industry trends and develop products in advance of the commercialization of our customers' products. if we fail to adequately predict our customers' needs and future activities, we may invest heavily in research and development of products and services that do not lead to significant revenue.
it may be difficult for us to implement our strategies for improving internal growth. some of the markets in which we compete have been flat or declining over the past several years. to address this issue, we are pursuing a number of strategies to improve our internal growth, including:
•   strengthening our presence in selected geographic markets;
•   allocating research and development funding to products with higher growth prospects;
•   expanding our service offerings;
•   continuing key customer initiatives;
•   combining sales and marketing operations in appropriate markets to compete more effectively;
•   finding new markets for our products; and
•   continuing the development of commercial tools and infrastructure to increase and support cross-selling opportunities of products and services to take advantage of our depth in product offerings.
we may not be able to successfully implement these strategies, and these strategies may not result in the expected growth of our business.
our business is affected by general economic conditions and related uncertainties affecting markets in which we operate. our business is affected by general economic conditions, both inside and outside the u.s. if the global economy and financial markets, or economic conditions in europe, the u.s. or other key markets, are unstable, it could adversely affect the business, results of operations and financial condition of the company and its customers, distributors, and suppliers, having the effect of
•   reducing demand for some of our products;
•   increasing the rate of order cancellations or delays;
•   increasing the risk of excess and obsolete inventories;
•   increasing pressure on the prices for our products and services; and
demand for some of our products depends on capital spending policies of our customers and on government funding policies. our customers include pharmaceutical and chemical companies, laboratories, universities, healthcare providers, government agencies and public and private research institutions. many factors, including public policy spending priorities, available resources and product and economic cycles, have a significant effect on the capital spending policies of these entities.
spending by some of these customers fluctuates based on budget allocations and the timely passage of the annual federal budget. an impasse in federal government budget decisions could lead to substantial delays or reductions in federal spending.
risk factors (continued)
as a multinational corporation, we are exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates, which could adversely affect our cash flows and results of operations. international markets contribute a substantial portion of our revenues, and we intend to continue expanding our presence in these regions. the exposure to fluctuations in currency exchange rates takes on different forms. international revenues and costs are subject to the risk that fluctuations in exchange rates could adversely affect our reported revenues and profitability when translated into u.s. dollars for financial reporting purposes. these fluctuations could also adversely affect the demand for products and services provided by us. as a multinational corporation, our businesses occasionally invoice third-party customers in currencies other than the one in which they primarily do business (the "functional currency"). movements in the invoiced currency relative to the functional currency could adversely impact our cash flows and our results of operations. should our international sales grow, exposure to fluctuations in currency exchange rates could have a larger effect on our financial results. in 2016, currency translation had an unfavorable effect of $145 million on revenues due to the strengthening of the u.s. dollar relative to other currencies in which the company sells products and services.
significant developments stemming from the recent u.s. presidential election or the u.k.'s referendum on membership in the eu could have an adverse effect on us. the new u.s. administration has called for substantial changes to trade agreements, such as the north american free trade agreement (nafta), and has raised the possibility of imposing significant increases on tariffs on goods imported into the united states, particularly from china and mexico. the new administration has also indicated an intention to request congress to make significant changes, replacement or elimination of the patient protection and affordable care act, and government negotiation/regulation of drug prices paid by government programs. changes in u.s. social, political, regulatory and economic conditions or laws and policies governing the health care system and drug prices, foreign trade, manufacturing, and development and investment in the territories and countries where we or our customers operate could adversely affect our operating results and our business.
additionally, on june 23, 2016, the united kingdom held a referendum and voted in favor of leaving the european union, or eu. this referendum has created political and economic uncertainty, particularly in the united kingdom and the eu, and this uncertainty may last for years. our business could be affected during this period of uncertainty, and perhaps longer, by the impact of the united kingdom's referendum. in addition, our business could be negatively affected by new trade agreements between the united kingdom and other countries, including the united states, and by the possible imposition of trade or other regulatory barriers in the united kingdom. these possible negative impacts, and others resulting from the united kingdom's actual or threatened withdrawal from the eu, may adversely affect our operating results and our customers' businesses.
our inability to protect our intellectual property could have a material adverse effect on our business. in addition, third parties may claim that we infringe their intellectual property, and we could suffer significant litigation or licensing expense as a result. we place considerable emphasis on obtaining patent and trade secret protection for significant new technologies, products and processes because of the length of time and expense associated with bringing new products through the development process and into the marketplace. our success depends in part on our ability to develop patentable products and obtain and enforce patent protection for our products both in the united states and in other countries. we own numerous u.s. and foreign patents, and we intend to file additional applications, as appropriate, for patents covering our products. patents may not be issued for any pending or future patent applications owned by or licensed to us, and the claims allowed under any issued patents may not be sufficiently broad to protect our technology. any issued patents owned by or licensed to us may be challenged, invalidated or circumvented, and the rights under these patents may not provide us with competitive advantages. in addition, competitors may design around our technology or develop competing technologies. intellectual property rights may also be unavailable or limited in some foreign countries, which could make it easier for competitors to capture increased market position. we could incur substantial costs to defend ourselves in suits brought against us or in suits in which we may assert our patent rights against others. an unfavorable outcome of any such litigation could materially adversely affect our business and results of operations.
third parties may assert claims against us to the effect that we are infringing on their intellectual property rights. our life technologies subsidiary is party to several lawsuits in which plaintiffs claim we infringe their intellectual property (note 10). we could incur substantial costs and diversion of management resources in defending these claims, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. in addition, parties making these claims could secure a judgment awarding substantial damages, as well as injunctive or other equitable relief, which could effectively block our ability to make, use, sell, distribute, or market our products and services in the united states or abroad. in the event that a claim relating to intellectual property is asserted against us, or third parties not affiliated with us hold pending or issued patents that relate to our products or technology, we may seek licenses to such intellectual property or challenge those patents.
risk factors (continued)
however, we may be unable to obtain these licenses on commercially reasonable terms, if at all, and our challenge of the patents may be unsuccessful. our failure to obtain the necessary licenses or other rights could prevent the sale, manufacture, or distribution of our products and, therefore, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
changes in governmental regulations may reduce demand for our products or increase our expenses. we compete in many markets in which we and our customers must comply with federal, state, local and international regulations, such as environmental, health and safety and food and drug regulations. we develop, configure and market our products to meet customer needs created by those regulations. any significant change in regulations could reduce demand for our products or increase our expenses. for example, many of our instruments are marketed to the pharmaceutical industry for use in discovering and developing drugs. changes in the u.s. food and drug administration's regulation of the drug discovery and development process could have an adverse effect on the demand for these products.
if our security products do not operate as designed and fail to detect explosives or radiation, we could be exposed to product liability and related claims for which we may not have adequate insurance coverage. products currently or previously sold by our environmental and process instruments and radiation measurement and security instruments businesses include fixed and portable instruments used for chemical, radiation and trace explosives detection. these products are used in airports, embassies, cargo facilities, border crossings and other high-threat facilities for the detection and prevention of terrorist acts. if any of these products were to malfunction, it is possible that explosive or radioactive material could fail to be detected by our product, which could lead to product liability claims. there are also many other factors beyond our control that could lead to liability claims, such as the reliability and competence of the customers' operators and the training of such operators. any such product liability claims brought against us could be significant and any adverse determination may result in liabilities in excess of our insurance coverage. although we carry product liability insurance, we cannot be certain that our current insurance will be sufficient to cover these claims or that it can be maintained on acceptable terms, if at all.
our inability to complete pending acquisitions or to successfully integrate any new or previous acquisitions could have a material adverse effect on our business. our business strategy includes the acquisition of technologies and businesses that complement or augment our existing products and services. certain acquisitions may be difficult to complete for a number of reasons, including the need for antitrust and/or other regulatory approvals. any acquisition we may complete may be made at a substantial premium over the fair value of the net identifiable assets of the acquired company. further, we may not be able to integrate acquired businesses successfully into our existing businesses, make such businesses profitable, or realize anticipated cost savings or synergies, if any, from these acquisitions, which could adversely affect our business.
moreover, we have acquired many companies and businesses. as a result of these acquisitions, we recorded significant goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets (primarily tradenames) on our balance sheet, which amount to approximately $21.33 billion and $1.34 billion, respectively, as of december 31, 2016. in addition, we have definite-lived intangible assets totaling $12.63 billion as of december 31, 2016. we assess the realizability of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets annually as well as whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that these assets may be impaired. we assess the realizability of definite-lived intangible assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that these assets may be impaired. these events or circumstances would generally include operating losses or a significant decline in earnings associated with the acquired business or asset. our ability to realize the value of the goodwill and intangible assets will depend on the future cash flows of these businesses. these cash flows in turn depend in part on how well we have integrated these businesses. if we are not able to realize the value of the goodwill and intangible assets, we may be required to incur material charges relating to the impairment of those assets.
we are subject to laws and regulations governing government contracts, and failure to address these laws and regulations or comply with government contracts could harm our business by leading to a reduction in revenue associated with these customers. we have agreements relating to the sale of our products to government entities and, as a result, we are subject to various statutes and regulations that apply to companies doing business with the government. the laws governing government contracts differ from the laws governing private contracts and government contracts may contain pricing terms and conditions that are not applicable to private contracts. we are also subject to investigation for compliance with the regulations governing government contracts. a failure to comply with these regulations could result in suspension of these contracts, criminal, civil and administrative penalties or debarment.
because we compete directly with certain of our larger customers and product suppliers, our results of operations could be adversely affected in the short term if these customers or suppliers abruptly discontinue or significantly modify their relationship with us. our largest customer in the laboratory products business is also a significant competitor. our business may be harmed in the short term if our competitive relationship in the marketplace with certain of our large customers results in a discontinuation of their purchases from us. in addition, we manufacture products that compete directly with products that we
risk factors (continued)
source from third-party suppliers. we also source competitive products from multiple suppliers. our business could be adversely affected in the short term if any of our large third-party suppliers abruptly discontinues selling products to us.
because we rely heavily on third-party package-delivery services, a significant disruption in these services or significant increases in prices may disrupt our ability to ship products, increase our costs and lower our profitability. we ship a significant portion of our products to our customers through independent package delivery companies, such as federal express in the u.s. and dhl in europe. we also maintain a small fleet of vehicles dedicated to the delivery of our products and ship our products through other carriers, including national and regional trucking firms, overnight carrier services and the u.s. postal service. if one or more of these third-party package-delivery providers were to experience a major work stoppage, preventing our products from being delivered in a timely fashion or causing us to incur additional shipping costs we could not pass on to our customers, our costs could increase and our relationships with certain of our customers could be adversely affected. in addition, if one or more of these third-party package-delivery providers were to increase prices, and we were not able to find comparable alternatives or make adjustments in our delivery network, our profitability could be adversely affected.
we are required to comply with a wide variety of laws and regulations, and are subject to regulation by various federal, state and foreign agencies. for example, some of our operations are subject to regulation by the u.s. food and drug administration and similar international agencies. these regulations govern a wide variety of product activities, from design and development to labeling, manufacturing, promotion, sales and distribution. if we fail to comply with the u.s. food and drug administration's regulations or those of similar international agencies, we may have to recall products and/or cease their manufacture and distribution, which would increase our costs and reduce our revenues.
we are also subject to a variety of federal, state, local and international laws and regulations that govern, among other things, the importation and exportation of products, the handling, transportation and manufacture of substances that could be classified as hazardous, and our business practices in the u.s. and abroad such as anti-corruption and anti-competition laws. a failure to comply with these laws and regulations could result in criminal, civil and administrative penalties.
our business could be adversely affected by disruptions at our sites. we rely upon our manufacturing operations to produce many of the products we sell and our warehouse facilities to store products, pending sale. any significant disruption of those operations for any reason, such as strikes or other labor unrest, power interruptions, fire, or other events beyond our control could adversely affect our sales and customer relationships and therefore adversely affect our business. we have significant operations in california, near major earthquake faults, which make us susceptible to earthquake risk. although most of our raw materials are available from a number of potential suppliers, our operations also depend upon our ability to obtain raw materials at reasonable prices. if we are unable to obtain the materials we need at a reasonable price, we may not be able to produce certain of our products or we may not be able to produce certain of these products at a marketable price, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations.
fluctuations in our effective tax rate may adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows. as a global company, we are subject to taxation in numerous countries, states and other jurisdictions. in preparing our financial statements, we record the amount of tax that is payable in each of the countries, states and other jurisdictions in which we operate. our future effective tax rate, however, may be lower or higher than experienced in the past due to numerous factors, including a change in the mix of our profitability from country to country, changes in accounting for income taxes and recently enacted and future changes in tax laws in jurisdictions in which we operate. any of these factors could cause us to experience an effective tax rate significantly different from previous periods or our current expectations, which could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and cash flows.
we may incur unexpected costs from increases in fuel and raw material prices, which could reduce our earnings and cash flow. our primary commodity exposures are for fuel, petroleum-based resins and steel. while we may seek to minimize the impact of price increases through higher prices to customers and various cost-saving measures, our earnings and cash flows could be adversely affected in the event these measures are insufficient to cover our costs.
a significant disruption in, or breach in security of, our information technology systems could adversely affect our business. as a part of our ongoing effort to upgrade our current information systems, we periodically implement new enterprise resource planning software and other software applications to manage certain of our business operations. as we implement and add functionality, problems could arise that we have not foreseen. such problems could disrupt our ability to provide quotes, take customer orders and otherwise run our business in a timely manner. when we upgrade or change systems, we may suffer interruptions in service, loss of data or reduced functionality. in addition, if our new systems fail to provide accurate pricing and cost data our results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected.
we also rely on our technology infrastructure, among other functions, to interact with suppliers, sell our products and services, fulfill orders and bill, collect and make payments, ship products, provide services and support to customers, track
risk factors (continued)
customers, fulfill contractual obligations and otherwise conduct business. our systems may be vulnerable to damage or interruption from natural disasters, power loss, telecommunication failures, terrorist attacks, computer viruses, computer denial-of-service attacks, unauthorized access to customer or employee data or company trade secrets, and other attempts to harm our systems. certain of our systems are not redundant, and our disaster recovery planning is not sufficient for every eventuality. despite any precautions we may take, such problems could result in, among other consequences, interruptions in our services, which could harm our reputation and financial results. any of the cyber-attacks, breaches or other disruptions or damage described above could interrupt our operations, delay production and shipments, result in theft of our and our customers' intellectual property and trade secrets, damage customer and business partner relationships and our reputation or result in defective products or services, legal claims and proceedings, liability and penalties under privacy laws and increased cost for security and remediation, each of which could adversely affect our business and financial results.
our debt may restrict our investment opportunities or limit our activities. as of december 31, 2016, we had approximately $16.63 billion in outstanding indebtedness. in addition, we have availability to borrow under a revolving credit facility that provides for up to $2.50 billion of unsecured multi-currency revolving credit. we may also obtain additional long-term debt and lines of credit to meet future financing needs, which would have the effect of increasing our total leverage.
our leverage could have negative consequences, including increasing our vulnerability to adverse economic and industry conditions, limiting our ability to obtain additional financing and limiting our ability to acquire new products and technologies through strategic acquisitions.
our ability to make scheduled payments, refinance our obligations or obtain additional financing will depend on our future operating performance and on economic, financial, competitive and other factors beyond our control. our business may not generate sufficient cash flow to meet our obligations. if we are unable to service our debt, refinance our existing debt or obtain additional financing, we may be forced to delay strategic acquisitions, capital expenditures or research and development expenditures.
additionally, the agreements governing our debt require that we maintain certain financial ratios, and contain affirmative and negative covenants that restrict our activities by, among other limitations, limiting our ability to incur additional indebtedness, merge or consolidate with other entities, make investments, create liens, sell assets and enter into transactions with affiliates. the covenants in our revolving credit facility and our term facility (each, a "facility" and together, the "facilities") include a total debt-to-consolidated ebitda ratio and an interest coverage ratio. specifically, the company has agreed that, so long as any lender has any commitment under the revolving credit facility, any letter of credit is outstanding under the revolving credit facility, or any loan or other obligation is outstanding under the revolving credit facility, it will not permit (as the following terms are defined in the credit agreement governing the revolving credit facility) the consolidated leverage ratio (the ratio of consolidated indebtedness to consolidated ebitda) to be greater than 4.5 to 1.0 as of the last day of any fiscal quarter for the first two consecutive quarters following the acquisition of fei (see note 2), with such ratio stepping down to 4.0 to 1.0 for the two immediately following fiscal quarters and then stepping down to 3.5 to 1.0 for each fiscal quarter thereafter. the company's term facility includes consolidated leverage ratio covenants substantively the same as the covenant included in the revolving credit facility.
the company has also agreed that so long as any lender has any commitment under the revolving credit facility or any letter of credit is outstanding under the revolving credit facility, or any loan or other obligation is outstanding under any facility (including the term loan and bridge facilities), it will not permit the consolidated interest coverage ratio (the ratio of consolidated ebitda to consolidated interest expense) to be less than 3.0 to 1.0 as at the last day of any fiscal quarter.
our ability to comply with these financial restrictions and covenants is dependent on our future performance, which is subject to prevailing economic conditions and other factors, including factors that are beyond our control such as foreign exchange rates and interest rates. our failure to comply with any of these restrictions or covenants may result in an event of default under the applicable debt instrument, which could permit acceleration of the debt under that instrument and require us to prepay that debt before its scheduled due date. also, an acceleration of the debt under certain of our debt instruments would trigger an event of default under other of our debt instruments.
item 7.   management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations reference is made throughout this management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations to notes to consolidated financial statements, which begin on page f-1 of this report.
overview the company develops, manufactures and sells a broad range of products that are sold worldwide. the company expands the product lines and services it offers by developing and commercializing its own technologies and by making strategic acquisitions of complementary businesses. the company's continuing operations fall into four business segments (see note 3): life sciences solutions, analytical instruments, specialty diagnostics and laboratory products and services.
recent acquisitions and divestitures the company's strategy is to augment internal growth at existing businesses with complementary acquisitions. the company's principal recent acquisitions and divestitures are described below.
on february 3, 2014, the company completed the acquisition of life technologies corporation for a total purchase price of $15.30 billion, net of cash acquired, including the assumption of $2.28 billion of debt. the company issued debt and common stock in late 2013 and early 2014 to partially fund the acquisition discussed below under the caption "liquidity and capital resources". life technologies was integrated into the life sciences solutions segment and provides innovative products and services to customers conducting scientific research and genetic analysis, as well as those in applied markets, such as forensics and food safety testing. life technologies' revenues totaled $3.87 billion in 2013.
on march 21, 2014, the company sold its legacy sera and media, gene modulation and magnetic beads businesses to ge healthcare for $1.06 billion, net of cash divested. the sale of these businesses resulted in a pre-tax gain of approximately $761 million included in restructuring and other costs (income), net. the businesses fell principally in the life sciences solutions segment. divestiture of these businesses was a condition to obtaining antitrust approval for the life technologies acquisition. revenues and operating income of the businesses sold were approximately $250 million and $64 million, respectively, for the year ended december 31, 2013 and $61 million and $12 million, respectively, in 2014 through the date of sale.
on august 15, 2014, the company sold its cole-parmer specialty channel business, part of the laboratory products and services segment, for $480 million in cash, net of cash divested. the sale of this business resulted in a pre-tax gain of approximately $134 million, included in restructuring and other costs (income), net. revenues and operating income of the business sold were approximately $232 million and $43 million, respectively, for the year ended december 31, 2013 and $149 million and $28 million, respectively, in 2014 through the date of sale.
in february 2015, the company acquired, within the life sciences solutions segment, advanced scientifics, inc., a north america-based global provider of single-use systems and process equipment for bioprocess production, for approximately $289 million. the acquisition expanded the company's bioprocessing offerings. revenues of advanced scientifics were approximately $80 million in 2014.
on september 30, 2015, the company acquired, within the laboratory products and services segment, alfa aesar, a u.k.-based global manufacturer of research chemicals from johnson matthey plc, for £257 million ($393 million) in cash. the acquisition expanded the company's existing portfolio of chemicals, solvents and reagents. revenues of alfa aesar were approximately £78 million in 2014.
on march 31, 2016, the company acquired, within the life sciences solutions segment, affymetrix, inc., a north america-based provider of cellular and genetic analysis products, for a total purchase price of $1.34 billion, net of cash acquired, including the assumption of $254 million of debt. the acquisition expanded the company's existing portfolio of antibodies and assays for flow cytometry and single-cell biology applications. additionally, the acquisition expanded the company's genetic analysis portfolio through the addition of microarrays. revenues of affymetrix were $360 million in 2015.
on september 19, 2016, the company acquired, within the analytical instruments segment, fei company, a north america-based provider of high-performance electron microscopy, for a total purchase price of $4.08 billion, net of cash acquired. the acquisition strengthened the company's analytical instrument portfolio with the addition of high-end electron microscopes. revenues of fei were $930 million in 2015.
management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview of results of operations and liquidity
laboratory products and services          7,030.0            38.5    %          6,661.5            39.3    %
sales in 2016 were $18.27 billion, an increase of $1.31 billion from 2015. sales increased $733 million due to acquisitions. the unfavorable effects of currency translation resulted in a decrease in revenues of $145 million in 2016. aside from the effects of currency translation and acquisitions, revenues increased $721 million (4%) primarily due to increased demand. sales to customers in the company's primary end markets grew. demand from customers in pharmaceutical and biotech industries was particularly strong. sales growth was strong in asia, moderate in europe and modest in north america. based on the weakening of currency exchange rates against the u.s. dollar that occurred in 2016, the company currently expects that there will be a continued adverse effect on reported amounts of revenue and operating income in 2017 as a result of the stronger u.s. dollar.
in 2016, total company operating income and operating income margin were $2.45 billion and 13.4%, respectively, compared with $2.34 billion and 13.8%, respectively, in 2015. the increase in operating income was primarily due to profit on higher sales in local currencies, productivity improvements, net of inflationary cost increases, and, to a lesser extent, acquisitions. these increases were offset in part by higher restructuring and acquisition-related charges in the 2016 period, strategic growth investments and unfavorable sales mix. the company's references to strategic growth investments generally refer to targeted spending for enhancing commercial capabilities, including expansion of geographic sales reach and e-commerce platforms, marketing initiatives, focused research projects and other expenditures to enhance the customer experience. the company's references throughout this discussion to productivity improvements generally refer to improved cost efficiencies from its practical process improvement (ppi) business system, reduced costs resulting from global sourcing initiatives, a lower cost structure following restructuring actions, including headcount reductions and consolidation of facilities, and low cost region manufacturing.
the company recorded a benefit from income taxes in 2016. in 2016, the company continued to implement tax planning initiatives related to non-u.s. subsidiaries. these non-u.s. subsidiaries incurred foreign tax obligations, and made cash and deemed distributions to the company's u.s. operations which resulted in no net tax cost. as a result of these distributions, the company benefitted from u.s. foreign tax credits of $91 million, offset in part by additional u.s. taxes of $37 million on the related foreign income (which reduced the benefit from the foreign rate differential in 2016) for a net benefit of $54 million. the foreign tax credits are the result of foreign earnings remitted or deemed remitted to the u.s. during the reporting year and the u.s. treatment of taxes paid in the foreign jurisdictions in the years those profits were originally earned. the company intends to make similar types of distributions from non-u.s. subsidiaries when they can be made at no net tax cost. the ability of the company to make distributions in future periods of similar type and magnitude will depend on the level of earnings and cash flow in various foreign jurisdictions and on the applicable tax laws in effect at that time. accordingly, the impact of foreign tax credits on the company's effective tax rate in future periods is likely to vary. the company also implemented foreign tax credit planning in sweden which resulted in $100 million of foreign tax credits, with no related incremental u.s. income tax expense. in addition, the company recorded discrete benefits in 2016 totaling $39 million related to prior year tax filings and net charges of $12 million related to tax audits.
the company recorded a benefit from income taxes in 2015. in 2015, the company implemented tax planning initiatives related to non-u.s. subsidiaries. these non-u.s. subsidiaries incurred foreign tax obligations, and made cash and deemed distributions to the company's u.s. operations which resulted in no net tax cost. as a result of these distributions, the company benefitted from u.s. foreign tax credits of $111 million, offset in part by additional u.s. taxes of $46 million on the related foreign income (which reduced the benefit from the foreign rate differential in 2015) for a net benefit of $66 million. the foreign tax credits are the result of foreign earnings remitted or deemed remitted to the u.s. during the reporting year and the u.s. treatment of taxes paid in the foreign jurisdictions in the years those profits were originally earned. the company also implemented foreign tax credit planning in sweden which resulted in $80 million of foreign tax credits, with no related

incremental u.s. income tax expense. in addition, the company recorded discrete benefits totaling $54 million related to additional prior year foreign tax and other credits as well as restructuring and other costs associated with the 2014 acquisition of life technologies. the tax provision in the 2015 period was favorably affected by $37 million as a result of adjustments to deferred tax balances due to changes in tax rates. the effective tax rate in both 2016 and 2015 was also affected by relatively significant earnings in lower tax jurisdictions. due primarily to the non-deductibility of intangible asset amortization for tax purposes, the company's cash payments for income taxes were higher than its income tax expense for financial reporting purposes and totaled $663 million and $477 million in 2016 and 2015, respectively.
the company expects its effective tax rate in 2017 will be less than 3% based on currently forecasted rates of profitability in the countries in which the company conducts business and expected generation of foreign tax credits.
income from continuing operations increased to $2.03 billion in 2016, from $1.98 billion in 2015. the increase in operating income in the 2016 period (discussed above) was offset in part by an increase in interest expense of $55 million primarily due to increases in outstanding debt to fund acquisitions and a lower tax benefit from income taxes in 2016.
during 2016, the company's cash flow from operations totaled $3.16 billion compared with $2.82 billion for 2015. the increase primarily resulted from lower investments in working capital and higher income before amortization and depreciation in the 2016 period.
as of december 31, 2016, the company's short-term debt totaled $1.26 billion, including $300 million due within the next twelve months under a 3-year term loan agreement and $953 million of commercial paper obligations. the company has a revolving credit facility with a bank group that provides up to $2.50 billion of unsecured multi-currency revolving credit. if the company borrows under this facility, it intends to leave undrawn an amount equivalent to outstanding commercial paper to provide a source of funds in the event that commercial paper markets are not available. as of december 31, 2016, no borrowings were outstanding under the company's revolving credit facility, although available capacity was reduced by approximately $72 million as a result of outstanding letters of credit.
the company believes that its existing cash and cash equivalents of $786 million as of december 31, 2016 and its future cash flow from operations together with available borrowing capacity under its revolving credit agreement will be sufficient to meet the cash requirements of its existing businesses for the foreseeable future, including at least the next 24 months.
critical accounting policies and estimates the company's discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations is based upon its financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america. the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses and related disclosure of contingent liabilities. on an on-going basis, management evaluates its estimates, including those related to bad debts, inventories, business combinations, intangible assets and goodwill, sales returns, income taxes, contingencies and litigation, and pension costs. management believes the most complex and sensitive judgments, because of their significance to the consolidated financial statements, result primarily from the need to make estimates about the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain. management bases its estimates on historical experience, current market and economic conditions and other assumptions that management believes are reasonable. the results of these estimates form the basis for judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities where the values are not readily apparent from other sources. actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.
the company believes the following represent its critical accounting policies and estimates used in the preparation of its financial statements:
(a)   accounts receivable the company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to pay amounts due. such allowances totaled $77 million at december 31, 2016. the company estimates the amount of customer receivables that are uncollectible based on the age of the receivable, the creditworthiness of the customer and any other information that is relevant to the judgment. if the financial condition of the company's customers were to deteriorate, reducing their ability to make payments, additional allowances would be required.
management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations critical accounting policies and estimates (continued)
expected demand and any other information that is relevant to the judgment. if ultimate usage or demand varies significantly from expected usage or demand, additional writedowns may be required.
(c)   intangible assets and goodwill the company uses assumptions and estimates in determining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination. the determination of the fair value of intangible assets, which represent a significant portion of the purchase price in many of the company's acquisitions, requires the use of significant judgment with regard to (i) the fair value; and (ii) whether such intangibles are amortizable or non-amortizable and, if the former, the period and the method by which the intangible asset will be amortized. the company estimates the fair value of acquisition-related intangible assets principally based on projections of cash flows that will arise from identifiable intangible assets of acquired businesses. the projected cash flows are discounted to determine the present value of the assets at the dates of acquisition. definite-lived intangible assets totaled $12.63 billion at december 31, 2016. the company reviews definite-lived intangible assets for impairment when indication of potential impairment exists, such as a significant reduction in cash flows associated with the assets. actual cash flows arising from a particular intangible asset could vary from projected cash flows which could imply different carrying values from those established at the dates of acquisition and which could result in impairment of such asset.
the company evaluates goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment annually and when events occur or circumstances change that may reduce the fair value of the asset below its carrying amount. events or circumstances that might require an interim evaluation include unexpected adverse business conditions, economic factors, unanticipated technological changes or competitive activities, loss of key personnel and acts by governments and courts. goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets totaled $21.33 billion and $1.34 billion, respectively, at december 31, 2016. estimates of future cash flows require assumptions related to revenue and operating income growth, asset-related expenditures, working capital levels and other factors. different assumptions from those made in the company's analysis could materially affect projected cash flows and the company's evaluation of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment.
indications of fair value based on projections of profitability for 2017 and thereafter and on peer revenues and earnings trading multiples were sufficient to conclude that no impairment of goodwill or indefinite-lived intangible assets existed at the end of the tenth fiscal month of 2016, the date of the company's impairment testing. there can be no assurance, however, that an economic downturn will not materially adversely affect peer trading multiples and the company's businesses such that they do not achieve their forecasted profitability and these assets become impaired. should the fair value of the company's goodwill or indefinite-lived intangible assets decline because of reduced operating performance, market declines, or other indicators of impairment, or as a result of changes in the discount rate, charges for impairment may be necessary.
with the completion of the fei acquisition in september 2016, the company established a new reporting unit called materials and structural analysis, which consists of the former fei business. because this reporting unit consists solely of the acquired business, the book value of which equaled its fair value as of the acquisition date, no cushion of fair value over book value existed at the acquisition date. during its 2016 goodwill impairment testing, the company determined that the materials and structural analysis reporting unit's cushion of fair value over book value was nominal as of november 5, 2016. given that the fair value is not substantially in excess of the book value, relatively small decreases in future cash flows from forecasted results or changes in discount rates or other assumptions could result in impairment of goodwill. the key variables that drive the cash flows of the reporting unit are levels of profitability and terminal value growth rate assumptions, as well as the weighted average cost of capital (wacc) rate applied. the estimates used for these assumptions represent management's best estimates, which the company believes are reasonable. these assumptions, however, are subject to uncertainty, including the degree to which the acquired business will grow revenue and profitability levels. the materials and structural analysis reporting unit had $1.99 billion of goodwill, and had an overall carrying value of $3.93 billion as of december 31, 2016.
(d)   revenues in instances where the company sells equipment with a related installation obligation, the company generally recognizes revenue related to the equipment when title passes. the company recognizes revenue related to the installation when it performs the installation. the allocation of revenue between the equipment and the installation is based on relative selling price at the time of sale. should the relative value of either the equipment or the installation change, the company's revenue recognition would be affected.
management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations critical accounting policies and estimates (continued)
in instances where the company sells equipment with customer-specified acceptance criteria, the company must assess whether it can demonstrate adherence to the acceptance criteria prior to the customer's acceptance testing to determine the timing of revenue recognition. if the nature of customer-specified acceptance criteria were to change or grow in complexity such that the company could not demonstrate adherence, the company would be required to defer additional revenues upon shipment of its products until completion of customer acceptance testing.
the company records reductions to revenue for estimated product returns by customers. should a greater or lesser number of products be returned, additional adjustments to revenue may be required.
(e)   income taxes in the ordinary course of business there is inherent uncertainty in quantifying the company's income tax positions. the company assesses income tax positions and records tax benefits for all years subject to examination based upon management's evaluation of the facts, circumstances and information available at the reporting date. for those tax positions where it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained, the company has recorded the largest amount of tax benefit with a greater than 50 percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information. for those income tax positions where it is not more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained, no tax benefit has been recognized in the financial statements. the company's reserve for these matters totaled $802 million at december 31, 2016. where applicable, associated interest expense has also been recognized as a component of the provision for income taxes.
the company operates in numerous countries under many legal forms and, as a result, is subject to the jurisdiction of numerous domestic and non-u.s. tax authorities, as well as to tax agreements and treaties among these governments. determination of taxable income in any jurisdiction requires the interpretation of the related tax laws and regulations and the use of estimates and assumptions regarding significant future events, such as the amount, timing and character of deductions, permissible revenue recognition methods under the tax law and the sources and character of income and tax credits. changes in tax laws, regulations, agreements and treaties, currency exchange restrictions or the company's level of operations or profitability in each taxing jurisdiction could have an impact upon the amount of current and deferred tax balances and hence the company's net income.
the company estimates the degree to which tax assets and loss carryforwards will result in a benefit, based on expected profitability by tax jurisdiction, and provides a valuation allowance for tax assets and loss carryforwards that it believes will more likely than not go unused. if it becomes more likely than not that a tax asset or loss carryforward will be used, the company reverses the related valuation allowance. any such reversals are recorded as a reduction of the company's tax provision. the company's tax valuation allowance totaled $113 million at december 31, 2016. should the company's actual future taxable income by tax jurisdiction vary from estimates, additional allowances or reversals thereof may be necessary.
the company provides a liability for future income tax payments in the worldwide tax jurisdictions in which it operates. should tax return positions that the company expects are sustainable not be sustained upon audit, the company could be required to record an incremental tax provision for such taxes. should previously unrecognized tax benefits ultimately be sustained, a reduction in the company's tax provision would result.
the company operates in various jurisdictions around the world. with the exception of its affymetrix singapore subsidiary, the company has not provided income taxes on the undistributed earnings of its non-u.s. subsidiaries due to its intention to permanently reinvest such earnings unless the company can remit such earnings to the u.s. without associated net tax cost. the company recorded a deferred tax liability of $156 million in acquisition accounting for the outside basis difference of affymetrix singapore as the company intends to integrate it with the company's existing singapore operations within the next twelve months. aside from this plan, the company's intent is to only make distributions from non-u.s. subsidiaries in the future when they can be made at no net tax cost.
(f)   contingencies and litigation the company records accruals for various contingencies, including legal proceedings, environmental, workers' compensation, product, general and auto liabilities, and other claims that arise in the normal course of business. the accruals are based on management's judgment, historical claims experience, the probability of losses and, where applicable, the consideration of opinions of internal and or external legal counsel and actuarial estimates. accruals of acquired businesses, including product liability and environmental accruals, were initially recorded at fair value and
management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations critical accounting policies and estimates (continued)
discounted to their net present value. additionally, the company records receivables from third-party insurers when recovery has been determined to be probable.
(g)   pension and other retiree benefits several of the company's u.s. and non-u.s. subsidiaries sponsor defined benefit pension and other retiree benefit plans. the cost and obligations of these arrangements are calculated using many assumptions to estimate the benefits that the employee earns while working, the amount of which cannot be completely determined until the benefit payments cease. major assumptions used in the accounting for these employee benefit plans include the discount rate, expected return on plan assets and rate of increase in employee compensation levels. assumptions are determined based on company data and appropriate market indicators in consultation with third-party actuaries, and are evaluated each year as of the plans' measurement date. net periodic pension costs for the company's pension and other postretirement benefit plans totaled $34 million in 2016. the company's unfunded benefit obligation totaled $610 million at year-end 2016 compared with $528 million at year-end 2015. should any of these assumptions change, they would have an effect on net periodic pension costs and the unfunded benefit obligation. for example, a 10% decrease in the discount rate would result in an annual increase in pension and other postretirement benefit expense of approximately $2 million and an increase in the benefit obligation of approximately $93 million.
as of december 31, 2016, the company expects to contribute between $215 and $235 million to its existing defined benefit pension plans in 2017.
as of january 1, 2017, the company changed the method it uses to estimate the service and interest components of net periodic benefit cost for pension and other retiree benefit plans. historically, the company estimated these service and interest cost components utilizing the single weighted-average discount rate used to measure each plan's benefit obligation at the beginning of the year. beginning in 2017, the company will utilize a full yield curve approach in the estimation of these components by applying the specific spot-rates along the yield curve used in the determination of the benefit obligation to the relevant projected cash flows. the company has made this change to provide a more precise measurement of the service and interest costs by improving the correlation between projected benefit cash flows to the corresponding spot yield curve rates. the company has accounted for this change as a change in accounting estimate and will account for it prospectively starting in january 2017. the reduction in service and interest costs for 2017 associated with this change in estimate will be approximately $10 million.

sales in 2016 were $18.27 billion, an increase of $1.31 billion from 2015. the unfavorable effects of currency translation resulted in a decrease in revenues of $145 million in 2016. sales increased $733 million due to acquisitions. aside from the effects of currency translation and acquisitions, revenues increased $721 million (4%) primarily due to increased demand. sales to customers in the company's primary end markets grew. demand from customers in pharmaceutical and biotech industries was particularly strong. sales growth was strong in asia, moderate in europe and modest in north america.
in 2016, total company operating income and operating income margin were $2.45 billion and 13.4%, respectively, compared with $2.34 billion and 13.8%, respectively, in 2015. the increase in operating income was primarily due to profit on higher sales in local currencies, productivity improvements, net of inflationary cost increases, and, to a lesser extent,
management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations results of operations (continued)
acquisitions. these increases were offset in part by higher restructuring and acquisition-related charges in the 2016 period, strategic growth investments and unfavorable sales mix.
in 2016, the company recorded restructuring and other costs, net, of $395 million, including $102 million of charges to cost of revenues for the sale of inventories revalued at the date of acquisition and to conform the accounting policies of fei and affymetrix with the company's accounting policies; $104 million of charges to selling, general and administrative expenses primarily for third-party transaction and integration costs related to the acquisitions of fei and affymetrix. in addition, the company recorded $164 million of cash restructuring costs, primarily to achieve acquisition synergies, including severance and abandoned facilities costs associated with the closure and consolidation of facilities in the u.s. the company's other businesses incurred costs for continued headcount reductions and facility consolidations in an effort to streamline operations, including severance at several businesses and abandoned facility expenses at businesses that have been or are being consolidated in the u.s., europe and asia (see note 14). the company also recorded charges for litigation and environmental remediation matters. these costs were partially offset by gains on the sales of real estate.
in 2015, the company recorded restructuring and other costs, net, of $171 million, including $9 million of charges to cost of revenues for the sale of inventories revalued at the date of acquisition and, to a lesser extent, accelerated depreciation at facilities closing due to real estate consolidation; $46 million of charges to selling, general and administrative expenses primarily for charges associated with product liability litigation, third-party transaction and integration costs primarily related to the acquisitions of life technologies and alfa aesar, and accelerated depreciation at facilities closing due to real estate consolidation. in addition, the company recorded $82 million of cash restructuring costs primarily for actions to achieve synergies from the life technologies acquisition and for abandoned facilities costs associated with a manufacturing facility in the u.s. the company's other businesses incurred costs for continued headcount reductions and facility consolidations in an effort to streamline operations, including severance at several businesses and abandoned facility expenses at businesses that have been or are being consolidated, including the consolidation of operations within several facilities in the u.s., europe and asia. the company also recorded charges for litigation-related matters associated with acquired businesses and impairment of acquired technology in development. these costs were partially offset by gains on the sale of a small product line and real estate.
as of february 28, 2017, the company has identified restructuring actions that will result in additional charges of approximately $85 million in 2017 and expects to identify additional actions during 2017 which will be recorded when specified criteria are met, such as communication of benefit arrangements and abandonment of leased facilities. approximately 45% of the additional charges will be incurred in the life sciences solutions segment, 35% in the analytical instruments segment, with the remainder incurred across the company's remaining segments. the restructuring projects for which charges were incurred in 2016 are expected to result in annual cost savings of approximately $100 million beginning in part in 2016 and, to a greater extent, in 2017, including $60 million in the life sciences solutions segment, $25 million in the analytical instruments segment, $5 million in the specialty diagnostics segment and $10 million in the laboratory products and services segment. the restructuring actions for which charges were incurred in 2015 resulted in annual cost savings of approximately $100 million beginning in part in 2015 and to a greater extent in 2016, including $50 million in the life sciences solutions segment, $25 million in the analytical instruments segment, $10 million in the specialty diagnostics segment and $15 million in the laboratory products and services segment.
segment results the company's management evaluates segment operating performance using operating income before certain charges/credits to cost of revenues and selling, general and administrative expenses, principally associated with acquisition-related activities; restructuring and other costs/income including costs arising from facility consolidations such as severance and abandoned lease expense and gains and losses from the sale of real estate and product lines; and amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets. the company uses this measure because it helps management understand and evaluate the segments' core operating results and facilitate comparison of performance for determining compensation (note 3). accordingly, the following segment data is reported on this basis.

other expense, net the company reported other expense, net, of $425 million and $400 million in 2016 and 2015, respectively (note 4). interest expense increased $55 million primarily due to an increase in outstanding debt. in 2016, other items, net includes $22 million of charges related to the amortization of fees paid to obtain bridge financing commitments for the acquisition of fei and $9 million of losses on the early extinguishment of debt, offset in part by $12.5 million of gains on investments. in 2015, other items, net includes losses of $12 million on the early extinguishment of debt and costs of $7.5 million associated with entering into interest rate swap arrangements.
provision for income taxes the company recorded a benefit from income taxes in 2016. in 2016, the company continued to implement tax planning initiatives related to non-u.s. subsidiaries. these non-u.s. subsidiaries incurred foreign tax obligations, and made cash and deemed distributions to the company's u.s. operations which resulted in no net tax cost. as a result of these distributions, the company benefitted from u.s. foreign tax credits of $91 million, offset in part by additional u.s. taxes of $37 million on the related foreign income (which reduced the benefit from the foreign rate differential in 2016) for a net benefit of $54 million. the foreign tax credits are the result of foreign earnings remitted or deemed remitted to the u.s. during the reporting year and the u.s. treatment of taxes paid in the foreign jurisdictions in the years those profits were originally earned. the company intends to make similar types of distributions from non-u.s. subsidiaries when they can be made at no net tax cost. the ability of the company to make distributions in future periods of similar type and magnitude will depend on the level of earnings and cash flow in various foreign jurisdictions and on the applicable tax laws in effect at that time. accordingly, the impact of foreign tax credits on the company's effective tax rate in future periods is likely to vary. the company also implemented foreign tax credit planning in sweden which resulted in $100 million of foreign tax credits, with no related incremental u.s. income tax expense. in addition, the company recorded discrete benefits in 2016 totaling $39 million related to prior year tax filings and net charges of $12 million related to tax audits.
the company recorded a benefit from income taxes in 2015. in 2015, the company implemented tax planning initiatives related to non-u.s. subsidiaries. these non-u.s. subsidiaries incurred foreign tax obligations, and made cash and deemed distributions to the company's u.s. operations which resulted in no net tax cost. as a result of these distributions, the company benefitted from u.s. foreign tax credits of $111 million, offset in part by additional u.s. taxes of $46 million on the related foreign income (which reduced the benefit from the foreign rate differential in 2015) for a net benefit of $66 million. the foreign tax credits are the result of foreign earnings remitted or deemed remitted to the u.s. during the reporting year and the u.s. treatment of taxes paid in the foreign jurisdictions in the years those profits were originally earned. the company also implemented foreign tax credit planning in sweden which resulted in $80 million of foreign tax credits, with no related incremental u.s. income tax expense. in addition, the company recorded discrete benefits totaling $54 million related to additional prior year foreign tax and other credits as well as restructuring and other costs associated with the 2014 acquisition of life technologies. the tax provision in the 2015 period was favorably affected by $37 million as a result of adjustments to deferred tax balances due to changes in tax rates. the effective tax rate in both 2016 and 2015 was also affected by relatively significant earnings in lower tax jurisdictions. due primarily to the non-deductibility of intangible asset amortization for tax purposes, the company's cash payments for income taxes were higher than its income tax expense for financial reporting purposes and totaled $663 million and $477 million in 2016 and 2015, respectively.
the company expects its effective tax rate in 2017 will be less than 3% based on currently forecasted rates of profitability in the countries in which the company conducts business and expected generation of foreign tax credits.
the company has operations and a taxable presence in approximately 50 countries outside the u.s. all of these countries except one have a lower tax rate than the u.s. the countries in which the company has a material presence that have significantly lower tax rates than the u.s. include germany, the netherlands, singapore, sweden, switzerland and the united kingdom. the company's ability to obtain a benefit from lower tax rates outside the u.s. is dependent on its relative levels of income in countries outside the u.s. and on the statutory tax rates in those countries. based on the dispersion of the company's non-u.s. income tax provision among many countries, the company believes that a change in the statutory tax rate in any individual country is not likely to materially affect the company's income tax provision or net income, aside from any resulting one-time adjustment to the company's deferred tax balances to reflect a new rate.

sales in 2015 were $16.97 billion, an increase of $76 million from 2014. the unfavorable effects of currency translation resulted in a decrease in revenues of $938 million in 2015. sales increased $212 million due to acquisitions, principally life technologies, net of divestitures. aside from the effects of currency translation and acquisitions/divestitures, revenues increased $803 million (5%) primarily due to increased demand. sales to customers in the company's primary end markets grew. demand from customers in pharmaceutical and biotech industries was particularly strong. sales growth was moderate in north america and europe and strong in asia.
in 2015, total company operating income and operating income margin were $2.34 billion and 13.8%, respectively, compared with $2.50 billion and 14.8%, respectively, in 2014. the decrease in operating income and operating income margin was primarily due to net gains of $895 million on the sale of businesses in 2014, offset in part by $450 million of charges in 2014 associated with the february 2014 acquisition of life technologies. the unfavorable impact of foreign currency exchange also contributed to the decrease in profitability. these factors that reduced operating income in 2015 were offset in part by productivity improvements, net of inflationary cost increases and, to a lesser extent, profit on higher sales in local currencies.
in 2015, the company recorded restructuring and other costs, net, of $171 million, including $9 million of charges to cost of revenues for the sale of inventories revalued at the date of acquisition and, to a lesser extent, accelerated depreciation at facilities closing due to real estate consolidation; $46 million of charges to selling, general and administrative expenses primarily for charges associated with product liability litigation, third-party transaction and integration costs primarily related to the acquisitions of life technologies and alfa aesar, and accelerated depreciation at facilities closing due to real estate consolidation. in addition, the company recorded $82 million of cash restructuring costs primarily for actions to achieve synergies from the life technologies acquisition and for abandoned facilities costs associated with a manufacturing facility in the u.s. the company's other businesses incurred costs for continued headcount reductions and facility consolidations in an effort to streamline operations, including severance at several businesses and abandoned facility expenses at businesses that have been or are being consolidated, including the consolidation of operations within several facilities in the u.s., europe and asia. the company also recorded charges for litigation-related matters associated with acquired businesses and impairment of acquired technology in development. these costs were partially offset by gains on the sale of a small product line and real estate (see note 14).
in 2014, the company recorded restructuring and other income, net, of $140 million, including net gains on the sale of businesses and real estate of $895 million and $15 million, respectively, offset in part by $328 million of charges to cost of revenues primarily for the sale of inventories revalued at the date of acquisition; $131 million of charges to selling, general and administrative expenses primarily for transaction costs related to the acquisition of life technologies; and $29 million of charges for pension settlements. the company incurred $268 million of cash restructuring costs primarily associated with the life technologies acquisition including cash compensation to monetize certain equity awards held by life technologies

employees at the date of acquisition and severance obligations to former executives and employees of life technologies. in addition, the company's other businesses incurred costs for continued headcount reductions and facility consolidations in an effort to streamline operations, including severance at several businesses and abandoned facility expenses at businesses that have been or are being consolidated, including the consolidation of operations within several facilities in the u.s., europe and asia.
the restructuring actions for which charges were incurred in 2014 resulted in annual cost savings of approximately $120 million beginning in part in 2014 and to a greater extent in 2015, including $80 million in the life sciences solutions segment, $10 million in the analytical instruments segment, $10 million in the specialty diagnostics segment and $20 million in the laboratory products and services segment.

sales in the life sciences solutions segment increased $244 million to $4.44 billion in 2015 primarily due to the acquisition of life technologies, net of divestitures. had the acquisition of life technologies been completed at the beginning of 2013, revenues for the 2015 period would have decreased $25 million compared to pro forma 2014 revenues, including a decrease of $278 million due to the unfavorable effects of currency translation, offset in part by an increase of $213 million (5%) due to higher revenues at existing businesses and an increase of $40 million due to other acquisitions, net of dispositions. the increase in pro forma revenue at existing businesses was primarily due to increased demand for bioprocess production products as well as biosciences products.
operating income margin was 30.1% in 2015 compared to 29.0% in 2014. the increase resulted primarily from productivity improvements (including acquisition cost synergies), net of inflationary cost increases and favorable sales mix. these increases were offset in part by the unfavorable impact of foreign currency exchange and, to a lesser extent, by exclusion in 2014 of january's lower margin results for life technologies. results for january commonly have a lower margin rate than results for the balance of the quarter, due to the phasing of revenue and costs.

operating income margin was 19.1% in 2015 compared to 17.9% in 2014. the increase resulted primarily from productivity improvements, net of inflationary cost increases and profit on incremental sales in local currencies, offset in part by strategic growth investments and the impact of unfavorable foreign currency exchange.

operating income margin was 26.9% in 2015 and 27.4% in 2014. the decrease resulted primarily from strategic growth investments and unfavorable foreign currency exchange, offset in part by productivity improvements, net of inflationary cost increases.

operating income margin was 15.0% in 2015 and 14.9% in 2014. the increase was primarily due to productivity improvements, net of inflationary cost increases as well as profit on incremental sales in local currencies offset in part by unfavorable sales mix and strategic growth investments.
other expense, net the company reported other expense, net, of $400 million and $416 million in 2015 and 2014, respectively (note 4). interest expense decreased $65 million primarily due to a reduction in outstanding debt and effective interest rates. in 2015, other items, net includes losses of $12 million on the early extinguishment of debt and costs of $7.5 million associated with entering into interest rate swap arrangements. in 2014, other items, net includes net gains of $9 million on the sale of investments.
provision for income taxes the company recorded a benefit from income taxes in 2015. in 2015, the company implemented tax planning initiatives related to non-u.s. subsidiaries. these non-u.s. subsidiaries incurred foreign tax obligations, and made cash and deemed distributions to the company's u.s. operations which resulted in no net tax cost. as a result of these distributions, the company benefitted from u.s. foreign tax credits of $111 million, offset in part by additional u.s. taxes of $46 million on the related foreign income (which reduced the benefit from the foreign rate differential in 2015) for a net benefit of $66 million. the foreign tax credits are the result of foreign earnings remitted or deemed remitted to the u.s. during the reporting year and the u.s. treatment of taxes paid in the foreign jurisdictions in the years those profits were originally earned. the company also implemented foreign tax credit planning in sweden which resulted in $80 million of foreign tax credits, with no related incremental u.s. income tax expense. in addition, the company recorded discrete benefits totaling $54 million related to additional prior year foreign tax and other credits as well as restructuring and other costs associated with the 2014 acquisition of life technologies. the tax provision in the 2015 period was favorably affected by $37 million as a result of adjustments to deferred tax balances due to changes in tax rates.
the company's effective tax rate was 9.2% in 2014. the 2014 provision for income taxes included $390 million related to gains on the sales of businesses. aside from the discrete tax on the gains, the company had a benefit from income taxes primarily due to restructuring and other costs associated with the acquisition of life technologies as well as an increase in the expected benefit from foreign tax credits. in 2014, the company implemented tax planning initiatives related to non-u.s. subsidiaries. these non-u.s. subsidiaries incurred foreign tax obligations, and made cash and deemed distributions to the company's u.s. operations which resulted in no net tax cost. as a result of these distributions, the company benefitted from u.s. foreign tax credits of $172 million, offset in part by additional u.s. taxes of $55 million on the related foreign income (which reduced the benefit from the foreign rate differential in 2014) for a net benefit of $117 million. the foreign tax credits are the result of foreign earnings remitted or deemed remitted to the u.s. during the reporting year and the u.s. treatment of taxes paid in the foreign jurisdictions in the years those profits were originally earned. the federal tax credit for 2014 research and development activities favorably affected the tax provision in 2014 by $20 million. in 2014, the company recognized a discrete tax benefit of $15 million attributable to tax rulings related to non-u.s. subsidiaries. the tax provision in the 2014 period was favorably affected by $5.5 million as a result of adjustments to deferred tax balances due to changes in tax rates. the effective tax rate in both 2015 and 2014 was also affected by relatively significant earnings in lower tax jurisdictions. due primarily to the non-deductibility of intangible asset amortization for tax purposes, the company's cash payments for income taxes were higher than its income tax expense for financial reporting purposes and totaled $477 million and $586 million in 2015 and 2014, respectively.
management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources consolidated working capital was $2.16 billion at december 31, 2016, compared with $1.59 billion at december 31, 2015. included in working capital were cash and cash equivalents of $786 million at december 31, 2016 and $452 million at december 31, 2015.
cash provided by operating activities was $3.16 billion during 2016. an increase in accounts receivable used cash of $352 million primarily to support growth in sales in local currencies and due to the mid-month timing of the acquisition of fei when receivables are commonly lower than at quarter-end. inventories provided cash of $98 million due to a reduction associated with fourth quarter 2016 sales. an increase in other assets used cash of $153 million primarily due to the timing of payments. an increase in other liabilities provided cash of $168 million primarily due to the timing of payments for income taxes and incentive compensation. cash payments for income taxes increased to $663 million during 2016, compared with $477 million in 2015. the company made cash contributions to its pension and postretirement benefit plans totaling $43 million during 2016. payments for restructuring actions, principally severance costs and lease and other expenses of real estate consolidation, used cash of $122 million during 2016.
during 2016, the company's investing activities used $5.53 billion of cash. acquisitions used cash of $5.19 billion. the company's investing activities also included the purchase of $444 million of property, plant and equipment. in february 2017, the company completed an acquisition for approximately $225 million in cash (note 16).
the company's financing activities provided $2.86 billion of cash during 2016. issuance of senior notes and borrowings under term loans provided cash of $7.60 billion and an increase in commercial paper obligations provided cash of $904 million. repayment of senior notes, the 364-day term loan and acquired debt used cash of $4.33 billion. the company's financing activities also included the repurchase of $1.25 billion of the company's common stock and the payment of $238 million in cash dividends, offset in part by $135 million of proceeds from employee stock option exercises. on july 7, 2016, the board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to $1.50 billion of the company's common stock. at december 31, 2016, $1.25 billion was available for future repurchases of the company's common stock under this authorization. early in the first quarter of 2017, the company repurchased $500 million of the company's common stock which reduced the availability under this authorization to $750 million as of february 28, 2017.
as of december 31, 2016, the company's short-term debt totaled $1.26 billion, including $300 million due within the next twelve months under a 3-year term loan agreement and $953 million of commercial paper obligations. the company has a revolving credit facility with a bank group that provides up to $2.50 billion of unsecured multi-currency revolving credit. if the company borrows under this facility, it intends to leave undrawn an amount equivalent to outstanding commercial paper to provide a source of funds in the event that commercial paper markets are not available. as of december 31, 2016, no borrowings were outstanding under the company's revolving credit facility, although available capacity was reduced by approximately $72 million as a result of outstanding letters of credit.
approximately half of the company's cash balances and cash flows from operations are from outside the u.s. the company uses its non-u.s. cash for needs outside of the u.s. including acquisitions and repayment of acquisition-related intercompany debt to the u.s. in addition, the company also transfers cash to the u.s. using non-taxable returns of capital as well as dividends where the related u.s. foreign tax credit equals or exceeds any tax cost arising from the dividends. as a result of using such means of transferring cash to the u.s., the company does not expect any material adverse liquidity effects from its significant non-u.s. cash balances for the foreseeable future.
the company believes that its existing cash and cash equivalents of $786 million as of december 31, 2016 and its future cash flow from operations together with available borrowing capacity under its revolving credit agreement will be sufficient to meet the cash requirements of its existing businesses for the foreseeable future, including at least the next 24 months.
cash provided by operating activities was $2.82 billion during 2015. increases in accounts receivable and inventories used cash of $149 million and $141 million, respectively, primarily to support growth in sales in local currencies. an increase in other assets used cash of $254 million primarily related to the timing of tax payments/refunds. an increase in other liabilities provided cash of $148 million primarily due to the timing of payments for income taxes and incentive compensation. cash payments for income taxes decreased to $477 million during 2015, compared with $586 million in 2014 that included taxes associated with gains on divestitures. the company made cash contributions to its pension and postretirement benefit plans

during 2015, the company's investing activities used $1.09 billion of cash. acquisitions used cash of $695 million. the company's investing activities also included the purchase of $423 million of property, plant and equipment.
the company's financing activities used $2.49 billion of cash during 2015. repayments of long-term debt totaled $3.78 billion. issuance of senior notes provided cash of $1.80 billion and an increase in commercial paper obligations provided cash of $50 million. the company's financing activities also included the repurchase of $500 million of the company's common stock and the payment of $241 million in cash dividends, offset in part by $124 million of proceeds from employee stock option exercises.
cash provided by operating activities was $2.62 billion during 2014 primarily from the company's earnings. increases in accounts receivable and inventories used cash of $145 million and $110 million, respectively, primarily to support growth in sales. other assets decreased by $163 million primarily due to collection of tax refunds including those related to legacy life technologies' operations. other liabilities increased by $308 million primarily due to the timing of payments for incentive compensation and income taxes. in 2014, the company made cash payments including monetizing certain equity awards, severance obligations and transaction costs totaling $325 million related to the acquisition of life technologies. the company made cash contributions to its pension and postretirement benefit plans totaling $50 million during 2014. cash payments for income taxes totaled $586 million.

(b)   unconditional purchase obligations include agreements to purchase goods, services or fixed assets that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed, minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. purchase obligations exclude agreements that are cancelable at any time without penalty.
reserves for unrecognized tax benefits of $802 million have not been included in the above table due to the inability to predict the timing of tax audit resolutions.
the company has no material commitments for purchases of property, plant and equipment, other than those included in the above table, but expects that for 2017, such expenditures will approximate $500 million.
guarantees of residual value under lease arrangements for three facilities have not been included in the above table due to the inability to predict if and when the guarantees may require payment (see note 10). the residual value guarantees become operative at the end of the leases for up to a maximum of $155 million. the initial terms of these leases end in 2019, 2020 and 2022, although renewal options exist for each.

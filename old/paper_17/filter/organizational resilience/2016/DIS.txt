item 1a. risk factors for an enterprise as large and complex as the company, a wide range of factors could materially affect future developments and performance. in addition to the factors affecting specific business operations identified in connection with the description of these operations and the financial results of these operations elsewhere in this report, the most significant factors affecting our operations include the following:
table of contents changes in u.s., global, or regional economic conditions could have an adverse effect on the profitability of some or all of our businesses.
a decline in economic activity in the u.s. and other regions of the world in which we do business can adversely affect demand for any of our businesses, thus reducing our revenue and earnings. past declines in economic conditions reduced spending at our parks and resorts, purchase of and prices for advertising on our broadcast and cable networks and owned stations, performance of our home entertainment releases, and purchases of company-branded consumer products, and similar impacts can be expected should such conditions recur. a decline in economic conditions could also reduce attendance at our parks and resorts, prices that mvpds pay for our cable programming or subscription levels for our cable programming. recent instability in non-u.s. economies has had some of these and similar impacts on some of our domestic and overseas operations. economic conditions can also impair the ability of those with whom we do business to satisfy their obligations to us. in addition, an increase in price levels generally, or in price levels in a particular sector such as the energy sector, could result in a shift in consumer demand away from the entertainment and consumer products we offer, which could also adversely affect our revenues and, at the same time, increase our costs. changes in exchange rates for foreign currencies may reduce international demand for our products or increase our labor or supply costs in non-u.s. markets, and recent changes have reduced the u.s. dollar value of revenue we receive and expect to receive from other markets. economic or political conditions in a country could also reduce our ability to hedge exposure to currency fluctuations in the country or our ability to repatriate revenue from the country.
changes in public and consumer tastes and preferences for entertainment and consumer products could reduce demand for our entertainment offerings and products and adversely affect the profitability of any of our businesses.
our businesses create entertainment, travel and consumer products whose success depends substantially on consumer tastes and preferences that change in often unpredictable ways. the success of our businesses depends on our ability to consistently create and distribute filmed entertainment, broadcast and cable programming, online material, electronic games, theme park attractions, hotels and other resort facilities and travel experiences and consumer products that meet the changing preferences of the broad consumer market and respond to competition from an expanding array of choices facilitated by technological developments in the delivery of content. many of our businesses increasingly depend on acceptance of our offerings and products by consumers outside the u.s., and their success therefore depends on our ability to successfully predict and adapt to changing consumer tastes and preferences outside as well as inside the u.s. moreover, we must often invest substantial amounts in film production, broadcast and cable programming, electronic games, theme park attractions, cruise ships or hotels and other resort facilities before we learn the extent to which these products will earn consumer acceptance. if our entertainment offerings and products do not achieve sufficient consumer acceptance, our revenue from advertising sales (which are based in part on ratings for the programs in which advertisements air) or subscription fees for broadcast and cable programming and online services, from theatrical film receipts or home entertainment or electronic game sales, from theme park admissions, hotel room charges and merchandise, food and beverage sales, from sales of licensed consumer products or from sales of our other consumer products and services may decline or fail to grow to the extent we anticipate when making investment decisions and thereby adversely affect the profitability of one or more of our businesses.
changes in technology and in consumer consumption patterns may affect demand for our entertainment products, the revenue we can generate from these products or the cost of producing or distributing products.
the media entertainment and internet businesses in which we participate increasingly depend on our ability to successfully adapt to shifting patterns of content consumption through the adoption and exploitation of new technologies. new technologies affect the demand for our products, the manner in which our products are distributed to consumers, the sources and nature of competing content offerings, the time and manner in which consumers acquire and view some of our entertainment products and the options available to advertisers for reaching their desired audiences. this trend has impacted the business model for certain traditional forms of distribution, as evidenced by the industry-wide decline in ratings for broadcast television, the reduction in demand for home entertainment sales of theatrical content, the development of alternative distribution channels for broadcast and cable programming and declines in subscriber levels across the industry, including for a number of our networks. in order to respond to these developments, we regularly consider and from time to time implement changes to our business models and there can be no assurance that we will successfully respond to these changes, that we will not experience disruption as we respond to the changes, or that the business models we develop will be as profitable as our current business models. as a result, the income from our entertainment offerings may decline or increase at slower rates than our historical experience or our expectations when we make investments in products.
table of contents the success of our businesses is highly dependent on the existence and maintenance of intellectual property rights in the entertainment products and services we create.
the value to us of our intellectual property rights is dependent on the scope and duration of our rights as defined by applicable laws in the u.s. and abroad and the manner in which those laws are construed. if those laws are drafted or interpreted in ways that limit the extent or duration of our rights, or if existing laws are changed, our ability to generate revenue from our intellectual property may decrease, or the cost of obtaining and maintaining rights may increase.
the unauthorized use of our intellectual property may increase the cost of protecting rights in our intellectual property or reduce our revenues. new technologies such as the convergence of computing, communication, and entertainment devices, the falling prices of devices incorporating such technologies, increased broadband internet speed and penetration and increased availability and speed of mobile data transmission have made the unauthorized digital copying and distribution of our films, television productions and other creative works easier and faster and enforcement of intellectual property rights more challenging. the unauthorized use of intellectual property in the entertainment industry generally continues to be a significant challenge for intellectual property rights holders. inadequate laws or weak enforcement mechanisms to protect intellectual property in one country can adversely affect the results of the company's operations worldwide, despite the company's efforts to protect its intellectual property rights. these developments require us to devote substantial resources to protecting our intellectual property against unlicensed use and present the risk of increased losses of revenue as a result of unlicensed distribution of our content.
with respect to intellectual property developed by the company and rights acquired by the company from others, the company is subject to the risk of challenges to our copyright, trademark and patent rights by third parties. successful challenges to our rights in intellectual property may result in increased costs for obtaining rights or the loss of the opportunity to earn revenue from the intellectual property that is the subject of challenged rights.
protection of electronically stored data is costly and if our data is compromised in spite of this protection, we may incur additional costs, lost opportunities and damage to our reputation.
we maintain information necessary to conduct our business, including confidential and proprietary information as well as personal information regarding our customers and employees, in digital form. data maintained in digital form is subject to the risk of intrusion, tampering and theft. we develop and maintain systems in an effort to prevent intrusion, tampering and theft, but the development and maintenance of these systems is costly and requires ongoing monitoring and updating as technologies change and efforts to overcome security measures become more sophisticated. accordingly, despite our efforts, the possibility of intrusion, tampering and theft cannot be eliminated entirely, and risks associated with each of these remain. in addition, we provide confidential, proprietary and personal information to third parties when it is necessary to pursue business objectives. while we obtain assurances that these third parties will protect this information and, where we believe appropriate, monitor the protections employed by these third parties, there is a risk the confidentiality of data held by third parties may be compromised. if our data systems are compromised, our ability to conduct our business may be impaired, we may lose profitable opportunities or the value of those opportunities may be diminished and, as described above, we may lose revenue as a result of unlicensed use of our intellectual property. if personal information of our customers or employees is misappropriated, our reputation with our customers and employees may be injured resulting in loss of business or morale, and we may incur costs to remediate possible injury to our customers and employees or to pay fines or take other action with respect to judicial or regulatory actions arising out of the incident.
a variety of uncontrollable events may reduce demand for our products and services, impair our ability to provide our products and services or increase the cost of providing our products and services.
demand for our products and services, particularly our theme parks and resorts, is highly dependent on the general environment for travel and tourism. the environment for travel and tourism, as well as demand for other entertainment products, can be significantly adversely affected in the u.s., globally or in specific regions as a result of a variety of factors beyond our control, including: adverse weather conditions arising from short-term weather patterns or long-term change, catastrophic events or natural disasters (such as excessive heat or rain, hurricanes, typhoons, floods, tsunamis and earthquakes); health concerns; international, political or military developments; and terrorist attacks. these events and others, such as fluctuations in travel and energy costs and computer virus attacks, intrusions or other widespread computing or telecommunications failures, may also damage our ability to provide our products and services or to obtain insurance coverage with respect to these events. in addition, we derive royalties from the sales of our licensed goods and services by third parties and the management of businesses operated under brands licensed from the company, and we are therefore dependent on the successes of those third parties for that portion of our revenue. a wide variety of factors could influence the success of those third parties and if negative factors significantly impacted a sufficient number of our licensees, the profitability of one or more of our businesses could be adversely affected. we obtain insurance against the risk of losses relating to some of these events,
table of contents generally including physical damage to our property and resulting business interruption, certain injuries occurring on our property and some liabilities for alleged breach of legal responsibilities. when insurance is obtained it is subject to deductibles, exclusions, terms, conditions and limits of liability. the types and levels of coverage we obtain vary from time to time depending on our view of the likelihood of specific types and levels of loss in relation to the cost of obtaining coverage for such types and levels of loss.
changes in our business strategy or restructuring of our businesses may increase our costs or otherwise affect the profitability of our businesses.
as changes in our business environment occur we may adjust our business strategies to meet these changes or we may otherwise decide to restructure our operations or particular businesses or assets. in addition, external events including changing technology, changing consumer patterns, acceptance of our theatrical offerings and changes in macroeconomic conditions may impair the value of our assets. when these changes or events occur, we may incur costs to change our business strategy and may need to write down the value of assets. we also make investments in existing or new businesses, including investments in international expansion of our business and in new business lines. in recent years, such investments have included expansion and renovation of certain of our theme park attractions and investment in shanghai disney resort. some of these investments may have short-term returns that are negative or low and the ultimate business prospects of the businesses may be uncertain. in any of these events, our costs may increase, we may have significant charges associated with the write-down of assets or returns on new investments may be lower than prior to the change in strategy or restructuring.
turmoil in the financial markets could increase our cost of borrowing and impede access to or increase the cost of financing our operations and investments.
past disruptions in the u.s. and global credit and equity markets made it difficult for many businesses to obtain financing on acceptable terms. these conditions tended to increase the cost of borrowing and if they recur, our cost of borrowing could increase and it may be more difficult to obtain financing for our operations or investments. in addition, our borrowing costs can be affected by short- and long-term debt ratings assigned by independent rating agencies that are based, in part, on the company's performance as measured by credit metrics such as interest coverage and leverage ratios. a decrease in these ratings would likely increase our cost of borrowing and/or make it more difficult for us to obtain financing. past disruptions in the global financial markets also impacted some of the financial institutions with which we do business. a similar decline in the financial stability of financial institutions could affect our ability to secure credit-worthy counterparties for our interest rate and foreign currency hedging programs, could affect our ability to settle existing contracts and could also affect the ability of our business customers to obtain financing and thereby to satisfy their obligations to us.
increased competitive pressures may reduce our revenues or increase our costs.
we face substantial competition in each of our businesses from alternative providers of the products and services we offer and from other forms of entertainment, lodging, tourism and recreational activities. we also must compete to obtain human resources, programming and other resources we require in operating our business. for example:
•   our broadcast and cable networks, stations and online offerings compete for viewers with other broadcast, cable and satellite services as well as with home entertainment products, new sources of broadband and mobile delivered content and internet usage.
•   our broadcast and cable networks and stations compete for the sale of advertising time with other broadcast, cable and satellite services, and internet and mobile delivered content, as well as with newspapers, magazines, billboards and radio stations.
•   our cable networks compete for carriage of their programming with other programming providers.
•   our studio operations, broadcast and cable networks compete to obtain creative and performing talent, sports and other programming, story properties, advertiser support and market share with other studio operations, broadcast and cable networks and new sources of broadband delivered content.
•   our theme parks and resorts compete for guests with all other forms of entertainment, lodging, tourism and recreation activities.
•   our studio operations compete for customers with all other forms of entertainment.
•   our consumer products &amp; interactive media segment competes with other licensors, publishers and retailers of character, brand and celebrity names.
•   our interactive media operations compete with other licensors and publishers of console, online and mobile games and other types of home entertainment.
table of contents competition in each of these areas may increase as a result of technological developments and changes in market structure, including consolidation of suppliers of resources and distribution channels. increased competition may divert consumers from our creative or other products, or to other products or other forms of entertainment, which could reduce our revenue or increase our marketing costs. such competition may also reduce, or limit growth in, prices for our products and services, including advertising rates and subscription fees at our media networks, parks and resorts admissions and room rates, and prices for consumer products from which we derive license revenues. competition for the acquisition of resources can increase the cost of producing our products and services.
sustained increases in costs of pension and postretirement medical and other employee health and welfare benefits may reduce our profitability.
with approximately 195,000 employees, our profitability is substantially affected by costs of pension benefits and current and postretirement medical benefits. we may experience significant increases in these costs as a result of macro-economic factors, which are beyond our control, including increases in the cost of health care. in addition, changes in investment returns and discount rates used to calculate pension expense and related assets and liabilities can be volatile and may have an unfavorable impact on our costs in some years. these macroeconomic factors as well as a decline in the fair value of pension and postretirement medical plan assets may put upward pressure on the cost of providing pension and postretirement medical benefits and may increase future funding requirements. although we have actively sought to control increases in these costs, there can be no assurance that we will succeed in limiting cost increases, and continued upward pressure could reduce the profitability of our businesses.
we enter into long-term contracts for both the acquisition and the distribution of media programming and products, including contracts for the acquisition of programming rights for sporting events and other programs, and contracts for the distribution of our programming to content distributors. as these contracts expire, we must renew or renegotiate the contracts, and if we are unable to renew them on acceptable terms, we may lose programming rights or distribution rights. even if these contracts are renewed, the cost of obtaining programming rights may increase (or increase at faster rates than our historical experience) or programming distributors, facing pressures resulting from increased subscription fees and alternative distribution challenges, may demand terms (including pricing and the breadth of distribution) that reduce our revenue from distribution of programs (or increase revenue at slower rates than our historical experience). moreover, our ability to renew these contracts on favorable terms may be affected by recent consolidation in the market for program distribution. with respect to the acquisition of programming rights, particularly sports programming rights, the impact of these long-term contracts on our results over the term of the contracts depends on a number of factors, including the strength of advertising markets, subscription levels and rates for programming, effectiveness of marketing efforts and the size of viewer audiences. there can be no assurance that revenues from programming based on these rights will exceed the cost of the rights plus the other costs of producing and distributing the programming.
changes in regulations applicable to our businesses may impair the profitability of our businesses.
our broadcast networks and television stations are highly regulated, and each of our other businesses is subject to a variety of u.s. and overseas regulations. these regulations include:
•   u.s. fcc regulation of our television and radio networks, our national programming networks, and our owned television stations. see item 1 - business - media networks, federal regulation.
•   regulation of the safety of consumer products and theme park operations.
•   environmental protection regulations.
•   imposition by foreign countries of trade restrictions, restrictions on the manner in which content is currently licensed and distributed, ownership restrictions, currency exchange controls or motion picture or television content requirements or quotas.
changes in any of these regulations or regulatory activities in any of these areas may require us to spend additional amounts to comply with the regulations, or may restrict our ability to offer products and services in ways that are profitable.
table of contents our operations outside the united states may be adversely affected by the operation of laws in those jurisdictions.
our operations in non-u.s. jurisdictions are in many cases subject to the laws of the jurisdictions in which they operate rather than u.s. law. laws in some jurisdictions differ in significant respects from those in the u.s. these differences can affect our ability to react to changes in our business, and our rights or ability to enforce rights may be different than would be expected under u.s. law. moreover, enforcement of laws in some overseas jurisdictions can be inconsistent and unpredictable, which can affect both our ability to enforce our rights and to undertake activities that we believe are beneficial to our business. in addition, the business and political climate in some jurisdictions may encourage corruption, which could reduce our ability to compete successfully in those jurisdictions while remaining in compliance with local laws or united states anti-corruption laws applicable to our businesses. as a result, our ability to generate revenue and our expenses in non-u.s. jurisdictions may differ from what would be expected if u.s. law governed these operations.
labor disputes may disrupt our operations and adversely affect the profitability of any of our businesses.
a significant number of employees in various of our businesses are covered by collective bargaining agreements, including employees of our theme parks and resorts as well as writers, directors, actors, production personnel and others employed in our media networks and studio operations. in addition, the employees of licensees who manufacture and retailers who sell our consumer products, and employees of providers of programming content (such as sports leagues) may be covered by labor agreements with their employers. in general, a labor dispute involving our employees or the employees of our licensees or retailers who sell our consumer products or providers of programming content may disrupt our operations and reduce our revenues, and resolution of disputes may increase our costs.
the seasonality of certain of our businesses could exacerbate negative impacts on our operations.
each of our businesses is normally subject to seasonal variations, as follows:
•   revenues in our media networks segment are subject to seasonal advertising patterns and changes in viewership levels. in general, advertising revenues are somewhat higher during the fall and somewhat lower during the summer months. affiliate fees are typically collected ratably throughout the year.
•   revenues in our parks and resorts segment fluctuate with changes in theme park attendance and resort occupancy resulting from the seasonal nature of vacation travel and leisure activities. peak attendance and resort occupancy generally occur during the summer months when school vacations occur and during early-winter and spring-holiday periods.
•   revenues in our studio entertainment segment fluctuate due to the timing and performance of releases in the theatrical, home entertainment and television markets. release dates are determined by several factors, including competition and the timing of vacation and holiday periods.
•   revenues in our consumer products &amp; interactive media segments are influenced by seasonal consumer purchasing behavior, which generally results in higher revenues during the company's first fiscal quarter, and by the timing and performance of theatrical and game releases and cable programming broadcasts.
accordingly, if a short-term negative impact on our business occurs during a time of high seasonal demand (such as hurricane damage to our parks during the summer travel season), the effect could have a disproportionate effect on the results of that business for the year.

table of contents organization of information management's discussion and analysis provides a narrative on the company's financial performance and condition that should be read in conjunction with the accompanying financial statements. it includes the following sections:
•   business segment results - 2016 vs. 2015
•   business segment results - 2015 vs. 2014
•   pension and postretirement medical benefit costs
•   liquidity and capital resources
•   contractual obligations, commitments and off balance sheet arrangements
revenues for fiscal 2016 increased 6%, or $3.2 billion, to $55.6 billion; net income attributable to disney increased 12%, or $1.0 billion, to $9.4 billion; and diluted earnings per share attributable to disney (eps) for the year increased 17%, or $0.83 to $5.73. the eps increase in fiscal 2016 was due to segment operating income growth driven by studio entertainment, parks and resorts and consumer products & interactive media, a decrease in weighted average shares outstanding as a result of our share repurchase program, a decrease in our effective income tax rate, which reflected a deferred tax asset write-off in the prior year, and the benefit of the vice gain (see note 3 to the consolidated financial statements). these increases were partially offset by higher net interest expense, the infinity charge (see note 1 to the consolidated financial statements) and higher restructuring and impairment charges in the current year. segment operating results benefited from growth in services, partially offset by the impact of foreign currency translation due to the movement of the u.s. dollar against major currencies including the impact of our hedging program (fx impact).
fiscal 2016 included fifty-two weeks of operations, while fiscal 2015 results included the benefit from a fifty-third week of operations (fiscal period impact) due to the timing of our fiscal period end. the estimated eps impact of the additional week of operations in the prior year was approximately $0.13 and the majority of the impact was at our cable networks business, followed by our parks and resorts and, to a lesser extent, consumer products businesses.
revenues service revenues for fiscal 2016 increased 7%, or $3.2 billion, to $47.1 billion, due to higher theatrical distribution revenues. the increase in service revenue was also driven by higher merchandise and game licensing revenue, average guest spending and attendance growth at our domestic parks and resorts, higher affiliate fees, growth in tv/ subscription video on demand (svod), revenues from the opening of shanghai disney resort, growth in digital distribution of film content and higher advertising revenue. these increases were partially offset by lower attendance at disneyland paris. service revenue growth reflected an approximate 1 percentage point decrease due to an unfavorable fx impact.
product revenues for fiscal 2016 decreased 1%, or $69 million, to $8.5 billion, due to the discontinuation of the infinity business and lower retail store volumes, partially offset by higher average guest spending at our domestic parks and resorts, higher net effective pricing at home entertainment and revenues from the opening of shanghai disney resort. lower product revenue reflected an approximate 1 percentage point decline due to an unfavorable fx impact.
costs and expenses cost of services for fiscal 2016 increased 6%, or $1.5 billion, to $24.7 billion, due to higher film cost amortization and distribution expense, increased media programming and production costs, the impact of the opening of shanghai disney resort and cost inflation and higher infrastructure and labor costs at our domestic parks and resorts. these increases were partially offset by efficiency initiatives at our domestic parks and resorts. cost of services reflected an approximate 1 percentage point benefit due to a favorable fx impact.
table of contents cost of products for fiscal 2016 increased 3%, or $167 million, to $5.3 billion, due to the infinity charge, higher guest spending and cost inflation at our domestic parks and resorts and higher film cost amortization due to home entertainment revenue growth, partially offset by lower costs from the discontinuation of the infinity business.
selling, general, administrative and other costs for the fiscal year increased 3%, or $231 million, to $8.8 billion, driven by increased marketing costs at our studio entertainment segment, partially offset by lower marketing spend at our media networks segment. selling, general, administrative and other costs reflected an approximate 1 percentage point benefit due to a favorable fx impact.
depreciation and amortization costs increased 7%, or $173 million, to $2.5 billion due to the opening of shanghai disney resort and depreciation of new attractions at our domestic parks and resorts.
restructuring and impairment charges the company recorded $156 million and $53 million of restructuring and impairment charges in fiscal years 2016 and 2015, respectively. charges in fiscal 2016 were due to asset impairments and severance and contract termination costs. charges in fiscal 2015 were primarily due to a contract termination and severance costs.

the increase in interest expense was due to higher average debt balances and an increase in our effective interest rate, partially offset by higher capitalized interest.
the decrease in interest and investment income was due to lower gains on sales of publicly traded investments.
equity in the income of investees equity in the income of investees increased 14% or $112 million, to $0.9 billion due to the $332 million vice gain (see note 3 to the consolidated financial statements). the benefit of the vice gain was partially offset by a higher loss at hulu and lower operating results at a+e. the increased equity loss at hulu was due to higher programming, marketing and labor costs, partially offset by growth in subscription and advertising revenues. the decrease at a+e was due to lower advertising revenue and the impact of the conversion of the h2 channel to viceland.

effective income tax rate   34.2   %      36.2   %   2.0                   ppt the decrease in the effective income tax rate was primarily due to a write-off of a $399 million deferred income tax asset in the prior year as a result of the increase in the company's ownership of euro disney s.c.a. in connection with the disneyland paris recapitalization (disneyland paris tax asset write-off) (see notes 6 and 9 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion). this decrease was partially offset by an increase in foreign losses for which we are not recognizing a tax benefit.
noncontrolling interests net income attributable to noncontrolling interests for the year decreased $71 million to $399 million due to higher pre-opening expenses at shanghai disney resort and a decrease related to disneyland paris, partially offset by higher results at espn. the decrease related to disneyland paris was driven by lower results, partially offset by the impact of an increase in the company's ownership interest.
table of contents net income attributable to noncontrolling interests is determined on income after royalties and management fees, financing costs and income taxes.
revenues for fiscal 2015 increased 7%, or $3.7 billion, to $52.5 billion; net income attributable to disney increased 12%, or $881 million, to $8.4 billion; and eps for the year increased 15%, or $0.64 to $4.90. the eps increase in fiscal 2015 reflected growth at all our operating segments and a decrease in the weighted average shares outstanding as a result of our share repurchase program, partially offset by the disneyland paris tax asset write-off and lower investment gains. results for fiscal 2015 also include the benefit of a favorable fiscal period impact.
revenues service revenues for fiscal 2015 increased 9%, or $3.7 billion, to $43.9 billion, primarily due to higher affiliate fees, volume growth and higher average guest spending at our domestic parks and resorts, higher svod sales of our television and film properties, an increase in merchandise licensing and advertising revenue growth. service revenue growth reflected an approximate 2 percentage point decrease due to an unfavorable fx impact.
product revenues for fiscal 2015 were comparable to fiscal 2014 as higher food, beverage and merchandise volumes and average guest spending at our domestic parks and resorts and increased revenues at our retail business were offset by lower worldwide home entertainment and console game volumes. product revenue growth reflected an approximate 2 percentage point decrease due to an unfavorable fx impact.
costs and expenses cost of services for fiscal 2015 increased 9%, or $1.8 billion, to $23.2 billion primarily due to higher sports programming costs and inflation and operations support cost growth at our domestic parks and resorts. cost of services reflected an approximate 1 percentage point benefit due to a favorable fx impact.
cost of products for fiscal 2015 increased 2%, or $109 million, to $5.2 billion, driven by volume growth at domestic parks and resorts and our retail business and inflation at our domestic parks and resorts. these increases were partially offset by lower home entertainment and console game unit sales. cost of products reflected an approximate 2 percentage point benefit due to a favorable fx impact.
selling, general, administrative and other costs in fiscal 2015 were comparable to fiscal 2014 as higher labor costs driven by the abc television network, espn and corporate and higher information technology costs at domestic parks and resorts were offset by lower marketing costs and a favorable fx impact. the decrease in marketing costs was due to lower spending for theatrical and home entertainment marketing, partially offset by increases at abc, espn and our merchandise licensing business.
depreciation and amortization costs increased 3%, or $66 million, to $2.4 billion, driven by new theme park attractions and, to a lesser extent, new broadcast facilities and equipment. depreciation and amortization costs reflected an approximate 2 percentage point benefit due to a favorable fx impact.
restructuring and impairment charges the company recorded $53 million and $140 million of restructuring and impairment charges in fiscal years 2015 and 2014, respectively. charges in fiscal 2015 were primarily due to a contract termination and severance. charges in fiscal 2014 were primarily due to severance costs across various of our segments and radio fcc license impairments, which were determined in connection with a plan to sell radio disney stations.

revenues parks and resorts revenues increased 7%, or $1.1 billion, to $16.2 billion due to an increase of $1.3 billion at our domestic operations, partially offset by a decrease of $219 million at our international operations.
revenue growth of 10% at our domestic operations reflected increases of 5% from higher volumes and 5% from higher average guest spending. higher volumes were due to attendance growth and higher occupied room nights. increased guest spending was primarily due to higher average ticket prices for admissions at our theme parks and for sailings at our cruise line, increased food, beverage and merchandise spending and higher average hotel room rates. revenues also benefited from a favorable fiscal period impact.
revenues at our international operations reflected an 11% decrease from foreign currency translation, partially offset by a 4% increase from higher average guest spending. guest spending growth was due to higher food, beverage and merchandise spending, an increase in average ticket prices and higher average hotel room rates. volumes at our international operations were essentially flat, as higher attendance and occupied room nights at disneyland paris were offset by lower attendance and occupied room nights at hong kong disneyland resort.
table of contents the following table presents supplemental attendance, per capita theme park guest spending and hotel statistics:
(1)   per room guest spending consists of the average daily hotel room rate as well as guest spending on food, beverage and merchandise at the hotels. hotel statistics include rentals of disney vacation club units.
(2)   per capita guest spending growth rate is stated on a constant currency basis. per room guest spending is stated at the fiscal 2014 average foreign currency exchange rate. the euro to u.s. dollar weighted average foreign currency exchange rate was $1.15 and $1.36 for fiscal years 2015 and 2014, respectively.
costs and expenses operating expenses include operating labor, which increased $347 million from $4,233 million to $4,580 million, cost of sales, which increased $80 million from $1,425 million to $1,505 million, and infrastructure costs, which increased $27 million from $1,854 million to $1,881 million. the increase in operating labor was due to inflation, higher employee benefit costs and increased labor hours. the increase in employee benefit costs included higher pension and postretirement medical costs. the increase in labor hours was driven by higher volumes and new guest offerings, such as the 60th anniversary celebration at disneyland resort. higher cost of sales was due to volume growth and inflation. infrastructure cost increases were driven by higher information technology expense and operations support costs, partially offset by costs incurred in fiscal 2014 in connection with the launch of mymagic+. other operating expenses, which include costs for such items as supplies, commissions and entertainment offerings, increased primarily due to inflation, higher operations support costs and pre-opening costs for shanghai disney resort. operating expenses reflected a 2% decrease from a favorable fx impact, partially offset by a 2% increase as a result of an unfavorable fiscal period impact, both of which had similar impacts on operating labor, cost of sales and infrastructure costs.
selling, general, administrative and other costs increased $28 million from $1,856 million to $1,884 million primarily due to information technology initiatives, partially offset by a favorable fx impact.
the increase in depreciation and amortization was driven by new attractions, partially offset by a favorable fx impact.
segment operating income segment operating income increased 14%, or $368 million, to $3.0 billion due to growth at our domestic operations, partially offset by a decrease at our international operations.

revenues the 5% decrease in theatrical distribution revenue was due to an unfavorable fx impact and the impact of having no dreamworks titles in fiscal 2015 compared to four in fiscal 2014. these decreases were partially offset by the performance of inside out and big hero 6 in fiscal 2015 compared to frozen and planes: fire and rescue in fiscal 2014, as well as one additional disney live-action release in fiscal 2015. significant disney live-action releases in fiscal 2015 included cinderella and into the woods, whereas fiscal 2014 included maleficent. the performance of avengers: age of ultron and ant-man in fiscal 2015 was comparable to the fiscal 2014 performance of guardians of the galaxy, captain america: the winter soldier and thor: the dark world.
the 14% decrease in home entertainment revenue was due to decreases of 9% from lower unit sales and 4% from lower average net effective pricing, both of which reflected the strong performance of frozen in fiscal 2014. net effective pricing is the wholesale selling price adjusted for discounts, sales incentives and returns.
the 18% increase in tv/svod distribution and other revenue was due to increases of 9% from higher revenue share with the consumer products & interactive media segment due to the success of merchandise based on frozen and 7% from tv/svod distribution. tv/svod distribution revenue growth was primarily due to worldwide pay television, which included the benefit of more titles available domestically and sales of star wars titles internationally, along with growth from international svod sales.
costs and expenses operating expenses include a decrease of $12 million in film cost amortization, from $1,802 million to $1,790 million, primarily due to decreased film cost impairments, partially offset by the impact of higher revenues and a higher average film cost amortization rate for theatrical releases in fiscal 2015 due to the success of frozen in fiscal 2014. operating expenses also include cost of goods sold and distribution costs, which decreased $75 million, from $1,335 million to $1,260 million due to lower home entertainment per unit costs and unit sales.
selling, general, administrative and other costs decreased $252 million from $2,456 million to $2,204 million due to lower theatrical and home entertainment marketing expense. lower theatrical marketing expense was primarily due to four dreamworks titles in release in fiscal 2014 compared to none in fiscal 2015 and a favorable fx impact. the decrease in home entertainment marketing expense was driven by spending on monsters university in fiscal 2014 compared to no pixar title in fiscal 2015.
segment operating income segment operating income increased $424 million to $2.0 billion due to higher revenue share with the consumer products & interactive media segment, increases in tv/svod and theatrical distribution and lower film cost impairments, partially offset by a decrease in home entertainment.

revenues the 7% increase in licensing, publishing and games revenues was due to a 9% increase from our merchandise licensing business, partially offset by a 2% decrease from our games business. higher merchandise licensing revenues were primarily due to the performance of merchandise based on frozen, avengers and star wars, partially offset by an unfavorable fx impact. the decrease in games revenue was due to lower sales of catalog titles, avengers alliance and infinity and a decrease in club penguin subscribers. these decreases were partially offset by the success of tsum tsum and star wars commander in fiscal 2015.
the 8% increase in retail and other revenue was driven by a 9% increase from our retail business due to comparable store and online sales growth, growth in our wholesale distribution business and a favorable fiscal period impact, partially offset by an unfavorable fx impact.
costs and expenses operating expenses include an increase of $52 million in cost of goods sold and distribution costs, from $1,395 million to $1,447 million, a $3 million increase in labor and occupancy costs, from $541 million to $544 million, and a $16 million decrease in product development expense, from $383 million to $367 million. the increase in cost of goods sold and distribution costs was due to higher sales at our retail business and higher per unit costs and cost mix of infinity products, partially offset by lower sales of catalog titles, a favorable fx impact and lower third-party royalty expense at our merchandise licensing business. the higher per unit costs for infinity included the impact of inventory obsolescence charges. product development expense decreased due to fewer titles in development.
selling, general, administrative and other costs decreased $66 million from $1,238 million to $1,172 million driven by lower marketing costs and a favorable fx impact. the decrease in marketing costs was primarily due to a decrease at our mobile phone business in japan and fewer game titles in release, partially offset by an increase at our merchandise licensing business.
segment operating income segment operating income increased 28% to $1,884 million due to an increase at our merchandise licensing business and, to a lesser extent, at our games and retail businesses.
other expense, net the company recorded a $16 million loss related to consumer products & interactive media in fiscal 2014 resulting from the foreign currency translation of net monetary assets denominated in venezuelan currency, which was reported in "other expense, net" in the consolidated statements of income.

pension and postretirement medical benefit costs pension and postretirement medical benefit plan costs affect results in all of our segments, with approximately 40% of these costs being borne by the parks and resorts segment. the company recognized pension and postretirement medical benefit plan expenses of $319 million, $457 million and $309 million for fiscal years 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. the decrease in fiscal 2016 was primarily due to a change in our approach to measuring service and interest costs (see note 10 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of plan assumptions). this change does not affect the measurement of our plan obligations nor the funded status of our plans.
in fiscal 2017, we expect pension and postretirement medical costs to increase by $68 million to $387 million due to the impact of a lower assumed discount rate, partially offset by higher estimated investment income, which is driven by higher plan assets in fiscal 2017.
in fiscal 2016, the underfunded status of our plans increased from $4.0 billion to $5.2 billion and the unrecognized expense increased from $3.9 billion ($2.5 billion after tax) to $5.8 billion ($3.6 billion after tax) due to a lower assumed discount rate. if discount rates do not increase and/or our future investment returns do not exceed our long-term expected returns, a significant portion of the unrecognized expense will be recognized as a net actuarial loss in our income statement over approximately the next 9 years. see note 10 to the consolidated financial statements for further details of the impacts of our pension and postretirement medical plans on our financial statements.
during fiscal 2016, the company contributed $900 million to its pension and postretirement medical plans. in the first quarter of fiscal 2017, we contributed $1.3 billion and do not expect to make any additional material contributions for the remainder of fiscal 2017. however, final minimum funding requirements for fiscal 2017 will be determined based on our january 1, 2017 funding actuarial valuation, which will be available in late fiscal 2017. see "item 1a - risk factors" for the impact of factors affecting pension and postretirement medical costs.

operating activities cash provided by operating activities for fiscal 2016 increased 21% or $2.3 billion to $13.2 billion compared to fiscal 2015. the increase in operating cash flow was due to higher operating cash receipts at studio entertainment, media networks and parks and resorts driven by revenue growth. these increases were partially offset by higher operating cash disbursements at studio entertainment and an increase in pension and postretirement medical plan contributions.
cash provided by operating activities for fiscal 2015 increased 12% or $1.1 billion to $10.9 billion compared to fiscal 2014 driven by higher operating cash flow at our media networks and studio entertainment segments, partially offset by an
table of contents increase in income taxes paid. higher operating cash flow at media networks was due to increased operating receipts driven by affiliate fee growth, partially offset by higher disbursements for operating expenses and sports programming costs. the increase in payments for sports programming costs was primarily due to college football, partially offset by the impact of a change in payment terms for certain sports rights in fiscal 2014. studio entertainment cash flow benefited from lower operating cash disbursements driven by lower theatrical and home entertainment marketing expense.

capital expenditures for the parks and resorts segment are principally for theme park and resort expansion, new attractions, cruise ships, capital improvements and systems infrastructure. the increase at our domestic parks and resorts in fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015 was due to spending on new attractions at walt disney world resort and disneyland resort, while the increase in fiscal 2015 compared to fiscal 2014 was driven by spending on new attractions at walt disney world resort. the decrease in capital expenditures at our international parks and resorts in fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015 was due to lower spending at shanghai disney resort, which opened in june 2016, partially offset by higher spending at hong kong disneyland resort, while the increase in fiscal 2015 compared to fiscal 2014 was due to higher spending for the shanghai disney resort.
capital expenditures at media networks primarily reflect investments in facilities and equipment for expanding and upgrading broadcast centers, production facilities and television station facilities.
capital expenditures at corporate primarily reflect investments in corporate facilities, information technology infrastructure and equipment.
table of contents the company currently expects its fiscal 2017 capital expenditures will be approximately $0.5 billion higher than fiscal 2016 capital expenditures of $4.8 billion due to increased investments at our domestic parks and resorts partially offset by decreased investments at our international parks and resorts.

financing activities cash used in financing activities was $7.0 billion in fiscal 2016 compared to $5.5 billion in fiscal 2015. the net use of cash in the current year was due to $7.5 billion of common stock repurchases and $2.3 billion in dividends, partially offset by net borrowings of $2.9 billion.
cash used in financing activities of $7.0 billion was $1.5 billion more than the cash used in fiscal 2015. the increase in cash used in financing activities was driven by:
•   higher common stock repurchases of $1.4 billion ($7.5 billion in the fiscal 2016 compared to $6.1 billion in fiscal 2015)
partially offset by decreases due to:
•   lower dividend payments of $0.8 billion as a result of moving from an annual dividend to a semi-annual dividend. in fiscal 2015, we paid our full year fiscal year 2014 dividend and the first half of the fiscal 2015 dividend. in the current year, we paid the dividend for the second half of fiscal 2015 and the first half of fiscal 2016.
•   higher net borrowings of $0.2 billion ($2.9 billion in fiscal 2016 compared to $2.7 billion in fiscal 2015)
cash used in financing activities was $5.5 billion in fiscal 2015 compared to $6.7 billion in fiscal 2014. the net use of cash in fiscal 2015 was due to $6.1 billion of common stock repurchases and $3.1 billion in dividends, partially offset by net borrowings of $2.7 billion and contributions from noncontrolling interest holders of $1.0 billion.
cash used in financing activities of $5.5 billion in fiscal 2015 was $1.2 billion lower than cash used in fiscal 2014. the decrease in cash used in financing activities was driven by:
•   higher net borrowings of $2.1 billion ($2.7 billion in fiscal 2015 compared to $0.6 billion in fiscal 2014)
partially offset by an increase in dividend payments of $1.6 billion as a result of moving from an annual dividend to a semi-annual dividend and an increase in the per share dividend related to fiscal 2014.
table of contents during the year ended october 1, 2016, the company's borrowing activity was as follows:
(1)   borrowings and reductions of borrowings are reported net.
(2)   the other activity is primarily the conversion of hong kong disneyland resort debt into equity and the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates. see note 6 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of this transaction.
(3)   the other activity is primarily market value adjustments for debt with qualifying hedges.
see note 8 to the consolidated financial statements for information regarding the company's bank facilities. the company may use commercial paper borrowings up to the amount of its unused bank facilities, in conjunction with term debt issuance and operating cash flow, to retire or refinance other borrowings before or as they come due.
see note 11 to the consolidated financial statements for a summary of the company's dividends and share repurchases in fiscal 2016, 2015 and 2014.
we believe that the company's financial condition is strong and that its cash balances, other liquid assets, operating cash flows, access to debt and equity capital markets and borrowing capacity, taken together, provide adequate resources to fund ongoing operating requirements and future capital expenditures related to the expansion of existing businesses and development of new projects. however, the company's operating cash flow and access to the capital markets can be impacted by macroeconomic factors outside of its control. see "item 1a - risk factors". in addition to macroeconomic factors, the company's borrowing costs can be impacted by short- and long-term debt ratings assigned by independent rating agencies, which are based, in significant part, on the company's performance as measured by certain credit metrics such as interest coverage and leverage ratios. as of october 1, 2016, moody's investors service's long- and short-term debt ratings for the company were a2 and p-1, respectively, with stable outlook; standard & poor's long- and short-term debt ratings for the company were a and a-1, respectively, with stable outlook; and fitch's long- and short-term debt ratings for the company were a and f-1, respectively, with stable outlook. the company's bank facilities contain only one financial covenant, relating to interest coverage, which the company met on october 1, 2016, by a significant margin. the company's bank facilities also specifically exclude certain entities, including the international theme parks, from any representations, covenants or events of default.
contractual obligations, commitments and off balance sheet arrangements the company has various contractual obligations, which are recorded as liabilities in our consolidated financial statements. other items, such as certain purchase commitments and other executory contracts are not recognized as liabilities in our consolidated financial statements but are required to be disclosed in the footnotes to the financial statements. for example, the company is contractually committed to acquire broadcast programming and make certain minimum lease payments for the use of property under operating lease agreements.
table of contents the following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations and commitments on an undiscounted basis at october 1, 2016 and the future periods in which such obligations are expected to be settled in cash. in addition, the table reflects the timing of principal and interest payments on outstanding borrowings based on their contractual maturities. additional details regarding these obligations are provided in the notes to the consolidated financial statements, as referenced in the table:
operating lease commitments (note 14)                              3,106                     477                     705                  505                    1,419

(1)   amounts exclude market value adjustments totaling $146 million, which are recorded in the balance sheet. amounts include interest payments based on contractual terms for fixed rate debt and on current interest rates for variable rate debt. in 2023, the company has the ability to call a debt instrument prior to its scheduled maturity, which if exercised by the company would reduce future interest payments by $1.1 billion.
(2)   other commitments primarily comprise contractual commitments for the construction of two new cruise ships, creative talent and employment agreements and unrecognized tax benefits. creative talent and employment agreements include obligations to actors, producers, sports, television and radio personalities and executives.
the company also has obligations with respect to its pension and postretirement medical benefit plans. see note 10 to the consolidated financial statements.
contingent commitments and contractual guarantees see notes 3, 6 and 14 to the consolidated financial statements for information regarding the company's contingent commitments and contractual guarantees.
legal and tax matters as disclosed in notes 9 and 14 to the consolidated financial statements, the company has exposure for certain tax and legal matters.
critical accounting policies and estimates we believe that the application of the following accounting policies, which are important to our financial position and results of operations require significant judgments and estimates on the part of management. for a summary of our significant accounting policies, including the accounting policies discussed below, see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements.
film and television revenues and costs we expense film and television production, participation and residual costs over the applicable product life cycle based upon the ratio of the current period's revenues to the estimated remaining total revenues (ultimate revenues) for each production. if our estimate of ultimate revenues decreases, amortization of film and television costs may be accelerated. conversely, if our estimate of ultimate revenues increases, film and television cost amortization may be slowed. for film productions, ultimate revenues include revenues from all sources that will be earned within ten years from the date of the initial theatrical release.
table of contents for television series, ultimate revenues include revenues that will be earned within ten years from delivery of the first episode, or if still in production, five years from delivery of the most recent episode, if later.
with respect to films intended for theatrical release, the most sensitive factor affecting our estimate of ultimate revenues (and therefore affecting future film cost amortization and/or impairment) is theatrical performance. revenues derived from other markets subsequent to the theatrical release (e.g., the home entertainment or television markets) have historically been highly correlated with the theatrical performance. theatrical performance varies primarily based upon the public interest and demand for a particular film, the popularity of competing films at the time of release and the level of marketing effort. upon a film's release and determination of the theatrical performance, the company's estimates of revenues from succeeding windows and markets are revised based on historical relationships and an analysis of current market trends. the most sensitive factor affecting our estimate of ultimate revenues for released films is the level of expected home entertainment sales. home entertainment sales vary based on the number and quality of competing home entertainment products, as well as the manner in which retailers market and price our products.
with respect to television series or other television productions intended for broadcast, the most sensitive factors affecting estimates of ultimate revenues are program ratings and the strength of the advertising market. program ratings, which are an indication of market acceptance, directly affect the company's ability to generate advertising revenues during the airing of the program. in addition, television series with greater market acceptance are more likely to generate incremental revenues through the licensing of program rights worldwide to television distributors, svod services and in home entertainment formats. alternatively, poor ratings may result in cancellation of the program, which would require an immediate write-down of any unamortized production costs. a significant decline in the advertising market would also negatively impact our estimates.
we expense the cost of television broadcast rights for acquired series, movies and other programs based on the number of times the program is expected to be aired or on a straight-line basis over the useful life, as appropriate. amortization of those television programming assets being amortized on a number of airings basis may be accelerated if we reduce the estimated future airings and slowed if we increase the estimated future airings. the number of future airings of a particular program is impacted primarily by the program's ratings in previous airings, expected advertising rates and availability and quality of alternative programming. accordingly, planned usage is reviewed periodically and revised if necessary. we amortize rights costs for multi-year sports programming arrangements during the applicable seasons based on the estimated relative value of each year in the arrangement. the estimated value of each year is based on our projections of revenues over the contract period, which include advertising revenue and an allocation of affiliate revenue. if the annual contractual payments related to each season approximate each season's estimated relative value, we expense the related contractual payments during the applicable season. if planned usage patterns or estimated relative values by year were to change significantly, amortization of our sports rights costs may be accelerated or slowed.
costs of film and television productions are subject to regular recoverability assessments, which compare the estimated fair values with the unamortized costs. the net realizable values of television broadcast program licenses and rights are reviewed using a daypart methodology. a daypart is defined as an aggregation of programs broadcast during a particular time of day or programs of a similar type. the company's dayparts are: primetime, daytime, late night, news and sports (includes broadcast and cable networks). the net realizable values of other cable programming assets are reviewed on an aggregated basis for each cable network. individual programs are written off when there are no plans to air or sublicense the program. estimated values are based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions. if actual demand or market conditions are less favorable than our projections, film, television and programming cost write-downs may be required.
revenue recognition the company has revenue recognition policies for its various operating segments that are appropriate to the circumstances of each business. see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for a summary of these revenue recognition policies.
we reduce home entertainment and game revenues for estimated future returns of merchandise and for customer programs and sales incentives. these estimates are based upon historical return experience, current economic trends and projections of customer demand for and acceptance of our products. if we underestimate the level of returns or sales incentives in a particular period, we may record less revenue in later periods when returns or sales incentives exceed the estimated amount. conversely, if we overestimate the level of returns or sales incentives for a period, we may have additional revenue in later periods when returns or sales incentives are less than estimated.
table of contents usage patterns. if actual usage is different than our estimated usage, revenues may not be recognized in the periods the related services are rendered. in addition, a change in usage patterns would impact the timing of revenue recognition.
pension and postretirement medical plan actuarial assumptions the company's pension and postretirement medical benefit obligations and related costs are calculated using a number of actuarial assumptions. two critical assumptions, the discount rate and the expected return on plan assets, are important elements of expense and/or liability measurement, which we evaluate annually. other assumptions include the healthcare cost trend rate and employee demographic factors such as retirement patterns, mortality, turnover and rate of compensation increase.
the discount rate enables us to state expected future cash payments for benefits as a present value on the measurement date. a lower discount rate increases the present value of benefit obligations and increases pension expense. the guideline for setting this rate is a high-quality long-term corporate bond rate. we decreased our discount rate to 3.73% at the end of fiscal 2016 from 4.47% at the end of fiscal 2015 to reflect market interest rate conditions at our fiscal 2016 year end measurement date. the company's discount rate was determined by considering yield curves constructed of a large population of high-quality corporate bonds and reflects the matching of plans' liability cash flows to the yield curves. a one percentage point decrease in the assumed discount rate would increase total benefit expense for fiscal 2017 by approximately $271 million and would increase the projected benefit obligation at october 1, 2016 by approximately $2.9 billion. a one percentage point increase in the assumed discount rate would decrease total benefit expense and the projected benefit obligation by approximately $235 million and $2.4 billion, respectively.
to determine the expected long-term rate of return on the plan assets, we consider the current and expected asset allocation as well as historical and expected returns on each plan asset class. our expected return on plan assets is 7.50%. a lower expected rate of return on pension plan assets will increase pension expense. a one percentage point change in the long-term asset return assumption would impact fiscal 2017 annual benefit expense by approximately $123 million.
for fiscal 2016, we changed the approach we used to determine the service and interest cost components of pension and other postretirement benefit expense. see note 10 to the consolidated financial statements for more information on our pension and postretirement medical plans.
goodwill, other intangible assets, long-lived assets and investments the company is required to test goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment on an annual basis and if current events or circumstances require, on an interim basis. goodwill is allocated to various reporting units, which are generally an operating segment or one level below the operating segment. the company compares the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying amount to determine if there is a potential goodwill impairment. if the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value, an impairment loss is recorded to the extent that the fair value of the goodwill within the reporting unit is less than the carrying value of the goodwill.
to determine the fair value of our reporting units, we generally use a present value technique (discounted cash flows) corroborated by market multiples when available and as appropriate. we apply what we believe to be the most appropriate valuation methodology for each of our reporting units. the discounted cash flow analyses are sensitive to our estimates of future revenue growth and margins for these businesses. we include in the projected cash flows an estimate of the revenue we believe the reporting unit would receive if the intellectual property developed by the reporting unit that is being used by other reporting units was licensed to an unrelated third party at its fair market value. these amounts are not necessarily the same as those included in segment operating results. we believe our estimates of fair value are consistent with how a marketplace participant would value our reporting units.
in times of adverse economic conditions in the global economy, the company's long-term cash flow projections are subject to a greater degree of uncertainty than usual. if we had established different reporting units or utilized different valuation methodologies or assumptions, the impairment test results could differ, and we could be required to record impairment charges.
the company is required to compare the fair values of other indefinite-lived intangible assets to their carrying amounts. if the carrying amount of an indefinite-lived intangible asset exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss is recognized for the excess. fair values of other indefinite-lived intangible assets are determined based on discounted cash flows or appraised values, as appropriate.
the company tests long-lived assets, including amortizable intangible assets, for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances (triggering events) indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. once a triggering event has occurred, the impairment test employed is based on whether the intent is to hold the asset for continued use or to hold the asset for sale. the impairment test for assets held for use requires a comparison of cash flows expected to be generated over the useful life of an asset group to the carrying value of the asset group. an asset group is established by identifying the lowest
table of contents level of cash flows generated by a group of assets that are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and could include assets used across multiple businesses or segments. if the carrying value of an asset group exceeds the estimated undiscounted future cash flows, an impairment would be measured as the difference between the fair value of the group's long-lived assets and the carrying value of the group's long-lived assets. the impairment is allocated to the long-lived assets of the group on a pro rata basis using the relative carrying amounts, but only to the extent the carrying value of each asset is above its fair value. for assets held for sale, to the extent the carrying value is greater than the asset's fair value less costs to sell, an impairment loss is recognized for the difference. determining whether a long-lived asset is impaired requires various estimates and assumptions, including whether a triggering event has occurred, the identification of the asset groups, estimates of future cash flows and the discount rate used to determine fair values. if we had established different asset groups or utilized different valuation methodologies or assumptions, the impairment test results could differ, and we could be required to record impairment charges.
the company has cost and equity investments. the fair value of these investments is dependent on the performance of the investee companies as well as volatility inherent in the external markets for these investments. in assessing the potential impairment of these investments, we consider these factors as well as the forecasted financial performance of the investees and market values, where available. if these forecasts are not met or market values indicate an other-than-temporary decline in value, impairment charges may be required.
the company tested its goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets, investments and long-lived assets for impairment and recorded non-cash impairment charges of $7 million, $10 million and $46 million in fiscal years 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. the fiscal 2014 impairment charges related to radio fcc licenses held by businesses in the media networks segment. the fair values of the radio fcc licenses were derived from market transactions. these impairment charges were recorded in "restructuring and impairment charges" in the consolidated statements of income.
allowance for doubtful accounts we evaluate our allowance for doubtful accounts and estimate collectability of accounts receivable based on our analysis of historical bad debt experience in conjunction with our assessment of the financial condition of individual companies with which we do business. in times of domestic or global economic turmoil, our estimates and judgments with respect to the collectability of our receivables are subject to greater uncertainty than in more stable periods. if our estimate of uncollectible accounts is too low, costs and expenses may increase in future periods, and if it is too high, costs and expenses may decrease in future periods.
contingencies and litigation we are currently involved in certain legal proceedings and, as required, have accrued estimates of the probable and estimable losses for the resolution of these proceedings. these estimates are based upon an analysis of potential results, assuming a combination of litigation and settlement strategies and have been developed in consultation with outside counsel as appropriate. from time to time, we may also be involved in other contingent matters for which we have accrued estimates for a probable and estimable loss. it is possible, however, that future results of operations for any particular quarterly or annual period could be materially affected by changes in our assumptions or the effectiveness of our strategies related to legal proceedings or our assumptions regarding other contingent matters. see note 14 to the consolidated financial statements for more detailed information on litigation exposure.
income tax audits as a matter of course, the company is regularly audited by federal, state and foreign tax authorities. from time to time, these audits result in proposed assessments. our determinations regarding the recognition of income tax benefits are made in consultation with outside tax and legal counsel, where appropriate, and are based upon the technical merits of our tax positions in consideration of applicable tax statutes and related interpretations and precedents and upon the expected outcome of proceedings (or negotiations) with taxing and legal authorities. the tax benefits ultimately realized by the company may differ from those recognized in our future financial statements based on a number of factors, including the company's decision to settle rather than litigate a matter, relevant legal precedent related to similar matters and the company's success in supporting its filing positions with taxing authorities.
new accounting pronouncements see note 18 to the consolidated financial statements for information regarding new accounting pronouncements.
forward-looking statements the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 provides a safe harbor for forward-looking statements made by or on behalf of the company. we may from time to time make written or oral statements that are "forward-looking," including statements contained in this report and other filings with the sec and in reports to our shareholders. such statements may, for
table of contents example, express expectations or projections about future actions that we may take, including restructuring or strategic initiatives, or about developments beyond our control including changes in domestic or global economic conditions. these statements are made on the basis of management's views and assumptions as of the time the statements are made and we undertake no obligation to update these statements. there can be no assurance, however, that our expectations will necessarily come to pass. significant factors affecting these expectations are set forth under item 1a - risk factors of this report on form 10-k.

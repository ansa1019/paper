item 1a. risk factors in addition to the factors discussed elsewhere in this report, the following risks and uncertainties could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial also may impair our business operations and financial condition.
we may not realize the benefits that we expect from our global efficiency and effectiveness program (project k).
in november 2013, the company announced a global efficiency and effectiveness program (project k). the successful implementation of project k presents significant organizational design and infrastructure challenges and in many cases will require successful negotiations with third parties, including labor organizations, suppliers,
business partners, and other stakeholders. in addition, the project may not advance our business strategy as expected. as a result, we may not be able to implement project k as planned, including the successful exit of our direct store delivery network and transitioning that business to a warehouse model. events and circumstances, such as financial or strategic difficulties, delays and unexpected costs may occur that could result in our not realizing all or any of the anticipated benefits or our not realizing the anticipated benefits on our expected timetable. if we are unable to realize the anticipated savings of the program, our ability to fund other initiatives may be adversely affected. any failure to implement project k in accordance with our expectations could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
in addition, the complexity of project k will require a substantial amount of management and operational resources. our management team must successfully implement administrative and operational changes necessary to achieve the anticipated benefits of project k. these and related demands on our resources may divert the organization's attention from existing core businesses, integrating or separating personnel and financial or other systems, have adverse effects on existing business relationships with suppliers and customers, and impact employee morale. as a result our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows may be adversely affected.
we may not realize the benefits we expect from the adoption of zero-based budgeting.
we adopted zero-based budgeting which presents significant organizational challenges. as a result, we may not realize all or part of the anticipated cost savings or other benefits from the initiative. other events and circumstances, such as financial or strategic difficulties, delays or unexpected costs, may also adversely impact our ability to realize all or part of the anticipated cost savings or other benefits, or cause us not to realize the anticipated cost savings or other benefits on the expected timetable. if we are unable to realize the anticipated cost savings, our ability to fund other initiatives may be adversely affected. in addition, the initiatives may not advance our strategy as expected. finally, the complexity of the implementation will require a substantial amount of management and operational resources. our management team must successfully execute the administrative and operational changes necessary to achieve the anticipated benefits of the initiatives. these and related demands on our resources may divert the organization's attention from other business issues, have adverse effects on existing business relationships with suppliers and customers, and impact employee morale.
any failure to implement our cost reduction, organizational design or other initiatives in accordance with our plans could adversely affect our business or financial results.
we may not realize the benefits we expect from revenue growth management.
we are establishing a more formal revenue growth management discipline to help us realize price in a more effective way. this approach addresses price strategy, price-pack architecture, promotion strategy, mix management, and trade strategies. revenue growth management will involve changes to the way we do business and may not always be accepted by our customers or consumers causing us not to realize the anticipated benefits. in addition, the complexity of the implementation will require a substantial amount of management and operational resources. our management team must successfully execute the administrative and operational changes necessary to achieve the anticipated benefits of the initiative. these and related demands on our resources may divert the organization's attention from other business issues and have adverse effects on existing business relationships with suppliers and customers. any failure to implement revenue growth management in accordance with our plans could adversely affect our business or financial condition.
our results may be materially and adversely impacted as a result of increases in the price of raw materials, including agricultural commodities, fuel and labor.
agricultural commodities, including corn, wheat, potato flakes, vegetable oils, sugar and cocoa, are the principal raw materials used in our products. cartonboard, corrugated, and plastic are the principal packaging materials used by us. the cost of such commodities may fluctuate widely due to government policy and regulation, drought and other weather conditions (including the potential effects of climate change) or other unforeseen circumstances. to the extent that any of the foregoing factors affect the prices of such commodities and we are unable to increase our prices or adequately hedge against such changes in prices in a manner that offsets such changes, the results of our operations could be materially and adversely affected. in addition, we use derivatives to hedge price risk associated with forecasted purchases of raw materials. our hedged price could exceed the spot price on the date of purchase, resulting in an unfavorable impact on both gross margin and net earnings.
cereal processing ovens at major domestic and international facilities are regularly fueled by electricity, natural gas or propane, which are obtained from local utilities or other local suppliers. short-term stand-by propane storage
exists at several plants for use in case of interruption in natural gas supplies. oil may also be used to fuel certain operations at various plants. in addition, considerable amounts of diesel fuel are used in connection with the distribution of our products. the cost of fuel may fluctuate widely due to economic and political conditions, government policy and regulation, war, or other unforeseen circumstances which could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated operating results or financial condition.
a shortage in the labor pool, failure to successfully negotiate collectively bargained agreements, or other general inflationary pressures or changes in applicable laws and regulations could increase labor cost, which could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated operating results or financial condition.
our labor costs include the cost of providing benefits for employees. we sponsor a number of benefit plans for employees in the united states and various foreign locations, including pension, retiree health and welfare, active health care, severance and other postemployment benefits. we also participate in a number of multiemployer pension plans for certain of our manufacturing locations. our major pension plans and u.s. retiree health and welfare plans are funded with trust assets invested in a globally diversified portfolio of equity securities with smaller holdings of bonds, real estate and other investments. the annual cost of benefits can vary significantly from year to year and is materially affected by such factors as changes in the assumed or actual rate of return on major plan assets, a change in the weighted-average discount rate used to measure obligations, the rate or trend of health care cost inflation, and the outcome of collectively-bargained wage and benefit agreements. many of our employees are covered by collectively-bargained agreements and other employees may seek to be covered by collectively-bargained agreements. strikes or work stoppages and interruptions could occur if we are unable to renew these agreements on satisfactory terms or enter into new agreements on satisfactory terms, which could adversely impact our operating results. the terms and conditions of existing, renegotiated or new agreements could also increase our costs or otherwise affect our ability to fully implement future operational changes to enhance our efficiency.
multiemployer pension plans could adversely affect our business.
we participate in various "multiemployer" pension plans administered by labor unions representing some of our employees. we make periodic contributions to these plans to allow them to meet their pension benefit obligations to their participants. our required contributions to these funds could increase because of a shrinking contribution base as a result of the insolvency or withdrawal of other companies that currently contribute to these funds, inability or failure of withdrawing companies to pay their withdrawal liability, lower than expected returns on pension fund assets or other funding deficiencies. in the event that we withdraw from participation in one of these plans, then applicable law could require us to make an additional lump-sum contribution to the plan, and we would have to reflect that as an expense in our consolidated statement of operations and as a liability on our consolidated balance sheet. our withdrawal liability for any multiemployer plan would depend on the extent of the plan's funding of vested benefits. in the ordinary course of our renegotiation of collective bargaining agreements with labor unions that maintain these plans, we may decide to discontinue participation in a plan, and in that event, we could face a withdrawal liability. some multiemployer plans in which we participate are reported to have significant underfunded liabilities. such underfunding could increase the size of our potential withdrawal liability.
we operate in the highly competitive food industry.
we face competition across our product lines, including ready-to-eat cereals and convenience foods, from other companies which have varying abilities to withstand changes in market conditions. most of our competitors have substantial financial, marketing and other resources, and competition with them in our various markets and product lines could cause us to reduce prices, increase capital, marketing or other expenditures, or lose category share, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results. in some cases, our competitors may be able to respond to changing business and economic conditions more quickly than us. category share and growth could also be adversely impacted if we are not successful in introducing new products or in effectively assessing, changing and setting proper pricing.
the changing retail environment could negatively impact our sales and profits.
our businesses are largely concentrated in the traditional retail grocery trade. our largest customer, wal-mart stores, inc. and its affiliates, accounted for approximately 20% of consolidated net sales during 2016, comprised principally of sales within the united states. at december 31, 2016, approximately 12% of our consolidated receivables balance and 18% of our u.s. receivables balance was comprised of amounts owed by wal-mart stores, inc. and its affiliates. no other customer accounted for greater than 10% of net sales in 2016. during 2016, our top five customers, collectively, including wal-mart, accounted for approximately 34% of our consolidated net sales and approximately 47% of u.s. net sales. there can be no assurances that our largest customers will continue to
purchase our products in the same mix or quantities or on the same terms as in the past. as the retail grocery trade continues to consolidate and retailers become larger, our large retail customers may seek to use their position to improve their profitability through improved efficiency, lower pricing, increased promotional programs funded by their suppliers and more favorable terms. if we are unable to use our scale, marketing expertise, product innovation and category leadership positions to respond, our profitability or volume growth could be negatively affected. the loss of any large customer for an extended length of time could negatively impact our sales and profits.
additionally, alternative retails channels, such as internet-based retailers, discount and dollar stores, drug stores and club stores, have become more prevalent. if we are not successful in expanding sales in alternative retail channels, our business or financial results may be negatively impacted. also, if these alternative retail channels like internet-based retailers were to take significant share away from traditional retailers that could have a flow over effect on our business and our financial results could be negatively impacted.
our results may be negatively impacted if consumers do not maintain their favorable perception of our brands.
we have a number of iconic brands with significant value. maintaining and continually enhancing the value of these brands is critical to the success of our business. brand value is based in large part on consumer perceptions. success in promoting and enhancing brand value depends in large part on our ability to provide high-quality products. brand value could diminish significantly due to a number of factors, including consumer perception that we have acted in an irresponsible manner, adverse publicity about our products (whether or not valid), our failure to maintain the quality of our products, the failure of our products to deliver consistently positive consumer experiences, the products becoming unavailable to consumers, or the failure to meet the nutrition expectations of our products or particular ingredients in our products (whether or not valid), including whether certain of our products are perceived to contribute to obesity. the growing use of social and digital media by consumers, kellogg and third parties increases the speed and extent that information or misinformation and opinions can be shared. negative posts or comments about kellogg, our brands or our products on social or digital media could seriously damage our brands and reputation, regardless of the information's accuracy. the harm may be immediate without affording us an opportunity for redress or correction. brand recognition can also be impacted by the effectiveness of our advertising campaigns and marketing programs, as well as our use of social media. if we do not maintain the favorable perception of our brands, our results could be negatively impacted.
tax matters, including changes in tax rates, disagreements with taxing authorities and imposition of new taxes could impact our results of operations and financial condition.
the company is subject to taxes in the u.s. and numerous foreign jurisdictions where the company's subsidiaries are organized. due to economic and political conditions (including shifts in the geopolitical landscape), tax rates in various foreign jurisdictions may be subject to significant change. the future effective tax rate could be effected by changes in mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in valuation of deferred tax asset and liabilities, or changes in tax laws or their interpretation which includes possible u.s. tax reform and contemplated changes in other countries of long-standing tax principles if finalized and adopted could have a material impact on our income tax expense and deferred tax balances.
we are also subject to regular reviews, examinations and audits by the internal revenue service and other taxing authorities with respect to taxes inside and outside of the u.s. although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, if a taxing authority disagrees with the positions we have taken, we could face additional tax liability, including interest and penalties. there can be no assurance that payment of such additional amounts upon final adjudication of any disputes will not have a material impact on our results of operations and financial position.
the cash we generate outside the u.s. is principally to be used to fund our international development. if the funds generated by our u.s. business are not sufficient to meet our need for cash in the u.s., we may need to repatriate a portion of our future international earnings to the u.s. such international earnings would be subject to u.s. tax which could cause our worldwide effective tax rate to increase.
we also need to comply with new, evolving or revised tax laws and regulations. the enactment of or increases in tariffs, including value added tax, or other changes in the application of existing taxes, in markets in which we are currently active, or may be active in the future, or on specific products that we sell or with which our products compete, may have an adverse effect on our business or on our results of operations.
if our food products become adulterated, misbranded or mislabeled, we might need to recall those items and may experience product liability if consumers are injured as a result.
selling food products involves a number of legal and other risks, including product contamination, spoilage, product tampering, allergens, or other adulteration. we may need to recall some of our products if they become adulterated or misbranded. we may also be liable if the consumption of any of our products causes injury, illness or death. a widespread product recall or market withdrawal could result in significant losses due to their costs, the destruction of product inventory, and lost sales due to the unavailability of product for a period of time. we could also suffer losses from a significant product liability judgment against us. a significant product recall or product liability case could also result in adverse publicity, damage to our reputation, and a loss of consumer confidence in our food products, which could have a material adverse effect on our business results and the value of our brands. moreover, even if a product liability or consumer fraud claim is meritless, does not prevail or is not pursued, the negative publicity surrounding assertions against our company and our products or processes could adversely affect our reputation or brands.
we could also be adversely affected if consumers lose confidence in the safety and quality of certain food products or ingredients, or the food safety system generally. if another company recalls or experiences negative publicity related to a product in a category in which we compete, consumers might reduce their overall consumption of products in this category. adverse publicity about these types of concerns, whether or not valid, may discourage consumers from buying our products or cause production and delivery disruptions.
unanticipated business disruptions could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
we manufacture and source products and materials on a global scale. we have a complex network of suppliers, owned manufacturing locations, contract manufacturer locations, distribution networks and information systems that support our ability to provide our products to our customers consistently. our ability to make, move and sell products globally is critical to our success. factors that are hard to predict or beyond our control, such as product or raw material scarcity, weather (including any potential effects of climate change), natural disasters, fires or explosions, terrorism, political unrest, health pandemics or strikes, could damage or disrupt our operations or our suppliers' or contract manufacturers' operations. if we do not effectively respond to disruptions in our operations, for example, by finding alternative suppliers or replacing capacity at key manufacturing or distribution locations, or cannot quickly repair damage to our information, production or supply systems, we may be late in delivering or unable to deliver products to our customers. if that occurs, we may lose our customers' confidence, and long-term consumer demand for our products could decline. these events could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
evolving tax, environmental, food quality and safety or other regulations or failure to comply with existing licensing, labeling, trade, food quality and safety and other regulations and laws could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition.
our activities or products, both in and outside of the united states, are subject to regulation by various federal, state, provincial and local laws, regulations and government agencies, including the u.s. food and drug administration, u.s. federal trade commission, the u.s. departments of agriculture, commerce and labor, as well as similar and other authorities outside of the united states, international accords and treaties and others, including voluntary regulation by other bodies. in addition, legal and regulatory systems in emerging and developing markets may be less developed, and less certain. these laws and regulations and interpretations thereof may change, sometimes dramatically, as a result of a variety of factors, including political, economic or social events.
the manufacturing, marketing and distribution of food products are subject to governmental regulation that impose additional regulatory requirements. those regulations control such matters as food quality and safety, ingredients, advertising, product or production requirements, labeling, import or export of our products or ingredients, relations with distributors and retailers, health and safety, the environment, and restrictions on the use of government programs, such as supplemental nutritional assistance program, to purchase certain of our products.
the marketing of food products has come under increased regulatory scrutiny in recent years, and the food industry has been subject to an increasing number of proceedings and claims relating to alleged false or deceptive marketing under federal, state and foreign laws or regulations. we are also regulated with respect to matters such as licensing requirements, trade and pricing practices, tax, anticorruption standards, advertising and claims, and environmental matters. the need to comply with new, evolving or revised tax, environmental, food quality and safety, labeling or other laws or regulations, or new, evolving or changed interpretations or enforcement of existing
laws or regulations, may have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. changes in legal or regulatory requirements (such as new food safety requirements and revised nutrition facts labeling and serving size regulations), or evolving interpretations of existing legal or regulatory requirements, may result in increased compliance costs, capital expenditures and other financial obligations that could adversely affect our business or financial results. if we are found to be out of compliance with applicable laws and regulations in these areas, we could be subject to civil remedies, including fines, injunctions, termination of necessary licenses or permits, or recalls, as well as potential criminal sanctions, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business. even if regulatory review does not result in these types of determinations, it could potentially create negative publicity or perceptions which could harm our business or reputation. further, modifications to international trade policy, including changes to or repeal of the north american free trade agreement, could have a negative impact on us or the industries we serve, including as a result of related uncertainty, and could materially and adversely impact our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
our operations face significant foreign currency exchange rate exposure and currency restrictions which could negatively impact our operating results.
we hold assets and incur liabilities, earn revenue and pay expenses in a variety of currencies other than the u.s. dollar, including the euro, british pound, australian dollar, canadian dollar, mexican peso, and russian ruble. because our consolidated financial statements are presented in u.s. dollars, we must translate our assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses into u.s. dollars at then-applicable exchange rates and face exposure to adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates. for example, the announcement of brexit has caused, and may continue to cause, significant volatility in currency exchange rate fluctuations. consequently, changes in the value of the u.s. dollar may unpredictably and negatively affect the value of these items in our consolidated financial statements, even if their value has not changed in their original currency.
if we pursue strategic acquisitions, alliances, divestitures or joint ventures, we may not be able to successfully consummate favorable transactions or successfully integrate acquired businesses.
from time to time, we may evaluate potential acquisitions, alliances, divestitures or joint ventures that would further our strategic objectives. with respect to acquisitions, we may not be able to identify suitable candidates, consummate a transaction on terms that are favorable to us, or achieve expected returns, expected synergies and other benefits as a result of integration challenges, or may not achieve those objectives on a timely basis. future acquisitions of foreign companies or new foreign ventures would subject us to local regulations and could potentially lead to risks related to, among other things, increased exposure to foreign exchange rate changes, government price control, repatriation of profits and liabilities relating to the u.s. foreign corrupt practices act.
with respect to proposed divestitures of assets or businesses, we may encounter difficulty in finding acquirers or alternative exit strategies on terms that are favorable to us, which could delay the accomplishment of our strategic objectives, or our divestiture activities may require us to recognize impairment charges. companies or operations acquired or joint ventures created may not be profitable or may not achieve sales levels and profitability that justify the investments made. for example, at the end of 2016, we acquired ritmo investimentos, controlling shareholder of parati s/a, afical ltda and padua ltda ("parati group"). the company will be integrating the parati group in 2017 and our ability to realize the anticipated benefits from this acquisition will depend, in part, on the successful integration of this business. our corporate development activities may present financial and operational risks, including diversion of management attention from existing core businesses, integrating or separating personnel and financial and other systems, and adverse effects on existing business relationships with suppliers and customers. future acquisitions could also result in potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities, the incurrence of debt, contingent liabilities and/or amortization expenses related to certain intangible assets and increased operating expenses, which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.
potential liabilities and costs from litigation could adversely affect our business.
there is no guarantee that we will be successful in defending our self in civil, criminal or regulatory actions, including under general, commercial, employment, environmental, food quality and safety, anti-trust and trade, advertising and claims, and environmental laws and regulations, or in asserting our rights under various laws. for example, our marketing or claims could face allegations of false or deceptive advertising or other criticisms which could end up in litigation and result in potential liabilities or costs. in addition, we could incur substantial costs and fees in defending our self or in asserting our rights in these actions or meeting new legal requirements. the costs and other effects of potential and pending litigation and administrative actions against us, and new legal requirements, cannot be determined with certainty and may differ from expectations.
our consolidated financial results and demand for our products are dependent on the successful development of new products and processes.
there are a number of trends in consumer preferences which may impact us and the industry as a whole. these include changing consumer dietary trends and the availability of substitute products.
our success is dependent on anticipating changes in consumer preferences and on successful new product and process development and product relaunches in response to such changes. trends within the food industry change often, and failure to identify and react to changes in these trends could lead to, among other things, reduced demand and price reductions for our brands and products. we aim to introduce products or new or improved production processes on a timely basis in order to counteract obsolescence and decreases in sales of existing products. while we devote significant focus to the development of new products and to the research, development and technology process functions of our business, we may not be successful in developing new products or our new products may not be commercially successful. in addition, if sales generated by new products cause a decline in sales of the company's existing products, the company's financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected. our future results and our ability to maintain or improve our competitive position will depend on our capacity to gauge the direction of our key markets and upon our ability to successfully identify, develop, manufacture, market and sell new or improved products in these changing markets.
our postretirement benefit-related costs and funding requirements could increase as a result of volatility in the financial markets, changes in interest rates and actuarial assumptions.
increases in the costs of postretirement medical and pension benefits may continue and negatively affect our business as a result of increased usage of medical benefits by retired employees and medical cost inflation, the effect of potential declines in the stock and bond markets on the performance of our pension and post-retirement plan assets, potential reductions in the discount rate used to determine the present value of our benefit obligations, and changes to our investment strategy that may impact our expected return on pension and post-retirement plan assets assumptions. u.s. generally accepted accounting principles require that we calculate income or expense for the plans using actuarial valuations. these valuations reflect assumptions about financial markets and interest rates, which may change based on economic conditions. the company's accounting policy for defined benefit plans may subject earnings to volatility due to the recognition of actuarial gains and losses, particularly those due to the change in the fair value of pension and post-retirement plan assets and interest rates. in addition, funding requirements for our plans may become more significant. however, the ultimate amounts to be contributed are dependent upon, among other things, interest rates, underlying asset returns, and the impact of legislative or regulatory changes related to pension and post-retirement funding obligations.
we use available borrowings under the credit facilities and other available debt financing for cash to operate our business, which subjects us to market and counter-party risk, some of which is beyond our control.
in addition to cash we generate from our business, our principal existing sources of cash are borrowings available under our credit facilities and other available debt financing. if our access to such financing was unavailable or reduced, or if such financing were to become significantly more expensive for any reason, we may not be able to fund daily operations, which would cause material harm to our business or could affect our ability to operate our business as a going concern. in addition, if certain of our lenders experience difficulties that render them unable to fund future draws on the facilities, we may not be able to access all or a portion of these funds, which could have similar adverse consequences.
we have a substantial amount of indebtedness.
we have indebtedness that is substantial in relation to our shareholders' equity, and we may incur additional indebtedness in the future, or enter into off-balance sheet financing, which would increase our leverage risks. as of december 31, 2016, we had total debt of approximately $7.8 billion and total kellogg company equity of $1.9 billion.
•   impairing the ability to access global capital markets to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures or general corporate purposes, particularly if the ratings assigned to our debt securities by rating organizations were revised downward or if a rating organization announces that our ratings are under review for a potential downgrade;
•   a downgrade in our credit ratings, particularly our short-term credit rating, would likely reduce the amount of commercial paper we could issue, increase our commercial paper borrowing costs, or both;
•   restricting our flexibility in responding to changing market conditions or making us more vulnerable in the event of a general downturn in economic conditions or our business;
•   requiring a substantial portion of the cash flow from operations to be dedicated to the payment of principal and interest on our debt, reducing the funds available to us for other purposes such as expansion through acquisitions, paying dividends, repurchasing shares, marketing and other spending and expansion of our product offerings; and
•   causing us to be more leveraged than some of our competitors, which may place us at a competitive disadvantage.
our ability to make scheduled payments or to refinance our obligations with respect to indebtedness or incur new indebtedness will depend on our financial and operating performance, which in turn, is subject to prevailing economic conditions, the availability of, and interest rates on, short-term financing, and financial, business and other factors beyond our control.
our performance is affected by general economic and political conditions and taxation policies.
customer and consumer demand for our products may be impacted by recession, financial and credit market disruptions, or other economic downturns in the united states or other nations. our results in the past have been, and in the future may continue to be, materially affected by changes in general economic and political conditions in the united states and other countries, including the interest rate environment in which we conduct business, the financial markets through which we access capital and currency, political unrest and terrorist acts in the united states or other countries in which we carry on business.
current economic conditions globally may delay or reduce purchases by our customers and consumers. this could result in reductions in sales of our products, reduced acceptance of innovations, and increased price competition. deterioration in economic conditions in any of the countries in which we do business could also cause slower collections on accounts receivable which may adversely impact our liquidity and financial condition. financial institutions may be negatively impacted by economic conditions and may consolidate or cease to do business which could result in a tightening in the credit markets, a low level of liquidity in many financial markets, and increased volatility in fixed income, credit, currency and equity markets. there could be a number of effects from a financial institution credit crisis on our business, which could include impaired credit availability and financial stability of our customers, including our suppliers, co-manufacturers and distributors. a disruption in financial markets may also have an effect on our derivative counterparties and could also impair our banking partners on which we rely for operating cash management. any of these events would likely harm our business, results of operations and financial condition.
we may not be able to attract and retain the highly skilled people we need to support our business we depend on the skills and continued service of key personnel, including our experienced management team. in addition, our ability to achieve our strategic and operating goals depends on our ability to identify, recruit, hire, train and retain qualified individuals. we compete with other companies both within and outside of our industry for talented personnel, and we may lose key personnel or fail to attract, recruit, train and retain other talented personnel. any such loss or failure may adversely affect our business or financial results. in addition, activities related to identifying, recruiting, hiring and integrating qualified individuals may require significant time and expense. we may not be able to locate suitable replacements for any key employees who leave, or offer employment to potential replacements on reasonable terms, each of which may adversely affect our business and financial results an impairment of the carrying value of goodwill or other acquired intangibles could negatively affect our consolidated operating results and net worth.
the carrying value of goodwill represents the fair value of acquired businesses in excess of identifiable assets and liabilities as of the acquisition date. the carrying value of other intangibles represents the fair value of trademarks, trade names, and other acquired intangibles as of the acquisition date. goodwill and other acquired intangibles expected to contribute indefinitely to our cash flows are not amortized, but must be evaluated by management at least annually for impairment. if carrying value exceeds current fair value, the intangible is considered impaired and is reduced to fair value via a charge to earnings. factors which could result in an impairment include, but are not limited to: (i) reduced demand for our products; (ii) higher commodity prices; (iii) lower prices for our products or increased marketing as a result of increased competition; and (iv) significant disruptions to our operations as a result of both internal and external events. should the value of one or more of the acquired intangibles become impaired, our consolidated earnings and net worth may be materially adversely affected.
as of december 31, 2016, the carrying value of intangible assets totaled approximately $7.5 billion, of which $5.2 billion was goodwill and $2.3 billion represented trademarks, tradenames, and other acquired intangibles compared to total assets of $15.1 billion and total kellogg company equity of $1.9 billion.
competition against retailer brands could negatively impact our business.
in nearly all of our product categories, we face branded and price-based competition. our products must provide higher value and/or quality to our consumers than alternatives, particularly during periods of economic uncertainty. consumers may not buy our products if relative differences in value and/or quality between our products and retailer brands change in favor of competitors' products or if consumers perceive this type of change. if consumers prefer retailer brands, then we could lose category share or sales volumes or shift our product mix to lower margin offerings, which could have a material effect on our business and consolidated financial position and on the consolidated results of our operations and profitability.
we may not achieve our targeted cost savings and efficiencies from cost reduction initiatives.
our success depends in part on our ability to be an efficient producer in a highly competitive industry. we have invested a significant amount in capital expenditures to improve our operational facilities. ongoing operational issues are likely to occur when carrying out major production, procurement, or logistical changes and these, as well as any failure by us to achieve our planned cost savings and efficiencies, could have a material adverse effect on our business and consolidated financial position and on the consolidated results of our operations and profitability.
technology failures could disrupt our operations and negatively impact our business.
we increasingly rely on information technology systems to process, transmit, and store electronic information. for example, our production and distribution facilities and inventory management utilize information technology to increase efficiencies and limit costs. information technology systems are also integral to the reporting of our results of operations. furthermore, a significant portion of the communications between, and storage of personal data of, our personnel, customers, consumers and suppliers depends on information technology. our information technology systems may be vulnerable to a variety of interruptions, as a result of updating our enterprise platform or due to events beyond our control, including, but not limited to, network or hardware failures, malicious or disruptive software, unintentional or malicious actions of employees or contractors, cyberattacks by common hackers, criminal groups or nation-state organizations or social-activist (hacktivist) organizations, geopolitical events, natural disasters, failures or impairments of telecommunications networks, or other catastrophic events. moreover, our computer systems have been, and will likely continue to be subjected to computer viruses or other malicious codes, unauthorized access attempts, and cyber- or phishing-attacks. these events could compromise our confidential information, impede or interrupt our business operations, and may result in other negative consequences, including remediation costs, loss of revenue, litigation and reputational damage. furthermore, if a breach or other breakdown results in disclosure of confidential or personal information, we may suffer reputational, competitive and/or business harm. to date, we have not experienced a material breach of cyber security. while we have implemented administrative and technical controls and taken other preventive actions to reduce the risk of cyber incidents and protect our information technology, they may be insufficient to prevent physical and electronic break-ins, cyber-attacks or other security breaches to our computer systems.
the company offers promotions, rebates, customer loyalty and other programs through which it may receive personal information, and it or its vendors could experience cyber-attacks, privacy breaches, data breaches or other incidents that result in unauthorized disclosure of consumer, customer, employee or company information. if the company suffers a loss as a result of a breach or other breakdown in its technology, including such cyber-attack, privacy breaches, data breaches or other incident involving one of the company's vendors, that result in unauthorized disclosure or significant unavailability of business, financial, personal or stakeholder information, the company may suffer reputational, competitive and/or business harm and may be exposed to legal liability, which may adversely affect the company's results of operations and/or financial condition. in addition, if the company's suppliers or customers experience such a breach or unauthorized disclosure or system failure, their businesses could be disrupted or otherwise negatively affected, which may result in a disruption in the company's supply chain or reduced customer orders, which would adversely affect the company's business operations.
our intellectual property rights are valuable, and any inability to protect them could reduce the value of our products and brands.
we consider our intellectual property rights, particularly and most notably our trademarks, but also including patents, trade secrets, copyrights and licensing agreements, to be a significant and valuable aspect of our
business. we attempt to protect our intellectual property rights through a combination of patent, trademark, copyright and trade secret laws, as well as licensing agreements, third party nondisclosure and assignment agreements and policing of third party misuses of our intellectual property. our failure to obtain or adequately protect our trademarks, products, new features of our products, or our technology, or any change in law or other changes that serve to lessen or remove the current legal protections of our intellectual property, may diminish our competitiveness and could materially harm our business.
we may be unaware of intellectual property rights of others that may cover some of our technology, brands or products. in addition, if, in the course of developing new products or improving the quality of existing products, we are found to have infringed the intellectual property rights of others, directly or indirectly, such finding could have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations and may limit our ability to introduce new products or improve the quality of existing products. any litigation regarding patents or other intellectual property could be costly and time-consuming and could divert the attention of our management and key personnel from our business operations. third party claims of intellectual property infringement might also require us to enter into costly license agreements. we also may be subject to significant damages or injunctions against development and sale of certain products.
we are subject to risks generally associated with companies that operate globally.
we are a global company and generated 35% of our 2016 net sales, 37% of 2015 and 39% of our 2014 net sales outside the united states. we manufacture our products in 21 countries and have operations in more than 180 countries, so we are subject to risks inherent in multinational operations. those risks include:
•   compliance with u.s. laws affecting operations outside of the united states, such as ofac trade sanction regulations and anti-boycott regulations,
•   compliance with anti-corruption laws, including u.s. foreign corrupt practices act (fcpa) and u.k. bribery act (ukba),
•   compliance with antitrust and competition laws, data privacy laws, and a variety of other local, national and multi-national regulations and laws in multiple regimes,
•   changes in tax laws, interpretation of tax laws and tax audit outcomes,
•   fluctuations or devaluations in currency values, especially in emerging markets,
•   changes in capital controls, including currency exchange controls, government currency policies or other limits on our ability to import raw materials or finished product or repatriate cash from outside the united states,
•   changes in local regulations and laws, the uncertainty of enforcement of remedies in foreign jurisdictions, and foreign ownership restrictions and the potential for nationalization or expropriation of property or other resources;
•   increased sovereign risk, such as default by or deterioration in the economies and credit worthiness of local governments,
•   greater risk of uncollectible accounts and longer collection cycles,
•   loss of ability to manage our operations in certain markets which could result in the deconsolidation of such businesses,
•   design and implementation of effective control environment processes across our diverse operations and employee base,
•   imposition of more or new tariffs, quotas, trade barriers, and similar restrictions on our sales or regulations, taxes or policies that might negatively affect our sales, and
•   changes in trade policies and trade relations.
please refer to note 16 for more information regarding our operations in venezuela, including the impact on our operations from currency restrictions and our decision to deconsolidate our venezuelan operations effective december 31, 2016.
in addition, political and economic changes or volatility, geopolitical regional conflicts, terrorist activity, political unrest, civil strife, acts of war, public corruption, expropriation and other economic or political uncertainties could interrupt and negatively affect our business operations or customer demand. the slowdown in economic growth or high unemployment in some emerging markets could constrain consumer spending, and declining consumer purchasing power could adversely impact our profitability. continued instability in the banking and governmental sectors of certain countries in the european union or the dynamics associated with the federal and state debt and budget challenges in the united states could adversely affect us. all of these factors could result in increased costs
or decreased revenues, and could materially and adversely affect our product sales, financial condition and results of operations.
there may be uncertainty as a result of key global events during 2016. for example, the continuing uncertainty arising from the brexit referendum in the united kingdom as well as ongoing terrorist activity, may adversely impact global stock markets (including the new york stock market on which our common shares are traded) and general global economic conditions. all of these factors are outside of our control, but may nonetheless cause us to adjust our strategy in order to compete effectively in global markets.
the results of the united kingdom's referendum on withdrawal from the european union may have a negative effect on global economic conditions, financial markets and our business.
in june 2016, a majority of voters in the united kingdom elected to withdraw from the european union in a national referendum. the referendum was advisory, and the terms of any withdrawal are subject to a negotiation period that could last at least two years after the government of the united kingdom formally initiates a withdrawal process. nevertheless, the referendum has created significant uncertainty about the future relationship between the united kingdom and the european union, including with respect to the laws and regulations that will apply as the united kingdom determines which european union laws to replace or replicate in the event of a withdrawal. the referendum has also given rise to calls for the governments of other european union member states to consider withdrawal.
the economic conditions and outlook in the united kingdom, the european union and elsewhere could be further adversely affected by (i) the uncertainty concerning the timing and terms of the exit, (ii) new or modified trading arrangements between the united kingdom and other countries, (iii) the risk that one or more other european union countries could come under increasing pressure to leave the european union, or (iv) the risk that the euro as the single currency of the eurozone could cease to exist. any of these developments, or the perception that any of these developments are likely to occur, could affect economic growth or business activity in the united kingdom or the european union, and could result in the relocation of businesses, cause business interruptions, lead to economic recession or depression, and impact the stability of the financial markets, availability of credit, currency exchange rates, interest rates, financial institutions, and political, financial and monetary systems. any of these developments, or the perception that any of them could occur, could depress economic activity and restrict our access to capital, which could materially and adversely affect our product sales, financial condition and results of operations.
our operations in certain emerging markets expose us to political, economic and regulatory risks.
our growth strategy depends in part on our ability to expand our operations in emerging markets. however, some emerging markets have greater political, economic and currency volatility and greater vulnerability to infrastructure and labor disruptions than more established markets. in many countries outside of the united states, particularly those with emerging economies, it may be common for others to engage in business practices prohibited by laws and regulations with extraterritorial reach, such as the fcpa and the ukba, or local anti-bribery laws. these laws generally prohibit companies and their employees, contractors or agents from making improper payments to government officials, including in connection with obtaining permits or engaging in other actions necessary to do business. failure to comply with these laws could subject us to civil and criminal penalties that could materially and adversely affect our reputation, financial condition and results of operations.
in addition, competition in emerging markets is increasing as our competitors grow their global operations and low cost local manufacturers expand and improve their production capacities. our success in emerging markets is critical to our growth strategy. if we cannot successfully increase our business in emerging markets and manage associated political, economic and regulatory risks, our product sales, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.
adverse changes in the global climate or extreme weather conditions could adversely affect our business or operations climate change is a core business issue for kellogg to ensure the long-term health and viability of the ingredients we use in our products. as set forth in the intergovernmental panel on climate change fifth assessment report, there is continuing scientific evidence, as well as concern from members of the general public, that emissions of greenhouse gases and contributing human activities have caused and will continue to cause significant changes in global temperatures and weather patterns and increase the frequency or severity of weather events, wildfires and
flooding. as the pressures from climate change and global population growth lead to increased demand, the food system and global supply chain is becoming increasingly vulnerable to acute shocks, leading to increased prices and volatility, especially in the energy and commodity markets. adverse changes such as these could:
•   unfavorably impact the cost or availability of raw or packaging materials, especially if such events have a negative impact on agricultural productivity or on the supply of water;
•   disrupt our ability, or the ability of our suppliers or contract manufacturers, to manufacture or distribute our products;
•   disrupt the retail operations of our customers; or
•   unfavorably impact the demand for, or the consumer's ability to purchase, our products.
foreign, federal, state and local regulatory and legislative bodies have proposed various legislative and regulatory measures relating to climate change, regulating greenhouse gas emissions and energy policies. in the event that such regulation is enacted, we may experience significant increases in our costs of operation and delivery. in particular, increasing regulation of fuel emissions could substantially increase the distribution and supply chain costs associated with our products. lastly, consumers and customers may put an increased priority on purchasing products that are sustainably grown and made, requiring us to incur increased costs for additional transparency, due diligence and reporting. as a result, climate change could negatively affect our business and operations
item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations kellogg company and subsidiaries results of operations business overview the following management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (md&a) is intended to help the reader understand kellogg company, our operations and our present business environment. md&a is provided as a supplement to, and should be read in conjunction with, our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes thereto contained in item 8 of this report.
for more than 100 years, consumers have counted on kellogg for great-tasting, high-quality and nutritious foods. kellogg is the world's leading producer of cereal, second largest producer of cookies and crackers, and a leading producer of savory snacks and frozen foods. additional product offerings include toaster pastries, cereal bars, fruit-flavored snacks and veggie foods. kellogg products are manufactured and marketed globally.
segments and growth targets we manage our operations through nine operating segments that are based on product category or geographic location. these operating segments are evaluated for similarity with regards to economic characteristics, products, production processes, types or classes of customers, distribution methods and regulatory environments to determine if they can be aggregated into reportable segments. we report results of operations in the following reportable segments: u.s. morning foods; u.s. snacks; u.s. specialty; north america other; europe; latin america; and asia pacific. the reportable segments are discussed in greater detail in note 18 within notes to consolidated financial statements.
we manage our company for sustainable performance defined by our long-range annual growth targets. our targeted long-range annual growth is low-single-digit (1 to 3%) for currency-neutral comparable net sales, mid-single-digit (4 to 6%) for currency-neutral comparable operating profit, and high-single-digit (7 to 9%) for currency-neutral comparable diluted net earnings per share (eps).
operating margin expansion by 2018
in 2016 we announced a plan to expand our currency-neutral comparable operating margin excluding venezuela by 350 basis points during 2016 through 2018. this is an increase and acceleration from our previous guidance, which targeted a 17-18% currency-neutral comparable operating margin excluding venezuela by 2020.
•   productivity and savings - in addition to annual productivity savings to offset inflation, we will expand our zero-based budgeting initiative in the u.s. and our international regions. we also are working on additional project k initiatives. the result of these initiatives should be higher annual savings.
•   price realization - we are establishing a more formal revenue growth management discipline around the world, to help us realize price in a more effective way.
•   investing for impact - we are updating our investment model to align with today's consumer and technology in order to optimize the return on investment in our brands.
•   on-trend foods - we are adopting a more impactful approach to renovation and innovation of our foods.
during this time period, we will be working to stabilize net sales, with an aim to returning to growth. however, the volume and price impact of exiting direct store delivery (dsd), the elasticity impact of certain pricing actions, and the effect of portfolio optimization, in conjunction with current industry dynamics, lead us to forecast a decline in currency-neutral comparable net sales excluding venezuela by approximately 2% in 2017. nevertheless, these margin-expansion actions are expected to drive accelerated growth in currency-neutral comparable operating profit and currency neutral comparable earnings per share excluding venezuela in 2017 and 2018.
in 2016 our advertising declined approximately 1.4 points as a percent to net sales, on a currency neutral comparable basis excluding venezuela, as a result of implementation of efficiency and effectiveness programs
including zero-based budgeting, the change in media landscape migrating investment to digital, and shifting investment to food innovation and renovation.   as we continue to implement zero-based budgeting we may identify additional efficiency and effectiveness opportunities in advertising as we proceed through 2017.  we may choose to reinvest these savings back into advertising, or other areas such as food reformulation or capacity to drive revenue growth, or to achieve our 2018 margin expansion target.  we remain committed to invest in our brands at an industry-leading level to maintain the strength of our many recognizable brands in the marketplace.
guidance on operating profit margin expansion and net sales growth outlook is provided on a non-gaap, currency-neutral comparable basis excluding venezuela only because certain information necessary to calculate such measures on a gaap basis is unavailable, dependent on future events outside of our control and cannot be predicted without unreasonable efforts by the company. please refer to the "non-gaap financial measures" section for a further discussion of our use of non-gaap measures, including quantification of known expected adjustment items.
non-gaap financial measures this filing includes non-gaap financial measures that we provide to management and investors that exclude certain items that we do not consider part of on-going operations. items excluded from our non-gaap financial measures are discussed in the "significant items impacting comparability" section of this filing. our management team consistently utilizes a combination of gaap and non-gaap financial measures to evaluate business results, to make decisions regarding the future direction of our business, and for resource allocation decisions, including incentive compensation. as a result, we believe the presentation of both gaap and non-gaap financial measures provides investors with increased transparency into financial measures used by our management team and improves investors' understanding of our underlying operating performance and in their analysis of ongoing operating trends. all historic non-gaap financial measures have been reconciled with the most directly comparable gaap financial measures.
non-gaap financial measures used include comparable net sales, comparable gross margin, comparable sga, comparable operating profit, comparable operating profit margin, comparable effective tax rate, comparable net income attributable to kellogg company, comparable diluted eps, and cash flow. these non-gaap financial measures are also evaluated for year-over-year growth and on a currency-neutral basis to evaluate the underlying growth of the business and to exclude the effect of foreign currency. we determine currency-neutral operating results by dividing or multiplying, as appropriate, the current-period local currency operating results by the currency exchange rates used to translate our financial statements in the comparable prior-year period to determine what the current period u.s. dollar operating results would have been if the currency exchange rate had not changed from the comparable prior-year period. these non-gaap financial measures may not be comparable to similar measures used by other companies.
•   comparable net sales: we adjust the gaap financial measures to exclude the pre-tax effect of acquisitions, divestitures, and shipping day differences. we excluded the items which we believe may obscure trends in our underlying net sales performance. by providing this non-gaap net sales measure, management intends to provide investors with a meaningful, consistent comparison of net sales performance for the company and each of our reportable segments for the periods presented. management uses this non-gaap measure to evaluate the effectiveness of initiatives behind net sales growth, pricing realization, and the impact of mix on our business results. this non-gaap measure is also used to make decisions regarding the future direction of our business, and for resource allocation decisions. currency-neutral comparable net sales represents comparable net sales excluding the impact of foreign currency.
•   comparable gross profit, comparable gross margin, comparable sga, comparable sga%, comparable operating profit, comparable operating profit margin, comparable net income attributable to kellogg company, and comparable diluted eps: we adjust the gaap financial measures to exclude the effect of project k and cost reduction activities, acquisitions, divestitures, integration costs, mark-to-market adjustments for pension plans, commodities and certain foreign currency contracts, costs associated with the vie deconsolidation, costs associated with the early redemption of debt outstanding, and costs associated with the venezuela remeasurement. we excluded the items which we believe may obscure trends in our underlying profitability. the impact of acquisitions and divestitures are not excluded from comparable diluted eps. by providing these non-gaap profitability measures, management intends to provide investors with a meaningful, consistent comparison of the company's profitability measures for the
periods presented. management uses these non-gaap financial measures to evaluate the effectiveness of initiatives intended to improve profitability, such as project k, zbb and revenue growth management, as well as to evaluate the impacts of inflationary pressures and decisions to invest in new initiatives within each of our segments. currency-neutral comparable represents comparable excluding foreign currency impact.
•   comparable effective tax rate: we adjust the gaap financial measure to exclude tax effect of project k and cost reduction activities, integration costs, mark-to-market adjustments for pension plans, commodities and certain foreign currency contracts, costs associated with the venezuela remeasurement, costs associated with the vie deconsolidation, and costs associated with the early redemption of debt outstanding. we excluded the items which we believe may obscure trends in our underlying tax rate. by providing this non-gaap measure, management intends to provide investors with a meaningful, consistent comparison of the company's effective tax rate for the periods presented. management uses this non-gaap measure to monitor the effectiveness of initiatives in place to optimize our global tax rate.
•   cash flow: defined as net cash provided by operating activities reduced by expenditures for property additions. cash flow does not represent the residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures. we use this non-gaap financial measure of cash flow to focus management and investors on the amount of cash available for debt repayment, dividend distributions, acquisition opportunities, and share repurchases once all of the company's business needs and obligations are met. additionally, certain performance-based compensation includes a component of this non-gaap measure.
these measures have not been calculated in accordance with gaap and should not be viewed as a substitute for gaap reporting measures.
significant items impacting comparability project k and cost reduction activities on february 9, 2017, we announced an extension to our previously-announced efficiency and effectiveness program ("project k"). project k is expected to continue generating a significant amount of savings that may be invested in key strategic areas of focus for the business. the company expects that these savings may be used to drive future growth in the business. we recorded pre-tax charges related to this program of $300 million in 2016, $311 million in 2015, and $298 million in 2014.
in 2015 we initiated the implementation of a zero-based budgeting (zbb) program in our north america business. during 2016 zbb was expanded to include the international segments of the business. in support of the zbb initiative, we incurred pretax charges of $25 million in 2016 and $12 million in 2015.
see the restructuring and cost reduction activities section for more information.
acquisitions and dispositions in september 2015, we completed the acquisition of mass foods, egypt's leading cereal company for $46 million, or $44 million net of cash and cash equivalents acquired. in our european reportable segment, the acquisition added $16 million in net sales and approximately $2 million in operating profit (before integration costs) in 2016 that impacted comparability to 2015 reported results. in addition, the acquisition added $4 million in net sales and less than $1 million of operating profit (before integration costs) in 2015 that impacted comparability to 2014 reported results.
in january 2015, we completed the acquisition of a majority interest in bisco misr, the number one packaged biscuits company in egypt for $125 million, or $117 million net of cash and cash equivalents acquired. in our european reportable segment, the acquisition added $9 million in net sales and less than $1 million of operating profit (before integration costs) in 2016 that impacted the comparability to 2015 reported results. in addition, the acquisition added $54 million in net sales and $4 million of operating profit (before integration costs) in 2015 that impacted comparability to 2014 reported results.
integration and transaction costs we have incurred integration costs related to the integration of the 2016 acquisition of parati group, the 2015 acquisitions of bisco misr and mass foods, the 2015 entry into a joint venture with tolaram africa, and the 2012 acquisition of pringles (integration completed in 2015) as we move these businesses into the kellogg business model. we recorded pre-tax integration costs of $12 million, $30 million, and $43 million for 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively.
mark-to-market accounting for pension plans, commodities and certain foreign currency contracts we recognize mark-to-market adjustments for pension plans, commodity contracts, and certain foreign currency contracts as incurred. actuarial gains/losses for pension plans are recognized in the year they occur. changes between contract and market prices for commodities contracts and certain foreign currency contracts result in gains/losses that are recognized in the quarter they occur. we recorded total pre-tax mark-to-market charges of $261 million, $446 million, and $784 million for 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively. within this total, the pre-tax mark-to-market charges for pension plans were $314 million, $471 million, and $744 million for 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively.
other costs impacting comparability in 2016, we redeemed $475 million of our 7.45% u.s. dollar debentures due 2031. in connection with the debt redemption, we incurred $153 million of interest expense, consisting primarily of a premium on the tender offer and also including accelerated losses on pre-issuance interest rate hedges, acceleration of fees and debt discount on the redeemed debt and fees related to the tender offer.
in 2015, a series of previously executed agreements between kellogg's and a third party variable interest entity (vie) were terminated resulting in our determination that we were no longer the primary beneficiary of the vie. accordingly, we deconsolidated the financial statements of the vie. as a result of the agreement terminations and related settlements, we recognized a loss of $19 million in other income (expense), net.
in connection with the deconsolidation, we derecognized all assets and liabilities of the vie, including an allocation of a portion of goodwill from the u.s. snacks operating segment, resulting in a $67 million non-cash gain, which was recorded within operating profit.
during 2014 we incurred $6 million of costs related to the evaluation of potential acquisitions.
venezuela there was a material change in the business environment, including a worsening of our access to key raw materials subject to restrictions, and a related significant drop in production volume in the fourth quarter. these supply chain disruptions, along with other factors such as the worsening economic environment in venezuela and the limited access to dollars to import goods through the use of any of the available currency mechanisms, have impaired our ability to effectively operate and fully control our venezuelan subsidiary.
as of december 31, 2016, we deconsolidated and changed to the cost method of accounting for our venezuelan subsidiary. we recorded a $72 million pre-tax charge in other income (expense), net as we fully impaired the value of our cost method investment in venezuela. the deconsolidation charge included the historical cumulative translation losses of approximately $63 million related to our venezuelan operations that had previously been recorded in accumulated other comprehensive losses within equity.
in 2015 we concluded that we were no longer able to obtain sufficient u.s. dollars on a timely basis through the dipro exchange resulting in a decision to remeasure our venezuela subsidiary's financial statements using the dicom (formerly simadi) rate. in connection with the change in rates, we recorded pre-tax charges totaling $152 million, including $112 million in the latin america operating segment and $40 million in the corporate operating segment. of the total charges, $100 million was recorded in cogs, $3 million was recorded in sga, and $49 million was recorded in other income (expense), net. these charges consisted of $47 million related to the remeasurement of net monetary assets denominated in venezuelan bolivar at the simadi exchange rate (recorded in other income (expense), net), $56 million related to reducing inventory to the lower of cost or market (recorded in cogs) and $49 million related to the impairment of long-lived assets in venezuela (recorded primarily in cogs).
following the change to the dicom (formerly simadi) rate in 2015, certain non-monetary assets related to our venezuelan subsidiary continued to be remeasured at historical exchange rates. as these assets were utilized by our venezuelan subsidiary during 2016 and 2015 they were recognized in the income statement at historical
exchange rates resulting in an unfavorable impact. we experienced an unfavorable pre-tax impact of approximately $11 million in 2016 and $17 million in 2015 related to the utilization of these remaining non-monetary assets, primarily impacting cogs.
shipping day differences our fiscal year normally ends on the saturday closest to december 31 and as a result, a 53rd week is added approximately every sixth year. our 2014 fiscal year ended on january 3, 2015, and included a 53rd week. while quarters normally consist of 13-week periods, the fourth quarter of 2014 included a 14th week. for comparability, the impact of the 53rd week is excluded from our comparable results. the impact of the fourth quarter 2014 53rd week was $197 million for net sales, $36 million for operating profit and $.07 on a fully-diluted eps basis.
foreign currency translation and the impact of venezuela we evaluate the operating results of our business on a currency-neutral basis. we determine currency-neutral operating results by dividing or multiplying, as appropriate, the current-period local currency operating results by the currency exchange rates used to translate our financial statements in the comparable prior-year period to determine what the current period u.s. dollar operating results would have been if the currency exchange rate had not changed from the comparable prior-year period.
as a result of our decision to change the exchange rate that we use to remeasure our venezuela subsidiary from cencoex to the simadi exchange rate beginning mid-2015, the methodology we use to calculate the impact of foreign currency translation, as described above, results in certain key performance metrics that are difficult to interpret when venezuela is included in the financial results. to provide additional visibility to our business performance, we have also included key performance metrics excluding our venezuela business. we believe that the use of our standard currency-neutral methodology in combination with the additional visibility provided by excluding venezuela from our key performance metrics provides important information to more fully understand currency-neutral operating results.
financial results for the full year 2016, our reported net sales decreased by 3.8% due primarily to the negative impact of foreign currency translation. currency-neutral comparable net sales increased by 4.0% due to the favorable year-over-year impact of the venezuela business. currency-neutral comparable net sales excluding venezuela decreased by 1.1%, which was in line with our expectations. the decline was driven primarily by declines in north america other, where we transitioned to new food and packaging in kashi® and morningstar farms®; in u.s. snacks, where we experienced lower sales in the first half of the year; in europe, where we face deflationary pressures in the u.k.; and in u.s. morning foods, where we experienced sharp declines in non-core categories. we experienced currency-neutral comparable net sales growth in u.s. specialty, latin america (excluding venezuela), and asia-pacific.
reported operating profit increased by 27.8% primarily due to expanded operating margins across several regions resulting from project k and zbb savings and the favorable year-over-year change in the pension mark-to-market which was partially offset by the negative impact of foreign currency translation and the unfavorable year-over-year impact of other one-time costs. currency-neutral comparable operating profit increased by 17.7%, above our expectations, primarily due to expanded margins across all regions resulting from project k and zbb savings. currency-neutral comparable operating profit excluding venezuela increased 6.7%.
reported operating margin improved 260 basis points due to the favorable impact to brand-building investment from zbb efficiencies, savings realized from project k and zbb, lower mark-to-market charges, lower integration costs, reduced impact from the venezuela remeasurement, which was partially offset by the unfavorable year-over-year impact of other one-time costs. currency-neutral comparable operating margin was favorable 190 basis points after excluding the year-over-year impact of mark-to-market charges, restructuring, integration costs, other one-time costs, venezuela remeasurement, and foreign currency. currency-neutral comparable operating margin excluding venezuela improved 110 basis points.
reported diluted eps of $1.96 was up 14.0% compared to the prior year of $1.72. currency-neutral comparable diluted eps of $4.31 was up 22.1% compared to prior year of $3.53, ahead of our expectations.

u.s. morning foods as reported and currency-neutral comparable net sales declined 2.0% as a result of unfavorable volume and pricing/mix. most of the decline was related to drinks and non-core products. this segment consists of cereal, toaster pastries, health and wellness bars, and beverages.
the cereal category and kellogg share are both down approximately 1% for the year. however, our core six cereal brands collectively gained 20 basis points of share, including special k®.
toaster pastries reported an increase in net sales and share gains, with good contribution from innovation.
as we look to 2017, we expect to see some trade inventory come out in the first quarter, but otherwise, we expect another sequential improvement in sales performance in 2017, and another year of strong operating margin expansion.
as reported operating profit increased 25.0% due to project k savings, brand-building efficiencies resulting from zbb, net deflation of input costs and reduced restructuring charges. this was partially offset by unfavorable sales performance. currency-neutral comparable operating profit increased 15.7%, excluding the benefit of reduced restructuring charges.
u.s. snacks as reported and currency-neutral comparable net sales declined 1.1% as a result of unfavorable pricing/mix and a slight decrease in volume. this segment consists of crackers, cereal bars, cookies, savory snacks, and fruit-flavored snacks.
crackers posted increased sales and share led by the big 3 brands in combination (cheez-it® , town house®, and club®). we have continued to invest in these brands, both in brand-building and innovation, and it continues to drive results.
the bars business declined due to weakness in the special k® brand as the change in weight-management trends away from counting calories. the brand's declines are moderating with the success of on-trend offerings like protein trail mix bars and fruit & nut bars. additionally, we have significant renovation and innovation launching in the first quarter of 2017. rice krispies treats® and nutri-grain® gained share during the year.
the cookies business consumption declined for the year resulting in lost share, although share losses moderated in the last half of the year. we are seeing the benefits of turning on advertising behind our keebler® elves.
savory snacks reported low-single-digit growth as a result of consumption growth due to core pringles® products driven, in part, by accelerated growth in on-the-go pack formats. this growth was partially offset by the lapping of sku discontinuations during the year.
as reported operating profit declined 15.8% due to the prior year benefit of the vie deconsolidation, increased restructuring charges in the current year, and unfavorable sales performance. this was partially offset by project k savings and brand-building efficiencies from zbb. currency-neutral comparable operating profit increased 8.5% after excluding the impact of the prior year vie deconsolidation and the impact of restructuring charges.
as announced, our u.s. snacks reporting segment will transition to a more efficient and effective go-to-market model during 2017, switching a portion of its business from dsd to the warehouse distribution system used by the rest of that business as well as our other u.s. business units. the transition is expected to have an unfavorable impact on net sales and gross margin in 2017 and 2018, owing to the re-set of list prices to reflect no longer providing retailers with dsd services, as well as the impact of reduced stock-keeping units and at least some disruption during the transition. lower overhead costs are expected to offset both the gross margin impact and reinvestment in brand building, resulting in a neutral impact on comparable operating profit in 2017 and positive thereafter.
u.s. specialty as reported and currency-neutral comparable net sales increased 2.8% as a result of favorable pricing/mix and a slight increase in volume. reported net sales growth was led by growth in the foodservice, convenience and vending channels. we held or gained share in cereal, crackers, wholesome snacks, and veggie in the foodservice channel, and in cereal, crackers, and frozen breakfast in the convenience channel.
we expect steady net sales growth and continued operating profit margin expansion in 2017 for this segment.
as reported operating profit increased 7.4% due to favorable sales performance and zbb savings. currency-neutral comparable operating profit increased 8.8% after excluding the minor impact of restructuring charges.
north america other as reported net sales decreased 5.3% due to lower volume, unfavorable impact of foreign currency and slightly unfavorable pricing/mix. currency-neutral comparable net sales declined 4.7% after excluding the impact of foreign currency.
the u.s. frozen business reported a net sales decline as we reshaped the portfolio for eggo® and transitioned packaging for morningstar farms®.  despite the impact of these significant changes, the business posted improvement in operating profit and profit margins, driven by project k and zbb.
in canada, net sales were down as a result of volume declines and unfavorable currency impact, partially offset by improved pricing/mix. beginning in the second quarter, we increased prices to help offset higher input costs due to significant transactional foreign exchange pressure. the price increases resulted in lower volume. however, consumption and share declines moderated in the fourth quarter. special k® gained share during 2016.
kashi posted lower sales during the year as the business continues to transition its portfolio. we have exited several non-core product lines, including frozen pizza, hot cereal, and trail mix. while these exits negatively impacted sales, they provide tighter focus and better economics going forward. we are investing heavily in our food. during the year, we completed an overhaul of our cereal portfolio, making every product non-gmo project verified. we also launched several new cereal and wholesome snacks products. finally, we have redesigned our packaging across our kashi portfolio. our substantial innovation and renovation efforts are starting to take hold.
we expect to gradually stabilize net sales in this segment during 2017, while expanding operating profit margins meaningfully throughout the year.
as reported operating profit increased 1.9% due to lower restructuring charges as well as project k savings and brand-building efficiencies resulting from zbb in the u.s. frozen and canada businesses. these impacts were mitigated somewhat by investments in food and packaging in the kashi business. currency-neutral comparable operating profit declined 7.5% after excluding the impact of restructuring and foreign currency.
europe as reported net sales declined 4.8% due to unfavorable foreign currency and pricing/mix offset by a slight increase in volume. currency-neutral comparable net sales declined 0.8% after excluding the impact of foreign currency and the impact of acquisitions.
the pringles® business posted mid-single-digit net sales growth due to sustained momentum in key markets and expansion of pringles® tortilla into new markets.
the wholesome snacks business posted net sales growth for the year led by emerging markets. in addition, we increased share in the uk and france, where growth in kids' brands accelerated.
the cereal business in europe posted a net sales decline mostly attributable to the uk, where consumption is down and a deflationary environment persists in our categories. we continue working to reposition and renovate special k®.
overall, we continue to see strong growth in emerging markets as currency-neutral comparable net sales increased at a double-digit rate in mediterranean, middle east, and russia.
in 2017, we will utilize revenue growth management (rgm) to improve price realization in the u.k., and this will be accompanied by concentrating more of our investment behind our priority brands. we expect some challenges early in the year with certain retailers, but the expectation is to make progress there as the year goes on. meanwhile, for the region as a whole, we will be renovating pringles® and continuing our emerging markets expansion. we expect another year of strong operating profit margin expansion behind key initiatives like project k, zbb, and rgm.
as reported operating profit declined 16.9% due to increased restructuring charges and unfavorable foreign currency impact partially offset by project k savings and productivity initiatives. currency-neutral comparable operating profit improved 8.9%, excluding the impact of restructuring charges and foreign currency.
latin america as reported net sales declined 23.1% due to unfavorable foreign currency and lower volume. this was partially offset by the favorable impact of pricing/mix, primarily due to venezuela. currency-neutral comparable net sales improved 67.7% primarily due to the impact of venezuela. excluding venezuela, currency-neutral comparable net sales would have grown 0.7%.
our sales performance was driven by price realization, as we cover the adverse impact of currency, the focus on kids-oriented rtec brands, the expansion of affordable formats in high-frequency stores, and the benefit of some distributor changes for pringles®.
cereal consumption and share grew in the back half of the year for mexico led by our focus on kids' rtec brands. the snacks business posted mid-single-digit net sales growth driven by strong pringles® results, with notable growth in the mexico and andean markets. we've accelerated consumption growth in wholesome snacks in mexico, led by new special k® offerings.

in 2017, we expect low single-digit currency neutral comparable net sales growth and continued currency neutral comparable operating margin expansion. this excludes the impact of parati, which we will be integrating in 2017. parati is our largest ever acquisition in latin america, and is expected to boost our capability and portfolio in high-frequency stores, and offer opportunity for geographic expansion and cost synergies.
asia pacific as reported net sales declined 0.4% due to unfavorable foreign currency, disposition of a small business and unfavorable pricing/mix. currency-neutral comparable net sales increased 1.6% after excluding the impact of foreign currency and disposition of a small business.
our australia business stabilized in 2016. the business is focusing media behind our priority brands, executing big "tent-pole" promotions during key shopper weeks, and launching consumer-driven innovation and renovation. our largest cereal brand in australia, nutri-grain®, returned to consumption and share growth as a result of these efforts.
in asia, modest growth was led by southeast asia and korea. the sub-saharan africa business continued to perform well. pringles® grew at a mid-single-digit rate on the strength of effective promotions as well as renovations like the re-stage of sweet flavors in korea and the roll-out of tortilla in australia and south africa. pringles® posted share gains for the year in korea, japan, south africa, indonesia, and the philippines.

u.s. morning foods as reported net sales declined 3.7% as a result of unfavorable volume and pricing/mix. currency-neutral comparable net sales declined 1.6% after excluding the negative impact of shipping day differences. this segment consists of cereal, toaster pastries, health and wellness bars, and beverages.
we saw a lot of improvement across the year in the morning foods business. we invested where we needed to and worked hard to improve the fundamentals by improving our brand building and the new products we launched. we also invested in our foods and put fun back in the box with avengers® and disney frozen®-themed cereals.
our cereal business reported a decline for the full year, although we continued to reflect improving trends throughout the year, and we reported consumption growth and share gains in the fourth quarter as our business continues to improve ahead of category trends. our six core cereals in combination (special k®, raisin bran®, frosted flakes®, mini-wheats®, froot loops®, and rice krispies®) gained share and increased consumption for the year, with even stronger growth in both share and consumption in the fourth quarter. special k® posted consumption growth and share gains for the year and even stronger results for the fourth quarter driven primarily by the renovation work we completed on special k® red berries. the good growth we saw all year on raisin bran® was the result of great advertising and the introduction of raisin bran® with cranberries.
toaster pastries reported a slight sales decline for the year. health and wellness bars and beverages each reported a sales decline.
as reported operating profit decreased 0.9% due to the negative impact of shipping day differences, increased distribution costs, and resetting of incentive compensation levels. these factors were mitigated somewhat by improved gross margins resulting from lower input costs and project k savings as well as lower brand-building investment. currency-neutral comparable operating profit increased 2.1% after excluding the negative impact of shipping day differences.
u.s. snacks as reported net sales declined 2.9% as a result of decreased volume and shipping day differences which were partially offset by favorable pricing/mix. currency-neutral comparable net sales declined 1.6% after excluding the negative impact of shipping day differences. this segment consists of crackers, cereal bars, cookies, savory snacks, and fruit-flavored snacks.
crackers posted a sales decline as consumption declined across several of our products, while consumption increased for our big 3 brands in combination (cheez-it® , town house®, and club®). the consumption decline was due primarily to weakness in special k® cracker chips during the first half of the year and full-year weakness in special k® popcorn chips. the special k® cracker chips products we restaged earlier this year posted consumption growth for the past two quarters as a result of improvements in packaging and food. we expect the impact of the remaining skus to lessen as we progress through 2016. the consumption increase for our big 3 brands was primarily the result of strong consumption and share gains in cheez-it® due to the cheez-it® grooves and cheez-it® extra toasty innovations.
the bars business declined due to weakness in the special k® and fiber plus® brands. the performance of our special k bars has improved in the second half of the year as a result of new products and renovation that occurred early in the year and good results from special k® chewy nut bars that were launched in mid-2015. rice krispies treats® reported double-digit consumption gains and gained share as a result of good core growth and innovation.
the cookies business consumption declined for the year resulting in lost share, although we have seen improving trends over the second half of 2015 as a result of good performance in chips deluxe®, fudge shoppe®, and famous amos® due to expanded distribution, new products, and increased in-store activity.
savory snacks reported low-single-digit growth as a result of consumption growth due to core products and innovations. the pringles® business had a good year including strength in the on-the-go segment.
as reported operating profit increased 5.9% due to a non-cash gain related to the deconsolidation of a vie partially mitigated by unfavorable sales performance and the resetting of incentive compensation levels. currency-neutral comparable operating profit declined by 11.3% after excluding the gain related to the deconsolidation of a vie.
u.s. specialty as reported net sales declined 1.4% due to lower volume and shipping day differences partly offset by favorable pricing/mix. currency-neutral comparable net sales increased 0.7% after excluding the impact of shipping day differences. sales growth was reported in the convenience and vending channels, partially offset by a slight decline in foodservice partially due to the exit of some unprofitable business early in the year.
as reported operating profit decreased 2.4% due to the resetting of incentive compensation levels, increased restructuring charges, and shipping day differences which more than offset the favorable sales performance. currency-neutral comparable operating profit declined by 0.8% after excluding the impact of restructuring costs and shipping day differences.
north america other as reported net sales decreased 9.5% due to the negative impact of shipping day differences, foreign currency, decreased volume and unfavorable pricing/mix. currency-neutral comparable net sales declined 3.2% after excluding the impact of shipping day differences and foreign currency.
the u.s. frozen business reported a net sales decline due to the impact from egg prices, network improvements, and a decision to draw down inventories due to changes in packaging from boxes to bags for our veggie foods business. the eggo® hand-held sandwiches posted double-digit consumption growth and share gains for the year.
the canada business reported a broad-based net sales increase across several categories for the year.
kashi reported a double-digit net sales decline although the business continues to experience stabilized distribution and sequential improvement across the last two quarters in part due to the impact of the introduction of new products in the second half of 2015. bear naked® granola posted double-digit consumption growth for the year.
as reported operating profit declined 39.8% due to increased restructuring charges, unfavorable sales performance in the u.s. frozen and kashi businesses, net cost inflation including transactional currency expense in the canadian business and increased material costs in the u.s. frozen business, and the resetting of incentive compensation levels. currency-neutral comparable operating profit declined 16.1% after excluding the impact of restructuring charges.
europe as reported net sales declined 13.0% as a result of foreign currency, shipping day differences, relatively flat volume and unfavorable pricing/mix partially offset by an acquisition. currency-neutral comparable net sales declined 0.6% after excluding the impact of the acquisition, foreign currency and shipping day differences.
the pringles® business posted strong, double-digit net sales growth as a result of good promotions, innovations and distribution gains throughout the year. both the base business and the launch of pringles® tortilla in the uk and germany contributed.
the wholesome snacks business posted growth in the second half of the year. this was due to better results in the uk driven in part by disney®-branded snacks, mini biscuits, crunchy nut®, and rice krispies squares®. in addition, the russian business did well.
the cereal business in europe declined due to challenges in the category in many of the countries. however, we improved our plans for special k® and crunchy nut® in the uk, saw good performance from extra® in italy, and invested behind kellogg's®-branded granola in germany. also, we recently launched the ancient legends® brands in the region. these are great products, which include on-trend ingredients like spelt, apples, sultanas, and chia seeds. we are also applying learnings from our us cereal business including the renovation of special k® red berries, the launch of special k® nourish, and we're also adding more fun in the box.
as reported operating profit increased 6.7% due to net cost deflation and strong savings, including savings from project k, lower integration costs and foreign currency. currency-neutral comparable operating profit improved 4.3% after excluding the impact of integration costs and foreign currency.
latin america as reported net sales declined 15.8% due to foreign currency mitigated somewhat by favorable volume and pricing/mix, including the impact of pricing actions in venezuela. currency-neutral comparable net sales improved 24.6% after excluding the impact of foreign currency. excluding venezuela, currency-neutral comparable net sales would have grown 1.3%.
we experienced volume growth in several of our markets, including mexico. we also realized strong price realization in venezuela as a result of pricing actions taken to offset cost inflation. cereal sales in the region increased and we have held or gained share in most of the region. these share gains have been driven by children's and family brands and the introduction of kellogg-branded granolas and muesli products.
sales in the snacks business also increased driven by innovation and go-to-market activity. the pringles® business continued to perform well and we have launched pringles® tortilla in the region.
our focus on high-frequency stores continues to drive results. we've seen results in convenience and mini-super stores in mexico, and in smaller stores in colombia. we have also had success driving sales growth through packaging initiatives designed to drive affordability and accessibility in various areas of the business.
as reported operating profit decreased 94.8% due to the remeasurement of our venezuela business and foreign currency partly mitigated by favorable price realization which was partially offset by net cost inflation. currency-neutral comparable operating profit improved by 15.4% after excluding the remeasurement of our venezuela business and foreign currency. excluding venezuela, currency neutral comparable operating profit declined 3.4% as sales growth and margin expansion were more than offset by increased investment in brand-building and business capabilities.
asia pacific as reported net sales declined 8.8% as a result of foreign currency and unfavorable pricing/mix partially mitigated by increased volume. unfavorable pricing/mix was primarily the result of country mix. currency-neutral comparable net sales increased 4.0% after excluding the impact of foreign currency.
the sales increase was the result of double-digit growth in the asian markets, double-digit growth in sub-saharan africa, and mid-single-digit growth in the savory snacks business across the region. the growth in asia included double-digit sales growth in japan driven by the continued growth of the granola category and the impact of new packaging as well as double-digit growth in korea and southeast asia. the savory snacks business reported broad-based sales growth and share gains due to innovation and gains in distribution.
this sales performance was partially offset by weakness in the australian cereal category. however, the granola and müesli segments are growing well and we are applying lessons learned in our us business to our australia business.
as reported operating profit increased 1.7% due to lower restructuring charges, foreign currency partially mitigated by our investment of project k savings into emerging markets in the region behind brand investments and capabilities. currency-neutral comparable operating profit declined 3.7% after excluding the impact of restructuring charges and foreign currency.
corporate as reported operating profit increased 38.1% due to lower mark-to-market expense and reduced pension costs partially offset by the resetting of incentive compensation levels and higher restructuring charges. currency-neutral comparable operating profit declined 4.1% after excluding the impact of mark-to-market and restructuring charges.

(a)   reported gross margin as a percentage of net sales. gross margin is equal to net sales less cost of goods sold.
reported gross margin for the year was favorable 190 basis points due to savings realized from project k and zbb, venezuela remeasurement, restructuring costs, mark-to-market and integration costs. this was partially offset by the impact of investments we are making in our food and packaging, unfavorable transactional foreign currency impact, and unfavorable mix. currency-neutral comparable gross margin declined 30 basis points, after excluding the impact of market-to-market, restructuring, integration costs, venezuela remeasurement, and foreign currency. currency-neutral comparable gross margin excluding venezuela declined 20 basis points.
reported sga% for the year was favorable 70 basis points primarily due to the favorable year-over-year impact to brand-building investment from zbb efficiencies, overhead savings realized from project k and zbb, and lower mark-to-market expense. these impacts were partially mitigated by the unfavorable year-over-year impact of a vie deconsolidation, continued reinvestment of project k savings into sales capabilities and re-establishing the kashi business, and foreign currency. currency-neutral comparable sga% was favorable 220 basis points, after excluding the impact of mark-to-market, vie deconsolidation, and foreign currency.
reported operating margin for the year was favorable 260 basis points due to the favorable year-over-year impact to brand-building investment from zbb efficiencies and overhead savings realized from project k and zbb,

reported and currency-neutral comparable gross margin declined by 10 basis points in 2015 due to the impact of venezuela. excluding the impact of venezuela, currency-neutral comparable gross margin would have increased by 20 basis points as a result of productivity savings, project k savings, and deflation in commodities and packaging which was partially offset by higher distribution costs and investment in our foods such as the launch of granolas and mueslis across the globe and the renovation of existing foods such as special k®.
reported sg&a% improved 120 basis points primarily due to lower mark-to-market expense related to pension and postretirement benefit plans, improvements resulting from efficiency and effectiveness programs, and decreased brand building investment. these impacts were partially offset by the resetting of incentive compensation, reinvestment of project k savings into sales capabilities including adding sales representatives, and re-establishing the kashi business unit. currency-neutral comparable sg&a% was worse by 40 basis points after excluding the impact of mark-to-market expense.

restructuring and cost reduction activities we view our continued spending on restructuring and cost reduction activities as part of our ongoing operating principles to provide greater visibility in achieving our long-term profit growth targets. initiatives undertaken are currently expected to recover cash implementation costs within a five-year period of completion. upon completion (or as each major stage is completed in the case of multi-year programs), the project begins to deliver cash savings and/or reduced depreciation.
project k in february 2017, the company announced an expansion and an extension to its previously-announced global efficiency and effectiveness program ("project k"), to reflect additional and changed initiatives. project k is expected to continue generating a significant amount of savings that may be invested in key strategic areas of focus
for the business or utilized to achieve our 2018 margin expansion target. the company expects that these savings may be used to improve operating margins or drive future growth in the business.
in addition to the original program's focus on strengthening existing businesses in core markets, increasing growth in developing and emerging markets, and driving an increased level of value-added innovation, the extended program will also focus on implementing a more efficient go-to-market model for certain businesses and creating a more efficient organizational design in several markets. since inception, project k has provided significant benefits and is expected to continue to provide a number of benefits in the future, including an optimized supply chain infrastructure, the implementation of global business services, a new global focus on categories, increased agility from a more efficient organization design, and improved effectiveness in go-to-market models.
we currently anticipate that project k will result in total pre-tax charges, once all phases are approved and implemented, of $1.5 to $1.6 billion, with after-tax cash costs, including incremental capital investments, estimated to be approximately $1.1 billion. cash expenditures of approximately $725 million have been incurred through the end of fiscal year 2016. total cash expenditures, as defined, are expected to be approximately $300 million for 2017 and the balance thereafter. total charges for project k in 2017 are expected to be approximately $400 to $450 million.
we now expect annual cost savings generated from project k will be approximately $600 to $700 million in 2019. the savings will be realized primarily in selling, general and administrative expense with additional benefit realized in gross profit as cost of goods sold savings are partially offset by negative volume and price impacts resulting from go-to-market business model changes. the overall savings profile of the project has been updated to reflect our go-to-market initiatives that will impact both selling, general and administrative expense and gross profit. we have realized approximately $300 million of annual savings through the end of 2016. cost savings will continue to be utilized to increase margins and be strategically invested in areas such as in-store execution, sales capabilities, including adding sales representatives, re-establishing the kashi business unit, and in the design and quality of our products. we have also invested in production capacity in developing and emerging markets, and in global category teams.
we funded much of the initial cash requirements for project k through our supplier financing initiative. we are now able to fund much of the cash costs for the project through cash on hand as we have started to realize cash savings from the project.
we also expect that the project will have an impact on our consolidated effective income tax rate during the execution of the project due to the timing of charges being taken in different tax jurisdictions. the impact of this project on our consolidated effective income tax rate will be excluded from the comparable income tax rate that will be disclosed on a quarterly basis.
refer to note 5 within notes to consolidated financial statements for further information related to project k and other restructuring activities.
other projects in 2015 we initiated the implementation of a zero-based budgeting (zbb) program in our north america business and during the first half of 2016 the program was expanded into our international businesses. we expect cumulative savings from the zbb program to be approximately $450 to $500 million by the end of 2018, realized largely in selling, general and administrative expense.
in support of the zbb initiative, we incurred pre-tax charges of approximately $25 million and $12 million during 2016 and 2015, respectively. we anticipate that zbb will result in total cumulative pre-tax charges up to approximately $50 million through 2017 which will consist primarily of the design and implementation of business capabilities.
foreign currency translation the reporting currency for our financial statements is the u.s. dollar. certain of our assets, liabilities, expenses and revenues are denominated in currencies other than the u.s. dollar, primarily in the euro, british pound, mexican peso, australian dollar, canadian dollar, and russian ruble. to prepare our consolidated financial statements, we must translate those assets, liabilities, expenses and revenues into u.s. dollars at the applicable exchange rates. as a result, increases and decreases in the value of the u.s. dollar against these other currencies will affect the amount of these items in our consolidated financial statements, even if their value has not changed in their original
currency. this could have significant impact on our results if such increase or decrease in the value of the u.s. dollar is substantial.
interest expense interest expense in 2016 includes a $153 million pre-tax charge to redeem $475 million of 7.45% u.s. dollar debentures due 2031. the charge consisted primarily of a premium on the tender offer and also included accelerated losses on pre-issuance interest rate hedges, acceleration of fees and debt discount on the redeemed debt and fees. additionally, increased weighting of fixed rate debt versus the prior year as well as higher average debt levels resulted in higher interest expense. the increase in 2015 was driven by higher average levels of long-term debt and to higher interest rates, partially resulting from lower levels of debt swapped to a variable rate. interest income (recorded in other income (expense), net) was (in millions), 2016-$5; 2015-$4; 2014-$8. we currently expect that our 2017 gross interest expense will be approximately $250 to $260 million.
(dollars in millions)                                                                       change vs.prior year

the 2016 effective income tax rate benefited from excess tax benefits from share-based compensation totaling $36 million. the 2015 and 2014 effective income tax rates benefited from the mark-to-market loss recorded for our pension plans. refer to note 13 within notes to consolidated financial statements for further information. fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could impact the expected effective income tax rate as it is dependent upon u.s. dollar earnings of foreign subsidiaries doing business in various countries with differing statutory tax rates. additionally, the rate could be impacted if pending uncertain tax matters, including tax positions that could be affected by planning initiatives, are resolved more or less favorably than we currently expect.

liquidity and capital resources our principal source of liquidity is operating cash flows supplemented by borrowings for major acquisitions and other significant transactions. our cash-generating capability is one of our fundamental strengths and provides us with substantial financial flexibility in meeting operating and investing needs.
we have historically reported negative working capital primarily as the result of our focus to improve core working capital by reducing our levels of trade receivables and inventory while extending the timing of payment of our trade payables.  in addition, we have a substantial amount of indebtedness which results in current maturities of long-term debt and notes payable which can have a significant impact on working capital as a result of the timing of these required payments. working capital is also impacted by the use of our ongoing cash flows from operations to service our debt obligations, pay dividends, fund acquisition opportunities, and repurchase our common stock. we had negative working capital of $1.5 billion and $2.5 billion as of december 31, 2016 and january 2, 2016, respectively.
we believe that our operating cash flows, together with our credit facilities and other available debt financing, will be adequate to meet our operating, investing and financing needs in the foreseeable future. however, there can be no assurance that volatility and/or disruption in the global capital and credit markets will not impair our ability to access these markets on terms acceptable to us, or at all.
as of december 31, 2016 and january 2, 2016, we had $240 million and $231 million, respectively, of cash and cash equivalents held in international jurisdictions which will be used to fund capital and other cash requirements of international operations.
the following table sets forth a summary of our cash flows:
operating activities                                                      $1,628                   $1,691              $1,793
effect of exchange rates on cash and cash equivalents                        (64        )             (50   )              13
operating activities the principal source of our operating cash flows is net earnings, meaning cash receipts from the sale of our products, net of costs to manufacture and market our products.
our net cash provided by operating activities for 2016 totaled $1,628 million, a decrease of $63 million as compared to 2015. the decrease from the prior year is due primarily to $97 million of after-tax cash costs related to the $475 million redemption of our 7.45% u.s. dollar debentures due 2031 during the first quarter of 2016. in addition, the incremental cash benefit of the supplier financing program was approximately $160 million lower in 2016 as the program moves towards maturity. these year-over-year decreases were partly mitigated by lower cash outflows for project k and taxes. net cash provided by operating activities for 2015 amounted to $1,691 million, a decrease of $102 million compared with 2014. the decrease compared to the prior year is the result of the negative year over year impact of accounts receivable mitigated somewhat by the incremental cash flow benefit from the supplier financing initiative of approximately $210 million.
our cash conversion cycle (defined as days of inventory and trade receivables outstanding less days of trade payables outstanding, based on a trailing 12 month average) is relatively short, equating to approximately 3 days and 15 days for 2016 and 2015, respectively. core working capital in 2016 averaged 4.0% of net sales, compared to 6.2% in 2015 and 7.6% in 2014. in 2016, both our cash conversion cycle and core working capital showed improvements in days of trade payables outstanding which includes the positive impact of a supplier financing initiative. days of trade receivables and inventory on hand increased slightly from 2015 to 2016.
our total pension and postretirement benefit plan funding amounted to $33 million, $33 million and $53 million, in 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.
the pension protection act (ppa), and subsequent regulations, determines defined benefit plan minimum funding requirements in the united states. we believe that we will not be required to make any contributions under ppa requirements until 2021 or beyond. our projections concerning timing of ppa funding requirements are subject to change primarily based on general market conditions affecting trust asset performance, future discount rates based on average yields of high quality corporate bonds and our decisions regarding certain elective provisions of the ppa.
we currently project that we will make total u.s. and foreign benefit plan contributions in 2017 of approximately $42 million. actual 2017 contributions could be different from our current projections, as influenced by our decision to undertake discretionary funding of our benefit trusts versus other competing investment priorities, future changes in government requirements, trust asset performance, renewals of union contracts, or higher-than-expected health care claims cost experience.
we measure cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities reduced by expenditures for property additions. we use this non-gaap financial measure of cash flow to focus management and investors on the amount of cash available for debt repayment, dividend distributions, acquisition opportunities, and share repurchases. our cash flow metric is reconciled to the most comparable gaap measure, as follows:

investing activities our net cash used in investing activities for 2016 amounted to $893 million, a decrease of $234 million compared with 2015. in 2016, we acquired parati, a manufacturer of biscuit, powdered beverage and pasta brands in brazil for $381 million.
in 2015, we acquired, for $445 million, a 50% interest in multipro singapore pte. ltd., a leading distributor of a variety of food products in nigeria and ghana, and an option to purchase a minority interest in an affiliated food manufacturer. in addition to our joint venture investment in 2015, we also acquired mass foods and a majority interest in bisco misr.
capital spending in 2016 included investments in our supply chain infrastructure, and to support capacity requirements in certain markets and products, including pringles in europe and the united states.
net cash used in investing activities of $1,127 million in 2015 increased $554 million compared with 2014 due primarily to the 2015 acquisitions of bisco misr and mass foods described above.
cash paid for additions to properties as a percentage of net sales decreased to 3.9% in 2016 from 4.1% in 2015, and 4.0% in 2014.
in november 2016, we issued $600 million of seven-year 2.65% u.s. dollar notes and repaid our 1.875% $500 million u.s. dollar notes due 2016 at maturity.
in may 2016, we issued €600 million of eight-year 1.00% euro notes due 2024 and repaid our 4.45% fixed rate $750 million u.s. dollar notes due 2016 at maturity.
in march 2016, we issued $750 million of ten-year 3.25% u.s. dollar notes and $650 million of thirty-year 4.50% u.s. dollar notes. also in march 2016, we redeemed $475 million of our 7.45% u.s. dollar debentures due 2031.
in february 2015, we repaid our floating-rate $250 million u.s. dollar notes due 2015 at maturity and in march 2015, we issued €600 million of ten-year 1.25% euro notes due 2025.
in march 2014, we redeemed $150 million of our 4.00% u.s. dollar notes due 2020, $342 million of our 3.125% u.s. dollar notes due 2022 and $189 million of our 2.75% u.s. dollar notes due 2023. in connection with the debt redemption, we incurred $1 million of interest expense, offset by $8 million of accelerated gains on interest rate hedges previously recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income, and incurred $5 million expense, recorded in other income, expense (net), related to acceleration of fees on the redeemed debt and fees related to the tender offer.
in may 2014, we issued €500 million of seven-year 1.75% euro notes due 2021, using the proceeds for general corporate purposes, which included repayment of a portion of our commercial paper borrowings.
in may 2014, we issued cdn. $300 million of three-year 2.05% canadian dollar notes due 2017, using the proceeds, together with cash on hand, to repay our cdn. $300 million, 2.10% notes due may 2014 at maturity.
in april 2013, the board of directors approved a $1 billion share repurchase program expiring in april 2014. in february 2014, the board of directors approved a new authorization to repurchase up to $1.5 billion in shares through december 2015. in december 2015, the board of directors approved a share repurchase program authorizing us to repurchase shares of our common stock amounting to $1.5 billion beginning in 2016 through december 2017.
we paid quarterly dividends to shareholders totaling $2.04 per share in 2016, $1.98 per share in 2015, and $1.90 per share in 2014. total cash paid for dividends increased by 3.0% in both 2016 and 2015. on february 17, 2017, the board of directors declared a dividend of $.52 per common share, payable on march 15, 2017 to shareholders of record at the close of business on march 1, 2017.
in january 2017, we entered into an unsecured 364-day credit agreement to borrow, on a revolving credit basis, up to $800 million at any time outstanding.  the new credit facility contains customary covenants and warranties, including specified restrictions on indebtedness, liens and a specified interest expense coverage ratio.  if an event of default occurs, then, to the extent permitted, the administrative agent may terminate the commitments under the
credit facility, accelerate any outstanding loans under the agreement, and demand the deposit of cash collateral equal to the lender's letter of credit exposure plus interest.  there are no borrowings outstanding under the new credit facility.
our long-term debt agreements contain customary covenants that limit kellogg company and some of its subsidiaries from incurring certain liens or from entering into certain sale and lease-back transactions. some agreements also contain change in control provisions. however, they do not contain acceleration of maturity clauses that are dependent on credit ratings. a change in our credit ratings could limit our access to the u.s. short-term debt market and/or increase the cost of refinancing long-term debt in the future. however, even under these circumstances, we would continue to have access to our five-year credit agreement, which expires in february 2019. this source of liquidity is unused and available on an unsecured basis, although we do not currently plan to use it.
we monitor the financial strength of our third-party financial institutions, including those that hold our cash and cash equivalents as well as those who serve as counterparties to our credit facilities, our derivative financial instruments, and other arrangements.
we are in compliance with all covenants as of december 31, 2016. we continue to believe that we will be able to meet our interest and principal repayment obligations and maintain our debt covenants for the foreseeable future, while still meeting our operational needs, including the pursuit of selected bolt-on acquisitions. this will be accomplished through our strong cash flow, our short-term borrowings, and our maintenance of credit facilities on a global basis.
during the first half of 2016, we executed a discrete customer program to extend customer payment terms.  in order to mitigate the net working capital impact of the extended terms, we entered into an agreement to sell, on a revolving basis, certain trade accounts receivable balances to third party financial institutions. transfers under this agreement are accounted for as sales of receivables resulting in the receivables being de-recognized from our consolidated balance sheet.  the agreement provides for the continuing sale of certain receivables on a revolving basis until terminated by either party; however the maximum funding from receivables that may be sold at any time is currently $700 million, but may be increased as additional financial institutions are added to the agreement.  during the year ended december 31, 2016, approximately $1.5 billion of accounts receivable have been sold via this arrangement. accounts receivable sold of $562 million remained outstanding under this arrangement as of december 31, 2016.
in addition to the discrete customer program above, during 2016, we established an accounts receivable securitization program for certain customers which allows for extended customer payment terms.  in order to mitigate the net working capital impact of the extended terms, we entered into agreements with financial institutions to sell these receivables resulting in the receivables being de-recognized from our consolidated balance sheet.  the maximum funding from receivables that may be sold at any time is currently $600 million, but may be increased as additional financial institutions are added to the agreement.  during the year ended december 31, 2016, $839 million of accounts receivable have been sold through this program. as of december 31, 2016, approximately $292 million of accounts receivable sold under the securitization program remained outstanding, for which we received cash of approximately $255 million and a deferred purchase price asset of approximately $37 million.

off-balance sheet arrangements and contractual obligations off-balance sheet arrangements at january 2, 2016 we did not have any material off-balance sheet arrangements. refer to note 2 within notes to consolidated financial statements for information on our accounts receivable securitization and factoring programs.

(a)   includes interest payments on our long-term debt and payments on our interest rate swaps. interest calculated on our variable rate debt was forecasted using the libor forward rate curve as of december 31, 2016.
(b)   the total expected cash payments on our capital leases include interest expense totaling less than $1 million over the periods presented above.
(c)   operating leases represent the minimum rental commitments under non-cancelable operating leases.
(d)   purchase obligations consist primarily of fixed commitments for raw materials to be utilized in the normal course of business and for marketing, advertising and other services. the amounts presented in the table do not include items already recorded in accounts payable or other current liabilities at year-end 2016, nor does the table reflect cash flows we are likely to incur based on our plans, but are not obligated to incur. therefore, it should be noted that the exclusion of these items from the table could be a limitation in assessing our total future cash flows under contracts.
(e)   as of december 31, 2016, our total liability for uncertain tax positions was $63 million, of which $16 million is expected to be paid in the next twelve months. we are not able to reasonably estimate the timing of future cash flows related to the remaining $47 million.
(f)   other long-term obligations are those associated with noncurrent liabilities recorded within the consolidated balance sheet at year-end 2016 and consist principally of projected commitments under deferred compensation arrangements, multiemployer plans, and supplemental employee retirement benefits. the table also includes our current estimate of minimum contributions to defined benefit pension and postretirement benefit plans through 2022 as follows: 2017-$42; 2018-$32; 2019-$38; 2020-$75; 2021-$179; 2022-$198.
critical accounting estimates promotional expenditures our promotional activities are conducted either through the retail trade or directly with consumers and include activities such as in-store displays and events, feature price discounts, consumer coupons, contests and loyalty programs. the costs of these activities are generally recognized at the time the related revenue is recorded, which normally precedes the actual cash expenditure. the recognition of these costs therefore requires management judgment regarding the volume of promotional offers that will be redeemed by either the retail trade or consumer. these estimates are made using various techniques including historical data on performance of similar promotional programs. differences between estimated expense and actual redemptions are normally insignificant and recognized as a change in management estimate in a subsequent period. on a full-year basis, these subsequent period adjustments represent approximately 0.4% of our company's net sales. however, our company's total promotional expenditures (including amounts classified as a revenue reduction) are significant, so it is likely our results would be materially different if different assumptions or conditions were to prevail.
property long-lived assets such as property, plant and equipment are tested for impairment when conditions indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. management evaluates several conditions, including, but not limited to, the following: a significant decrease in the market price of an asset or an asset group; a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which a long-lived asset is being used, including an extended period of idleness; and a current expectation that, more likely than not, a long-lived asset or asset group will be sold or otherwise disposed of significantly before the end of its previously estimated useful life. for assets to be held and used, we project the expected future undiscounted cash flows generated by the long-lived asset or asset group over the remaining useful life of the primary asset. if the cash flow analysis yields an amount less than the carrying amount we determine the fair value of the asset or asset group by using comparable market data. there are inherent uncertainties associated with the judgments and estimates we use in these analyses.
at december 31, 2016, we have property, plant and equipment of $3.6 billion, net of accumulated depreciation, on our balance sheet. included in this amount are approximately $36 million of idle assets.
goodwill and other intangible assets we perform an impairment evaluation of goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives at least annually during the fourth quarter of each year in conjunction with our annual budgeting process.
goodwill impairment testing first requires a comparison between the carrying value and fair value of a reporting unit with associated goodwill. carrying value is based on the assets and liabilities associated with the operations of that reporting unit, which often requires allocation of shared or corporate items among reporting units. for the 2016 goodwill impairment test, the fair value of the reporting units was estimated based on market multiples. our approach employs market multiples based on earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (ebitda) and earnings for companies comparable to our reporting units. in the event the fair value determined using the market multiples approach is close to the carrying value, we may also supplement our fair value determination using discounted cash flows. management believes the assumptions used for the impairment test are consistent with those utilized by a market participant performing similar valuations for our reporting units.
similarly, impairment testing of indefinite-lived intangible assets requires a comparison of carrying value to fair value of that particular asset. fair values of non-goodwill intangible assets are based primarily on projections of future cash flows to be generated from that asset. for instance, cash flows related to a particular trademark would be based on a projected royalty stream attributable to branded product sales discounted at rates consistent with rates used by market participants. these estimates are made using various inputs including historical data, current and anticipated market conditions, management plans, and market comparables.
we also evaluate the useful life over which a non-goodwill intangible asset with a finite life is expected to contribute directly or indirectly to our cash flows. reaching a determination on useful life requires significant judgments and assumptions regarding the future effects of obsolescence, demand, competition, other economic factors (such as the stability of the industry, known technological advances, legislative action that results in an uncertain or changing regulatory environment, and expected changes in distribution channels), the level of required maintenance expenditures, and the expected lives of other related groups of assets.
at december 31, 2016, goodwill and other intangible assets amounted to $7.5 billion, consisting primarily of goodwill and brands associated with the 2001 acquisition of keebler foods company and the 2012 acquisition of pringles. within this total, approximately $2.3 billion of non-goodwill intangible assets were classified as indefinite-lived, comprised principally of keebler and pringles trademarks. the majority of these intangible assets are recorded in our u.s. snacks reporting unit. we currently believe that the fair value of our goodwill and other intangible assets exceeds their carrying value and that those intangibles so classified will contribute indefinitely to our cash flows. the percentage of excess fair value over carrying value of the u.s. snacks reporting unit was approximately 41% and 43% in 2016 and 2015, respectively. however, if we had used materially different assumptions, which we do not believe are reasonably possible, regarding the future performance of our business or a different market multiple in the valuation, this could have resulted in significant impairment losses.
retirement benefits our company sponsors a number of u.s. and foreign defined benefit employee pension plans and also provides retiree health care and other welfare benefits in the united states and canada. plan funding strategies are influenced by tax regulations and asset return performance. a substantial majority of plan assets are invested in a globally diversified portfolio of equity securities with smaller holdings of debt securities and other investments. we recognize the cost of benefits provided during retirement over the employees' active working life to determine the obligations and expense related to our retiree benefit plans. inherent in this concept is the requirement to use various actuarial assumptions to predict and measure costs and obligations many years prior to the settlement date. major actuarial assumptions that require significant management judgment and have a material impact on the measurement of our consolidated benefits expense and accumulated obligation include the long-term rates of return on plan assets, the health care cost trend rates, the mortality table and improvement scale, and the interest rates used to discount the obligations for our major plans, which cover employees in the united states, united kingdom and canada.
our expense recognition policy for pension and nonpension postretirement benefits is to immediately recognize actuarial gains and losses in our operating results in the year in which they occur. actuarial gains and losses are recognized annually as of our measurement date, which is our fiscal year-end, or when remeasurement is otherwise required under generally accepted accounting principles.
additionally, for purposes of calculating the expected return on plan assets related to pension and nonpension postretirement benefits we use the fair value of plan assets.
to conduct our annual review of the long-term rate of return on plan assets, we model expected returns over a 20-year investment horizon with respect to the specific investment mix of each of our major plans. the return assumptions used reflect a combination of rigorous historical performance analysis and forward-looking views of the financial markets including consideration of current yields on long-term bonds, price-earnings ratios of the major stock market indices, and long-term inflation. our u.s. plan model, corresponding to approximately 71% of our trust assets globally, currently incorporates a long-term inflation assumption of 2.5% and an active management premium of 1% (net of fees) validated by historical analysis and future return expectations. although we review our expected long-term rates of return annually, our benefit trust investment performance for one particular year does not, by itself, significantly influence our evaluation. our expected rates of return have generally not been revised, provided these rates continue to fall within a "more likely than not" corridor of between the 25th and 75th percentile of expected long-term returns, as determined by our modeling process. our assumed rate of return for u.s. plans in 2016 of 8.5% equates to approximately the 62nd percentile expectation of our model. similar methods are used for various foreign plans with invested assets, reflecting local economic conditions. foreign trust investments represent approximately 29% of our global benefit plan assets.
based on consolidated benefit plan assets at december 31, 2016, a 100 basis point increase or decrease in the assumed rate of return would correspondingly increase or decrease 2016 benefits expense by approximately $54 million. for each of the three fiscal years, our actual return on plan assets exceeded (was less than) the recognized assumed return by the following amounts (in millions): 2016-$84; 2015-$(666); 2014-$(41).
to conduct our annual review of health care cost trend rates, we model our actual claims cost data over a five-year historical period, including an analysis of pre-65 versus post-65 age groups and other important demographic components in our covered retiree population. this data is adjusted to eliminate the impact of plan changes and other factors that would tend to distort the underlying cost inflation trends. our initial health care cost trend rate is reviewed annually and adjusted as necessary to remain consistent with recent historical experience and our expectations regarding short-term future trends. in comparison to our actual five-year compound annual claims cost growth rate of approximately 4.61%, our initial trend rate for 2017 of 4.75% reflects the expected future impact of faster-growing claims experience for certain demographic groups within our total employee population. our initial rate is trended downward by 0.25% per year, until the ultimate trend rate of 4.5% is reached. the ultimate trend rate is adjusted annually, as necessary, to approximate the current economic view on the rate of long-term inflation plus an appropriate health care cost premium. based on consolidated obligations at december 31, 2016, a 100 basis point increase in the assumed health care cost trend rates would increase 2017 benefits expense by approximately $7 million and generate an immediate loss recognition of $111 million. a one percent increase in 2017 health care claims cost over that projected from the assumed trend rate would result in an experience loss of approximately $7 million and would increase 2017 expense by $0.2 million. any arising health care claims cost-related experience gain or loss is recognized in the year in which they occur. the experience loss arising from recognition of 2016 claims experience was approximately $5 million.
assumed mortality rates of plan participants are a critical estimate in measuring the expected payments a participant will receive over their lifetime and the amount of expense we recognize. at the end of 2014, we revised our mortality assumption after considering the society of actuaries' (soa) updated mortality tables and improvement scale, as well as other mortality information available from the social security administration to develop assumptions aligned with our expectation of future improvement rates. in determining the appropriate mortality assumptions as of december 31, 2016, we considered the soa's 2016 updated improvement scale. the soa's 2016 scale incorporates changes consistent with our view of future mortality improvements established in 2014. therefore, we adopted the 2016 soa improvement scale. this change to the mortality assumption decreased the year-end pension and other postretirement benefit obligations by $39 million and $10 million, respectively.
to conduct our annual review of discount rates, we selected the discount rate based on a cash-flow matching analysis using willis towers watson's proprietary rate:link tool and projections of the future benefit payments constituting the projected benefit obligation for the plans. rate:link establishes the uniform discount rate that produces the same present value of the estimated future benefit payments, as is generated by discounting each year's benefit payments by a spot rate applicable to that year. the spot rates used in this process are derived from a yield curve created from yields on the 40th to 90th percentile of u.s. high quality bonds. a similar methodology is applied in canada and europe, except the smaller bond markets imply that yields between the 10th and 90th percentiles are preferable. we use a december 31 measurement date for our defined benefit plans. accordingly, we select yield curves to measure our benefit obligations that are consistent with market indices during december of each year.
based on consolidated obligations at december 31, 2016, a 25 basis point decline in the yield curve used for benefit plan measurement purposes would decrease 2017 benefits expense by approximately $3 million and would result in an immediate loss recognition of $230 million. all obligation-related actuarial gains and losses are recognized immediately in the year in which they occur.
despite the previously-described rigorous policies for selecting major actuarial assumptions, we periodically experience material actuarial losses due to differences between assumed and actual experience and due to changing economic conditions. during 2016, we recognized a net actuarial loss of approximately $307 million compared to a net actuarial loss of approximately $418 million in 2015. of the total net loss recognized in 2016, approximately $393 million was related to assumption changes, primarily unfavorable changes in the discount rate which were partially offset by the change in mortality assumptions. the loss was offset by an $84 million gain from better than expected asset returns. of the $418 million net loss recognized in 2015, approximately $(245)million was primarily related to favorable changes in the discount rate and other assumptions, $666 million was related to asset returns less than expected, and $(3) million was related to a discrete benefit resulting from certain events affecting our benefit programs.
during 2016, we made contributions in the amount of $18 million to kellogg's global tax-qualified pension programs. this amount was mostly non-discretionary. additionally we contributed $15 million to our retiree medical programs.
income taxes our consolidated effective income tax rate is influenced by tax planning opportunities available to us in the various jurisdictions in which we operate. the calculation of our income tax provision and deferred income tax assets and liabilities is complex and requires the use of estimates and judgment. income taxes are provided on the portion of foreign earnings that is expected to be remitted to and taxable in the united states.
as of december 31, 2016 substantially all foreign earnings were considered permanently invested.  accumulated foreign earnings of approximately $1.9 billion, primarily in europe, were considered indefinitely reinvested.  due to the varying tax laws around the world and fluctuation in foreign exchange rates, it is not practicable to determine the unrecognized deferred tax liability on these earnings because the actual tax liability, if any, would be dependent on circumstances existing when a repatriation, sale, or liquidation occurs.
we recognize tax benefits associated with uncertain tax positions when, in our judgment, it is more likely than not that the positions will be sustained upon examination by a taxing authority. for tax positions that meet the more likely than not recognition threshold, we initially and subsequently measure the tax benefits as the largest amount that we judge to have a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. our liability associated with unrecognized tax benefits is adjusted periodically due to changing circumstances, such as the progress of tax audits, new or emerging legislation and tax planning. the tax position will be derecognized when it is no longer more likely than not of being sustained. significant adjustments to our liability for unrecognized tax benefits impacting our effective tax rate are separately presented in the rate reconciliation table of note 13 within notes to consolidated financial statements.
management monitors the company's ability to utilize certain future tax deductions, operating losses and tax credit carryforwards, prior to expiration. changes resulting from management's assessment will result in impacts to deferred tax assets and the corresponding impacts on the effective income tax rate. valuation allowances were recorded to reduce deferred tax assets to an amount that will, more likely than not, be realized in the future.
accounting standards to be adopted in future periods simplifying the test for goodwill impairment. in january 2017, the financial accounting standards board (fasb) issued an asu to simplify how an entity is required to test goodwill for impairment by eliminating step 2 from the goodwill impairment test. step 2 measures a goodwill impairment loss by comparing the implied fair value of a reporting unit's goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill. the asu is effective for annual or interim goodwill impairment tests in fiscal years beginning after december 15, 2019. early adoption is permitted for interim or annual goodwill impairment tests performed on testing dates after january 1, 2017. the amendments in this asu should be applied on a prospective basis. we are currently assessing the impact and timing of adoption of this asu.
intra-entity transfers of assets other than inventory. in october 2016, the fasb, as part of their simplification initiative, issued an asu to improve the accounting for income tax consequences of intra-entity transfers of assets other than inventory. current generally accepted accounting principles (gaap) prohibit recognition of current and deferred income taxes for intra-entity asset transfers until the asset has been sold to an outside party, which is an
exception to the principle of comprehensive recognition of current and deferred income taxes in gaap. the amendments in the asu eliminate the exception, such that entities should recognize the income tax consequences of an intra-entity transfer of an asset other than inventory when the transfer occurs. the asu is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after december 15, 2017. early adoption is permitted, as of the beginning of an annual reporting period for which financial statements have not been issued or made available for issuance. that is, early adoption should be the first interim period if an entity issues interim financial statements. the amendments in this asu should be applied on a modified retrospective basis through a cumulative-effect adjustment directly to retained earnings as of the period of adoption.  we will adopt the updated standard in the first quarter of 2017. as a result of a 2017 transaction, we anticipate a $38 million income tax benefit in the first quarter of 2017.
classification of certain cash receipts and payments. in august 2016, the fasb issued an asu to provide cash flow statement classification guidance for certain cash receipts and payments including (a) debt prepayment or extinguishment costs; (b) contingent consideration payments made after a business combination; (c) insurance settlement proceeds; (d) distributions from equity method investees; (e) beneficial interests in securitization transactions and (f) application of the predominance principle for cash receipts and payments with aspects of more than one class of cash flows.  the asu is  effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after december 15, 2017. early adoption is permitted, including adoption in an interim period, in which case adjustments should be reflected as of the beginning of the fiscal year that includes the interim period.  the amendments in this asu should be applied retrospectively.  we are currently assessing the impact and timing of adoption of the asu.
leases. in february 2016, the fasb issued an asu which will require the recognition of lease assets and lease liabilities by lessees for all leases with terms greater than 12 months. the distinction between finance leases and operating leases will remain, with similar classification criteria as current gaap to distinguish between capital and operating leases. the principal difference from current guidance is that the lease assets and lease liabilities arising from operating leases will be recognized on the consolidated balance sheet. lessor accounting remains substantially similar to current gaap. the asu is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after december 15, 2018. early adoption is permitted. we are currently evaluating the impact that implementing this asu will have on our financial statements and disclosures, as well as timing of implementation.
recognition and measurement of financial assets and liabilities. in january 2016, the fasb issued an asu which primarily affects the accounting for equity investments, financial liabilities under the fair value option, and the presentation and disclosure requirements for financial instruments. the asu is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after december 15, 2017. early adoption can be elected for all financial statements of fiscal years and interim periods that have not yet been issued or that have not yet been made available for issuance. entities should apply the update by means of a cumulative-effect adjustment to the balance sheet as of the beginning of the fiscal year of adoption. we will adopt the updated standard in the first quarter of 2018 and do not expect the adoption of this guidance to have a significant impact on our financial statements.
revenue from contracts with customers. in may 2014, the fasb issued an asu which provides guidance for accounting for revenue from contracts with customers. the core principle of this asu is that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration the entity expects to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services. to achieve that core principle, an entity would be required to apply the following five steps: 1) identify the contract(s) with a customer; 2) identify the performance obligations in the contract; 3) determine the transaction price; 4) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract and 5) recognize revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies a performance obligation. when the asu was originally issued it was effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after december 15, 2016, and early adoption was not permitted. on july 9, 2015, the fasb decided to delay the effective date of the new revenue standard by one year. the updated standard will be effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after december 15, 2017. entities will be permitted to adopt the new revenue standard early, but not before the original effective date.  entities will have the option to apply the final standard retrospectively or use a modified retrospective method, recognizing the cumulative effect of the asu in retained earnings at the date of initial application. an entity will not restate prior periods if it uses the modified retrospective method, but will be required to disclose the amount by which each financial statement line item is affected in the current reporting period by the application of the asu as compared to the guidance in effect prior to the change, as well as reasons for significant changes. we will adopt the guidance in the first quarter of 2018, using a modified retrospective transition method, and the adoption is not expected to have a significant impact on our historical financial statements or future financial position or results of operations.
future outlook we provide guidance on a currency-neutral comparable basis. on this basis, we expect net sales to be down approximately 2% in 2017. slightly more than one point of this decline is associated with price reductions and an expected volume decline associated with our exit from direct store delivery (dsd) in u.s. snacks. this initiative could create an unusual degree of variability in our net sales in 2017. the remainder of the business is expected to be flat to down 1%. we expect a slow start to the year, as a result of lower-than-anticipated consumption performance, trade-inventory reductions, challenges in our u.k. business, and price-elasticity as we execute revenue growth management initiatives across our business.
from a profitability standpoint, we expect currency-neutral comparable gross margin to increase as a result of price realization efforts and productivity initiatives, though partially offset by the impact of the change in our u.s. snacks go-to-market model. finally, we expect currency-neutral comparable operating profit growth in the range of 7 to 9 percent and currency-neutral comparable eps to increase in the range of 8 to 10 percent.
we expect that full-year operating cash flow will be between $1.1 and $1.2 billion, including roughly $300 million in expenditures related to project k as well as capital spending of 3 to 4 percent of net sales.
non-gaap financial measures forward-looking guidance for comparable net sales, comparable operating profit, comparable operating profit margin, comparable net income attributable to kellogg, comparable diluted eps, and cash flow is included in this filing. guidance for net sales and operating profit excludes the impact of mark-to-market adjustments, integration costs, costs related to project k, acquisitions, dispositions, foreign-currency translation, remeasurement of the venezuelan business, and other items that could affect comparability. guidance for earnings per share excludes the impact of mark-to-market adjustments, integration costs, costs related to project k, foreign-currency translation, remeasurement of the venezuelan business, and other items that could affect comparability; it includes the impact of acquisitions and dispositions. we have provided these non-gaap measures for future guidance for the same reasons that were outlined above for historical non-gaap measures.
we are unable to reasonably estimate the potential full-year financial impact of mark-to-market adjustments, venezuela remeasurement, acquisitions or dispositions because these impacts are dependent on future changes in market conditions (interest rates, return on assets, and commodity prices) or future decisions to be made by our management team and board of directors. as a result, these items are not included in the guidance provided. therefore, we are unable to provide a full reconciliation of these non-gaap measures used in our guidance without unreasonable effort as certain information necessary to calculate such measure on a gaap basis is unavailable, dependent on future events outside of our control and cannot be predicted without unreasonable efforts by the company.
see the table below that outlines the projected impact of certain other items that are excluded from non-gaap guidance:

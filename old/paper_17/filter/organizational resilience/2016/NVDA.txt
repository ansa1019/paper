item 1a. risk factors in evaluating nvidia and our business, the following factors should be considered in addition to the other information in this annual report on form 10-k. before you buy our common stock, you should know that making such an investment involves risks including, but not limited to, the risks described below. any one of the following risks could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations, which could cause our stock price to decline. additional risks, trends and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also harm our business.
risks related to our business, industry and partners if we fail to meet the evolving needs of our markets, identify new products, services or technologies, or successfully compete in our target markets, our revenue and financial results will be adversely impacted.
nvidia-branded solutions and services are visual computing and accelerated computing platforms that address four large markets: gaming, professional visualization, datacenter, and automotive. our success depends to a significant extent on our ability to meet the evolving needs of these markets and to enhance our existing products, services and technologies. in addition, our success depends on our ability to identify emerging industry trends and to develop new products, services and technologies. our existing markets and products and new markets and products may require a considerable investment of technical, financial, compliance, sales and marketing resources. we are currently devoting significant resources to the development of technologies and business offerings in markets where our operating history is less extensive, such as the automotive market.
we cannot assure you that our strategic direction will result in innovative products and technologies that provide value to our customers and partners. if we fail to anticipate the changing needs of our target markets and emerging technology trends, or adapt that strategy as market conditions evolve, in a timely manner to exploit potential market opportunities our business will be harmed. in addition, if demand for products and services from these growth markets is below our expectations, if we fail to achieve consumer or market acceptance of them or if we are not able to develop these products and services in a cost effective or efficient manner, we may not realize benefits from our strategy.
our target markets remain extremely competitive, and we expect competition to intensify as current competitors expand their product and/or service offerings, industry standards continue to evolve and new competitors enter these markets. if we are unable to successfully compete in our target markets, including in significant international markets such as china, demand for our products, services and technologies could decrease which would cause our revenue to decline and our financial results to suffer. our competitors' products, services and technologies may be less costly, or may offer superior functionality or different features, than ours. in addition, many of our competitors operate and maintain their own fabrication facilities and have longer operating histories, greater name recognition, larger customer bases, and greater financial, sales, marketing and distribution resources than we do. these competitors may be able to more effectively identify and capitalize upon opportunities in new markets and end user customer trends, quickly transition their semiconductor products to increasingly smaller line width geometries and obtain sufficient foundry capacity and packaging materials, which could harm our business. if we are unable to successfully compete in our target markets or introduce new offerings in light of the competitive environment, our results of operations could suffer.
if our products fail to achieve expected manufacturing yields, our financial results could be adversely impacted.
manufacturing yields for our products are a function of product design, which is developed largely by us, and process technology, which typically is proprietary to the foundry. low yields may result from either product design or process technology failure. we do not know whether a yield problem will exist until our design is actually manufactured by the foundry. as a result, yield problems may not be identified until well into the manufacturing process and require us and the foundry to cooperate to resolve the problem. because of our potentially limited access to wafer foundry capacity, any decrease in manufacturing yields could result in higher manufacturing costs and require us to allocate our available product supply among our customers and partners. lower than expected yields could harm customer or partner relationships and our financial results.
system security and data protection breaches, as well as cyber-attacks, could disrupt our operations, reduce our expected revenue and increase our expenses, which could adversely affect our stock price and damage our reputation.
security breaches, computer malware and cyber-attacks have become more prevalent and sophisticated in recent years. these attacks have occurred on our systems in the past and are expected to occur in the future. experienced computer programmers, hackers and employees may be able to penetrate our security controls and misappropriate or compromise our confidential information, or that of our employees or third parties. these attacks may create system disruptions or cause shutdowns. these hackers may also develop and deploy viruses, worms and other malicious software programs that attack or otherwise exploit security vulnerabilities in our products, including consumer and automotive products, where we utilize over-the-air updates to improve functionality over time. for portions of our it infrastructure, including business management and communication software products, we rely on products and services provided by third parties. these providers may also experience breaches and attacks to their products which may impact our systems. data security breaches may also result from non-technical means, such as actions by an employee with access to our systems.
actual or perceived breaches of our security measures or the accidental loss, inadvertent disclosure or unapproved dissemination of proprietary information or sensitive or confidential data about us, our partners, our customers or third parties could expose the parties affected to a risk of loss, or misuse of this information, resulting in litigation and potential liability, damage to our brand and reputation or other harm to our business. our efforts to prevent and overcome these challenges could increase our expenses and may not be successful. we may experience interruptions, delays, cessation of service and loss of existing or potential customers. such disruptions could adversely impact our ability to fulfill orders and interrupt other critical functions. delayed sales, lower margins or lost customers as a result of these disruptions could adversely affect our financial results, stock price and reputation.
if our products contain significant defects, we could incur significant expenses to remediate such defects, our reputation could be damaged and we could lose market share.
our products are complex and may contain defects or experience failures or unsatisfactory performance due to any number of issues in design, fabrication, packaging, materials and/or use within a system. our products are used by a variety of industries, including the automotive industry. failure of our products to perform to specifications, or other product defects, could lead to substantial damage to the products we sell directly to customers, the end product in which our device has been integrated by oems, odms, aibs and tier 1 automotive suppliers, and to the user of such end product. any such defect may cause us to incur significant warranty, support and repair or replacement costs, cause us to lose market share, and divert the attention of our engineering personnel from our product development efforts to find and correct the issue. in addition, an error or defect in new products or releases or related software drivers after commencement of commercial shipments could result in failure to achieve market acceptance or loss of design wins and harm our relationships with customers and partners and consumers' perceptions of our brand. also, we may be required to reimburse our customers, partners or consumers, including costs to repair or replace products in the field. a product recall, particularly an automotive recall, or a significant number of product returns could be expensive, damage our reputation, result in the shifting of business to our competitors and result in litigation against us such as product liability suits. if a product liability claim is brought against us, the cost of defending the claim could be significant and would divert the efforts of our technical and management personnel, and harm our business. further, our business liability insurance may be inadequate or future coverage may be unavailable on acceptable terms, which could adversely impact our financial results.
if we do not replace our intel licensing revenues, our financial results may be adversely affected.
in january 2011, we entered into a patent cross licensing agreement under which intel agreed to pay us an aggregate of $1.50 billion over six years. the final $200 million payment under this agreement was received in january 2016. we will be recognizing revenue under this agreement through the first quarter of fiscal year 2018. if we do not enter into new licensing agreements or if the intel agreement is not offset by other growth in income our financial results may be adversely affected.
we depend on third parties and their technology to manufacture, assemble, test and/or package our products, which reduces our control over product quantity and quality, development, enhancement and product delivery schedule and could harm our business.
we do not manufacture the silicon wafers used for our gpus and tegra processors and do not own or operate a wafer fabrication facility. instead, we are dependent on industry-leading foundries, such as taiwan semiconductor manufacturing company limited and samsung electronics co. ltd., to manufacture our semiconductor wafers using their fabrication equipment and techniques. similarly, we do not assemble, test or package our products, but instead rely on independent subcontractors, such as advanced semiconductor engineering, inc., byd auto co., ltd., hon hai precision industry co., ltd., jsi logistics, ltd., king yuan electronics co. and siliconware precision industries co. ltd. we do not have long-term commitment contracts with these foundries or subcontractors. as a result, we face several significant risks which could have an adverse effect on our ability to meet customer demand and/or negatively impact our business operations, gross margin, revenue and/or financial results, including:
•   a lack of guaranteed supply of wafers and other components and potential higher wafer and component prices due to supply constraints;
•   a failure by our foundries to procure raw materials or to provide or allocate adequate manufacturing or test capacity for our products;
•   a failure to develop, obtain or successfully implement high quality, leading-edge process technologies, including transitions to smaller geometry process technologies such as 16nm finfet, and memory designs such as cowos, needed to manufacture our products profitably or on a timely basis;
•   loss of a supplier and additional expense and/or production delays as a result of qualifying a new foundry or subcontractor and commencing volume production or testing in the event of a loss of or a decision to add or change a supplier;
•   a lack of direct control over delivery schedules or product quantity and quality; and
•   delays in product shipments, shortages, a decrease in product quality and/or higher expenses in the event our subcontractors or foundries prioritize our competitors' orders over our orders or otherwise.
we also rely on third-party software development tools to assist us in the design, simulation and verification of new products or product enhancements, and to bring such new products and enhancements to market in a timely manner. in the past, we have experienced delays in the introduction of products and enhancements as a result of the inability of then available software development tools to fully simulate the complex features and functionalities of our products. the design requirements necessary to meet consumer demands for more features and greater functionality from our products may exceed the capabilities of available software development tools. if we miss design cycles or lose design wins due to the unavailability of such software development tools, we could lose market share and our revenues could decline.
if we fail to achieve design wins for our products, our business will be harmed.
for our products that we do not sell directly to consumers, achieving design wins is an important success factor. our oem, odm, and aib and motherboard manufacturers' customers typically introduce new system configurations as often as twice per year, typically based on spring and fall design cycles or in connection with trade shows. if oems, odms, and aib and motherboard manufacturers do not include our products in their systems, they will typically not use our products in their systems until at least the next design configuration. in order to achieve design wins, we must:
•anticipate the features and functionality that customers and consumers will demand;
•   incorporate those features and functionalities into products that meet the exacting design requirements of our customers; and
•price our products competitively.
unanticipated changes in industry standards could render our products incompatible with products developed by major hardware manufacturers and software developers. further, if our products are not in compliance with prevailing industry standards, our customers may not incorporate our products into their design strategies.
business disruptions could harm our business, lead to a decline in revenues and increase our costs.
our worldwide operations could be disrupted by earthquakes, telecommunications failures, power or water shortages, outages at cloud service providers, tsunamis, floods, hurricanes, typhoons, fires, extreme weather conditions, medical epidemics or pandemics and other natural or man-made disasters, catastrophic events or climate change. the occurrence of any of these disruptions could harm our business and result in significant losses, a decline in revenue and an increase in our costs and expenses. any of these business disruptions could require substantial expenditures and recovery time in order to fully resume operations. our corporate headquarters, and a portion of our research and development activities, are located in california, and other critical business operations and some of our suppliers are located in asia, near major earthquake faults known for seismic activity. in addition, a majority of our principal it datacenters are located in california, making our operations vulnerable to natural disasters or other business disruptions occurring in this geographical area. the manufacture of product components, the final assembly of our products and other critical operations are concentrated in certain geographic locations, including taiwan, china and korea. our operations could be harmed if manufacturing, logistics or other operations in these locations are disrupted for any reason, including natural disasters, high heat events or water shortages, information technology system failures, military actions or economic, business, labor, environmental, public health, regulatory or political issues. the ultimate impact on us, our third-party foundries and other suppliers and our general infrastructure of being located near major earthquake faults and being consolidated in certain geographical areas is unknown. in the event of a major earthquake or other disaster or catastrophic event, our revenue could decline and our business may be harmed.
we receive a significant amount of our revenue from a limited number of customers within our partner network and our revenue could be adversely affected if we lose any of these customers.
we receive a significant amount of our revenue from a limited number of customers within our partner network. with several of these partners, we are selling multiple target market platforms through their channels. as a result, revenue from significant customers, those representing 10% or more of total revenue, was 12%, 11%, and 11% of our total revenue from one customer in fiscal years 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively. our operating results in the foreseeable future will continue to depend on sales within our partner network, as well as the ability of these partners to sell products that incorporate our gpus and tegra processors. in the future, these partners may decide to purchase fewer products than they did in the past, not to incorporate our products into their ecosystem, or to alter their purchasing patterns in some other way, particularly because:
•   most of our sales are made on a purchase order basis, which permits our customers to cancel, change or delay product purchase commitments with little or no notice to us and without penalty;
•   our customers may purchase products from our competitors; or
•   our partners may discontinue sales or lose market share in the markets for which they purchase our products.
the loss of any of our large customers or a significant reduction in purchases by them would likely harm our financial condition and results of operations, and any difficulties in collecting accounts receivable could harm our operating results and financial condition.
we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of certain of our customers to make required payments and obtain credit insurance over the purchasing credit extended to these customers. in the future, we may have to record additional provisions or write-offs and/or defer revenue on certain sales transactions, which could negatively impact our financial results, and we may not be able to acquire credit insurance on the credit we extend to these customers or in amounts that we deem sufficient.
our gross margin depends on a number of factors and changes in any of these factors could adversely affect our gross margin.
our gross margin for any period depends on a number of factors, including the mix of our products sold, average selling prices, introduction of new products and services, process node transitions, product transitions, sales discounts, pricing actions by our competitors, the cost of product components and the yield of wafers produced by the foundries that manufacture our products. we are focused on improving our gross margin and if we are not able to control or estimate the impact of the above factors or other factors we do not foresee, our gross margins may be negatively impacted.
if we fail to estimate customer demand properly, our financial results could be harmed.
we manufacture our gpus and tegra processors based on estimates of customer demand. in order to have shorter shipment lead times and quicker delivery schedules for our customers, we may build inventories for anticipated periods of growth which do not occur, or may build inventory anticipating demand for a product that does not materialize. in estimating demand, we make multiple assumptions, any of which may prove to be incorrect. situations that may result in excess or obsolete inventory include:
•changes in business and economic conditions, including downturns in our target markets and/or overall economy;
•changes in consumer confidence caused by changes in market conditions, including changes in the credit market;
•a higher incidence of inventory obsolescence because of rapidly changing technology or customer requirements;
•our introduction of new products resulting in lower demand for older products;
•increased competition, including competitive pricing actions.
in addition, the cancellation or deferral of customer purchase orders could result in our holding excess inventory, which could adversely affect our gross margins. in addition, because we often sell a substantial portion of our products in the last month of each quarter, we may not be able to reduce our inventory purchase commitments in a timely manner in response to customer cancellations or deferrals. we could be required to write-down our inventory to the lower of cost or market or write-off excess inventory, and we could experience a reduction in average selling prices if we incorrectly forecast product demand, any of which could harm our financial results.
conversely, if we underestimate our customers' demand for our products, our foundry partners may not have adequate lead-time or capacity to increase production and we may not be able to obtain sufficient inventory to fill customers' orders on a timely basis. even if we are able to increase production levels to meet customer demand, we may not be able to do so in a cost-effective or timely manner. if we fail to fulfill our customers' orders on a timely basis, or at all, our customer relationships could be damaged, we could lose revenue and market share and our reputation could be damaged.
we are subject to risks and uncertainties associated with international operations which may harm our business.
we conduct our business worldwide and we have offices in various countries outside of the united states. our semiconductor wafers are manufactured, assembled, tested and packaged by third parties located outside of the united states and other americas. we also generate a significant portion of our revenue from sales to customers outside the united states and other americas. revenue from sales to customers outside of the united states and other americas accounted for 80%, 79% and 75% of total revenue for fiscal years 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. the global nature of our business subjects us to a number of risks and uncertainties, including:
•   international economic and political conditions, such as political tensions between countries in which we do business;
•   unexpected changes in, or impositions of, legislative or regulatory requirements;
•   differing legal standards with respect to protection of intellectual property and employment practices;
•   local business and cultural factors that differ from our normal standards and practices, including business practices that we are prohibited from engaging in by the foreign corrupt practices act and other anticorruption laws and regulations;
•   financial risks such as longer payment cycles, difficulty in collecting accounts receivable and foreign exchange rate fluctuations; and
•   increased costs due to imposition of climate change regulations, such as carbon taxes, fuel or energy taxes, and pollution limits.
if sales to any of our customers outside of the united states and other americas are delayed or cancelled because of any of the above factors, our revenue may be negatively impacted.
we may not be able to realize the potential financial or strategic benefits of business acquisitions or strategic investments and we may not be able to successfully integrate acquisition targets, which could hurt our ability to grow our business, develop new products or sell our products.
we have in the past acquired and invested in, and may continue to acquire and invest in, other businesses that offer products, services and technologies that we believe will help expand or enhance our existing products and business. any of the following risks associated with past or future acquisitions or investments could impair our ability to grow our business, develop new products or sell our products, and ultimately could have a negative impact on our growth or our financial results:
•   difficulty in combining the technology, products, operations or workforce of the acquired business with our business;
•   diversion of capital and other resources, including management's attention;
•   assumption of liabilities;
•   incurring amortization expenses, impairment charges to goodwill or write-downs of acquired assets;
•   potential failure of our due diligence processes to identify significant issues with product quality, architecture and development, or legal and financial contingencies, among other things; and
•   impairment of relationships with, or loss of our or our target's, employees, vendors and customers, as a result of our acquisition or investment.
risks related to regulatory, legal, our common stock and other matters actions to adequately protect our intellectual property rights could result in substantial costs to us and our ability to compete could be harmed if we are unsuccessful in doing so or if we are prohibited from making or selling our products.
we have in the past, currently are, and may in the future become involved in lawsuits or other legal proceedings alleging patent infringement or other intellectual property rights violations by us, our employees or parties that we have agreed to indemnify for certain claims of infringement. an unfavorable ruling in any such intellectual property related litigation could include significant damages, invalidation of a patent or family of patents, indemnification of customers, payment of lost profits, or, when it has been sought, injunctive relief.
we may commence litigation or other legal proceedings in order to protect our intellectual property rights. such proceedings may increase our operating expenses, which could negatively impact our operating results. further, we could be subject to countersuits as a result of our initiation of litigation. if infringement claims are made against us or our products are found to infringe a third party's patent or intellectual property, we or one of our indemnitees may have to seek a license to the third party's patent or other intellectual property rights. however, we may not be able to obtain licenses at all or on terms acceptable to us particularly from our competitors. if we or one of our indemnitees is unable to obtain a license from a third party for technology that we use or that is used in one of our products, we could be subject to substantial liabilities or have to suspend or discontinue the manufacture and sale of one or more of our products. we may also have to make royalty or other payments, or cross license our technology. if these arrangements are not concluded on commercially reasonable terms, our business could be negatively impacted. furthermore, the indemnification of a customer or other indemnitee may increase our operating expenses which could negatively impact our operating results.
we rely primarily on a combination of patents, trademarks, trade secrets, employee and third-party nondisclosure agreements, licensing arrangements, and the laws of the countries in which we operate to protect our intellectual property in the united states and internationally. the laws of certain foreign countries may not protect our products or intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states. this makes the possibility of piracy of our technology and products more likely. we continuously assess whether and where to seek formal protection for existing and new innovations and technologies, but cannot be certain whether our applications for such protections will be approved, and, if approved, whether we will be able to enforce such protections.
our operating results have in the past fluctuated and may in the future fluctuate, and if our operating results are below the expectations of securities analysts or investors, our stock price could decline.
our operating results have in the past fluctuated and may in the future continue to fluctuate due to numerous factors. for example, our operating expenses represent a significant portion of total revenue and are largely independent of revenue in any particular period. in particular, our research and development expenses reflect multi-year programs for the development of new products and enhancements that will not result in revenue, if any, until future periods. therefore, investors should not rely on quarterly comparisons of our results of operations as an indication of our future performance.
factors that could affect our results of operations in the future include:
•   demand and market acceptance for our products and services and/or our customers' products;
•   the successful development and volume production of our next-generation products;
•   our inability to adjust spending to offset revenue shortfalls due to the multi-year development cycle for some of our products and services;
•   new product and service announcements or product and service introductions by our competitors;
•   our introduction of new products in accordance with oems' design requirements and design cycles;
•   changes in the timing of product orders due to unexpected delays in the introduction of our customers' products;
•   the level of growth or decline of the pc industry in general;
•   seasonal fluctuations associated with the pc and consumer products market;
•   contraction in automotive and consumer end-market demand due to adverse regional or worldwide economic conditions;
•   slower than expected growth of demand for new technologies;
•   fluctuations in the availability of manufacturing capacity or manufacturing yields;
•   our ability to reduce the manufacturing costs of our products;
•   competitive pressures resulting in lower than expected average selling prices;
•   product rates of return in excess of that forecasted or expected due to quality issues;
•   rescheduling or cancellation of customer orders;
•   the loss of a significant customer;
•   substantial disruption in the operations of our foundries or other third-party subcontractors, as a result of a natural disaster, equipment failure, terrorism or other causes;
•   supply constraints for and changes in the cost of the other components incorporated into our customers' products, including memory devices;
•   costs associated with the repair and replacement of defective products;
•   unexpected inventory write-downs or write-offs;
•   legal and other costs related to defending intellectual property and other types of lawsuits;
•   availability of software and technology licenses at commercially reasonable terms for the continued sale or development of new products;
•   customer bad debt write-offs;
•   changes in our effective tax rate as a result of changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, applicable tax laws or interpretations of tax laws;
•   any unanticipated costs associated with environmental liabilities;
•   unexpected costs related to our ownership of real property;
•   costs to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting;
•   changes in financial accounting standards or interpretations of existing standards; and
•   general macroeconomic events and factors affecting the overall semiconductor industry and our target markets.
any one or more of the factors discussed above could prevent us from achieving our expected future financial results. any such failure to meet our expectations or the expectations of our investors or security analysts could cause our stock price to decline or experience substantial price volatility and, as a result, investors may suffer losses.
in the past, securities class action litigation has often been brought against a company following periods of volatility in the market price of its securities. we have been in the past, and may be in the future, the target of securities litigation. such lawsuits generally result in the diversion of management's time and attention away from business operations, which could harm our business. in addition, the costs of defense and any damages resulting from litigation, a ruling against us, or a settlement of the litigation could adversely affect our cash flow and financial results.
privacy concerns relating to our products and services could damage our reputation and deter current and potential users from using our products and services.
our products and services may provide us with access to sensitive, confidential or personal data or information that is subject to privacy and security laws and regulations. concerns about our practices with regard to the collection, use, retention, security or disclosure of personal information or other privacy-related matters, even if unfounded, could damage our reputation and adversely affect our operating results.
worldwide regulatory authorities are considering various legislative proposals concerning data protection. in addition, the interpretation and application of consumer and data protection laws in the united states, europe and elsewhere are often uncertain and fluid, and may be interpreted and applied in a manner that is inconsistent with our data practices. if so, we may be ordered to change our data practices and/or be fined. complying with these changing laws could cause us to incur substantial costs, which could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations.
we are subject to risks associated with development and construction of our headquarters building under an operating lease financing arrangement.
in fiscal year 2016, we began to construct a new headquarters building in santa clara, california, which is currently targeted for completion in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2018. we may encounter unanticipated occurrences or conditions during construction that may increase the expense of the project. we may also encounter unanticipated delays in the construction of the new building and final city approval for occupancy may be delayed. we are financing this construction under an operating lease arrangement described below. delays and cost overruns during construction could result in a default under the operating lease financing arrangement which could result in liabilities and expenses and could harm our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations.
additionally, any such difficulties could result in our default under the operative agreements entered into with a syndicate of banks that are participants to the operating lease financing arrangement to finance development and construction of our headquarters. we have pledged our assets that relate to the new headquarters building in order to secure our obligations under the operating lease financing arrangement. we will need to maintain compliance with the requirements governing such agreements, including compliance with financial and other covenants, certain of which may be subject to events outside of our control. if we fail to comply with the covenants, we may be unable to obtain or utilize all or a portion of the financing contemplated by the operating lease financing arrangement. further, noncompliance with such covenants or other event of default could lead to a termination of our lease of the property, and the lenders could have the right to, among other things, foreclose on the collateral for our obligations under the operating lease financing arrangement. a loss of financing for the new headquarters building or foreclosure on the collateral could adversely affect our liquidity and business.
our indebtedness could adversely affect our financial position and prevent us from implementing our strategy or fulfilling our contractual obligations.
in september 2016, we issued $1.00 billion of 2.20% notes due september 16, 2021, or the notes due 2021, and $1.00 billion of 3.20% notes due september 16, 2026, or the notes due 2026 (collectively, the notes). in december 2013, we issued $1.50 billion of 1.00% convertible senior notes due december 1, 2018, or the convertible notes, of which $827 million in principal amount remained outstanding as of january 29, 2017. we have received additional conversion requests of $660 million in principal amount, $502 million of which have already settled, $103 million of which are expected to settle during the first quarter of fiscal year 2018, and $55 million of which are expected to settle during the second quarter of fiscal year 2018.
our indebtedness may limit our ability to use our cash flow or borrow additional funds for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and general corporate and other purposes. additionally, our obligation to make payments related to the notes or the convertible notes could impact our cash balance and limit our ability to use our cash for our capital return program and our other liquidity needs, including working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, investments and other general corporate purposes.
the warrants associated with our convertible notes, or the warrants, dilute our net income per share and the settlement or eventual exercise of the warrants would dilute the ownership interest of our existing shareholders.
when the average trading price of our common stock for a fiscal quarter exceeds the adjusted strike price of the warrants, the number of diluted weighted average shares used in our net income per share calculation increases, which dilutes our net income per share.
any issuance by us of shares upon exercise or any other settlement of the warrants may dilute the ownership interest of our existing shareholders. in december 2016, we entered into an agreement with a counterparty bank to terminate 63 million of the 75 million warrants outstanding. in consideration for the termination of these warrants, we delivered a total of 48 million shares of common stock to the counterparty bank, the amount of which was determined each day based on the daily volume-weighted average price of our common stock during an observation period beginning december 13, 2016 and ending january 31, 2017. as of january 29, 2017, 44 million of the 48 million shares of our common stock had been issued related to the terminated warrants. the remaining 4 million shares were issued in the beginning of fiscal year 2018.
an aggregate of 12 million warrants remained outstanding, or the remaining warrants, as of january 29, 2017. the remaining warrants will be deemed to be automatically exercised on certain dates between march 2019 and june 2019, unless the warrant holder notifies us otherwise.
delaware law and provisions in our certificate of incorporation, our bylaws and our agreement with microsoft corporation could delay or prevent a change in control.
our status as a delaware corporation and the anti-takeover provisions of the delaware general corporation law may discourage, delay, or prevent a change in control by prohibiting us from engaging in a business combination with an interested shareholder for a period of three years after the person becomes an interested shareholder, even if a change of control would be beneficial to our existing shareholders. in addition, our certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire a majority of our outstanding voting stock. these provisions include the following:
•the ability of our board of directors to create and issue preferred stock without prior shareholder approval;
•the prohibition of shareholder action by written consent;
•the ability of our board of directors to increase or decrease the number of directors without shareholder approval;
•a super-majority voting requirement to amend some provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws;
•the inability of our shareholders to call special meetings of shareholders; and
•the ability of our board of directors to make, amend or repeal our bylaws.
on march 5, 2000, we entered into an agreement with microsoft in which we agreed to develop and sell graphics chips and to license certain technology to microsoft and its licensees for use in the xbox. under the agreement, if an individual or corporation makes an offer to purchase shares equal to or greater than 30% of the outstanding shares of our common stock, microsoft may have first and last rights of refusal to purchase the stock. the microsoft provision and the other factors listed above could also delay or prevent a change in control of nvidia. these provisions could also discourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for shareholders to elect directors of their choosing and to cause us to take other corporate actions they desire.
item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with "item 1a. risk factors", "item 6. selected financial data", our consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto, as well as other cautionary statements and risks described elsewhere in this annual report on form 10-k, before deciding to purchase, hold or sell shares of our common stock.

revenue for fiscal year 2017 grew 38% to $6.91 billion, reflecting growth in each of our market platforms -- gaming, professional visualization, datacenter, and automotive. gpu business revenue was $5.82 billion, up 39% from a year earlier, led by growth in our geforce gpu gaming and datacenter platforms. geforce gpu gaming growth was fueled by strong adoption of our latest pascal architecture. datacenter growth reflected strong demand for deep learning training, cloud and virtualized computing, and sales of our new dgx-1 supercomputer. tegra business revenue was $824 million, up 47% from a year ago, led by growth in automotive, primarily from infotainment modules, and gaming development platforms and services.
gross margin for fiscal year 2017 was 58.8%, compared with 56.1% a year earlier, reflecting the growth of geforce gaming gpus, the growth of our gpu computing platforms for cloud, deep learning, ai, and graphics virtualization, and decreased sales volumes of lower margin products.
operating expenses for fiscal year 2017 were $2.13 billion, up from $2.06 billion in the previous year. this reflects growth in headcount and related costs, partially offset by lower litigation and restructuring expenses.
net income and net income per diluted share for fiscal year 2017 were $1.67 billion and $2.57, respectively, up 171% and 138%, respectively, from a year earlier. these increases were fueled by strong revenue growth, improved gross and operating margins, and a lower effective income tax rate as a result of a decrease in the amount of earnings subject to united states tax and the recognition of excess tax benefits from our adoption of a new accounting standard related to the simplification of certain aspects of stock-based compensation accounting.
cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities were $6.80 billion as of january 29, 2017, up from $5.04 billion as of january 31, 2016.
gpu business during fiscal year 2017, we released many new gaming gpu products based on our new nvidia pascal architecture, including geforce gtx titan x, geforce gtx 1080, 1070, 1060, 1050 and 1050ti. we also expanded the nvidia vrworks software development kit, released our first game, nvidia vr funhouse, and introduced nvidia ansel, an in-game photography tool.
for datacenter, we introduced the tesla p100, p40 and p4 gpu accelerators, based on the pascal architecture, unveiled our inception program, which provides access to nvidia technology and expertise to support the growth of startups in deep learning and data science, introduced the tesla m10 for virtualizing enterprise applications, launched the nvidia tensorrt deep learning inferencing framework, and began shipping the dgx-1 ai supercomputer to research organizations, universities, and multinationals. we also collaborated with microsoft to accelerate ai with a gpu-accelerated microsoft cognitive toolkit available on the microsoft azure cloud and nvidia dgx-1, partnered with the national cancer institute and the u.s. department of energy to build candle, an ai framework that will advance cancer research, and unveiled the nvidia dgx saturnv ai supercomputer, powered by 124 pascal-powered dgx-1 server nodes.
for professional visualization, we enabled a new class of supercomputing workstations using quadro gp100, introduced quadro p5000 to power vr-ready mobile workstations, the 24gb quadro m6000, the quadro m2000, and unveiled the quadro p6000 to power advanced workstations. we also refreshed nvidia designworks and nvidia vrworks with new updates and software development kits, introduced nvidia iray physically-based rendering solutions, and unveiled iray vr, which creates interactive, photorealistic virtual 3d worlds.
tegra processor business during fiscal year 2017, for the automotive market, we introduced the hd mapping platform for self-driving cars, announced that our nvidia drive px 2 platform will power vehicles in the new roborace autonomous car-racing circuit, initiated collaborative research in advanced self-driving technology with new york university's pioneering deep learning team, and announced that nvidia drive px 2 will power a new autopilot system in all of tesla motors' factory produced vehicles - the model s, model x and upcoming model 3. we also announced a number of new partnerships aimed at getting ai-powered cars, trucks and commercial vehicles on the road, including partnerships with audi, bosch, mercedes-benz, and zf. we also partnered with europe's here to develop a real-time, high-definition mapping solution for autonomous vehicles, and with japan's zenrin to develop a cloud-to-car high-definition map solution for self-driving cars.
we also expanded the nvidia shield platform's gaming content available for streaming from geforce now, announced that nvidia gaming technology will power the nintendo switch home gaming system, and launched our new shield tv, which integrates google assistant for tv, smartthings hub technology and the nvidia spot ai mic.
critical accounting policies and estimates management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states, or u.s. gaap. the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, cost of revenue, expenses and related disclosure of contingencies. on an on-going basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related to revenue recognition, inventories, income taxes, goodwill, cash equivalents and marketable securities, stock-based compensation, and litigation, investigation and settlement costs and other contingencies. we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities.
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. our management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting policies and estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors. the audit committee has reviewed our disclosures relating to our critical accounting policies and estimates in this annual report on form 10-k.
revenue recognition product revenue we recognize revenue from product sales when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, the product has been delivered, the price is fixed or determinable and collection of the related receivable is reasonably assured.
for sales to certain distributors with rights of return for which the level of returns cannot be reasonably estimated, our policy is to defer recognition of revenue and related cost of revenue until the distributors resell the product and, in some cases, when customer return rights lapse.
our customer programs primarily involve rebates, which are designed to serve as sales incentives to resellers of our products in various target markets. we account for rebates as a reduction of revenue and accrue for 100% of the potential rebates and do not apply a breakage factor. while we have a long history of rebate arrangements with oems, we believe we are unable to apply our historical experience to reliably estimate the amount of rebates that will eventually be claimed by individual oems. in such cases, the oems may not be our direct customers and therefore the quantity and mix of demand they place on their cems/odms may shift as we introduce new generations and iterations of products and as we experience changes in new competitor offerings. in addition, we typically find that approximately 95% of the rebates we accrue each year are eventually claimed, which is substantially close to 100%, and that this percentage varies by program and by customer. we recognize a liability for these rebates at the later of the date at which we record the related revenue or the date at which we offer the rebate. rebates typically expire six months from the date of the original sale, unless we reasonably believe that the customer intends to claim the rebate. unclaimed rebates are reversed to revenue, the amount of which typically represents less than 0.5% of total revenue.
our customer programs also include marketing development funds, or mdfs. mdfs represent monies paid to retailers, system builders, oems, distributors, add-in card partners and other channel partners that are earmarked for market segment development and expansion and typically are designed to support our partners' activities while also promoting nvidia products. depending on market conditions, we may take actions to increase amounts offered under customer programs, possibly resulting in an incremental reduction of revenue at the time such programs are offered. we account for mdfs as a reduction of revenue and apply a breakage factor to certain types of mdf program accruals for which we believe we can make a reasonable and reliable estimate of the amount that will ultimately be unclaimed.
license and development revenue for license arrangements that require significant customization of our intellectual property components, we generally recognize the related revenue over the period that services are performed. for most license and service arrangements, we determine progress to completion based on actual cost incurred to date as a percentage of the estimated total cost required to complete the project. we periodically evaluate the actual status of each project to ensure that the estimates to complete each contract remain accurate. revenue recognized in any period is dependent on our progress toward completion of projects in progress. significant management judgment and discretion are used to estimate total cost. any changes in or deviations from these estimates could have a material effect on the amount of revenue we recognize in any period.
for license arrangements that do not require significant customization but where we are obligated to provide further deliverables over the term of the license agreement, we record revenue over the life of the license term, with consideration received in advance of the performance period classified as deferred revenue.
please refer to note 1 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements in part iv, item 15 of this annual report on form 10-k for additional information.
inventories inventory cost is computed on an adjusted standard basis, which approximates actual cost on an average or first-in, first-out basis. we charge cost of sales for inventory provisions to write down our inventory to the lower of cost or estimated market value or to completely write off obsolete or excess inventory. most of our inventory provisions relate to the write-off of excess quantities of products, based on our inventory levels and future product purchase commitments compared to assumptions about future demand and market conditions.
situations that may result in excess or obsolete inventory include changes in business and economic conditions, changes in market conditions, sudden and significant decreases in demand for our products, inventory obsolescence because of changing technology and customer requirements, failure to estimate customer demand properly, or unexpected competitive pricing actions by our competition. in addition, cancellation or deferral of customer purchase orders could result in our holding excess inventory. also, we may not be able to reduce our inventory purchase commitments in a timely manner in response to customer cancellations or deferrals.
the overall net effect on our gross margin from inventory provisions and sales of items previously written down was an unfavorable impact of 0.2%, 1.6%, and 0.6% in fiscal years 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively. the charges we took to cost of sales for inventory provisions during these fiscal years were primarily related to the write-off of excess quantities of products whose inventory levels were higher than our updated forecasts of future demand for those products. as a fabless semiconductor company, we must make commitments to purchase inventory based on forecasts of future customer demand. in doing so, we must account for our third-party manufacturers' lead times and constraints. we also adjust to other market factors, such as product offerings and pricing actions by our competitors, new product transitions, and macroeconomic conditions - all of which may impact demand for our products.
please refer to the gross profit and gross margin discussion below in this management's discussion and analysis for further discussion.
income taxes we recognize federal, state and foreign current tax liabilities or assets based on our estimate of taxes payable or refundable in the current fiscal year by tax jurisdiction. we recognize federal, state and foreign deferred tax assets or liabilities, as appropriate, for our estimate of future tax effects attributable to temporary differences and carryforwards; and we record a valuation allowance to reduce any deferred tax assets by the amount of any tax benefits that, based on available evidence and judgment, are not expected to be realized.
united states income tax has not been provided for a portion of earnings of our non-u.s. subsidiaries to the extent that such earnings are considered to be indefinitely reinvested.
our calculation of deferred tax assets and liabilities is based on certain estimates and judgments and involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws. our estimates of deferred tax assets and liabilities may change based, in part, on added certainty or finality to an anticipated outcome, changes in accounting standards or tax laws in the united states, or foreign jurisdictions where we operate, or changes in other facts or circumstances. in addition, we recognize liabilities for potential united states and foreign income tax contingencies based on our estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes may be due. if we determine that payment of these amounts is unnecessary or if the recorded tax liability is less than our current assessment, we may be required to recognize an income tax benefit or additional income tax expense in our financial statements accordingly.
as of january 29, 2017, we had a valuation allowance of $353 million related to state and certain foreign deferred tax assets that management determined are not likely to be realized due to projections of future taxable income and potential utilization limitations of tax attributes acquired as a result of stock ownership changes. to the extent realization of the deferred tax assets becomes more-likely-than-not, we would recognize such deferred tax asset as an income tax benefit during the period.
goodwill goodwill is subject to our annual impairment test during the fourth quarter of our fiscal year, or earlier, if indicators of potential impairment exist, using either a qualitative or a quantitative assessment. our impairment review process compares the fair value of the reporting unit in which the goodwill resides to its carrying value. we have identified two reporting units, gpu and tegra processor, for the purposes of completing our goodwill analysis. goodwill assigned to the gpu and tegra processor reporting units as of january 29, 2017 was $210 million and $408 million, respectively. determining the fair value of a reporting unit requires us to make judgments and involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions. we also make judgments and assumptions in allocating assets and liabilities to each of our reporting units. we base our fair value estimates on assumptions we believe to be reasonable but that are unpredictable and inherently uncertain.
during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2017, we elected to use the quantitative assessment to test goodwill for impairment for each reporting unit. in applying the fair value based test of each reporting unit, the results from the income approach and the market approach were equally weighted. these valuation approaches consider a number of factors that include, but are not limited to, prospective financial information, growth rates, terminal or residual values, discount rates and comparable multiples from publicly traded companies in our industry and require us to make certain assumptions and estimates regarding industry economic factors and the future profitability of our business.
when performing an income approach valuation, we incorporate the use of projected financial information and a discount rate that are developed using market participant based assumptions to our discounted cash flow model. our estimates of discounted cash flow were based upon, among other things, certain assumptions about our expected future operating performance, such as revenue growth rates, operating margins, risk-adjusted discount rates, and future economic and market conditions. our estimates may differ from actual cash flow due to, among other things, economic conditions, changes to our business model or changes in operating performance. additionally, certain estimates of discounted cash flow involve businesses with limited financial history and developing revenue models, which increases the risk of differences between the projected and actual performance. the long-term financial forecasts that we utilize represent the best estimate that we have at this time and we believe that its underlying assumptions are reasonable. significant differences between our estimates and actual cash flow could materially affect our future financial results, which could impact our future estimates of the fair value of our reporting units.
during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2017, we concluded that there was no impairment of our goodwill. the fair values of our gpu and tegra processor reporting units significantly exceeded their respective carrying values. as such, even the application of a hypothetical 10% decrease to the fair value of each reporting unit would not have resulted in the fair value of either reporting unit being less than its carrying value. as an overall test of the reasonableness of estimated fair values of our reporting units, we reconciled the combined fair value estimates of our reporting units to our market capitalization as of the valuation date. the reconciliation confirmed that the fair values were relatively representative of the market views when applying a reasonable control premium to the market capitalization. however, any significant reductions in the actual amount of future cash flows realized by our reporting units, reductions in the value of market comparables, or reductions in our market capitalization could impact future estimates of the fair values of our reporting units. such events could ultimately result in a charge to our earnings in future periods due to the potential for a write-down of the goodwill associated with our reporting units.
cash equivalents and marketable securities cash equivalents consist of financial instruments which are readily convertible into cash and have original maturities of three months or less at the time of acquisition.  marketable securities consist primarily of highly liquid investments with maturities greater than three months when purchased. we measure our cash equivalents and marketable securities at fair value. the fair values of our financial assets and liabilities are determined using quoted market prices of identical assets or quoted market prices of similar assets from active markets. all of our available-for-sale investments are subject to a periodic impairment review. we record a charge to earnings when a decline in fair value is significantly below cost basis and judged to be other-than-temporary, or have other indicators of impairments.
we performed an impairment review of our investment portfolio as of january 29, 2017. we concluded that our investments were appropriately valued and that no other-than-temporary impairment charges were necessary on our portfolio of available-for-sale investments as of january 29, 2017.
please refer to notes 6 and 7 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements in part iv, item 15 of this annual report on form 10-k for additional information.
stock-based compensation our stock-based compensation expense is associated with restricted stock units, or rsus, performance stock units that are based on our corporate financial performance targets, or psus, performance stock units that are based on market conditions, or market-based psus, our employee stock purchase plan, or espp, and stock options. in fiscal year 2015, we shifted away from granting stock options and toward granting rsus, psus and market-based psus to reflect changing market trends for equity incentives at our peer companies. the number of psus and market-based psus that will ultimately be awarded is contingent on the company's level of achievement compared with the corporate financial performance target established by our compensation committee in the beginning of each fiscal year.
please refer to notes 1 and 2 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements in part iv, item 15 of this annual report on form 10-k for additional information.
litigation, investigation and settlement costs from time to time, we are involved in legal actions and/or investigations by regulatory bodies. we are aggressively defending our current litigation matters. however, there are many uncertainties associated with any litigation or investigations, and we cannot be certain that these actions or other third-party claims against us will be resolved without costly litigation, fines and/or substantial settlement payments. if that occurs, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. if information becomes available that causes us to determine that a loss in any of our pending litigation, investigations or settlements is probable, and we can reasonably estimate the loss associated with such events, we will record the loss in accordance with u.s. gaap. however, the actual liability in any such litigation or investigation may be materially different from our estimates, which could require us to record additional costs.
results of operations the following table sets forth, for the periods indicated, certain items in our consolidated statements of income expressed as a percentage of revenue.

gpu business. gpu business revenue increased by 39% in fiscal year 2017 compared to fiscal year 2016. this increase was due primarily to increased revenue from our geforce gpu gaming and datacenter platforms. sales of high-end geforce gpu products for gaming increased over 40%, reflecting a combination of continued strength in pc gaming and strong demand for our recent pascal-based gpu products. datacenter revenue, including our tesla, nvidia grid, and dgx-1 brands, increased 145%, reflecting strong demand for deep learning training for ai, cloud, accelerated, and virtualized computing, and initial dgx-1 sales. revenue from quadro gpus for professional visualization increased 11% due primarily to higher sales in high end desktop and mobile workstation products. revenue from geforce gpu products for mainstream pc oems declined compared to last year.
gpu business revenue increased by 9% in fiscal year 2016 compared to fiscal year 2015. this increase was due primarily to increased revenue from sales of high-end geforce gpu products for gaming, which increased over 30% reflecting a combination of continued strength in pc gaming and increased sales of our maxwell-based gpu products. revenue from tesla gpus for datacenter increased, driven by strong demand from hyperscale companies for deep learning for ai and accelerated computing. revenue from quadro gpus for professional visualization declined due to weakness in the overall workstation market. revenue from geforce gpu products for mainstream pc oems declined compared to the prior year.
tegra processor business.  tegra processor business revenue increased by 47% in fiscal year 2017 compared to fiscal year 2016. this was driven by an increase of over 50% in sales of tegra products and services serving automotive systems and an increase of almost 50% in gaming development platforms compared to last year.
tegra processor business revenue decreased by 3% in fiscal year 2016 compared to fiscal year 2015. this decrease was driven by a decline in sales of tegra products for oem smartphones and tablets of almost 90%, partially offset by an increase in sales of tegra products serving automotive systems of almost 75%. revenue also grew from development services and sales of shield devices.
all other. license revenue from the patent cross licensing arrangement we entered into with intel in january 2011 was flat at $264 million for fiscal years 2017, 2016, and 2015. the remaining $44 million in revenue under this arrangement will be recognized in the first quarter of fiscal year 2018.
concentration of revenue revenue from sales to customers outside of the united states and other americas accounted for 80%, 79%, and 75% of total revenue for fiscal years 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively. revenue by geographic region is allocated to individual countries based on the location to which the products are initially billed even if the revenue is attributable to end customers in a different location.
revenue from significant customers, those representing 10% or more of total revenue for the respective dates, is summarized as follows:
customer a   12      %       11          %       11          %
gross profit and gross margin gross profit consists of total revenue, net of allowances, less cost of revenue. cost of revenue consists primarily of the cost of semiconductors purchased from subcontractors, including wafer fabrication, assembly, testing and packaging, board and device costs, manufacturing support costs, including labor and overhead associated with such purchases, final test yield fallout, inventory and warranty provisions, memory and component costs, and shipping costs. cost of revenue also includes development costs for license and service arrangements and stock-based compensation related to personnel associated with manufacturing.
our overall gross margin was 58.8%, 56.1%, and 55.5% for fiscal years 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively. these increases were driven primarily by a higher mix of our gpu business, fewer inventory provisions, and lower warranty charges in our tegra processor business.
charges to cost of sales for inventory provisions totaled $62 million, $112 million and $59 million for fiscal years 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively, unfavorably impacting our gross margin by 0.9%, 2.2%, and 1.3%, respectively. sales of inventory that was previously written-off or written-down totaled $51 million for fiscal year 2017 and $32 million for both fiscal years 2016 and 2015, favorably impacting our gross margin by 0.7%, 0.6%, and 0.7%, respectively. as a result, the overall net effect on our gross margin from inventory provisions and sales of items previously written down was an unfavorable impact of 0.2%, 1.6%, and 0.6% in fiscal years 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively.
a discussion of our gross margin results for each of our reportable segments is as follows:
gpu business. the gross margin of our gpu business increased during fiscal year 2017 when compared to fiscal year 2016 primarily due to product mix resulting from increased sales of our geforce gaming, tesla, grid and quadro gpu products, as well as a continued decrease in sales volumes of lower margin pc oem products. the gross margin of our gpu business increased during fiscal year 2016 when compared to fiscal year 2015 primarily due to strong sales of our high end geforce gaming gpu products and the decreased sales volume of lower margin pc oem products.
tegra processor business. the gross margin of our tegra processor business increased during fiscal year 2017 when compared to fiscal year 2016, primarily due to fewer inventory provisions, and the absence of the warranty charge associated with the shield tablet product recall during fiscal year 2016. the gross margin of our tegra processor business decreased during fiscal year 2016 when compared to fiscal year 2015 due to inventory provisions, a warranty charge associated with the shield tablet product recall and higher automotive and shield product sales, which have had comparably lower gross margins. the inventory provisions related primarily to older generation tegra products, as well as inventory purchase commitments in excess of estimated demand and excess component inventories for shield products.

research and development research and development expenses increased by 10% in fiscal year 2017 compared to fiscal year 2016, driven primarily by employee additions and increases in employee compensation and other related costs, including stock-based compensation expense.
research and development expenses decreased by 2% in fiscal year 2016 compared to fiscal year 2015. this decrease was primarily driven by the wind-down of icera modem operations and other organization efficiencies, partially offset by increases in employee compensation and related costs, including stock-based compensation expense.
sales, general and administrative sales, general and administrative expenses increased by 10% in fiscal year 2017 compared to fiscal year 2016, driven primarily by employee additions and increases in employee compensation and other related costs, including stock-based compensation expense. offsetting these increases was a $57 million decrease in outside professional fees resulting from the resolution of our intellectual property disputes with samsung and qualcomm during early fiscal year 2017.
sales, general and administrative expenses increased by 25% in fiscal year 2016 compared to fiscal year 2015. outside professional fees increased, primarily due to $70 million of legal fees associated with our litigation against samsung and qualcomm. compensation and benefits increased by $39 million resulting from employee additions, employee compensation increases and related costs, including stock-based compensation expense. advertising and promotions increased by $9 million resulting from digital advertising.
restructuring and other charges in fiscal year 2016, we began the wind down our icera modem operations. as a result, our operating expenses for fiscal years 2017 and 2016 included $3 million and $131 million, respectively, of restructuring and other charges. please refer to note 17 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements in part iv, item 15 of this annual report on form 10-k for further discussion.
interest income and interest expense interest income consists of interest earned on cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. interest expense is primarily comprised of coupon interest and debt discount amortization related to the convertible notes we issued in december 2013 and the notes we issued in september 2016.
interest expense was $58 million, $47 million, and $46 million in fiscal years 2017, 2016, and 2015. the increase in fiscal year 2017 compared to fiscal years 2016 and 2015 was due primarily to interest expense related to the notes we issued in september 2016, partially offset by a decrease in interest expense as a result of the early conversion of a significant portion of the convertible notes during fiscal year 2017.
other income (expense), net other income (expense), net, consists primarily of realized gains and losses from the sale of marketable securities, sales or impairments of investments in non-affiliated companies, losses on early conversions of the convertible notes, and the impact of changes in foreign currency rates.
net other income (expense) was $(25) million, $4 million, and $14 million in fiscal years 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively. the net other (expense) in fiscal year 2017 compared to the net other income in fiscal year 2016 was primarily due to $21 million of losses we recognized from early conversions of the convertible notes. the decrease for fiscal year 2016 compared to fiscal year 2015 was primarily due to less gain recognized from sales of non-affiliated investments and more losses from foreign currency remeasurement.
income taxes we recognized income tax expense of $239 million, $129 million and $124 million for fiscal years 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively. our annual effective tax rate was 12.5%, 17.3%, and 16.5% for fiscal years 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively. the decrease in the effective tax rate in fiscal year 2017 as compared to fiscal years 2016 and 2015 was primarily due to the recognition of excess tax benefits from our adoption of a new accounting standard related to the simplification of certain aspects of stock-based compensation accounting. the higher effective tax rate in fiscal year 2016 as compared to fiscal years 2017 and 2015 was due to an additional amount of earnings subject to united states tax in fiscal year 2016, partially offset by a net income tax benefit related to the icera modem restructuring in fiscal year 2016.
our effective tax rate for each of the fiscal years was lower than the u.s. federal statutory rate of 35% due primarily to income earned in jurisdictions, including british virgin islands, hong kong, china, taiwan and united kingdom, where the tax rate is lower than the united states federal statutory tax rate of 35%, favorable recognition in these fiscal years of the u.s. federal research tax credit, favorable discrete events primarily attributable to the tax benefit recognized upon the expiration of the applicable statutes of limitations, and adoption of an accounting standard related to stock-based compensation in fiscal year 2017.

as of january 29, 2017, we had $6.80 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, an increase of $1.76 billion from the end of fiscal year 2016. our portfolio of cash equivalents and marketable securities is managed on our behalf by several financial institutions which are required to follow our investment policy, which requires the purchase of high grade investment securities, the diversification of asset types and includes certain limits on our portfolio duration.
cash provided by operating activities increased in fiscal year 2017 compared to fiscal year 2016, primarily driven by an increase in net income and changes in working capital. cash provided by operating activities increased in fiscal year 2016 compared to fiscal year 2015, primarily due to changes in working capital, partially offset by a decline in net income.

liquidity our primary sources of liquidity are our cash and cash equivalents, our marketable securities, and the cash generated by our operations. as of january 29, 2017 and january 31, 2016, we had $6.80 billion and $5.04 billion, respectively, in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. our marketable securities consist principally of debt securities of corporations and united states government and its agencies, asset-backed securities, mortgage-backed securities issued by government-sponsored enterprises, money market funds and foreign government bonds. these investments are denominated in united states dollars. please refer to critical accounting policies and estimates in part ii, item 7, quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in part ii, item 7a and note 6 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements in part iv, item 15 of this annual report on form 10-k for additional information.
our cash balances are held in numerous locations throughout the world, including substantial amounts held outside of the united states. as of january 29, 2017, we had cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of $2.24 billion held within the united states and $4.56 billion held outside of the united states. most of the amounts held outside the united states may be repatriated to the united states but, under current law, would be subject to u.s. federal income taxes, less applicable foreign tax credits. further, repatriation of some foreign balances may be restricted by local laws. as of january 29, 2017, we have not provided for u.s. federal and state income taxes on approximately $3.13 billion of undistributed earnings of non-united states subsidiaries, as such earnings are considered indefinitely reinvested outside the united states. although we have no current need to do so, if we repatriate foreign earnings for cash requirements in the united states, we would incur u.s. federal and state income tax, less applicable foreign tax credits, and reduced by the current amount of our u.s. federal and state net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. further, in addition to the $2.24 billion of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities held within the united states and available to fund our u.s. operations and any other u.s. cash needs, we have access to external sources of financing if cash is needed in the united states other than by repatriation of foreign earnings where u.s. income tax may otherwise be due.  accordingly, we do not reasonably expect any material effect on our business, as a whole, or to our financial flexibility with respect to our current cash balances held outside of the united states.
capital return to shareholders dividend payments and share repurchases must be made from cash held in the united states. during fiscal year 2017, we repurchased a total of 15 million shares for $739 million and paid $261 million in cash dividends to our shareholders. as a result, we returned $1.00 billion to shareholders during fiscal year 2017, utilizing a significant amount of our u.s. cash balance previously taxed as of january 29, 2017.
for fiscal year 2018, we intend to return approximately $1.25 billion to shareholders through ongoing quarterly cash dividends and share repurchases. in november 2016, the board authorized an additional $2.00 billion under our repurchase program and extended it through december 2020.
our cash dividend program and the payment of future cash dividends under that program are subject to continued capital availability and our board's continuing determination that the dividend program and the declaration of dividends thereunder are in the best interests of our shareholders and are in compliance with all laws and agreements of nvidia applicable to the declaration and payment of cash dividends. please refer to note 14 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements in part iv, item 15 of this annual report on form 10-k for further discussion.
convertible notes in december 2013, we issued $1.50 billion of convertible notes that mature on december 1, 2018 unless repurchased or converted prior to such date. the convertible notes first became convertible at the holders' option beginning on the first day of fiscal year 2017. we utilized u.s. cash to settle an aggregate of $673 million in principal amount of the convertible notes during fiscal year 2017 and we have received additional conversion notices for an aggregate of $660 million in principal amount, $502 million of which have already settled, $103 million of which are expected to be settled in the first quarter of fiscal year 2018, and $55 million of which are expected to be settled in the second quarter of fiscal year 2018. please refer to note 11 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements in part iv, item 15 of this annual report on form 10-k for further discussion.
on september 16, 2016, we issued $1.00 billion of the notes due 2021 and $1.00 billion of the notes due 2026. the net proceeds from the notes were $1.98 billion, after deducting debt discounts and issuance costs. we intend to use the net proceeds from the notes to prefund the repayment of the principal amount of early conversions of our convertible notes and for general corporate purposes such as dividend payments or share repurchases.
revolving credit facility on october 7, 2016, we entered into a credit agreement under which we may borrow, repay and re-borrow amounts from time to time, up to $575 million, for working capital and other general corporate purposes. the commitments under the credit agreement are available for a 5-year period ending on october 7, 2021, on which date all outstanding obligations would be due and payable. the credit agreement also permits us to obtain additional revolving loan commitments and/or commitments to issue letters of credit of up to $425 million, subject to certain conditions. as of january 29, 2017, we had not borrowed any amounts under the credit agreement.
operating capital and capital expenditure requirements we believe that our existing cash balances and anticipated cash flows from operations will be sufficient to meet our operating and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next twelve months.

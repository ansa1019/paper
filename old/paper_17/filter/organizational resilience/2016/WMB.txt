because we do not control the partially owned entities, we may have limited flexibility to control the operation of or cash distributions received from these entities. the partially owned entities' organizational documents generally require distribution of their available cash to their members on a quarterly basis; however, in each case, available cash is reduced, in part, by reserves appropriate for operating the businesses. as of december 31, 2016, our investments in the partially owned entities accounted for approximately 8 percent of our total consolidated assets. conflicts of interest may arise in the future between us, on the one hand, and our partially owned entities, on the other hand, with regard to our partially owned entities' governance, business, or operations. if a conflict of interest arises between us and a partially owned entity, other owners may control the partially owned entity's actions with respect to such matter (subject to certain limitations), which could be detrimental to our business. any future disagreements with the other co-owners of these assets could adversely affect our ability to respond to changing economic or industry conditions, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.
organizational realignment in september 2016, we announced organizational changes aiming to simplify our structure, increase direct operational alignment to advance our natural gas-focused strategy, and drive continued focus on customer service and execution. effective january 1, 2017, we implemented these changes, which combined the management of certain of our operations and reduced the overall number of operating areas managed within our business.

distributions from equity-method investees the organizational documents of entities in which we have an equity-method investment generally require distribution of their available cash to their members on a quarterly basis. in each case, available cash is reduced, in part, by reserves appropriate for operating their respective businesses.

item 1a. risk factors an investment in our securities involves various risks. all investors should carefully consider the following risk factors in conjunction with the other information contained in this annual report before trading in our securities. if any of the events set forth in the following risks actually occur, our business, operating results, prospects and financial condition could be harmed.
our performance is subject to risks associated with real estate investments. we are a real estate company that derives our income from operation of our stores. there are a number of factors that may adversely affect the income that our stores generate, including the following:
risks related to our stores and operations adverse economic or other conditions in the markets in which we do business could negatively affect our occupancy levels and rental rates and therefore our operating results.
our operating results are dependent upon our ability to maximize occupancy levels and rental rates in our stores. adverse economic or other conditions in the markets in which we operate may lower our occupancy levels and limit our ability to increase rents or require us to offer rental discounts. if our stores fail to generate revenues sufficient to meet our cash requirements, including operating and other expenses, debt service and capital expenditures, our net income, funds from operations ("ffo"), cash flow, financial condition, ability to make cash distributions to stockholders and the trading price of our securities could be adversely affected. the following factors, among others, may adversely affect the operating performance of our stores:
•   the national economic climate and the local or regional economic climate in the markets in which we operate, which may be adversely impacted by, among other factors, industry slowdowns, relocation of businesses and changing demographics;
•   periods of economic slowdown or recession, rising interest rates, or declining demand for self-storage or the public perception that any of these events may occur could result in a general decline in rental rates or an increase in tenant defaults;
•   a decline of the current economic environment;
•   local or regional real estate market conditions, such as competing stores, the oversupply of self-storage or a reduction in demand for self-storage in a particular area;
•   perceptions by prospective users of our stores of the safety, convenience and attractiveness of our stores and the neighborhoods in which they are located;
•   increased operating costs, including the need for capital improvements, insurance premiums, real estate taxes and utilities;
•   the impact of environmental protection laws;
•   changes in tax, real estate and zoning laws; and
•   earthquakes, hurricanes and other natural disasters, terrorist acts, civil disturbances or acts of war which may result in uninsured or underinsured losses.
if we are unable to promptly re-let our units or if the rates upon such re-letting are significantly lower than expected, our business and results of operations would be adversely affected.
virtually all of our leases are on a month-to-month basis. any delay in re-letting units as vacancies arise would reduce our revenues and harm our operating results. in addition, lower than expected rental rates upon re-letting could adversely affect our revenues and impede our growth.
we depend upon our on-site personnel to maximize tenant satisfaction at each of our stores, and any difficulties we encounter in hiring, training and maintaining skilled field personnel may harm our operating performance.
we had 2,723 field personnel as of february 21, 2017 in the management and operation of our stores. the general professionalism of our store managers and staff are contributing factors to a store's ability to successfully secure rentals and retain tenants. we also rely upon our field personnel to maintain clean and secure stores. if we are unable to successfully recruit, train and retain qualified field personnel, the quality of service we strive to provide at our stores could be adversely affected which could lead to decreased occupancy levels and reduced operating performance.
uninsured losses or losses in excess of our insurance coverage could adversely affect our financial condition and our cash flow.
we maintain comprehensive liability, fire, flood, earthquake, wind (as deemed necessary or as required by our lenders), extended coverage and rental loss insurance with respect to our stores. certain types of losses, however, may be either uninsurable or not economically insurable, such as losses due to earthquakes, hurricanes, tornadoes, riots, acts of war or terrorism. should an uninsured loss occur, we could lose both our investment in and anticipated profits and cash flow from a store. in addition, if any such loss is insured, we may be required to pay significant amounts on any claim for recovery of such a loss prior to our insurer being obligated to reimburse us for the loss, or the amount of the loss may exceed our coverage for the loss. as a result, our operating results may be adversely affected.
costs resulting from changes in real estate tax laws generally are not passed through to tenants directly and will affect us. increases in income, property or other taxes generally are not passed through to tenants under leases and may reduce our net income, ffo, cash flow, financial condition, ability to pay or refinance our debt obligations, ability to make cash distributions to stockholders, and the trading price of our securities. similarly, changes in laws increasing the potential liability for environmental conditions existing on stores or increasing the restrictions on discharges or other conditions may result in significant unanticipated expenditures, which could similarly adversely affect our business and results of operations.
environmental compliance costs and liabilities associated with operating our stores may affect our results of operations.
under various u.s. federal, state and local laws, ordinances and regulations, owners and operators of real estate may be liable for the costs of investigating and remediating certain hazardous substances or other regulated materials on or in such property. such laws often impose such liability without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of, or was responsible for, the presence of such substances or materials. the presence of such substances or materials, or the failure to properly remediate such substances, may adversely affect the owner's or operator's ability to lease, sell or rent such property or to borrow using such property as collateral. persons who arrange for the disposal or treatment of hazardous substances or other regulated materials may be liable for the costs of removal or remediation of such substances at a disposal or treatment facility, whether or not such facility is owned or operated by such person. certain environmental laws impose liability for release of asbestos-containing materials into the air and third parties may seek recovery from owners or operators of real stores for personal injury associated with asbestos-containing materials.
certain environmental laws also impose liability, without regard to knowledge or fault, for removal or remediation of hazardous substances or other regulated materials upon owners and operators of contaminated property even after they no
longer own or operate the property. moreover, the past or present owner or operator from which a release emanates could be liable for any personal injuries or property damages that may result from such releases, as well as any damages to natural resources that may arise from such releases.
certain environmental laws impose compliance obligations on owners and operators of real property with respect to the management of hazardous materials and other regulated substances. for example, environmental laws govern the management of asbestos-containing materials and lead-based paint. failure to comply with these laws can result in penalties or other sanctions.
no assurances can be given that existing environmental studies with respect to any of our stores reveal all environmental liabilities, that any prior owner or operator of our stores did not create any material environmental condition not known to us, or that a material environmental condition does not otherwise exist as to any one or more of our stores. there also exists the risk that material environmental conditions, liabilities or compliance concerns may have arisen after the review was completed or may arise in the future. finally, future laws, ordinances or regulations and future interpretations of existing laws, ordinances or regulations may impose additional material environmental liability.
costs associated with complying with the americans with disabilities act of 1990 may result in unanticipated expenses.
under the ada, places of public accommodation are required to meet certain federal requirements related to access and use by disabled persons. these requirements became effective in 1992. a number of additional u.s. federal, state and local laws may also require modifications to our stores, or restrict certain further renovations of the stores, with respect to access thereto by disabled persons. noncompliance with the ada could result in the imposition of fines or an award of damages to private litigants and also could result in an order to correct any non-complying feature, which could result in substantial capital expenditures. we have not conducted an audit or investigation of all of our stores to determine our compliance and we cannot predict the ultimate cost of compliance with the ada or other legislation. if one or more of our stores is not in compliance with the ada or other legislation, then we would be required to incur additional costs to bring the facility into compliance. if we incur substantial costs to comply with the ada or other legislation, our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow, per share trading price of our securities and our ability to satisfy our debt service obligations and to make cash distributions to our stockholders could be adversely affected.
our tenant reinsurance business is subject to significant governmental regulation, which may adversely affect our results.
our tenant reinsurance business is subject to significant governmental regulation. the regulatory authorities generally have broad discretion to grant, renew and revoke licenses and approvals, to promulgate, interpret and implement regulations, and to evaluate compliance with regulations through periodic examinations, audits and investigations of the affairs of insurance providers. as a result of regulatory or private action in any jurisdiction, we may be temporarily or permanently suspended from continuing some or all of our reinsurance activities, or otherwise fined or penalized or suffer an adverse judgment, which could adversely affect our business and results of operations.
we face competition for the acquisition of stores and other assets, which may impede our ability to make future acquisitions or may increase the cost of these acquisitions.
we compete with many other entities engaged in real estate investment activities for acquisitions of stores and other assets, including national, regional and local operators and developers of stores. these competitors may drive up the price we pay for stores or other assets we seek to acquire or may succeed in acquiring those stores or assets themselves. in addition, our potential acquisition targets may find our competitors to be more attractive suitors because they may have greater resources, may be willing to pay more or may have a more compatible operating philosophy. in addition, the number of entities and the amount of funds competing for suitable investment in stores may increase. this competition would result in increased demand for these assets and therefore increased prices paid for them. because of an increased interest in single-store acquisitions among tax-motivated individual purchasers, we may pay higher prices if we purchase single stores in comparison with portfolio acquisitions. if we pay higher prices for stores or other assets, our profitability will be reduced.
we may not be successful in identifying and consummating suitable acquisitions that meet our criteria, which may impede our growth.
our ability to expand through acquisitions is integral to our business strategy and requires us to identify suitable acquisition candidates or investment opportunities that meet our criteria and are compatible with our growth strategy. we may not be successful in identifying suitable stores or other assets that meet our acquisition criteria or in consummating acquisitions
or investments on satisfactory terms or at all. failure to identify or consummate acquisitions will slow our growth, which could in turn adversely affect our stock price.
our ability to acquire stores on favorable terms and successfully integrate and operate them may be constrained by the following significant risks:
•   competition from local investors and other real estate investors with significant capital, including other publicly-traded reits and institutional investment funds;
•   competition from other potential acquirers may significantly increase the purchase price which could reduce our profitability;
•   the inability to achieve satisfactory completion of due diligence investigations and other customary closing conditions;
•   we may acquire stores subject to liabilities without any recourse, or with only limited recourse, with respect to unknown liabilities such as liabilities for clean-up of undisclosed environmental contamination, claims by persons dealing with the former owners of the stores and claims for indemnification by general partners, directors, officers and others indemnified by the former owners of the stores.
in addition, strategic decisions by us, such as acquisitions, may adversely affect the price of our securities.
we may not be successful in integrating and operating acquired stores.
we have acquired many stores in the past, and we expect to continue acquiring stores in the future. if we acquire any stores, we will be required to integrate them into our existing portfolio. the acquired stores may turn out to be less compatible with our growth strategy than originally anticipated, may cause disruptions in our operations or may divert management's attention away from day-to-day operations, which could impair our operating results as a whole.
our investments in development and redevelopment projects may not yield anticipated returns, which would harm our operating results and reduce the amount of funds available for distributions.
to the extent that we engage in development and redevelopment activities, we will be subject to the following risks normally associated with these projects:
•   we may not complete development or redevelopment projects on schedule or within budgeted amounts;
•   occupancy rates and rents at newly developed or redeveloped stores may fluctuate depending on a number of factors, including market and economic conditions, and may result in our investment not being profitable.
in deciding whether to develop or redevelop a particular property, we make certain assumptions regarding the expected future performance of the store. we may underestimate the costs necessary to bring the property up to the standards established for its intended market position or may be unable to increase occupancy at a newly developed store as quickly as expected or at all. any substantial unanticipated delays or expenses could adversely affect the investment returns from these development or redevelopment projects and harm our operating results, liquidity and financial condition, which could result in a decline in the value of our securities.
we may rely on the investments of our joint venture partners for funding certain of our development and redevelopment projects. if our reputation in the self-storage industry changes or the number of investors considering us an attractive strategic partner is otherwise reduced, our ability to develop or redevelop stores could be affected, which would limit our growth.
we rely on information technology in our operations, and any material failure, inadequacy, interruption or security failure of that technology could harm our business.
we rely on information technology networks and systems, including the internet, to process, transmit and store electronic information, and to manage or support a variety of business processes, including financial transactions and records, personally
identifiable information, and tenant and lease data. we purchase some of our information technology from vendors, on whom our systems depend. we rely on commercially available systems, software, tools and monitoring to provide security for processing, transmission and storage of confidential tenant and other sensitive information. although we have taken steps to protect the security of our information systems and the data maintained in those systems, it is possible that our safety and security measures will not be able to prevent the systems' improper functioning or damage, or the improper access or disclosure of personally identifiable information such as in the event of cyber-attacks. security breaches, including physical or electronic break-ins, computer viruses, attacks by hackers and similar breaches, can create system disruptions, shutdowns or unauthorized disclosure of confidential information. while, to date, we have not experienced a security breach, this risk has generally increased as the number, intensity and sophistication of such breaches and attempted breaches from around the world have increased. any failure to maintain proper function, security and availability of our information systems could interrupt our operations, damage our reputation, divert significant management attention and resources to remedy any damages that result, subject us to liability claims or regulatory penalties and have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.
risks related to our organization and structure our business could be harmed if key personnel with long-standing business relationships in the self-storage industry terminate their employment with us.
our success depends on the continued services of members of our executive management team, who have substantial experience in the self-storage industry. in addition, our ability to acquire or develop stores in the future depends on the significant relationships our executive management team has developed with our institutional joint venture partners, such as affiliates of prudential financial, inc. there is no guarantee that any of them will remain employed by us. we do not maintain key person life insurance on any of our officers. the loss of services of one or more members of our executive management team could harm our business and our prospects.
we may change our investment and financing strategies and enter into new lines of business without stockholder consent, which may subject us to different risks.
we may change our investment and financing strategies and enter into new lines of business at any time without the consent of our stockholders, which could result in our making investments and engaging in business activities that are different from, and possibly riskier than, the investments and businesses described in this document. a change in our investment strategy or our entry into new lines of business may increase our exposure to other risks or real estate market fluctuations.
if other self-storage companies convert to an upreit structure or if tax laws change, we may no longer have an advantage in competing for potential acquisitions.
because we are structured as an upreit, we are a more attractive acquirer of stores to tax-motivated sellers than our competitors that are not structured as upreits. however, if other self-storage companies restructure their holdings to become upreits, this competitive advantage will disappear. in addition, new legislation may be enacted or new interpretations of existing legislation may be issued by the internal revenue service ("irs"), or the u.s. treasury department that could affect the attractiveness of our upreit structure so that it may no longer assist us in competing for acquisitions.
tax indemnification obligations may require the operating partnership to maintain certain debt levels.
we have provided certain tax protections to various third parties in connection with their property contributions to the operating partnership upon acquisition by the company, including making available the opportunity to (1) guarantee debt or (2) enter into a special loss allocation and deficit restoration obligation. we have agreed to these provisions in order to assist these contributors in preserving their tax position after their contributions. these obligations may require us to maintain certain indebtedness levels that we would not otherwise require for our business.
our joint venture investments could be adversely affected by our lack of sole decision-making authority.
as of december 31, 2016, we held interests in 180 operating stores through joint ventures. some of these arrangements could be adversely affected by our lack of sole decision-making authority, our reliance on co-venturers financial conditions and disputes between us and our co-venturers. we expect to continue our joint venture strategy by entering into more joint ventures for the purpose of developing new stores and acquiring existing stores. in such event, we would not be in a position to exercise sole decision-making authority regarding the property, partnership, joint venture or other entity. the decision-making authority regarding the stores we currently hold through joint ventures is either vested exclusively with our joint venture partners, is subject to a majority vote of the joint venture partners or equally shared by us and the joint venture partners. in addition,
investments in partnerships, joint ventures or other entities may, under certain circumstances, involve risks not present were a third party not involved, including the possibility that partners or co-venturers might become bankrupt or fail to fund their share of required capital contributions. partners or co-venturers may have economic or other business interests or goals which are inconsistent with our business interests or goals, and may be in a position to take actions contrary to our policies or objectives. such investments may also have the potential risk of impasses on decisions, such as a sale, because neither we nor the partner or co-venturer would have full control over the partnership or joint venture. disputes between us and partners or co-venturers may result in litigation or arbitration that would increase our expenses and prevent our officers and/or directors from focusing their time and efforts on our business. consequently, actions by or disputes with partners or co-venturers might result in subjecting stores owned by the partnership or joint venture to additional risk. in addition, we may in certain circumstances be liable for the actions of our third-party partners or co-venturers, which could harm our financial condition.
conflicts of interest could arise as a result of our relationship with our operating partnership.
conflicts of interest could arise in the future as a result of the relationships between us and our affiliates, and our operating partnership or any partner thereof. our directors and officers have duties to our company under applicable maryland law in connection with their management of our company. at the same time, we, through our wholly-owned subsidiary, have fiduciary duties, as a general partner, to our operating partnership and to the limited partners under delaware law in connection with the management of our operating partnership. our duties, through our wholly-owned subsidiary, as a general partner to our operating partnership and its partners may come into conflict with the duties of our directors and officers to our company. the partnership agreement of our operating partnership does not require us to resolve such conflicts in favor of either our company or the limited partners in our operating partnership. unless otherwise provided for in the relevant partnership agreement, delaware law generally requires a general partner of a delaware limited partnership to adhere to fiduciary duty standards under which it owes its limited partners the highest duties of good faith, fairness, and loyalty and which generally prohibit such general partner from taking any action or engaging in any transaction as to which it has a conflict of interest.
additionally, the partnership agreement expressly limits our liability by providing that neither we, our direct wholly-owned massachusetts business trust subsidiary, as the general partner of the operating partnership, nor any of our or their trustees, directors or officers, will be liable or accountable in damages to our operating partnership, the limited partners or assignees for errors in judgment, mistakes of fact or law or for any act or omission if we, or such trustee, director or officer, acted in good faith. in addition, our operating partnership is required to indemnify us, our affiliates and each of our respective trustees, officers, directors, employees and agents to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law against any and all losses, claims, damages, liabilities (whether joint or several), expenses (including, without limitation, attorneys' fees and other legal fees and expenses), judgments, fines, settlements and other amounts arising from any and all claims, demands, actions, suits or proceedings, civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, that relate to the operations of the operating partnership, provided that our operating partnership will not indemnify for (1) willful misconduct or a knowing violation of the law, (2) any transaction for which such person received an improper personal benefit in violation or breach of any provision of the partnership agreement, or (3) in the case of a criminal proceeding, the person had reasonable cause to believe the act or omission was unlawful.
the provisions of delaware law that allow the common law fiduciary duties of a general partner to be modified by a partnership agreement have not been resolved in a court of law, and we have not obtained an opinion of counsel covering the provisions set forth in the partnership agreement that purport to waive or restrict our fiduciary duties that would be in effect under common law were it not for the partnership agreement.
certain provisions of maryland law and our organizational documents, including the stock ownership limit imposed by our charter, may inhibit market activity in our stock and could prevent or delay a change in control transaction.
our charter, subject to certain exceptions, authorizes our directors to take such actions as are necessary and desirable to preserve our qualification as a reit and to limit any person to actual or constructive ownership of no more than 7.0% (by value or by number of shares, whichever is more restrictive) of our outstanding common stock or 7.0% (by value or by number of shares, whichever is more restrictive) of our outstanding capital stock. our board of directors, in its sole discretion, may exempt a proposed transferee from the ownership limit. however, our board of directors may not grant an exemption from the ownership limit to any proposed transferee whose ownership could jeopardize our qualification as a reit. these restrictions on ownership will not apply if our board of directors determines that it is no longer in our best interests to attempt to qualify, or to continue to qualify, as a reit. the ownership limit may delay or impede a transaction or a change of control that might involve a premium price for our securities or otherwise be in the best interests of our stockholders. different ownership limits apply to the family of kenneth m. woolley, certain of his affiliates, family members and estates and trusts formed for the benefit of the foregoing; to spencer f. kirk, certain of his affiliates, family members and estates and trusts formed for the benefit of the foregoing; and to certain designated investment entities as defined in our charter.
our board of directors has the power to issue additional shares of our stock in a manner that may not be in the best interest of our stockholders.
our charter authorizes our board of directors to issue additional authorized but unissued shares of common stock or preferred stock and to increase the aggregate number of authorized shares or the number of shares of any class or series without stockholder approval. in addition, our board of directors may classify or reclassify any unissued shares of common stock or preferred stock and set the preferences, rights and other terms of the classified or reclassified shares. our board of directors could issue additional shares of our common stock or establish a series of preferred stock that could have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a change in control or other transaction that might involve a premium price for our securities or otherwise not be in the best interests of our stockholders.
our rights and the rights of our stockholders to take action against our directors and officers are limited.
maryland law provides that a director or officer has no liability in that capacity if he or she performs his or her duties in good faith, in a manner he or she reasonably believes to be in our best interests and with the care that an ordinarily prudent person in a like position would use under similar circumstances. in addition, our charter eliminates our directors' and officers' liability to us and our stockholders for money damages except for liability resulting from actual receipt of an improper benefit in money, property or services or active and deliberate dishonesty established by a final judgment and which is material to the cause of action. our bylaws require us to indemnify our directors and officers for liability resulting from actions taken by them in those capacities to the maximum extent permitted by maryland law. as a result, we and our stockholders may have more limited rights against our directors and officers than might otherwise exist under common law. in addition, we may be obligated to fund the defense costs incurred by our directors and officers.
to the extent our distributions represent a return of capital for u.s. federal income tax purposes, our stockholders could recognize an increased capital gain upon a subsequent sale of common stock.
distributions in excess of our current and accumulated earnings and profits and not treated by us as a dividend will not be taxable to a u.s. stockholder under current u.s. federal income tax law to the extent those distributions do not exceed the stockholder's adjusted tax basis in his, her, or its common stock, but instead will constitute a return of capital and will reduce such adjusted basis. if distributions result in a reduction of a stockholder's adjusted basis in such holder's common stock, subsequent sales of such holder's common stock will result in recognition of an increased capital gain or decreased capital loss due to the reduction in such adjusted basis.
risks related to the real estate industry our primary business involves the ownership and operation of self-storage stores.
our current strategy is to own, operate, manage, acquire, develop and redevelop only self-storage stores. consequently, we are subject to risks inherent in investments in a single industry. because investments in real estate are inherently illiquid, this strategy makes it difficult for us to diversify our investment portfolio and to limit our risk when economic conditions change. decreases in market rents, negative tax, real estate and zoning law changes and changes in environmental protection laws may also increase our costs, lower the value of our investments and decrease our income, which would adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results.
illiquidity of real estate investments could significantly impede our ability to respond to adverse changes in the performance of our stores.
because real estate investments are relatively illiquid, our ability to promptly sell one or more stores in our portfolio in response to changing economic, financial and investment conditions is limited. the real estate market is affected by many factors, such as general economic conditions, availability of financing, interest rates and other factors, including supply and demand, that are beyond our control. we cannot predict whether we will be able to sell any store for the price or on the terms set by us or whether any price or other terms offered by a prospective purchaser would be acceptable to us. we also cannot predict the length of time needed to find a willing purchaser and to close the sale of a store.
we may be required to expend funds to correct defects or to make improvements before a store can be sold. we cannot assure you that we will have funds available to correct those defects or to make those improvements. in acquiring a store, we may agree to transfer restrictions that materially restrict us from selling that store for a period of time or impose other restrictions, such as a limitation on the amount of debt that can be placed or repaid on that store. these transfer restrictions would impede our ability to sell a store even if we deem it necessary or appropriate.
any investments in unimproved real property may take significantly longer to yield income-producing returns, if at all, and may result in additional costs to us to comply with re-zoning restrictions or environmental regulations.
we have invested in the past, and may invest in the future, in unimproved real property. unimproved properties generally take longer to yield income-producing returns based on the typical time required for development. any development of unimproved property may also expose us to the risks and uncertainties associated with re-zoning the land for a higher use or development and environmental concerns of governmental entities and/or community groups. any unsuccessful investments or delays in realizing an income-producing return or increased costs to develop unimproved real estate could restrict our ability to earn our targeted rate of return on an investment or adversely affect our ability to pay operating expenses which would harm our financial condition and operating results.
any negative perceptions of the self-storage industry generally may result in a decline in our stock price.
to the extent that the investing public has a negative perception of the self-storage industry, the value of our securities may be negatively impacted, which could result in our securities trading below the inherent value of our assets.
risks related to our debt financings disruptions in the financial markets could affect our ability to obtain debt financing on reasonable terms and have other adverse effects on us.
uncertainty in the credit markets may negatively impact our ability to access additional debt financing or to refinance existing debt maturities on favorable terms (or at all), which may negatively affect our ability to make acquisitions and fund development projects. a downturn in the credit markets may cause us to seek alternative sources of potentially less attractive financing, and may require us to adjust our business plan accordingly. in addition, these factors may make it more difficult for us to sell stores or may adversely affect the price we receive for stores that we do sell, as prospective buyers may experience increased costs of debt financing or difficulties in obtaining debt financing.
required payments of principal and interest on borrowings may leave us with insufficient cash to operate our stores or to pay the distributions currently contemplated or necessary to maintain our qualification as a reit and may expose us to the risk of default under our debt obligations.
as of december 31, 2016, we had approximately $4.4 billion of outstanding indebtedness. we may incur additional debt in connection with future acquisitions and development. we may borrow under our credit lines or borrow new funds to finance these future stores. additionally, we do not anticipate that our internally generated cash flow will be adequate to repay our existing indebtedness upon maturity and, therefore, we expect to repay our indebtedness through refinancings and equity and/or debt offerings. further, we may need to borrow funds in order to make cash distributions to maintain our qualification as a reit or to make our expected distributions.
if we are required to utilize our credit lines for purposes other than acquisition activity, this will reduce the amount available for acquisitions and could slow our growth. therefore, our level of debt and the limitations imposed on us by our debt agreements could have significant adverse consequences, including the following:
•   we may be unable to refinance our indebtedness at maturity or the refinancing terms may be less favorable than the terms of our original indebtedness;
•   because a portion of our debt bears interest at variable rates, an increase in interest rates could materially increase our interest expense;
•   we may be forced to dispose of one or more of our stores, possibly on disadvantageous terms;
•   after debt service, the amount available for cash distributions to our stockholders is reduced;
•   our debt level could place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors with less debt;
•   we may experience increased vulnerability to economic and industry downturns, reducing our ability to respond to changing business and economic conditions;
•   we may default on our obligations and the lenders or mortgagees may foreclose on our stores that secure their loans and receive an assignment of rents and leases;
•   our default under any one of our mortgage loans with cross-default or cross-collateralization provisions could result in a default on other indebtedness or result in the foreclosures of other stores.
increases in interest rates may increase our interest expense and adversely affect our cash flow and our ability to service our indebtedness and make cash distributions to our stockholders.
as of december 31, 2016, we had approximately $4.4 billion of debt outstanding, of which approximately $1.3 billion, or 30.0% was subject to variable interest rates (excluding debt with interest rate swaps). this variable rate debt had a weighted average interest rate of approximately 2.3% per annum. increases in interest rates on this variable rate debt would increase our interest expense, which could harm our cash flow and our ability to pay cash distributions. for example, if market rates of interest on this variable rate debt increased by 100 basis points, the increase in interest expense would decrease future earnings and cash flows by approximately $13.1 million annually.
failure to hedge effectively against interest rate changes may adversely affect our results of operations.
in certain cases we may seek to manage our exposure to interest rate volatility by using interest rate hedging arrangements. hedging involves risks, such as the risk that the counterparty may fail to honor its obligations under an arrangement. failure to hedge effectively against interest rate changes may adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and ability to make cash distributions to our stockholders.
risks related to qualification and operation as a reit to maintain our qualification as a reit, we may be forced to borrow funds on a short-term basis during unfavorable market conditions.
to qualify as a reit, we generally must distribute to our stockholders at least 90% of our net taxable income each year, excluding net capital gains, and we are subject to regular corporate income taxes to the extent that we distribute less than 100% of our net taxable income each year. in addition, we are subject to a 4% nondeductible excise tax on the amount, if any, by which distributions made by us in any calendar year are less than the sum of 85% of our ordinary income, 95% of our capital gain net income and 100% of our undistributed income from prior years. while historically we have satisfied these distribution requirements by making cash distributions to our stockholders, a reit is permitted to satisfy these requirements by making distributions of cash or other property, including, in limited circumstances, its own stock. assuming we continue to satisfy these distributions requirements with cash, we may need to borrow funds on a short-term basis, or possibly long-term, to meet the reit distribution requirements even if the then prevailing market conditions are not favorable for these borrowings. these borrowing needs could result from a difference in timing between the actual receipt of cash and inclusion of income for u.s. federal income tax purposes, or the effect of non-deductible capital expenditures, the creation of reserves or required debt amortization payments.
the maximum u.s. federal income tax rate for dividends paid by domestic corporations to individual u.s. stockholders is 20%. dividends paid by reits, however, are generally not eligible for the reduced rates. the more favorable rates applicable to regular corporate dividends could cause stockholders who are individuals to perceive investments in reits to be relatively less attractive than investments in the stocks of non-reit corporations that pay dividends, which could adversely affect the value of the stock of reits, including our securities.
in addition, the relative attractiveness of real estate in general may be adversely affected by the favorable tax treatment given to corporate dividends, which could negatively affect the value of our stores.
the rules dealing with u.s. federal income taxation are constantly under review by persons involved in the legislative process and by the irs and the u.s. treasury department. changes to tax laws (which changes may have retroactive application) could adversely affect our stockholders. it cannot be predicted whether, when, in what forms, or with what effective dates, the tax laws applicable to us or our stockholders will be changed.
the power of our board of directors to revoke our reit election without stockholder approval may cause adverse consequences to our stockholders.
our charter provides that our board of directors may revoke or otherwise terminate our reit election, without the approval of our stockholders, if it determines that it is no longer in our best interest to continue to qualify as a reit. if we cease to qualify as a reit, we would become subject to u.s. federal income tax on our taxable income and would no longer be required to distribute most of our net taxable income to our stockholders, which may have adverse consequences on the total return to our stockholders.
our failure to qualify as a reit would have significant adverse consequences to us and the value of our stock.
we believe we operate in a manner that allows us to qualify as a reit for u.s. federal income tax purposes under the internal revenue code. if we fail to qualify as a reit or lose our qualification as a reit at any time, we will face serious tax consequences that would substantially reduce the funds available for distribution for each of the years involved because:
•   unless we are entitled to relief under applicable statutory provisions, we could not elect to be taxed as a reit for four taxable years following a year during which we were disqualified.
in addition, if we fail to qualify as a reit, we will not be required to make distributions to stockholders, and all distributions to stockholders will be subject to tax as regular corporate dividends to the extent of our current and accumulated earnings and profits. this means that our u.s. individual stockholders would be taxed on our dividends at capital gains rates, and our u.s. corporate stockholders would be entitled to the dividends received deduction with respect to such dividends, subject, in each case, to applicable limitations under the internal revenue code. if we fail to qualify as a reit for federal income tax purposes and are able to avail ourselves of one or more of the relief provisions under the internal revenue code in order to maintain our reit status, we may nevertheless be required to pay penalty taxes of $50,000 or more for each such failure. as a result of all these factors, our failure to qualify as a reit also could impair our ability to expand our business and raise capital, and could adversely affect the value of our securities.
qualification as a reit involves the application of highly technical and complex internal revenue code provisions for which there are only limited judicial and administrative interpretations. the complexity of these provisions and of the applicable treasury regulations that have been promulgated under the internal revenue code is greater in the case of a reit that, like us, holds its assets through a partnership. the determination of various factual matters and circumstances not entirely within our control may affect our ability to qualify as a reit. in order to qualify as a reit, we must satisfy a number of requirements, including requirements regarding the composition of our assets, the sources of our gross income and the owners of our stock. our ability to satisfy the asset tests depends upon our analysis of the fair market value of our assets, some of which are not susceptible to precise determination, and for which we will not obtain independent appraisals. also, we must make distributions to stockholders aggregating annually at least 90% of our net taxable income, excluding capital gains, and we will be subject to income tax at regular corporate rates to the extent we distribute less than 100% of our net taxable income including capital gains. in addition, legislation, new regulations, administrative interpretations or court decisions may adversely affect our investors, our ability to qualify as a reit for u.s. federal income tax purposes or the desirability of an investment in a reit relative to other investments. although we believe that we have been organized and have operated in a manner that is intended to allow us to qualify for taxation as a reit, we can give no assurance that we have qualified or will continue to qualify as a reit for tax purposes. we have not requested and do not plan to request a ruling from the internal revenue service regarding our qualification as a reit.
even though we qualify as a reit for u.s. federal income tax purposes, we will be required to pay some u.s. federal, state and local taxes on our income and property. extra space management, inc. manages stores for our joint ventures and stores owned by third parties. we, jointly with extra space management, inc., elected to treat extra space management, inc. as a taxable reit subsidiary ("trs") of our company for u.s. federal income tax purposes. a taxable reit subsidiary is a fully taxable corporation, and may be limited in its ability to deduct interest payments made to us. esm reinsurance limited, a wholly-owned subsidiary of extra space management, inc., generates income from insurance premiums that are subject to federal income tax and state insurance premiums tax. in addition, we will be subject to a 100% penalty tax on certain amounts if the economic arrangements among our tenants, our taxable reit subsidiary and us are not comparable to similar arrangements among unrelated parties or if we receive payments for inventory or property held for sale to customers in the
ordinary course of business. also, if we sell property as a dealer (i.e., to customers in the ordinary course of our trade or business), we will be subject to a 100% penalty tax on any gain arising from such sales. while we do not intend to sell stores as a dealer, the irs could take a contrary position. to the extent that we are, or our taxable reit subsidiary is, required to pay u.s. federal, state or local taxes, we will have less cash available for distribution to stockholders.
to qualify as a reit for u.s. federal income tax purposes, we must continually satisfy tests concerning, among other things, the sources of our income, the nature and diversification of our assets, the amounts we distribute to our stockholders and the ownership of our stock. in order to meet these tests, we may be required to forgo attractive business or investment opportunities. thus, compliance with the reit requirements may adversely affect our ability to operate solely to maximize profits.

overview we are a fully integrated, self-administered and self-managed real estate investment trust, or reit, formed to continue the business commenced in 1977 by extra space storage llc and its subsidiaries to own, operate, manage, acquire, develop and redevelop professionally managed stores.
at december 31, 2016, we owned, had ownership interests in, or managed 1,427 operating stores in 38 states, washington, d.c. and puerto rico. of these 1,427 operating stores, we owned 836, we held joint venture interests in 180 stores, and our taxable reit subsidiary, extra space management, inc., operated an additional 411 stores that are owned by third parties. these operating stores contain approximately 107 million square feet of rentable space in approximately 960,000 units and currently serve a customer base of approximately 850,000 tenants.
our stores are generally situated in convenient, highly visible locations clustered around large population centers such as atlanta, baltimore/washington, d.c., boston, chicago, dallas, houston, las vegas, los angeles, miami, new york city, orlando, philadelphia, phoenix, st. petersburg/tampa and san francisco/oakland. these areas all enjoy above average population growth and income levels. the clustering of our assets around these population centers enables us to reduce our operating costs through economies of scale. we consider a store to be in the lease-up stage after it has been issued a certificate of occupancy, but before it has achieved stabilization. we consider a store to be stabilized once it has achieved either an 80% occupancy rate for a full year measured as of january 1 of the current year, or has been open for three years prior to the january 1 of the current year.
to maximize the performance of our stores, we employ industry-leading revenue management systems. developed by our management team, these systems enable us to analyze, set and adjust rental rates in real time across our portfolio in order to respond to changing market conditions. we believe our systems and processes allow us to more proactively manage revenues.
we derive substantially all of our revenues from rents received from tenants under leases at each of our wholly-owned stores, from management fees on the stores we manage for joint-venture partners and unaffiliated third parties, and from our tenant reinsurance program. our management fee is generally equal to approximately 6.0% of cash collected from total revenues generated by the managed stores. we also receive an asset management fee of 0.5% of the total asset value from one of our joint ventures.
we operate in competitive markets, often where consumers have multiple stores from which to choose. competition has impacted, and will continue to impact, our store results. we experience seasonal fluctuations in occupancy levels, with occupancy levels generally higher in the summer months due to increased moving activity. our operating results depend materially on our ability to lease available self-storage units, to actively manage unit rental rates, and on the ability of our
tenants to make required rental payments. we believe that we are able to respond quickly and effectively to changes in local, regional and national economic conditions by adjusting rental rates through the combination of our revenue management team and our industry-leading technology systems.
we continue to evaluate a range of new initiatives and opportunities in order to enable us to maximize stockholder value. our strategies to maximize stockholder value include the following:
•   maximize the performance of our stores through strategic, efficient and proactive management. we pursue revenue-generating and expense-minimizing opportunities in our operations. our revenue management team seeks to maximize revenue by responding to changing market conditions through our advanced technology system's ability to provide real-time, interactive rental rate and discount management. our size allows us greater ability than the majority of our competitors to implement more effective online marketing programs, which we believe will attract more customers to our stores at a lower net cost.
•   acquire self-storage stores. our acquisitions team continues to pursue the acquisition of multi-store portfolios and single stores that we believe can provide stockholder value. we have established a reputation as a reliable, ethical buyer, which we believe enhances our ability to negotiate and close acquisitions. in addition, we believe our status as an upreit enables flexibility when structuring deals. we continue to review available acquisitions. as interest rates increase, our expectation is that capitalization rates will also increase and that prices will begin to decrease. we remain a disciplined buyer and only execute acquisitions that we believe will strengthen our portfolio and increase stockholder value.
•   expand our management business. our management business enables us to generate increased revenues through management fees and expand our geographic footprint. we believe this expanded footprint enables us to reduce our operating costs through economies of scale. in addition, we see our management business as a future acquisition pipeline. we pursue strategic relationships with owners whose stores would enhance our portfolio in the event an opportunity arises to acquire such stores.
critical accounting policies and estimates our financial statements have been prepared in accordance with u.s. generally accepted accounting principles. the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amount of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. on an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and assumptions, including those that impact our most critical accounting policies. we base our estimates and assumptions on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances. a summary of significant accounting policies is also provided in the notes to our consolidated financial statements (see note 2 to our consolidated financial statements). actual results may differ from these estimates. we believe the following are our most critical accounting policies:
consolidation: arrangements that are not controlled through voting or similar rights are accounted for as variable interest entities ("vies"). an enterprise is required to consolidate a vie if it is the primary beneficiary of the vie.
a vie is created when (i) the equity investment at risk is not sufficient to permit the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties, or (ii) the entity's equity holders as a group either: (a) lack the power, through voting or similar rights, to direct the activities of the entity that most significantly impact the entity's economic performance, (b) are not obligated to absorb expected losses of the entity if they occur, or (c) do not have the right to receive expected residual returns of the entity if they occur. if an entity is deemed to be a vie, the enterprise that is deemed to have a variable interest, or combination of variable interests, that provides the enterprise with a controlling financial interest in the vie is considered the primary beneficiary and must consolidate the vie.
we have concluded that under certain circumstances when we enter into arrangements for the formation of joint ventures, a vie may be created under condition (i) or (ii)(b) or (ii)(c) of the previous paragraph. for each vie created, we have performed a qualitative analysis, including considering which party, if any, has the power to direct the activities most significant to the economic performance of each vie and whether that party has the obligation to absorb losses of the vie or the right to receive benefits from the vie that could be significant to the vie. if we are determined to be the primary beneficiary of the vie, the assets, liabilities and operations of the vie are consolidated with our financial statements. as of december 31, 2016, we had no consolidated vies. additionally, our operating partnership has notes payable to three trusts that are vies under condition (ii)(a) above. since the operating partnership is not the primary beneficiary of the trusts, these vies are not consolidated.
real estate assets: real estate assets are stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation. direct and allowable internal costs associated with the development, construction, renovation, and improvement of real estate assets are capitalized. interest, property taxes, and other costs associated with development incurred during the construction period are capitalized.
expenditures for maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred. major replacements and betterments that improve or extend the life of the asset are capitalized and depreciated over their estimated useful lives. depreciation is computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the buildings and improvements, which are generally between 5 and 39 years.
in connection with our acquisition of operating stores, the purchase price is allocated to the tangible and intangible assets and liabilities acquired based on their fair values, which are estimated using significant unobservable inputs. the value of the tangible assets, consisting of land and buildings, is determined as if vacant. intangible assets, which represent the value of existing tenant relationships, are recorded at their fair values based on the avoided cost to replace the current leases. we measure the value of tenant relationships based on the rent lost due to the amount of time required to replace existing customers, which is based on our historical experience with turnover in our facilities. debt assumed as part of an acquisition is recorded at fair value based on current interest rates compared to contractual rates. acquisition-related transaction costs are expensed as incurred.
stores purchased at the time of certificate of occupancy issuance are considered asset acquisitions. as such, the purchase price is allocated to the land and buildings acquired based on their fair values. any debt assumed as part of the acquisition is recorded at fair value based on current interest rates compared to contractual rates. acquisition-related transactions costs are capitalized as part of the purchase price.
intangible lease rights include: (1) purchase price amounts allocated to leases on three stores that cannot be classified as ground or building leases; these rights are amortized to expense over the term of the leases; and (2) intangibles related to ground leases on eight stores where the ground leases were assumed by us at rates that were different than the current market rates for similar leases. the value associated with these assumed leases were recorded as intangibles, which will be amortized over the lease terms.
evaluation of asset impairment: long lived assets held for use are evaluated for impairment when events or circumstances indicate that there may be impairment. we review each store at least annually to determine if any such events or circumstances have occurred or exist. we focus on stores where occupancy and/or rental income have decreased by a significant amount. for these stores, we determine whether the decrease is temporary or permanent and whether the store will likely recover the lost occupancy and/or revenue in the short term. in addition, we review stores in the lease-up stage and compare actual operating results to original projections.
when we determine that an event that may indicate impairment has occurred, we compare the carrying value of the related long-lived assets to the undiscounted future net operating cash flows attributable to the assets. an impairment loss is recorded if the net carrying value of the assets exceeds the undiscounted future net operating cash flows attributable to the assets. the impairment loss recognized equals the excess of net carrying value over the related fair value of the assets.
when real estate assets are identified as held for sale, we discontinue depreciating the assets and estimate the fair value of the assets, net of selling costs. if the estimated fair value, net of selling costs, of the assets that have been identified as held for sale is less than the net carrying value of the assets, we would recognize a loss on the disposal group classified as held for sale. the operations of assets held for sale or sold during the period are presented as part of normal operations for all periods presented.
investments in unconsolidated real estate ventures: our investments in real estate joint ventures where we have significant influence but not control, and joint ventures which are vies in which we are not the primary beneficiary, are recorded under the equity method of accounting on the accompanying consolidated financial statements.
under the equity method, our investment in real estate ventures is stated at cost and adjusted for our share of net earnings or losses and reduced by distributions. equity in earnings of real estate ventures is generally recognized based on our ownership interest in the earnings of each of the unconsolidated real estate ventures. for the purposes of presentation in the statement of cash flows, we follow the "look through" approach for classification of distributions from joint ventures. under this approach, distributions are reported under operating cash flow unless the facts and circumstances of a specific distribution clearly indicate that it is a return of capital (e.g., a liquidating dividend or distribution of the proceeds from the joint venture's sale of assets) in which case it is reported as an investing activity.
our management assesses annually whether there are any indicators that the value of our investments in unconsolidated real estate ventures may be impaired and when events or circumstances indicate that there may be impairment. an investment is impaired if management's estimate of the fair value of the investment, using significant unobservable inputs, is less than its carrying value. to the extent impairment has occurred and is considered to be other than temporary, the loss is measured as the excess of the carrying amount of the investment over the fair value of the investment.
derivative instruments and hedging activities: the accounting for changes in the fair value of derivatives depends on the intended use of the derivative and the resulting designation. derivatives used to hedge the exposure to changes in the fair value of an asset, liability or firm commitment attributable to a particular risk, are considered fair value hedges. derivatives used to hedge the exposure to variability in expected future cash flows, or other types of forecasted transactions, are considered cash flow hedges.
for derivatives designated as fair value hedges, changes in the fair value of the derivative and the hedged item related to the hedged risk are recognized in earnings. for derivatives designated as cash flow hedges, the effective portion of changes in the fair value of the derivative is initially reported in other comprehensive income, outside of earnings and subsequently reclassified to earnings when the hedged transaction affects earnings.
revenue and expense recognition: rental revenues are recognized as earned based upon amounts that are currently due from tenants. leases are generally on month-to-month terms. prepaid rents are recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the leases. promotional discounts are recognized as a reduction to rental income over the promotional period. late charges, administrative fees, merchandise sales and truck rentals are recognized in income when earned. management fee revenues are recognized monthly as services are performed and in accordance with the terms of the related management agreements. equity in earnings of real estate entities is recognized based on our ownership interest in the earnings of each of the unconsolidated real estate entities. interest income is recognized as earned.
property expenses, including utilities, property taxes, repairs and maintenance and other costs to manage the facilities are recognized as incurred. we accrue for property tax expense based upon invoice amounts, estimates and historical trends. if these estimates are incorrect, the timing of expense recognition could be affected.
tenant reinsurance premiums are recognized as revenue over the period of insurance coverage. we record an unpaid claims liability at the end of each period based on existing unpaid claims and historical claims payment history. the unpaid claims liability represents an estimate of the ultimate cost to settle all unpaid claims as of each period end, including both reported but unpaid claims and claims that may have been incurred but have not been reported. we use a third party claims administrator to adjust all tenant reinsurance claims received. the administrator evaluates each claim to determine the ultimate claim loss and includes an estimate for claims that may have been incurred but not reported. annually, a third party actuary evaluates the adequacy of the unpaid claims liability. prior year claim reserves are adjusted as experience develops or new information becomes known. the impact of such adjustments is included in the current period operations. the unpaid claims liability is not discounted to its present value. each tenant chooses the amount of insurance coverage they want through the tenant reinsurance program. tenants can purchase policies in amounts of two thousand dollars to ten thousand dollars of insurance coverage in exchange for a monthly fee. our exposure per claim is limited by the maximum amount of coverage chosen by each tenant. we purchase reinsurance for losses exceeding a set amount on any one event. we do not currently have any amounts recoverable under the reinsurance arrangements.
income taxes: we have elected to be treated as a reit under sections 856 through 860 of the internal revenue code. in order to maintain our qualification as a reit, among other things, we are required to distribute at least 90% of our reit taxable income to our stockholders and meet certain tests regarding the nature of our income and assets. as a reit, we are not subject to federal income tax with respect to that portion of our income which meets certain criteria and is distributed annually to our stockholders. we plan to continue to operate so that we meet the requirements for taxation as a reit. many of these requirements, however, are highly technical and complex. if we were to fail to meet these requirements, we would be subject to federal income tax. we are subject to certain state and local taxes. provision for such taxes has been included in income tax expense in our consolidated statements of operations.
we have elected to treat one of our corporate subsidiaries, extra space management, inc., as a taxable reit subsidiary ("trs"). in general, our trs may perform additional services for tenants and generally may engage in any real estate or non-real estate related business. a trs is subject to corporate federal income tax. deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities. interest and penalties relating to uncertain tax positions will be recognized in income tax expense when incurred.

results of operations comparison of the year ended december 31, 2016 to the year ended december 31, 2015
overview results for the year ended december 31, 2016 included the operations of 1,016 stores (836 wholly-owned, one in a consolidated joint venture, and 179 in joint ventures accounted for using the equity method) compared to the results for the year ended december 31, 2015, which included the operations of 999 stores (746 wholly-owned, one in a consolidated joint venture, and 252 in joint ventures accounted for using the equity method).
revenues the following table presents information on revenues earned for the years indicated:
2016                                                    2015                                $ change           % change revenues:
management fees and other income        39,842                      34,161                5,681             16.6      %
property rental-the increase in property rental revenues for the year ended december 31, 2016 was primarily the result of an increase of $144,985 associated with acquisitions completed in 2016 and 2015. we acquired 99 stores during the year ended december 31, 2016 and 171 stores during the year ended december 31, 2015. property rental revenue also increased by $42,171 during the year ended december 31, 2016 as a result of increases in rental rates to new and existing customers at our stabilized stores. revenues at our lease-up stores increased by $3,439 for the year ended december 31, 2016 due primarily to increases in occupancy. the achieved rental rate to new tenants on wholly owned properties for the year ended december 31, 2016 increased an average of approximately 7.0% over the prior year. these increases were offset by decreases in property revenue of $1,991 for the year ended december 31, 2016 related to the sales of stores during 2016.
management fees and other income-our trs manages stores owned by our joint ventures and third parties. management fees generally represent 6.0% of cash collected from stores owned by third parties and unconsolidated joint ventures. we also earn an asset management fee from the storage portfolio i ("spi") joint venture, equal to 0.50% multiplied by the total asset value, provided certain conditions are met. the increase in management fees is due primarily to an increase in the revenues at the stores we managed. at december 31, 2016, we managed 591 stores for third parties and non-consolidated joint ventures, compared to 601 stores at december 31, 2015. the decrease in the number of stores managed is due primarily to our acquisition of 40 stores from our joint ventures during 2016.
expenses the following table presents information on expenses for the years indicated:
2016                                                       2015                              $ change            % change expenses:
property operations-the increase in property operations expense consists primarily of an increase of $45,055 related to acquisitions completed in 2016 and 2015. we acquired 99 operating stores during the year ended december 31, 2016 and 171 stores during the year ended december 31, 2015.
tenant reinsurance-tenant reinsurance expense represents the costs that are incurred to provide tenant reinsurance. the change is due primarily to the increase in the number of stores we owned and/or managed. at december 31, 2016, we owned and/or managed 1,427 stores compared to 1,347 stores at december 31, 2015.
acquisition related costs and other-these costs relate primarily to acquisition activities during the periods indicated. the decrease in these expenses for the year ended december 31, 2016 compared to the prior year was due to a decrease in the number of acquisitions. we acquired 99 properties during the year ended december 31, 2016 compared to 171 during the prior year. included in the acquisitions completed in 2015 was the acquisition of smartstop self storage inc. ("smartstop") on october 1, 2015. as part of this acquisition, we recorded an expense of $38,360 related to defeasance costs and prepayment penalties incurred related to the repayment of smartstop's existing debt as of the acquisition date. we incurred $8,053 of professional fess/closing costs, $6,338 of severance-related costs, $1,327 of other payroll-related costs and $9,043 of other acquisition related costs as a result of the acquisition of smartstop, for a total of $63,121.
general and administrative-general and administrative expenses primarily include all expenses not directly related to our stores, including corporate payroll, travel and professional fees. these expenses are recognized as incurred. general and administrative expenses for the year ended december 31, 2016 increased when compared to the same periods in the prior year primarily due to the overall cost associated with the management of additional stores. at december 31, 2016, we owned and/or managed 1,427 stores compared to 1,347 stores at december 31, 2015. additionally, during 2016, we accrued a $4,000 expense related to the potential settlement of a legal action. we did not observe any material trends in specific payroll, travel or other expenses that contributed significantly to the increase in general and administrative expenses apart from the increase due to the management of additional stores.
depreciation and amortization-depreciation and amortization expense increased as a result of the acquisition of new stores. we acquired 99 operating stores during the year ended december 31, 2016, and 171 operating stores during the year ended december 31, 2015.
other income and expenses the following table presents information on other revenues and expenses for the years indicated:
2016                                                                                                                                                                                         2015             $ change              % change other income and expenses:

equity in earnings of unconsolidated real estate ventures                                                                                               12,895                      12,351                    544                 4.4      %
equity in earnings of unconsolidated real estate ventures - gain on sale of real estate assets and purchase of joint venture partners' interests        69,199                       2,857                 66,342             2,322.1      %
gain on real estate transactions, earnout from prior acquisition and sale of other assets- during the year ended december 31, 2016, through various transactions, we sold a total of nine stores located in indiana, ohio and texas. we received a total of $22,002 in cash and 85,452 of our op units valued at $7,689 in exchange for these stores. the operating partnership has canceled the op units received. we recognized a total gain of $11,358 related to these dispositions.
during 2014, we acquired a portfolio of five stores. as part of this acquisition, we agreed to make an additional cash payment to the sellers if the acquired stores exceeded a specified amount of net operating income for the years ending december 31, 2015 and 2016. at the acquisition date, we recorded an estimated liability related to this provision. as the operating income of these stores during the earnout period was higher than originally estimated, an additional payment was due to the sellers of $4,284, which was recorded as a loss during 2016.
in 2011, we acquired a single store in florida. as part of the acquisition, we agreed to make an additional cash payment to the sellers if the acquired store exceeded a specified amount of net rental income for the period of 12 consecutive months ending june 30, 2015. during 2014, we recorded a liability of $2,500 as an estimate of the payment that would become due. the $400 gain recorded during 2015 represents the adjustment needed to true up the existing liability to the amount owed to the sellers as of june 30, 2015.
during 2015, we determined that one of our acquisitions was purchased at below its market value, and therefore recorded a $1,101 gain at the time of the acquisition, which represents the excess of the fair value of the store acquired over the consideration paid.
interest expense-the increase in interest expense during the year ended december 31, 2016 was primarily the result of higher debt balances when compared to the prior year. the total face value of our debt, including our lines of credit, was $4,363,697 at december 31, 2016 compared to $3,598,254 at december 31, 2015.
non-cash interest expense related to amortization of discount on equity component of exchangeable senior notes-represents the amortization of the discounts related to the equity components of the exchangeable senior notes issued by our operating partnership. our operating partnership has issued and outstanding 2.375% exchangeable senior notes due 2033 (the "2013 notes") and 3.125% exchangeable senior notes due 2035 (the "2015 notes.") the 2013 notes and the 2015 notes both have an effective interest rate of 4.0% relative to the carrying amount of the liability. the increase for the year ended december 31, 2016 when compared to the same period in the prior year is due to the issuance of $575,000 principal amount of the 2015 notes in september 2015 and related discount of $22,597.
interest income-interest income represents amounts earned on cash and cash equivalents deposited with financial institutions and interest earned on notes receivable. the increase for the year ended december 31, 2016 is related primarily to the increase in the average notes receivable balances outstanding when compared to the prior year. the majority of the increase in interest income related to the $84,331 of notes receivable issued in conjunction with the acquisition of smartstop in october 2015. these notes have a 7.0% interest rate which increases to 9.0% in february 2017. as of december 31, 2016, the remaining principal balance was $52,201.
interest income on note receivable from preferred operating partnership unit holder-represents interest on a $100,000 loan to the holder of the operating partnership's series a participating redeemable preferred units (the "series a units").
equity in earnings of unconsolidated real estate ventures-equity in earnings of unconsolidated real estate ventures represents the income earned through our ownership interests in unconsolidated joint ventures. the increase for the year ended december 31, 2016 compared to the same period in the prior year was primarily the result of an increase in our ownership interest from 2.0% to approximately 4.0% in the ess prisa llc ("prisa") joint venture and from 2.0% to approximately 4.4% in the ess prisa ii llc ("prisa ii") joint venture, as well as an increase in revenue at the stores owned by our joint ventures. these increases were offset by an overall decrease in the number of stores owned by our joint ventures, primarily due to our acquisition of 40 of these stores as noted below.
on april 25, 2016, we and affiliates of prudential financial, inc. ("prudential") entered into the "second amendment to amended and restated operating agreement of ess prisa llc" and the "first amendment to amended and restated operating agreement of ess prisa ii llc" (the "amendments"). the amendments are deemed effective as of april 1, 2016. under the amendments, we gave up any future rights to receive distributions from these joint ventures at the higher "excess profit participation" percentage of 17.0% in exchange for a higher equity ownership percentage. our equity ownership in ess prisa llc increased from 2.0% to 4.0%, and our equity ownership in ess prisa ii llc increased from 2.0% to 4.4%.
equity in earnings of unconsolidated real estate ventures-gain on sale of real estate assets and purchase of joint venture partners' interests-on november 17, 2016, we acquired 11 stores from our ess wcot llc joint venture ("wcot") in a step acquisition. we owned 5.0% of wcot, with the other 95.0% owned by affiliates of prudential. wcot created a new subsidiary, extra space storage 132 llc ("ess 132"), and transferred 11 stores into ess 132. wcot then distributed ess 132 to prudential and us on a pro rata basis. this distribution was accounted for as a spinoff, and was therefore recorded at the net carrying amount of the properties of $68,814 . immediately after the distribution, we acquired prudential's 95.0% interest in ess 132 for $153,304, resulting in 100% ownership of ess 132 and the related 11 stores. based on the purchase price of prudential's share of ess 132, we determined that the fair value of our investment in ess 132 immediately prior to the acquisition of prudential's share was $8,119, and we recorded a gain of $4,651 as a result of re-measuring to fair value our existing equity interest in ess 132.
on september 16, 2016, we acquired 23 stores from prisa ii in a step acquisition. we owned 4.4% of prisa ii, with the other 95.6% owned by affiliates of prudential. prisa ii created a new subsidiary, extra space properties 131 llc ("esp 131"), and transferred 23 stores into esp 131. prisa ii then distributed esp 131 to prudential and us on a pro rata basis. this distribution was accounted for as a spinoff, and was therefore recorded at the net carrying amount of the properties of $4,326. immediately after the distribution, we acquired prudential's 95.6% interest in esp 131 for $238,679, resulting in 100% ownership of esp 131 and the related 23 stores. based on the purchase price of prudential's share of esp 131, we determined that the fair value of our investment in esp 131 immediately prior to the acquisition of prudential's share was $10,988, and we recorded a gain of $6,778 as a result of re-measuring to fair value our existing equity interest in esp 131. subsequent to these transactions, prisa ii owned 42 stores. we then sold our remaining interest in prisa ii to prudential for $34,758 in cash. as a result of this sale, we recognized a gain of $30,846.
on february 2, 2016, we acquired six stores from our vrs self storage llc joint venture ("vrs") in a step acquisition. we owned 45.0% of vrs, with the other 55.0% owned by prudential. vrs created a new subsidiary, extra space properties 122 llc ("esp 122") and transferred six stores into esp 122. vrs then distributed esp 122 to prudential and us on a pro rata basis. this distribution was accounted for as a spinoff, and was therefore recorded at the net carrying amount of the properties of $17,261, immediately after the distribution, we acquired prudential's 55.0% interest in esp 122 for $53,940, resulting in 100% ownership of esp 122 and the related six stores. based on the purchase price of prudential's share of esp 122, we determined that the fair value of our investment in esp 122 immediately prior to the acquisition of prudential's share was $44,184, and we recorded a gain of $26,923 as a result of re-measuring to fair value our existing equity interest in esp 122.
in march 2015, one of our joint ventures sold a store located in new york to a third party and recognized a gain of $60,495. we recognized our 2.0% share of this gain, or $1,228.
in march 2015 we acquired a joint venture partner's 82.4% equity interest in an existing joint venture which had one store. we previously held the remaining 17.6% equity interest in this joint venture. prior to the acquisition, we accounted for our equity interest in this joint venture as an equity-method investment. we recognized a non-cash gain of $1,629 as a result of re-measuring the fair value of our equity interest in this joint venture held before the acquisition.

property rental-the change in property rental revenues consists primarily of an increase of $69,622 associated with acquisitions completed in 2015 and 2014. we acquired 171 operating stores during 2015 and 51 stores during 2014. in addition, revenues increased by $47,560 as a result of increases in occupancy and rental rates to new and existing customers at our stabilized stores. we saw no significant increase in overall customer renewal rates and our average length of stay was approximately 13.7 months. for existing customers we generally seek to increase rental rates approximately 7% to 10% at least annually. rental rates to new tenants increased by approximately 8.9% over the prior year. occupancy at our stabilized stores increased to 91.1% at december 31, 2015, as compared to 89.6% at december 31, 2014.
tenant reinsurance-the increase in tenant reinsurance revenues was partially due to the increase in overall customer participation to approximately 72.8% at december 31, 2015, compared to approximately 70.7% at december 31, 2014. in addition, we operated 1,347 stores at december 31, 2015, compared to 1,088 stores at december 31, 2014.
management fees and other income-our trs manages stores owned by our joint ventures and third parties. management fees generally represent 6.0% of cash collected from stores owned by third parties and unconsolidated joint ventures. we also earn an asset management fee from the storage portfolio i ("spi") joint venture, equal to 0.50% multiplied by the total asset value, provided certain conditions are met. the increase in management fees is due to an increase in the number of properties managed. at december 31, 2015, we managed 348 stores, compared to 260 stores at december 31, 2014.
expenses the following table presents information on expenses for the years indicated:

tenant reinsurance-tenant reinsurance expense represents the costs that are incurred to provide tenant reinsurance. the change is due primarily to the increase in the number of stores we owned and/or managed. at december 31, 2015, we owned and/or managed 1,347 stores compared to 1,088 stores at december 31, 2014. in addition, there was an increase in overall customer participation to approximately 72.8% at december 31, 2015 from approximately 70.7% at december 31, 2014.
acquisition related costs-these costs relate to acquisition activities during the periods indicated. the increase for the year ended december 31, 2015 when compared to the prior year was related primarily to the acquisition of smartstop on october 1, 2015. as part of this acquisition, we recorded an expense of $38,360 related to defeasance costs and prepayment penalties incurred related to the repayment of smartstop's existing debt as of the acquisition date. we incurred $8,053 of professional fees/closing costs, $6,338 of severance-related costs, $1,327 of other payroll-related costs and $9,043 of other acquisition related costs as a result of the acquisition of smartstop, for a total of $63,121. additionally, we acquired 49 other properties during the year ended december 31, 2015.
general and administrative-general and administrative expenses primarily include all expenses not related to our stores, including corporate payroll, travel and professional fees. the expenses are recognized as incurred. general and administrative expense increased over the prior year primarily as a result of the costs related to the management of additional stores. during the year ended december 31, 2015, we acquired 171 stores, 161 of which we did not previously manage. during the year ended december 31, 2014, we acquired 51 stores, 30 of which we did not previously manage. we did not observe any

gain (loss) on real estate transactions, earnout from prior acquisitions and sale of other assets-during 2011, we acquired a store located in florida. as part of this acquisition, we agreed to make an additional cash payment to the sellers if the acquired store exceeded a specified amount of net rental income for any twelve-month period prior to june 30, 2015. at the acquisition date, $133 was recorded as the estimated amount that would be due, and we believed that it was unlikely that any significant additional payment would be made as a result of this earnout provision. because the rental growth of the stores trended significantly higher than expected, we recorded additional liability of $2,500. this amount is included in gain (loss) on sale of real estate and earnout from prior acquisitions on our consolidated statements of operations for the year ended december 31, 2014. the $400 gain recorded during the year ended december 31, 2015 represents the adjustment needed to true up the existing liability to the amount owed to the sellers as of june 30, 2015.
during the year ended december 31, 2015, we determined that one of our acquisitions was purchased at below its market value, and we therefore recorded a $1,101 gain, which represents the excess of the fair value of the store acquired over the consideration paid.
during 2012, we acquired a portfolio of ten stores. as part of this acquisition, we agreed to make an additional cash payment to the sellers if the acquired stores exceeded a specified amount of net rental income two years after the acquisition date. at the acquisition date, we believed that it was unlikely that any significant payment would be made as a result of this earnout provision. the rental growth of the stores was significantly higher than expected, resulting in a payment to the sellers of $7,785. this amount is included in gain (loss) on sale of real estate and earnout from prior acquisitions on our consolidated statements of operations for the year ended december 31, 2014.
property casualty loss, net-in october 2014, a store located in venice, california, was damaged by a fire. as a result, we recorded a loss, net of insurance recoveries, of $1,724.
interest expense-interest expense increased due to the increase in total amount of debt outstanding. this increase was partially offset by a decrease in the average interest rate. at december 31, 2015, our total face value of debt was $3,598,254, compared to a total face value of debt of $2,379,657 at december 31, 2014. the average interest rate was 3.1% as of december 31, 2015, compared to 3.4% as of december 31, 2014.
non-cash interest expense related to amortization of discount on equity component of exchangeable senior notes-represents the amortization of the discount related to the equity component of the exchangeable senior notes issued by our operating partnership. in june 2013, our operating partnership issued $250,000 of its 2013 notes. in september 2015, our operating partnership issued $575,000 of its 2015 notes, and repurchased $164,636 principal amount of the 2013 notes. both the 2013 notes and the 2015 notes have effective interest rates of 4.0%.
interest income-interest income represents amounts earned on cash and cash equivalents deposited with financial institutions and interest earned on notes receivable. the increase relates primarily to the increase in the average balance of notes receivable when compared to the prior year and an increase in our average cash balance. as part of the smartstop acquisition on october 1, 2015, we issued an $84,331 note receivable that accrues interest at 7.0% annually. we recorded approximately $1,476 of interest income related to this note receivable during the year ended december 31, 2015.
interest income on note receivable from preferred operating partnership unit holder-represents interest on a $100,000 loan to the holder of the series a units.
equity in earnings of unconsolidated real estate ventures-equity in earnings of unconsolidated real estate ventures represents the income earned through our ownership interests in unconsolidated joint ventures. the increase in equity in earnings for the year ended december 31, 2015 was due primarily to increases in revenue at the stores owned by the joint ventures.
equity in earnings of unconsolidated real estate ventures-gain on sale of real estate assets and purchase of joint venture partners' interests- during march 2015, one of our joint ventures sold a store located in new york to a third party and recognized a gain of $60,495. we recognized our 2.0% share of this gain, or $1,228. additionally, in march 2015 we acquired a joint venture partner's 82.4% equity interest in an existing joint venture. we previously held the remaining 17.6% equity interest in this joint venture. prior to the acquisition, we accounted for our equity interest in this joint venture as an equity-method investment. we recognized a non-cash gain of $1,629 during the three months ended march 31, 2015 as a result of re-measuring the fair value of our equity interest in this joint venture held before the acquisition.
in december 2013 and may 2014, as part of a larger acquisition, we acquired our joint venture partners' 60% to 65% equity interests in six stores located in california. we previously held the remaining 35% to 40% interests in these stores through six separate joint ventures with affiliates of grupe properties co. inc. ("grupe"). prior to the acquisition, we accounted for our interests in these joint ventures as equity-method investments. we recognized a non-cash gain of $3,438 during the year ended december 31, 2014, as a result of re-measuring the fair value of our equity interest in one of these joint ventures held before the acquisition. during the year ended december 31, 2014, we recorded an additional gain of $584 as a result of the final cash distributions received from the other five joint ventures associated with the acquisitions that were completed during 2013.
income tax expense-the increase in income tax expense relates primarily to an increase in income earned by our trs when compared to the same periods in the prior year. additionally, during the year ended december 31, 2014, we recorded the initial tax benefit related to a royalty fee that we charge quarterly to our captive insurance subsidiary, which reduced the tax expense for that period.
net income allocated to noncontrolling interests the following table presents information on net income allocated to noncontrolling interests for the years indicated:
2015                                                                                                    2014                        $ change                 % change net income allocated to noncontrolling interests:
net income allocated to preferred operating partnership noncontrolling interests   $(11,718      )             $(10,991      )      $(727       )          6.6      %
net income allocated to operating partnership and other noncontrolling interests   (8,344        )             (6,550        )      (1,794      )         27.4      %
net income allocated to preferred operating partnership noncontrolling interests-in december 2014, as part of the acquisition of a single store, our operating partnership issued 548,390 series d redeemable preferred units ("series d units"). the series d units have a liquidation value of $25.00 per unit, and receive distributions at an annual rate of 5.0%.
in december 2013 and may 2014, as part of a portfolio acquisition, our operating partnership issued 704,016 series c convertible redeemable preferred units ("series c units"). the series c units have a liquidation value of $42.10 per unit. from issuance until the fifth anniversary of issuance, the series c units receive distributions at an annual rate of $0.18 plus the then-payable quarterly distribution per op unit.
in april 2014, as part of a single store acquisition, our operating partnership issued 333,360 series b redeemable preferred units ("series b units"). during august and september 2013, as part of a portfolio acquisition, our operating partnership issued 1,342,727 series b units. the series b units have a liquidation value of $25.00 per unit and receive distributions at an annual rate of 6.0%.
income allocated to the preferred operating partnership noncontrolling interests for the years ended december 31, 2015 and 2014 represents the fixed distributions paid to the holders of the series a units, series b units, series c units and series d units, plus approximately 0.7% of the remaining net income allocated to the holders of the series a units.
net income allocated to operating partnership and other noncontrolling interests-income allocated to the operating partnership represents approximately 4.2% and 3.5% of net income after the allocation of the fixed distribution paid to the preferred operating partnership unit holders for the years ended december 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. the percentage of net income allocated to the operating partnership noncontrolling interest increased due to op units issued in conjunction with acquisitions during 2015.
funds from operations ffo provides relevant and meaningful information about our operating performance that is necessary, along with net income and cash flows, for an understanding of our operating results. we believe ffo is a meaningful disclosure as a supplement to net earnings. net earnings assume that the values of real estate assets diminish predictably over time as reflected through depreciation and amortization expenses. the values of real estate assets fluctuate due to market conditions and we believe ffo more accurately reflects the value of our real estate assets. ffo is defined by the national association of real estate investment trusts, inc. ("nareit") as net income computed in accordance with u.s. generally accepted accounting principles ("gaap"), excluding gains or losses on sales of operating stores and impairment write-downs of depreciable real estate assets, plus real estate related depreciation and amortization and after adjustments to record unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures on the same basis. we believe that to further understand our performance, ffo should be considered along with the reported net income and cash flows in accordance with gaap, as presented in the consolidated financial statements. ffo should not be considered a replacement of net income computed in accordance with gaap.
the computation of ffo may not be comparable to ffo reported by other reits or real estate companies that do not define the term in accordance with the current nareit definition or that interpret the current nareit definition differently. ffo does not represent cash generated from operating activities determined in accordance with gaap, and should not be considered as an alternative to net income as an indication of our performance, as an alternative to net cash flow from operating activities as a measure of our liquidity, or as an indicator of our ability to make cash distributions.
the following table presents the calculation of ffo for the periods indicated:

same-store results our same-store pool for the periods presented consists of 564 stores that are wholly-owned and operated and that were stabilized by the first day of the earliest calendar year presented. we consider a store to be stabilized once it has been open for three years or has sustained average square foot occupancy of 80% or more for one calendar year. we believe that by providing same-store results from a stabilized pool of stores, with accompanying operating metrics including, but not limited to: occupancy, rental revenue growth, operating expense growth, net operating income growth, etc., stockholders and potential investors are able to evaluate operating performance without the effects of non-stabilized occupancy levels, rent levels, expense levels, acquisitions or completed developments. same-store results should not be used as a basis for future same-store performance or for the performance of our stores as a whole. the following table presents operating data for our same-store portfolio.

the increases in same-store rental and tenant reinsurance revenues for the three months and year ended december 31, 2016, as compared to the same periods ended december 31, 2015, were due primarily to higher rental rates for both new and existing customers. expenses were lower for the three months ended december 31, 2016 due to decreases year-over-year across most expense categories, primarily due to comparably higher expenses in the three months ended december 31, 2015. the most significant decreases were in repairs and maintenance and utilities. decreases in these expenses were partially offset by increases in property taxes. for the year ended december 31, 2016, expenses were higher due to increases in property taxes and credit card processing fees. these increases in expenses were partially offset by decreases in utilities and repairs and maintenance expense.

the increases in same-store rental and tenant reinsurance revenues for the three months and year ended december 31, 2015, as compared to the same periods ended december 31, 2014, were due primarily to an increase in occupancy, an increase in rental rates to new and existing customers, and reduced customer discounts. expenses were higher for the year ended december 31, 2015 due to increases in tenant reinsurance expense, credit card merchant fees and property taxes. increases were offset by decreases in utility expenses and property insurance expense.
cash flows comparison of the year ended december 31, 2016 to the year ended december 31, 2015
cash provided by operating activities was $539,263 and $367,329 for the years ended december 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. the change when compared to the prior year was primarily due to a $187,553 increase in net income and an increase in depreciation and amortization expense of $49,103. these increases were offset by an increase in the gain on sale of real estate assets and purchase joint venture partners' interests of $66,342. this gain was primarily the result of three step acquisitions of stores that were previously owned by our vrs, prisa ii and wcot joint ventures, along with the gain on the sale of our remaining interest in the prisa ii joint venture to prudential.
cash used in investing activities was $1,032,035 and $1,625,664, for the years ended december 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. the decrease was primarily due to a decrease in total cash paid for the acquisition of real estate assets of $464,227. we purchased 99 stores during the year ended december 31, 2016, compared to 171 stores purchased during 2015. there was also an increase in proceeds from sale of real estate assets, investments in real estate ventures and other assets of $60,013, a decrease in cash paid on the purchase/issuance of notes receivable of $57,902 and an increase in cash received from principal payments on notes receivable of $42,785 for the year ended december 31, 2016 when compared to 2015.
cash provided by financing activities was $460,831 and $1,286,471, for the years ended december 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. the change related primarily to a decrease in proceeds from notes payable and revolving lines of credit of $221,445, a decrease in net proceeds from the issuance of exchangeable senior notes of $563,500, and a decrease in net proceeds from the sale of common stock of $323,453 for the year ended december 31, 2016 when compared to the prior year. these decreases were partially offset by a decrease in principal payments on notes payable and revolving lines of credit of $191,128 and a decrease in the cash paid for the repurchase of exchangeable senior notes of $205,017.
comparison of the year ended december 31, 2015 to the year ended december 31, 2014
cash provided by operating activities was $367,329 and $337,581 for the years ended december 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. the change when compared to the prior year was primarily due to a $13,640 increase in net income and an increase in depreciation and amortization expense of $18,381. these increases were partially offset by a decrease in the change in accounts payable and accrued liabilities of $4,812.
cash used in investing activities was $1,625,664 and $564,948 for the years ended december 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. the change was primarily the result of an increase of $1,200,853 paid for the acquisition of smartstop in october 2015. there was also an increase of $55,073 in cash used to purchase/issue notes receivable. these increases in cash outflows were partially offset by an increase of $45,080 in cash received as returns of investments in unconsolidated real estate ventures.
cash provided by financing activities was $1,286,471 and $148,307 for the years ended december 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. the net increase was due to a number of factors, including an increase of $1,204,138 in the cash proceeds received from the issuance of notes payable and revolving lines of credit, an increase of $446,877 in the cash proceeds received from the sale of common stock, and an increase of $563,500 in the net proceeds from the issuance of exchangeable senior notes. these increases in cash inflows were offset by an increase of $780,442 of cash paid for principal payments on notes payable and revolving lines of credit, an increase of $227,212 in cash paid to repurchase existing exchangeable senior notes, and an increase of $59,211 in cash paid as dividends on our common stock.
liquidity and capital resources as of december 31, 2016, we had $43,858 available in cash and cash equivalents. we are required to distribute at least 90% of our net taxable income, excluding net capital gains, to our stockholders on an annual basis to maintain our qualification as a reit.
our cash and cash equivalents are held in accounts managed by third party financial institutions and consist of invested cash and cash in our operating accounts. during 2016 and 2015, we experienced no loss or lack of access to our cash or cash equivalents; however, there can be no assurance that access to our cash and cash equivalents will not be impacted by adverse conditions in the financial markets.
the following table presents information on our lines of credit for the period presented. all of our lines of credit are guaranteed by us.
as of december 31, 2016
revolving lines of credit               amount drawn                            capacity              interest rate            origination date              maturity             basis rate (1)
(4) basis rate as of december 31, 2016. rate is subject to change based on our consolidated leverage ratio.
as of december 31, 2016, we had $4,363,697 face value of debt, resulting in a debt to total enterprise value ratio of 29.6%. as of december 31, 2016, the ratio of total fixed-rate debt and other instruments to total debt was 70.0% (including $2,198,275 on which we have interest rate swaps that have been included as fixed-rate debt). the weighted average interest rate of the total of fixed- and variable-rate debt at december 31, 2016 was 3.0%. certain of our real estate assets are pledged as collateral for our debt. we are subject to certain restrictive covenants relating to our outstanding debt. we were in compliance with all financial covenants at december 31, 2016.
we expect to fund our short-term liquidity requirements, including operating expenses, recurring capital expenditures, dividends to stockholders, distributions to holders of operating partnership units and interest on our outstanding indebtedness, out of our operating cash flow, cash on hand and borrowings under our revolving lines of credit, including undrawn portions of our unsecured facility. in addition, we are pursuing additional sources of financing based on anticipated funding needs.
our liquidity needs consist primarily of cash distributions to stockholders, store acquisitions, principal payments under our borrowings and non-recurring capital expenditures. we may from time to time seek to repurchase our outstanding debt, shares of common stock or other securities in open market purchases, privately negotiated transactions or otherwise. such repurchases, if any, will depend on prevailing market conditions, our liquidity requirements, contractual restrictions and other factors. in addition, we evaluate, on an ongoing basis, the merits of strategic acquisitions and other relationships, which may require us to raise additional funds. we do not expect that our operating cash flow or cash balances will be sufficient to fund our liquidity needs and instead expect to fund such needs out of additional borrowings of secured or unsecured indebtedness, joint ventures with third parties, and from the proceeds of public and private offerings of equity and debt. additional capital may not be available on terms favorable to us or at all. any additional issuance of equity or equity-linked securities may result in dilution to our stockholders. in addition, any new securities we issue could have rights, preferences and privileges senior to holders of our common stock. we may also use operating partnership units as currency to fund acquisitions from self-storage owners who desire tax-deferral in their exiting transactions.
off-balance sheet arrangements except as disclosed in the notes to our financial statements, we do not currently have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purposes entities, which typically are established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes. further, except as disclosed in the notes to our financial statements, we have not guaranteed any obligations of unconsolidated entities nor do we have any commitments or intent to provide funding to any such entities. accordingly, we are not materially exposed to any financing, liquidity, market or credit risk that could arise if we had engaged in these relationships.
contractual obligations the following table presents information on future payments due by period as of december 31, 2016:
less than                                                                      after total                  1 year                 1-3 years                 3-5 years                5 years operating leases                                                            $120,926                $6,123                   $12,801                   $11,977                 $90,025
notes payable, notes payable to trusts and revolving lines of credit interest                                                                     573,411               127,630                   218,184                   109,191                 118,406
the operating leases above include minimum future lease payments on leases for 22 of our operating stores as well as leases of our corporate offices. three ground leases include additional contingent rental payments based on the level of revenue achieved at the store.
as of december 31, 2016, the weighted average interest rate for all fixed rate loans was 3.3%, and the weighted average interest rate on all variable rate loans was 2.3%.
financing strategy we will continue to employ leverage in our capital structure in amounts reviewed from time to time by our board of directors. although our board of directors has not adopted a policy which limits the total amount of indebtedness that we may incur, we will consider a number of factors in evaluating our level of indebtedness from time to time, as well as the amount of such indebtedness that will be either fixed or variable rate. in making financing decisions, we will consider factors including but not limited to:
•   the interest rate of the proposed financing;
•   the extent to which the financing impacts flexibility in managing our stores;
•   the purchase price of stores acquired with debt financing;
•   long-term objectives with respect to the financing;
•   the ability of particular stores, and our company as a whole, to generate cash flow sufficient to cover expected debt service payments;
•   overall level of consolidated indebtedness;
•   timing of debt and lease maturities;
•   provisions that require recourse and cross-collateralization;
•   corporate credit ratios including debt service coverage, debt to total capitalization and debt to undepreciated assets; and
•   the overall ratio of fixed and variable rate debt.
our indebtedness may be recourse, non-recourse, cross-collateralized, cross-defaulted, secured or unsecured. if the indebtedness is non-recourse, the collateral will be limited to the particular stores to which the indebtedness relates. in addition, we may invest in stores subject to existing loans collateralized by mortgages or similar liens on our stores, or may refinance stores acquired on a leveraged basis. we may use the proceeds from any borrowings to refinance existing indebtedness, to refinance investments, including the redevelopment of existing stores, for general working capital or to purchase additional interests in partnerships or joint ventures or for other purposes when we believe it is advisable.
we may from time to time seek to retire or repurchase our outstanding debt, as well as shares of common stock or other securities in open market purchases, privately negotiated transactions or otherwise. such repurchases, if any, will depend on prevailing market conditions, our liquidity requirements, contractual restrictions and other factors. the amounts involved may be material.
seasonality the self-storage business is subject to seasonal fluctuations. a greater portion of revenues and profits are realized from may through september. historically, our highest level of occupancy has been at the end of july, while our lowest level of occupancy has been in late february and early march. results for any quarter may not be indicative of the results that may be achieved for the full fiscal year.

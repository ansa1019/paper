utility regulatory risks
(entergy corporation, entergy arkansas, entergy gulf states louisiana, entergy louisiana, entergy mississippi, entergy new orleans, entergy texas, and system energy)
the terms and conditions of service, including electric and gas rates, of the utility operating companies and system energy are determined through regulatory approval proceedings that are lengthy and subject to appeal that could result in delays in effecting rate changes and uncertainty as to ultimate results.
the rates that the utility operating companies and system energy charge reflect their capital expenditures, operations and maintenance costs, allowed rates of return, financing costs, and related costs of service. these rates significantly influence the financial condition, results of operations, and liquidity of entergy and each of the utility operating companies and system energy. these rates are determined in regulatory proceedings and are subject to periodic regulatory review and adjustment.
in addition, regulators can initiate proceedings to investigate the prudence of costs in the utility operating companies' base rates and examine, among other things, the reasonableness or prudence of the companies' operation and maintenance practices, level of expenditures (including storm costs and costs associated with capital projects), allowed rates of return and rate base, proposed resource acquisitions, and previously incurred capital expenditures that the operating companies seek to place in rates. the regulators can disallow costs subject to their jurisdiction found not to have been prudently incurred or found not to have been incurred in compliance with applicable tariffs, creating some risk to the ultimate recovery of those costs. regulatory proceedings relating to rates and other matters typically involve multiple parties seeking to limit or reduce rates. the proceedings generally have long timelines, are primarily based on historical costs, and may or may not be limited in scope or duration by statute. the length of the proceedings can cause the utility operating companies and system energy to experience regulatory lag in recovering costs through rates. decisions are typically subject to appeal, potentially leading to additional uncertainty associated with rate case proceedings.
the base rates of entergy arkansas and entergy texas are established in traditional base rate case proceedings.
entergy mississippi infrequently has traditional base rate cases, although one was filed and settled in 2014. more commonly, it obtains base rate adjustments through its formula rate plan, which operates annually. in the event that this formula rate plan were terminated, entergy mississippi would at that time revert to the more traditional rate case environment.
in january 2013, entergy gulf states louisiana's and entergy louisiana's then-existing formula rate plans expired, and each company filed full rate cases in february 2013. as part of the rate cases that entergy louisiana and entergy gulf states louisiana filed, each company requested that the lpsc approve new formula rate plans. in december 2013 the lpsc voted to approve a settlement that provides for the continued use, through the test year
2016 filing, of formula rate plans by entergy louisiana and entergy gulf states louisiana. entergy louisiana's formula rate plan changes are capped at a cumulative total of $30 million through the formula rate plan cycle.
as part of the settlement, both companies established mechanisms to recover non-fuel miso-related costs calculated separately from the formula rate plan requirements, but embedded in the formula rate plan factor applied on customer bills. miso fuel and energy-related costs are recoverable in entergy gulf states louisiana's and entergy louisiana's fuel adjustment
table of contents part i item 1a & 1b entergy corporation, utility operating companies, and system energy clauses. the formula rate plans continue to retain exceptions from the rate cap/restrictions and sharing requirements for certain large capital investment projects, including the ninemile 6 generating facility. in the event that these formula rate plans were terminated, or expire without renewal or extension, entergy gulf states louisiana and entergy louisiana would at that time revert to the more traditional rate case environment.
company filing for 2014. most of the provisions under the existing separate formula rate plans would be retained under the combined formula rate plan. further, entergy louisiana and entergy new orleans have filed with the council of the city of new orleans a joint application seeking authorization to transfer certain assets of entergy louisiana used to serve the fifteenth ward of new orleans (commonly referred to as algiers) to entergy new orleans.
entergy new orleans has operated under a formula rate plan that ended with the 2011 test year and has not yet been extended. if no formula rate plan is approved going forward, entergy new orleans will continue operating in the more traditional rate case environment.
the utility operating companies and system energy, and the energy industry as a whole, have experienced a period of rising costs and investments, and an upward trend in spending, especially with respect to infrastructure investments, which is likely to continue in the foreseeable future and could result in more frequent rate cases and requests for, and the continuation of, cost recovery mechanisms. for information regarding rate case proceedings and formula rate plans applicable to certain of the utility operating companies, see note 2 to the financial statements.
the utility operating companies recover fuel, purchased power, and associated costs through rate mechanisms that are subject to risks of delay or disallowance in regulatory proceedings.
the utility operating companies recover their fuel, purchased power, and associated costs from their customers through rate mechanisms subject to periodic regulatory review and adjustment. because regulatory review can result in the disallowance of incurred costs found not to have been prudently incurred with the possibility of refunds to ratepayers, there exists some risk to the ultimate recovery of those costs. regulators can initiate proceedings to investigate the continued usage or the adequacy and operation of the fuel and purchased power recovery clauses of the utility operating companies.
the utility operating companies' cash flows can be negatively affected by the time delays between when gas, power, or other commodities are purchased and the ultimate recovery from customers of the costs in rates. on occasion, when the level of incurred costs for fuel and purchased power rises very dramatically, some of the utility operating companies may agree to defer recovery of a portion of that period's fuel and purchased power costs for recovery at a later date, which could increase the near-term working capital and borrowing requirements of those companies. for a description of fuel and purchased power recovery mechanisms and information regarding the regulatory proceedings for fuel and purchased power costs recovery, see note 2 to the financial statements.
as a result of a challenge by the lpsc, the manner in which the utility operating companies have traditionally shared the costs associated with coordinated planning, construction, and operation of generating resources has been changed by the ferc, a development which has had and could continue to require adjustment of retail and wholesale rates in the jurisdictions where the utility operating companies provide service and has introduced additional uncertainty in the ratemaking process.
the utility operating companies historically have engaged in the coordinated planning, construction, and operation of generating resources and bulk transmission facilities under the terms of the system agreement, which is a rate schedule that has been approved by the ferc. in 2005 the ferc issued a decision requiring changes to the cost allocation methodology used in that rate schedule.
in 2007 through 2012, payments were made by entergy arkansas to certain of the utility operating companies in compliance with the 2005 ferc decision on the cost allocation methodology, and in 2013 and 2014, payments were made by entergy texas to entergy new orleans. there have been challenges to the level and timing of payments
table of contents part i item 1a & 1b entergy corporation, utility operating companies, and system energy made by entergy arkansas under the ferc's decision and the prudence of the utility operating companies' production costs. the ability to recover in rates any changes to the cost allocation resulting from the challenges, and timing of such recovery, could be uncertain and could be the subject of additional regulatory and other proceedings. for information regarding these and other proceedings associated with the system agreement, as well as additional information regarding the system agreement itself, see note 2 to financial statements, system agreement cost equalization proceedings
. the outcome and timing of these ferc proceedings and resulting recovery and impact on rates cannot be predicted at this time.
the withdrawal and notices of withdrawal of certain utility operating companies from the system agreement create uncertainty regarding the system agreement and the effect of the absence of such an arrangement on the utility operating companies.
entergy arkansas's participation in the system agreement terminated in december 2013, and entergy mississippi's participation in the system agreement is scheduled to terminate in november 2015.
in october 2013, the utility operating companies filed at the ferc seeking to shorten to 60 months the provision in the system agreement that requires a utility operating company seeking to withdraw from the system agreement to provide 96 months advance notice of termination of participation. in october 2013, entergy texas provided its notice to the other utility operating companies to terminate its participation in the system agreement after expiration of the proposed 60-month notice period or such other period as approved by the ferc. subsequently, entergy texas filed its notice to terminate its participation in the system agreement at ferc in october 2013. in january 2014, the lpsc directed entergy louisiana and entergy gulf states louisiana to provide no later than february 15, 2014 notice of their intention to terminate their participation in the system agreement, and to use their reasonable best efforts to achieve a consensual resolution permitting early termination of the system agreement. entergy louisiana and entergy gulf states louisiana provided notice of their termination on february 14,
2014. accordingly, there is uncertainty regarding the continuation of the system agreement and the effect of the absence of such an arrangement on the utility operating companies.

entergy's integration into the miso regional transmission organization " section of management's financial discussion and analysis for entergy corporation and subsidiaries. miso maintains functional control over the combined transmission systems of its members and administers wholesale energy and ancillary services markets for market participants in the miso region, including the utility operating companies. the utility operating companies sell capacity, energy, and ancillary services on a bilateral basis to certain wholesale customers and offer available electricity production of their generating facilities into the miso day-ahead and real-time energy markets pursuant to the miso tariff and market rules. the utility operating companies are subject to economic risks associated with participation in the miso markets. miso tariff rules and system conditions, including transmission congestion, could affect the utility operating companies' ability to sell power in certain regions and/or the economic value of such sales, and miso market rules may change in ways, including the implementation of competition among transmission providers, that cause additional risk.
table of contents part i item 1a & 1b entergy corporation, utility operating companies, and system energy the utility operating companies participate in the miso regional transmission planning process and are subject to risks associated with planning decisions that miso makes in the exercise of control over the planning of the utility operating companies' transmission assets that are under miso's functional control. the utility operating companies pay transmission rates that reflect the cost of transmission projects that the utility operating companies do not own, which could increase cash or financing needs. the terms and conditions of the miso tariff, including provisions related to the design and implementation of wholesale markets and the allocation of transmission upgrade costs, are subject to regulation by ferc. the operation of the utility operating companies'
transmission system pursuant to the miso tariff and their participation in the miso wholesale markets may be adversely affected by regulatory or market design changes, as well as liability under, or any future inability to comply with, existing or future regulations or requirements.
a delay or failure in recovering amounts for storm restoration costs incurred as a result of severe weather could have material effects on entergy and those utility operating companies affected by severe weather.
entergy's and its utility operating companies' results of operations, liquidity, and financial condition can be materially affected by the destructive effects of severe weather. severe weather can also result in significant outages for the customers of the utility operating companies and, therefore, reduced revenues for the utility operating companies during the period of the outages. a delay or failure in recovering amounts for storm restoration costs incurred or revenues lost as a result of severe weather could have a material effect on entergy and those utility operating companies affected by severe weather.
nuclear operating and regulatory risks
(entergy corporation, entergy arkansas, entergy gulf states louisiana, entergy louisiana, and system energy)
certain of the utility operating companies, system energy, and entergy wholesale commodities must consistently operate their nuclear power plants at high capacity factors in order to be successful, and lower capacity factors could materially affect entergy's and their results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity.
nuclear capacity factors significantly affect the results of operations of certain utility operating companies, system energy, and entergy wholesale commodities. nuclear plant operations involve substantial fixed operating costs. consequently, to be successful, a plant owner must consistently operate its nuclear power plants at high capacity factors. for the utility operating companies that own nuclear plants, lower capacity factors can increase production costs by requiring the affected companies to generate additional energy, sometimes at higher costs, from their fossil facilities or purchase additional energy in the spot or forward markets in order to satisfy their supply needs. for the entergy wholesale commodities nuclear plants, lower capacity factors directly affect revenues and cash flow from operations. entergy wholesale commodities' forward sales are comprised of various hedge products, many of which have some degree of operational-contingent price risk. certain unit-contingent contracts guarantee specified minimum capacity factors. in the event plants with these contracts were operating below the guaranteed capacity factors, entergy would be subject to price risk for the undelivered power. further, entergy wholesale commodities' nuclear forward sales contracts can also be on a firm ld basis, which subjects entergy to increasing price risk as capacity factors decrease. many of these firm hedge products have damages risk, capped through the use of risk management products.
certain of the utility operating companies, system energy, and entergy wholesale commodities nuclear plant owners periodically shut down their nuclear power plants to replenish fuel. plant maintenance and upgrades are often scheduled during such refueling outages. if refueling outages last longer than anticipated or if unplanned outages arise, entergy's and their results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity could be materially affected.
table of contents part i item 1a & 1b entergy corporation, utility operating companies, and system energy outages at nuclear power plants to replenish fuel require the plant to be "turned off." refueling outages generally are planned to occur once every 18 to 24 months and average approximately 30 days in duration. plant maintenance and upgrades are often scheduled during such planned outages. when refueling outages last longer than anticipated or a plant experiences unplanned outages, capacity factors decrease and maintenance costs may increase. lower than forecasted capacity factors may cause entergy wholesale commodities to experience reduced revenues and may also create damages risk with certain hedge products as previously discussed.
certain of the utility operating companies, system energy, and entergy wholesale commodities face risks related to the purchase of uranium fuel (and its conversion, enrichment, and fabrication), and the risk of being unable to effectively manage these risks by purchasing from a diversified mix of sellers located in a diversified mix of countries could materially affect entergy's and their results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity.
based upon currently planned fuel cycles, entergy's nuclear units have a diversified portfolio of contracts and inventory that provides substantially adequate nuclear fuel materials and conversion and enrichment services at what entergy believes are reasonably predictable prices through most of 2015. entergy's ability to purchase nuclear fuel at reasonably predictable prices, however, depends upon the performance reliability of uranium miners and enrichers. while there are a number of possible alternate suppliers that may be accessed to mitigate any supplier performance failure, the pricing of any such alternate uranium supply from the market will be dependent upon the market for uranium supply at that time. entergy also may draw upon its own inventory intended for later generation periods, depending upon its risk management strategy at that time. entergy buys uranium from a diversified mix of sellers located in a diversified mix of countries, and from time to time purchases from nearly all qualified reliable major market participants worldwide that sell into the u.s. market prices for nuclear fuel have been extremely volatile from time to time in the past. although entergy's nuclear fuel contract portfolio provides a degree of hedging against market risks for several years, costs for nuclear fuel in the future cannot be predicted with certainty due to normal inherent market uncertainties, and price increases could materially affect the liquidity, financial condition, and results of operations of certain of the utility operating companies, system energy, and entergy wholesale commodities.
entergy's ability to assure nuclear fuel supply also depends upon the performance and reliability of conversion, enrichment, and fabrication services providers. these service providers are fewer in number than uranium suppliers.
for conversion and enrichment services, entergy diversifies its supply by supplier and country and may take special measures to ensure a reliable supply of enriched uranium for fabrication into nuclear fuel. for fabrication services, each plant is dependent upon the performance of the fabricator of that plant's nuclear fuel; therefore, entergy relies upon additional monitoring, inspection, and oversight of the fabrication process to assure reliability and quality of its nuclear fuel. certain of the suppliers and service providers are located in or dependent upon countries, such as russia, in which deteriorating economic conditions or international sanctions could restrict the ability of such suppliers to continue to supply fuel or provide such services. the inability of such suppliers or service providers to perform such obligations could materially affect the liquidity, financial condition, and results of operations of certain of the utility operating companies, system energy, and entergy wholesale commodities.
certain of the utility operating companies, system energy, and the entergy wholesale commodities business face the risk that the nrc will change or modify its regulations or suspend or revoke their licenses, which could materially affect entergy's and their results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity.
under the atomic energy act and energy reorganization act, the nrc regulates the operation of nuclear power plants.
the nrc may modify, suspend, or revoke licenses, shut down a nuclear facility and impose civil penalties for failure to comply with the atomic energy act, related regulations, or the terms of the licenses for nuclear facilities. a change in the atomic energy act, other applicable statutes, or the applicable regulations or licenses may require a substantial increase in capital expenditures or may result in increased operating or decommissioning costs and could materially affect the results of operations, liquidity, or financial condition of entergy (through entergy wholesale commodities), its utility operating companies, or system energy. events at nuclear plants owned by others, as well as those owned by one of these companies, may cause the nrc to initiate such actions. as a result, if an incident were to occur at any nuclear generating unit, whether an entergy nuclear generating unit or not, it could materially affect
table of contents part i item 1a & 1b entergy corporation, utility operating companies, and system energy the financial condition, results of operations, and liquidity of entergy, certain of the utility operating companies, system energy, or entergy wholesale commodities. for example, the earthquake of march 11, 2011 that affected the fukushima daiichi nuclear plants in japan resulted in the nrc issuing three orders effective on march
12, 2012 requiring u.s. nuclear operators, including entergy, to undertake plant modifications or perform additional analyses that will, among other things, result in increased capital and operating costs associated with operating entergy's nuclear plants, some of which could be material.
certain of the utility operating companies, system energy, and entergy wholesale commodities are exposed to risks and costs related to operating and maintaining their nuclear power plants, and their failure to maintain operational efficiency at their nuclear power plants could materially affect entergy's and their results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity.
the nuclear generating units owned by certain of the utility operating companies, system energy, and the entergy wholesale commodities business began commercial operations in the 1970s-1980s. older equipment may require more capital expenditures to keep each of these nuclear power plants operating efficiently. this equipment is also likely to require periodic upgrading and improvement. any unexpected failure, including failure associated with breakdowns, forced outages, or any unanticipated capital expenditures, could result in reduced profitability.
operations at any of the nuclear generating units owned and operated by entergy's subsidiaries could degrade to the point where the affected unit needs to be shut down or operated at less than full capacity. if this were to happen, identifying and correcting the causes may require significant time and expense. a decision may be made to close a unit rather than incur the expense of restarting it or returning the unit to full capacity. for entergy wholesale commodities, this could result in lost revenue and increased fuel and purchased power expense to meet supply commitments and penalties for failure to perform under their contracts with customers. moreover, entergy is becoming more dependent on fewer suppliers for key parts of entergy's nuclear power plants that may need to be replaced or refurbished. in addition, certain major parts have long lead-times to manufacture if an unplanned replacement is needed. this dependence on a reduced number of suppliers and long lead-times on certain major parts for unplanned replacements could result in delays in obtaining qualified replacement parts and, therefore, greater expense for entergy.
the costs associated with the storage of the spent nuclear fuel of certain of the utility operating companies, system energy, and the owners of the entergy wholesale commodities nuclear power plants, as well as the costs of and their ability to fully decommission their nuclear power plants, could be significantly affected by the timing of the opening of a spent nuclear fuel disposal facility, as well as interim storage and transportation requirements.
certain of the utility operating companies, system energy and the owners of the entergy wholesale commodities nuclear plants incur costs on a periodic basis for the on-site storage of spent nuclear fuel. the approval of a license for a national repository for the disposal of spent nuclear fuel, such as the one proposed for yucca mountain, nevada, or any interim storage facility, and the timing of such facility opening, will significantly affect the costs associated with on-site storage of spent nuclear fuel. for example, while the doe is required by law to proceed with the licensing of yucca mountain and, after the license is granted by the nrc, to construct the repository and commence the receipt of spent fuel, the obama administration has expressed its intention and taken specific steps to discontinue the yucca mountain project and study a new spent fuel strategy. these actions may prolong the time before spent fuel is removed from entergy's plant sites. because the doe has not accomplished its objectives, it is in non-compliance with the nuclear waste policy act of 1982 and has breached its spent fuel disposal contracts, and entergy has sued the doe for such breach. furthermore, entergy is uncertain as to when the doe plans to commence acceptance of spent fuel from its facilities for storage or disposal. as a result, continuing future expenditures will be required to increase spent fuel storage capacity at the companies' nuclear sites. the costs of on-site storage are also affected by regulatory requirements for such storage. in addition, the availability of a repository or other off-site storage facility for spent nuclear fuel may affect the ability to fully decommission the nuclear units and the costs relating to decommissioning. for further information regarding spent fuel storage, see the "
- spent fuel disposal " section of management's financial discussion and analysis for entergy, entergy arkansas, entergy gulf states louisiana, entergy louisiana, and system energy.
table of contents part i item 1a & 1b entergy corporation, utility operating companies, and system energy certain of the utility operating companies, system energy, and the entergy wholesale commodities nuclear plant owners may be required to pay substantial retrospective premiums imposed under the price-anderson act in the event of a nuclear incident, and losses not covered by insurance could have a material effect on entergy's and their results of operations, financial condition, or liquidity.
accidents and other unforeseen problems at nuclear power plants have occurred both in the united states and elsewhere. the price-anderson act limits each reactor owner's public liability (off-site) for a single nuclear incident to the payment of retrospective premiums into a secondary insurance pool of up to approximately $127.318
million per reactor. with 104 reactors currently participating, this translates to a total public liability cap of approximately $13.241 billion per incident. the limit is subject to change to account for the effects of inflation, a change in the primary limit of insurance coverage, and changes in the number of licensed reactors. as required by the price-anderson act, the utility operating companies, system energy, and entergy wholesale commodities carry the maximum available amount of primary nuclear off-site liability insurance with american nuclear insurers (currently
$375 million for each operating site). claims for any nuclear incident exceeding that amount are covered under the retrospective premiums paid into the secondary insurance pool. as a result, in the event of a nuclear incident that causes damages (off-site) in excess of the $375 million in primary insurance coverage, each owner of a nuclear plant reactor, including entergy's utility operating companies, system energy, and the entergy wholesale commodities plant owners, regardless of fault or proximity to the incident, will be required to pay a retrospective premium, equal to its proportionate share of the loss in excess of the $375 million primary level, up to a maximum of $127.318 million per reactor per incident (entergy's maximum total contingent obligation per incident is $1.4
billion). the retrospective premium payment is currently limited to $18.963 million per year per incident per reactor until the aggregate public liability for each licensee is paid up to the $127.318 million cap.
neil is a utility industry mutual insurance company, owned by its members. all member plants could be subject to an annual assessment (retrospective premium of up to 10 times current annual premium for all policies) should the surplus (reserve) be significantly depleted due to insured losses. as of april 1, 2014, the maximum annual assessment amounts total $105.7 million for the utility plants and $126.4 million for the entergy wholesale commodities plants. retrospective premium insurance available through neil's reinsurance treaty can cover the potential assessments. the entergy wholesale commodities plants currently maintain the retrospective premium insurance to cover this potential assessment.
as an owner of nuclear power plants, entergy participates in industry self-insurance programs and could be liable to fund claims should a plant owned by a different company experience a major event. any resulting liability from a nuclear accident may exceed the applicable primary insurance coverage and require contribution of additional funds through the industry-wide program that could significantly affect the results of operations, financial condition, or liquidity of entergy, certain of the utility operating companies, system energy, or the entergy wholesale commodities subsidiaries.
market performance and other changes may decrease the value of assets in the decommissioning trusts, which then could require significant additional funding.
owners of nuclear generating plants have an obligation to decommission those plants. certain of the utility operating companies, system energy, and owners of the entergy wholesale commodities nuclear power plants maintain decommissioning trust funds for this purpose. certain of the utility operating companies collect funds from their customers, which are deposited into the trusts covering the units operated for or on behalf of those companies.
those rate collections are based upon operating license lives as well as estimated trust fund earnings and decommissioning costs. in connection with the acquisition of certain nuclear plants, the entergy wholesale commodities plant owners also acquired decommissioning trust funds that are funded in accordance with nrc regulations. assets in these trust funds are subject to market fluctuations, will yield uncertain returns that may fall below projected return rates, and may result in losses resulting from the recognition of impairments of the value of certain securities held in these trust funds. as part of the pilgrim, indian point 1 and 2, vermont yankee, and palisades/big rock point purchases, the former owners transferred decommissioning trust funds, along with the liability to decommission the plants, to the
table of contents part i item 1a & 1b entergy corporation, utility operating companies, and system energy respective entergy wholesale commodities nuclear power plant owners. in addition, the former owner of indian point
3 and fitzpatrick retained the decommissioning trusts and related liability to decommission these plants, but has the right to require the respective entergy wholesale commodities nuclear plant owners to assume the decommissioning liability provided that it assigns the funds in the corresponding decommissioning trust, up to a specified level, to such owners. alternatively, the former owner may contract with entergy nuclear, inc. for the decommissioning work at a price equal to the funds in the corresponding decommissioning trust up to a specified amount. as part of the indian point 1 and 2 purchase, the entergy wholesale commodities nuclear power plant owner also funded an additional $25 million to a supplemental decommissioning trust fund. as part of the palisades transaction, the entergy wholesale commodities business assumed responsibility for spent fuel at the decommissioned big rock point nuclear plant, which is located near charlevoix, michigan. once the spent fuel is removed from the site, the entergy wholesale commodities business will dismantle the spent fuel storage facility and complete site decommissioning. the entergy wholesale commodities business expects to fund this activity from operating revenue, and entergy is providing $5 million in credit support to provide financial assurance to the nrc for this obligation.
in 2008, entergy experienced declines in the market value of assets held in the trust funds for meeting its decommissioning funding assurance obligations for its plants. this decline adversely affected entergy's ability to demonstrate compliance with the nrc's requirements for providing financial assurance for decommissioning funding for some of its plants, which deficiencies have now been corrected. an early plant shutdown, poor investment results or higher than anticipated decommissioning costs could cause trust fund assets to be insufficient to meet the decommissioning obligations, with the result that the entergy wholesale commodities nuclear plant owners may be required to provide additional funds or credit support to satisfy regulatory requirements for decommissioning. for further information regarding nuclear decommissioning costs, see the "
" section of management's financial discussion and analysis for entergy, entergy arkansas, entergy gulf states louisiana, entergy louisiana, and system energy and note 9 to the financial statements.
changes in nrc regulations or other binding regulatory requirements may cause increased funding requirements for nuclear plant decommissioning trusts.
nrc regulations require certain minimum financial assurance requirements for meeting obligations to decommission nuclear power plants. those financial assurance requirements may change from time to time, and certain changes may result in a material increase in the financial assurance required for decommissioning the utility operating companies', system energy's and owners of the entergy wholesale commodities nuclear power plants. such changes could result in the need for additional contributions to decommissioning trusts, or the posting of parent guarantees, letters of credit, or other surety mechanisms. for further information regarding nuclear decommissioning costs, see the "
" section of management's financial discussion and analysis for entergy, entergy arkansas, entergy gulf states louisiana, entergy louisiana, and system energy and note 9 to the financial statements.
new or existing safety concerns regarding operating nuclear power plants and nuclear fuel could lead to restrictions upon the operation of entergy's nuclear power plants.
new and existing concerns are being expressed in public forums about the safety of nuclear generating units and nuclear fuel, in particular in the northeastern united states, which is where five of the six units in the current fleet of entergy wholesale commodities nuclear power plants are located. these concerns have led to, and are expected to continue to lead to, various proposals to federal regulators and governing bodies in some localities where entergy's subsidiaries own nuclear generating units for legislative and regulatory changes that could lead to the shutdown of nuclear units, denial of license renewal applications, restrictions on nuclear units as a result of unavailability of sites for spent nuclear fuel storage and disposal, or other adverse effects on owning and operating nuclear generating units. entergy vigorously responds to these concerns and proposals. if any of the existing proposals, or any proposals that may arise in the future with respect to legislative and regulatory changes, become effective, they could have a material effect on entergy's results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity.
table of contents part i item 1a & 1b entergy corporation, utility operating companies, and system energy
a failure to obtain renewed licenses or other approvals required for the continued operation of the entergy wholesale commodities nuclear power plants could have a material effect on entergy's results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity and could lead to an increase in depreciation rates or an acceleration of the timing for the funding of decommissioning obligations.
the license renewal and related processes for the entergy wholesale commodities nuclear power plants have been and may continue to be the subject of significant public debate and regulatory and legislative review and scrutiny at the federal and, in certain cases, state level. the original expiration date of the operating license for indian point 2 was september 2013 and the original expiration date of the operating license for indian point 3 is december
2015. because these plants filed timely license renewal applications, the nrc's rules provide that these plants may continue to operate under their existing operating licenses until their renewal applications have been finally determined. various parties have expressed opposition to renewal of these licenses. renewal of the indian point licenses is the subject of ongoing proceedings before the atomic safety and licensing board (aslb) of the nrc and, with respect to issues resolved by the aslb, before the nrc on appeal.
in relation to indian point 2 and indian point 3, the new york state department of environmental conservation has taken the position that these plant owners must obtain a new state-issued clean water act section 401 water quality certification as part of the license renewal process. in addition, before the nrc may issue renewed operating licenses it must resolve its obligation to address the requirements of the coastal zone management act (czma). most commonly, those requirements are met by the applicant's demonstration that the activity authorized by the federal permit being sought is consistent with the host state's federally-approved coastal management policies. entergy has undertaken three independent initiatives to resolve czma issues: "grandfathering," "previous review," and a
"consistency certification." in december 2014 the new york supreme court, appellate division, issued a unanimous ruling stating that indian point 2 and indian point 3 "are exempt from new york's coastal management program." that decision could be appealed. for further information regarding these environmental regulations see the "
regulation of entergy's business
environmental regulation -
if the nrc finally denies the applications for the renewal of operating licenses for one or more of the entergy wholesale commodities nuclear power plants, or a state in which any such nuclear power plant is located is able to prevent the continued operation of such plant, entergy's results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity could be materially affected by loss of revenue and cash flow associated with the plant or plants, potential impairments of the carrying value of the plants, increased depreciation rates, and an accelerated need for decommissioning funds, which could require additional funding. in addition, entergy may incur increased operating costs depending on any conditions that may be imposed in connection with license renewal. for further discussion regarding the license renewal processes for the entergy wholesale commodities nuclear power plants, see the "
entergy wholesale commodities authorizations to operate its nuclear plants " in entergy corporation and subsidiaries management's financial discussion and analysis.
the decommissioning trust fund assets for the nuclear power plants owned by entergy wholesale commodities nuclear plant owners may not be adequate to meet decommissioning obligations if one or more of their nuclear power plants is retired earlier than the anticipated shutdown date, the plants cost more to decommission than estimated, or if current regulatory requirements change, which then could require additional funding.
under nrc regulations, entergy wholesale commodities' nuclear subsidiaries are permitted to project the nrc-
required decommissioning amount, based on an nrc formula or a site-specific estimate, and the amount in each of the entergy wholesale commodities nuclear power plant's decommissioning trusts combined with other decommissioning financial assurances in place. the projections are made based on the operating license expiration date and the mid-
point of the subsequent decommissioning process, or the anticipated actual completion of decommissioning if a site-
specific estimate is used, for each of these nuclear power plants. as a result, if the projected amount of individual plants' decommissioning trusts exceeds the nrc-required decommissioning amount, then its
table of contents part i item 1a & 1b entergy corporation, utility operating companies, and system energy decommissioning obligations are considered to be funded in accordance with nrc regulations. if the projected costs do not sufficiently reflect the actual costs the applicable entergy subsidiaries would be required to incur to decommission these nuclear power plants, and funding is otherwise inadequate, or if the formula or site-specific estimate is changed to require increased funding, additional resources would be required. furthermore, depending upon the level of funding available in the trust funds, the nrc may not permit the trust funds to be used to pay for related costs such as the management of spent nuclear fuel that are not included in the nrc's formula. the nrc may also require a plan for the provision of separate funding for spent fuel management costs. in addition to nrc requirements, there are other decommissioning-related obligations for certain of the entergy wholesale commodities nuclear power plants, which management believes it will be able to satisfy.
if any entergy wholesale commodities subsidiary decides to shut down one of its nuclear power plants earlier than the scheduled shutdown date and conduct decommissioning without the benefit of a safe storage period, the applicable entergy subsidiary may be unable to rely upon only the decommissioning trust to fund the entire decommissioning obligations, which would require it to obtain funding from other sources.
vermont yankee submitted notification of permanent cessation of operations and permanent removal of fuel from the reactor in january 2015 after final shutdown in december 2014. the post shutdown decommissioning activities report for vermont yankee, including a site specific cost estimate, was submitted to the nrc in december 2014. vermont yankee's future certifications to satisfy the nrc's financial assurance requirements will now be based on the site specific cost estimate, including the estimated cost of managing spent fuel, rather than the nrc minimum formula for estimating decommissioning costs. entergy expects that amounts available in vermont yankee's decommissioning trust fund, including expected earnings, together with the credit facilities entered into in january 2015 that are expected to be repaid with recoveries from doe litigation related to spent fuel storage, will be sufficient to cover expected costs of decommissioning, spent fuel management costs, and site restoration. filings with the nrc for planned shutdown activities will determine whether any other financial assurance may be required and will specifically address funding for spent fuel management, which will be required until the federal government takes possession of the fuel and removes it from the site, per its current obligation.
further, federal or state regulatory changes, including mandated increases in decommissioning funding or changes in the methods or standards for decommissioning operations, may also increase the funding requirements of, or accelerate the timing for funding of, the obligations related to the decommissioning of entergy wholesale commodities nuclear power plants. as a result, under any of these circumstances, entergy's results of operations, liquidity, and financial condition could be materially affected.
entergy wholesale commodities nuclear power plants are exposed to price risk.
entergy and its subsidiaries do not have a regulator-authorized rate of return on their capital investments in non-
utility businesses. in particular, the sale of capacity and energy from the entergy wholesale commodities nuclear power plants, unless otherwise contracted, is subject to the fluctuation of market power prices. in order to reduce future price risk to desired levels, entergy wholesale commodities utilizes contracts that are unit-contingent and firm ld and various products such as forward sales, options, and collars. as of december 31, 2014, entergy wholesale commodities' nuclear power generation plants had sold forward 86%, 74%, 39%, 17%, and 19% of its generation portfolio's planned energy output for 2015, 2016, 2017, 2018, and 2019, respectively.
market conditions such as product cost, market liquidity, and other portfolio considerations influence the product and contractual mix. the obligations under unit-contingent agreements depend on a generating asset that is operating; if the generation asset is not operating, the seller generally is not liable for damages. for some unit-
contingent obligations, however, there is also a guarantee of availability that provides for the payment to the power purchaser of contract damages, if incurred, in the event the unit owner fails to deliver power as a result of the failure of the specified generation unit to generate power at or above a specified availability threshold. firm ld sales transactions may be exposed to substantial operational price risk, a portion of which may be capped through the use of risk management products, to the extent that the plants do not run as expected and market prices exceed contract prices.
table of contents part i item 1a & 1b entergy corporation, utility operating companies, and system energy market prices may fluctuate substantially, sometimes over relatively short periods of time, and at other times experience sustained increases or decreases. demand for electricity and its fuel stock can fluctuate dramatically, creating periods of substantial under- or over-supply. during periods of over-supply, prices might be depressed.
also, from time to time there may be political pressure, or pressure from regulatory authorities with jurisdiction over wholesale and retail energy commodity and transportation rates, to impose price limitations, credit requirements, bidding rules and other mechanisms to address volatility and other issues in these markets.
the price that different counterparties offer for various products including forward sales is influenced both by market conditions as well as the contract terms such as damage provisions, credit support requirements, and the number of available counterparties interested in contracting for the desired forward period. depending on differences between market factors at the time of contracting versus current conditions, entergy wholesale commodities' contract portfolio may have average contract prices above or below current market prices, including at the expiration of the contracts, which may significantly affect entergy wholesale commodities' results of operations, financial condition, or liquidity. new hedges are generally layered into on a rolling forward basis, which tends to drive hedge over-performance to market in a falling price environment, and hedge underperformance to market in a rising price environment; however, hedge timing, product choice, and hedging costs will also affect these results. see the "
results of operations
realized revenue per mwh for entergy wholesale commodities nuclear plants " section of management's financial discussion and analysis for entergy corporation and subsidiaries. with operating licenses for indian point 2 and indian point 3 expiring in 2013 and 2015, respectively (see discussion above regarding the continued operation of indian point 2 and 3 past the license expiration dates), and as a consequence of any delays in obtaining extension of the operating licenses and any other approvals required for continued operation of the plants, entergy wholesale commodities may enter into fewer unit-contingent forward sales contracts for output from such plants for periods beyond the license expiration.
among the factors that could affect market prices for electricity and fuel, all of which are beyond entergy's control to a significant degree, are:
prevailing market prices for natural gas, uranium (and its conversion, enrichment, and fabrication), coal,
•  oil, and other fuels used in electric generation plants, including associated transportation costs, and supplies of such commodities;
•  availability of competitively priced alternative energy sources and the requirements of a renewable portfolio standard;
•  changes in production and storage levels of natural gas, lignite, coal and crude oil, and refined products;
•  liquidity in the general wholesale electricity market, including the number of creditworthy counterparties available and interested in entering into forward sales agreements for entergy's full hedging term;
the actions of external parties, such as the ferc and local independent system operators and other state or
•  federal energy regulatory bodies, that may impose price limitations and other mechanisms to address some of the volatility in the energy markets;
•  electricity transmission, competing generation or fuel transportation constraints, inoperability, or inefficiencies;
•  the general demand for electricity, which may be significantly affected by national and regional economic conditions;
•  weather conditions affecting demand for electricity or availability of hydroelectric power or fuel supplies;
•  the rate of growth in demand for electricity as a result of population changes, regional economic conditions, and the implementation of conservation programs or distributed generation;
•  regulatory policies of state agencies that affect the willingness of entergy wholesale commodities customers to enter into long-term contracts generally, and contracts for energy in particular;
increases in supplies due to actions of current entergy wholesale commodities competitors or new market
•  entrants, including the development of new generation facilities, expansion of existing generation facilities, the disaggregation of vertically integrated utilities, and improvements in transmission that allow additional supply to reach entergy wholesale commodities' nuclear markets;
table of contents part i item 1a & 1b entergy corporation, utility operating companies, and system energy changes in federal and state energy and environmental laws and regulations and other initiatives, including
•  but not limited to, the price impacts of proposed emission controls such as the regional greenhouse gas initiative (rggi);
•  changes in law resulting from federal or state energy legislation or legislation subjecting energy derivatives used in hedging and risk management transactions to governmental regulation; and
•  natural disasters, terrorist actions, wars, embargoes, and other catastrophic events.
the entergy wholesale commodities business is subject to substantial governmental regulation and may be adversely affected by legislative, regulatory or market design changes, as well as liability under, or any future inability to comply with, existing or future regulations or requirements.
the entergy wholesale commodities business is subject to extensive federal, state, and local laws and regulation.
compliance with the requirements under these various regulatory regimes may cause the entergy wholesale commodities business to incur significant additional costs, and failure to comply with such requirements could result in the shutdown of the non-complying facility, the imposition of liens, fines and/or civil or criminal liability.
public utilities under the federal power act are required to obtain ferc acceptance of their rate schedules for wholesale sales of electricity. each of the owners of the entergy wholesale commodities nuclear power plants that generates electricity, as well as entergy nuclear power marketing, llc, is a "public utility" under the federal power act by virtue of making wholesale sales of electric energy and/or owning wholesale electric transmission facilities. the ferc has granted these generating and power marketing companies the authority to sell electricity at market-based rates. the ferc's orders that grant the entergy wholesale commodities' generating and power marketing companies market-based rate authority reserve the right to revoke or revise that authority if the ferc subsequently determines that the entergy wholesale commodities business can exercise market power in transmission or generation, create barriers to entry, or engage in abusive affiliate transactions. in addition, the entergy wholesale commodities' market-based sales are subject to certain market behavior rules, and if any of its generating and power marketing companies were deemed to have violated one of those rules, they would be subject to potential disgorgement of profits associated with the violation and/or suspension or revocation of their market-
based rate authority and potential penalties of up to $1 million per day per violation. if the entergy wholesale commodities' generating or power marketing companies were to lose their market-based rate authority, such companies would be required to obtain the ferc's acceptance of a cost-of-service rate schedule and could become subject to the accounting, record-keeping, and reporting requirements that are imposed on utilities with cost-based rate schedules. this could have an adverse effect on the rates the entergy wholesale commodities business charges for power from its facilities.
the entergy wholesale commodities business is also affected by legislative and regulatory changes, as well as changes to market design, market rules, tariffs, cost allocations, and bidding rules imposed by the existing independent system operators. the independent system operators that oversee most of the wholesale power markets impose, and in the future may continue to impose, mitigation, including price limitations, offer caps and other mechanisms, to address some of the volatility and the potential exercise of market power in these markets. these types of price limitations and other regulatory mechanisms may have an adverse effect on the profitability of the entergy wholesale commodities business' generation facilities that sell energy and capacity into the wholesale power markets. for further information regarding federal, state and local laws and regulation applicable to the entergy wholesale commodities business, see the
regulation of entergy's business
the regulatory environment applicable to the electric power industry has undergone substantial changes over the past several years as a result of restructuring initiatives at both the state and federal levels. these changes are ongoing and entergy cannot predict the future design of the wholesale power markets or the ultimate effect that the changing regulatory environment will have on the entergy wholesale commodities business. in addition, in some of these markets, interested parties have proposed material market design changes, including the elimination of a single clearing price mechanism and have raised claims that the competitive marketplace is not working because energy prices in wholesale markets exceed the marginal cost of operating nuclear power plants, as well as proposals to re-regulate the markets, impose a generation tax, or require divestitures by generating companies to reduce their market share. other
table of contents part i item 1a & 1b entergy corporation, utility operating companies, and system energy proposals to re-regulate may be made and legislative or other attention to the electric power market restructuring process may delay or reverse the deregulation process, which could require material changes to business planning models. if competitive restructuring of the electric power markets is reversed, modified, discontinued, or delayed, the entergy wholesale commodities business' results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity could be materially affected.
the power plants owned by the entergy wholesale commodities business are subject to impairment charges in certain circumstances, which could have a material effect on entergy's results of operations, financial condition or liquidity.
entergy reviews long-lived assets held in all of its business segments whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that recoverability of these assets is uncertain. generally, the determination of recoverability is based on the undiscounted net cash flows expected to result from the operations of such assets. projected net cash flows depend on the future operating costs associated with the assets, the efficiency and availability of the assets and generating units, and the future market and price for energy and capacity over the remaining life of the assets. in particular, the assets of the entergy wholesale commodities business are subject to impairment if adverse market conditions arise and continue (such as expected long-term declines in market prices for electricity), if adverse regulatory events occur (including with respect to environmental regulation), if a unit ceases operation or if a unit's operating license is not renewed. moreover, the failure of the entergy wholesale commodities business to achieve forecasted operating results and cash flows, an unfavorable change in forecasted operating results or cash flows, or a decline in observable industry market multiples could all result in potential impairment charges for the affected assets.
section in part i, item 1, the original expiration dates of the operating licenses for indian point 2 and indian point 3 are 2013 and 2015, respectively (see discussion above regarding the continued operation of indian point 2
and 3 past the license expiration dates),and are currently the subject of license renewal processes at the nrc and the state in which the plants operate. on august 27, 2013, entergy announced its plan to close and decommission vermont yankee. vermont yankee ceased power production in the fourth quarter 2014 at the end of a fuel cycle. this decision was approved by the board in august 2013, and resulted in the recognition of impairment charges in 2013
and 2014. if entergy concludes that any of its nuclear power plants is unlikely to operate through its current useful life, which conclusion would be based on a variety of factors, such a conclusion could result in an impairment of part or all of the carrying value of the plant. any impairment charge taken by entergy with respect to its long-lived assets, including the power plants owned by the entergy wholesale commodities business, would likely be material in the quarter that the charge is taken and could otherwise have a material effect on entergy's results of operations, financial condition, or liquidity. for further information regarding evaluating long-lived assets for impairment, see the "
" section of management's financial discussion and analysis for entergy corporation and subsidiaries.
general business
entergy and the utility operating companies depend on access to the capital markets and, at times, may face potential liquidity constraints, which could make it more difficult to handle future contingencies such as natural disasters or substantial increases in gas and fuel prices. disruptions in the capital and credit markets may adversely affect entergy's and its subsidiaries' ability to meet liquidity needs, access capital and operate and grow their businesses, and the cost of capital.
entergy's business is capital intensive and dependent upon its ability to access capital at reasonable rates and other terms. at times there are also spikes in the price for natural gas and other commodities that increase the liquidity requirements of the utility operating companies and entergy wholesale commodities. in addition, entergy's and the utility operating companies' liquidity needs could significantly increase in the event of a hurricane or other weather-
table of contents part i item 1a & 1b entergy corporation, utility operating companies, and system energy related or unforeseen disaster similar to that experienced in entergy's service territory with hurricane katrina and hurricane rita in 2005, hurricane gustav and hurricane ike in 2008, and hurricane isaac in 2012. the occurrence of one or more contingencies, including a delay in regulatory recovery of fuel or purchased power costs or storm restoration costs, higher than expected pension contributions, an acceleration of payments or decreased credit lines, less cash flow from operations than expected, or other unknown events, such as future storms, could cause the financing needs of entergy and its subsidiaries to increase. in addition, accessing the debt capital markets more frequently in these situations may result in an increase in leverage. material leverage increases could negatively affect the credit ratings of entergy and the utility operating companies, which in turn could negatively affect access to the capital markets.
the inability to raise capital on favorable terms, particularly during times of uncertainty in the capital markets, could negatively affect entergy and its subsidiaries' ability to maintain and to expand their businesses. events beyond entergy's control, such as the volatility and disruption in global capital and credit markets in 2008 and
2009, may create uncertainty that could increase its cost of capital or impair its ability to access the capital markets, including the ability to draw on its bank credit facilities. entergy and its subsidiaries are unable to predict the degree of success they will have in renewing or replacing their credit facilities as they come up for renewal. moreover, the size, terms, and covenants of any new credit facilities may not be comparable to, and may be more restrictive than, existing facilities. if entergy and its subsidiaries are unable to access the credit and capital markets on terms that are reasonable, they may have to delay raising capital, issue shorter-term securities and/or bear an unfavorable cost of capital, which, in turn, could impact their ability to grow their businesses, decrease earnings, significantly reduce financial flexibility and/or limit entergy corporation's ability to sustain its current common stock dividend level.
(entergy corporation, entergy arkansas, entergy gulf states louisiana, entergy louisiana, entergy mississippi, entergy new orleans, entergy texas, and system energy)
ability to access capital and/or could require entergy corporation or its subsidiaries to post collateral, accelerate certain payments, or repay certain indebtedness.
there are a number of factors that rating agencies evaluate to arrive at credit ratings for each of entergy corporation and the registrant subsidiaries, including each registrant's regulatory framework, ability to recover costs and earn returns, diversification and financial strength and liquidity. if one or more rating agencies downgrade entergy corporation's, any of the utility operating companies', or system energy's ratings, particularly below investment grade, borrowing costs would increase, the potential pool of investors and funding sources would likely decrease, and cash or letter of credit collateral demands may be triggered by the terms of a number of commodity contracts, leases, and other agreements.
most of entergy corporation's and its subsidiaries' large customers, suppliers, and counterparties require sufficient creditworthiness to enter into transactions. if entergy corporation's or its subsidiaries' ratings decline, particularly below investment grade, or if certain counterparties believe entergy corporation or the utility operating companies are losing creditworthiness and demand adequate assurance under fuel, gas, and purchased power contracts, the counterparties may require posting of collateral in cash or letters of credit, prepayment for fuel, gas or purchased power or accelerated payment, or counterparties may decline business with entergy corporation or its subsidiaries. at december 31, 2014, based on power prices at that time, entergy had liquidity exposure of $159 million under the guarantees in place supporting entergy wholesale commodities transactions and $5 million of posted cash collateral. in the event of a decrease in entergy corporation's credit rating to below investment grade, based on power prices as of december 31, 2014, entergy would have been required to provide approximately $51 million of additional cash or letters of credit under some of the agreements. as of december 31, 2014, the liquidity exposure associated with entergy wholesale commodities assurance requirements, including return of previously posted collateral from counterparties, would increase by $52 million for a $1 per mmbtu increase in gas prices in both the short- and long-term markets.
table of contents part i item 1a & 1b entergy corporation, utility operating companies, and system energy entergy and its subsidiaries' ability to successfully complete strategic transactions, including merger, acquisition, divestiture, joint venture, restructuring or other strategic transactions, is subject to significant risks, including the risk that required regulatory or governmental approvals may not be obtained, risks relating to unknown or undisclosed problems or liabilities, and the risk that for these or other reasons, entergy and its subsidiaries may be unable to achieve some or all of the benefits that they anticipate from such transactions.
from time to time, entergy and its subsidiaries have pursued and may continue to pursue strategic transactions including merger, acquisition, divestiture, joint venture, restructuring or other strategic transactions. in particular, as discussed in note 2 to the financial statements, two of entergy's subsidiaries, entergy louisiana and entergy gulf states louisiana, are undertaking a transaction that would result in the combination of those entities into a single public utility. in addition, as discussed in the "capital expenditure plans and other uses of capital - union power station purchase agreement" section of management's financial discussion and analysis for entergy corporation and subsidiaries, certain of entergy's subsidiaries have entered into an asset purchase agreement to acquire the union power station, consisting of four natural gas-fired, combined-cycle gas turbine power blocks, each rated at 495 mw (summer rating), from union power partners, l.p. each of these transactions is subject to regulatory approval and other material conditions or contingencies. the failure to complete these transactions or any future strategic transaction successfully or on a timely basis could have an adverse effect on entergy's financial condition, results of operations and the market's perception of entergy's ability to execute its strategy. further, these transactions, and any completed or future strategic transactions, involve substantial risks, including the following:
•  acquired businesses or assets may not produce revenues, earnings or cash flow at anticipated levels;
•  acquired businesses or assets could have environmental, permitting or other problems for which contractual protections prove inadequate;
•  to close a transaction, such approvals may be granted subject to terms that are unacceptable to them, or entergy or its subsidiaries otherwise may be unable to achieve anticipated regulatory treatment of any such transaction or acquired business or assets; and
•  entergy or its subsidiaries otherwise may be unable to achieve the full strategic and financial benefits that they anticipate from the transaction, or such benefits may be delayed or may not occur at all.
the construction of, and capital improvements to, power generation facilities involve substantial risks. should construction or capital improvement efforts be unsuccessful, the financial condition, results of operations, or liquidity of entergy and the utility operating companies could be materially affected.
entergy's and the utility operating companies' ability to complete construction of power generation facilities in a timely manner and within budget is contingent upon many variables and subject to substantial risks. these variables include, but are not limited to, project management expertise and escalating costs for materials, labor, and environmental compliance. delays in obtaining permits, shortages in materials and qualified labor, suppliers and contractors not performing as required under their contracts, changes in the scope and timing of projects, poor quality initial cost estimates from contractors, the inability to raise capital on favorable terms, changes in commodity prices affecting revenue, fuel costs, or materials costs, downward changes in the economy, changes in law or regulation, including environmental compliance requirements, and other events beyond the control of the utility operating companies or the entergy wholesale commodities business may occur that may materially affect the schedule, cost, and performance of these projects. if these projects are significantly delayed or become subject to cost overruns or cancellation, entergy and the utility operating companies could incur additional costs and termination payments, or face increased risk of potential write-off of the investment in the project. for further information regarding capital expenditure plans and other uses of capital in connection with the potential construction of additional generation supply sources within the utility operating companies' service territory, and as to the entergy wholesale commodities business, see the " capital expenditure plans and other uses of capital "
section of management's financial discussion and analysis for entergy and each of the registrant subsidiaries.
table of contents part i item 1a & 1b entergy corporation, utility operating companies, and system energy the utility operating companies, system energy, and the entergy wholesale commodities business may incur substantial costs to fulfill their obligations related to environmental and other matters.
the businesses in which the utility operating companies, system energy, and the entergy wholesale commodities business operate are subject to extensive environmental regulation by local, state, and federal authorities. these laws and regulations affect the manner in which the utility operating companies, system energy, and the entergy wholesale commodities business conduct their operations and make capital expenditures. these laws and regulations also affect how the utility operating companies, system energy, and the entergy wholesale commodities business manage air emissions, discharges to water, wetlands impacts, solid and hazardous waste storage and disposal, cooling and service water intake, the protection of threatened and endangered species, hazardous materials transportation, and similar matters. federal, state, and local authorities continually revise these laws and regulations, and the laws and regulations are subject to judicial interpretation and to the permitting and enforcement discretion vested in the implementing agencies. developing and implementing plans for facility compliance with these requirements can lead to capital, personnel, and operation and maintenance expenditures.
violations of these requirements can subject the utility operating companies, system energy, and the entergy wholesale commodities business to enforcement actions, capital expenditures to bring existing facilities into compliance, additional operating costs or operating restrictions to achieve compliance, remediation and clean-up costs, civil penalties, and exposure to third parties' claims for alleged health or property damages or for violations of applicable permits or standards. in addition, the utility operating companies, system energy, and the entergy wholesale commodities business potentially are subject to liability under these laws for the costs of remediation of environmental contamination of property now or formerly owned or operated by the utility operating companies, system energy, and entergy wholesale commodities and of property contaminated by hazardous substances they generate. the utility operating companies are currently involved in proceedings relating to sites where hazardous substances have been released and may be subject to additional proceedings in the future. the utility operating companies, system energy, and the entergy wholesale commodities business have incurred and expect to incur significant costs related to environmental compliance.
emissions of nitrogen and sulfur oxides, mercury, particulates, greenhouse gases, and other regulated air emissions from generating plants are potentially subject to increased regulation, controls and mitigation expenses. in addition, existing air regulations and programs promulgated by the epa often are challenged legally, sometimes resulting in large-scale changes to anticipated regulatory regimes and the resulting need to shift course, both operationally and economically, depending on the nature of the changes. risks relating to global climate change, initiatives to compel greenhouse gas emission reductions, and water availability issues are discussed below.
entergy and its subsidiaries may not be able to obtain or maintain all required environmental regulatory approvals.
if there is a delay in obtaining any required environmental regulatory approvals, or if entergy and its subsidiaries fail to obtain, maintain, or comply with any such approval, the operation of its facilities could be stopped or become subject to additional costs. for further information regarding environmental regulation and environmental matters, see the "
regulation of entergy
s business
- environmental regulation
" section of part i, item 1.
the utility operating companies, system energy, and the entergy wholesale commodities business may incur substantial costs related to reliability standards.
entergy's business is subject to extensive and mandatory reliability standards. such standards, which are established by the north american electric reliability corporation (nerc), the serc reliability corporation (serc), and other regional enforcement entities, are approved by the ferc and frequently are reviewed, amended, and supplemented. failure to comply with such standards could result in the imposition of fines or civil penalties, and potential exposure to third party claims for alleged violations of such standards. the standards, as well as the laws and regulations that govern them, are subject to judicial interpretation and to the enforcement discretion vested in the implementing agencies. in addition to exposure to civil penalties and fines, the utility operating companies have incurred and expect to incur significant costs related to compliance with new and existing reliability standards, including costs associated with the utility operating companies' transmission system and generation assets. the changes to the
table of contents part i item 1a & 1b entergy corporation, utility operating companies, and system energy reliability standards applicable to the electric power industry are ongoing, and entergy cannot predict the ultimate effect that the reliability standards will have on its utility and entergy wholesale commodities.
the effects of weather and economic conditions, and the related impact on electricity and gas usage, may materially affect the utility operating companies
results of operations.
temperatures above normal levels in the summer tend to increase summer cooling electricity demand and revenues, and temperatures below moderate levels in the winter tend to increase winter heating electricity and gas demand and revenues. as a corollary, moderate temperatures tend to decrease usage of energy and resulting revenues. seasonal pricing differentials, coupled with higher consumption levels, typically cause the utility operating companies to report higher revenues in the third quarter of the fiscal year than in the other quarters. extreme weather conditions or storms, however, may stress the utility operating companies' generation facilities and transmission and distribution systems, resulting in increased maintenance and capital costs (and potential increased financing needs), limits on their ability to meet peak customer demand, increased regulatory oversight, and lower customer satisfaction. these extreme conditions could have a material effect on the utility operating companies' financial condition, results of operations, and liquidity.
entergy's electricity sales volumes are affected by a number of factors, including the state of the national and regional economies, weather, customer bill sizes (large bills tend to induce conservation), trends in energy efficiency, and the willingness and ability of large industrial customers to develop co-generation facilities that greatly reduce their demand from entergy. some of these factors are inherently cyclical or temporary in nature, such as the weather or economic conditions, and rarely have a long-lasting impact on entergy's operating results.
others, such as the increasing adoption of energy efficient appliances and building codes, are having a more permanent impact of reducing sales growth rates from historical norms. newer technologies such as distributed generation have not yet had a substantive impact on entergy's electricity sales, but further advances have the potential to do so in the future. since the national economy emerged from the last recession in 2009, entergy's industrial sales in particular have benefited from steady economic growth and relatively low natural gas prices from an historical perspective. any substantial negative change in any of these factors has the potential to result in slower or declining sales growth and increased bad debt expense, which could materially affect entergy's and the utility operating companies' results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity.
the effects of climate change and environmental and regulatory obligations intended to compel greenhouse gas emission reductions or to place a price on greenhouse gas emissions could materially affect the financial condition, results of operations, and liquidity of entergy, the utility operating companies, system energy, and the entergy wholesale commodities business.
in an effort to address climate change concerns, federal, state, and local authorities are calling for additional laws and regulations aimed at known or suspected causes of climate change. for example, in response to the united states supreme court's 2007 decision holding that the epa has authority to regulate emissions of co2 and other
"greenhouse gases" under the clean air act, the epa, various environmental interest groups, and other organizations are focusing considerable attention on co2 emissions from power generation facilities and their potential role in climate change. in 2010, epa promulgated its first regulations controlling greenhouse gas emissions from certain vehicles and from new and significantly modified stationary sources of emissions, including electric generating units. in 2012 and 2013, epa proposed a co2 emission standard for new sources; this standard is expected to be finalized in 2015. additionally, epa proposed a co2 existing source performance standard regulation in 2014 for finalization in 2015. as examples of state action, in the northeast, the regional greenhouse gas initiative (rggi)
table of contents part i item 1a & 1b entergy corporation, utility operating companies, and system energy developing and implementing plans for compliance with greenhouse gas emissions reduction requirements can lead to additional capital, personnel, and operation and maintenance expenditures and could significantly affect the economic position of existing facilities and proposed projects; moreover, long-term planning to meet environmental requirements can be negatively impacted and costs may increase to the extent laws and regulations change prior to full implementation. violations of such requirements may subject entergy wholesale commodities and the utility operating companies to enforcement actions, capital expenditures to bring existing facilities into compliance, additional operating costs or operating restrictions to achieve compliance, civil penalties, and exposure to third parties' claims for alleged health or property damages or for violations of applicable permits or standards. to the extent entergy believes any of these costs are recoverable in rates, however, additional material rate increases for customers could be resisted by entergy's regulators and, in extreme cases, entergy's regulators might deny or defer timely recovery of these costs. future changes in environmental regulation governing the emission of co2 and other greenhouse gases could make some of entergy's electric generating units uneconomical to maintain or operate, and could increase the difficulty that entergy and its subsidiaries have with obtaining or maintaining required environmental regulatory approvals, which could also materially affect the financial condition, results of operations and liquidity of entergy and its subsidiaries. in addition, lawsuits currently are pending or are reasonably expected against emitters of greenhouse gases alleging that these companies are liable for personal injuries and property damage caused by climate change. these lawsuits may seek injunctive relief, monetary compensation, and punitive damages.
in addition to the regulatory and financial risks associated with climate change discussed above, physical risks from climate change include an increase in sea level, wind and storm surge damages, wetland and barrier island erosion, risks of flooding and changes in weather conditions, such as changes in precipitation, drought, average temperatures, and potential increased impacts of extreme weather conditions or storms. entergy subsidiaries own assets in, and serve, communities that are at risk from sea level rise, changes in weather conditions, storms, and loss of the protection offered by coastal wetlands. a significant portion of the nation's oil and gas infrastructure is located in these areas and susceptible to storm damage that could be aggravated by wetland and barrier island erosion, which could give rise to fuel supply interruptions and price spikes. entergy and its subsidiaries also face the risk that climate change could impact the availability and quality of water supply necessary for operations.
these and other physical changes could result in changes in customer demand, increased costs associated with repairing and maintaining generation facilities and transmission and distribution systems resulting in increased maintenance and capital costs (and potential increased financing needs), limits on the entergy system's ability to meet peak customer demand, increased regulatory oversight, and lower customer satisfaction. also, to the extent that climate change adversely impacts the economic health of a region or results in energy conservation or demand side management programs, it may adversely impact customer demand and revenues. such physical or operational risks could have a material effect on entergy's, entergy wholesale commodities', system energy's, and the utility operating companies' financial condition, results of operations, and liquidity.
continued and future availability and quality of water for cooling, process, and sanitary uses could materially affect the financial condition, results of operations, and liquidity of the utility operating companies, system energy, and the entergy wholesale commodities business.
water is a vital natural resource that is also critical to the utility operating companies'
, system energy's, and entergy wholesale commodities' business operations. entergy's facilities use water for cooling, boiler make-up, sanitary uses, potable supply, and many other uses. two of entergy's utility operating companies own and/or operate hydroelectric facilities. accordingly, water availability and quality are critical to entergy's business operations. impacts to water availability or quality could negatively impact both operations and revenues.
entergy secures water through various mechanisms (ground water wells, surface waters intakes, municipal supply, etc.) and operates under the provisions and conditions set forth by the provider and/or regulatory authorities.
entergy also obtains and operates in substantial compliance with water discharge permits issued under various provisions of the clean water act. regulations and authorizations for both water intake and use and for waste discharge can become more stringent in times of water shortages, low flows in rivers, low lake levels, low groundwater
table of contents part i item 1a & 1b entergy corporation, utility operating companies, and system energy aquifer volumes, and similar conditions. the increased use of water by industry, agriculture, and the population at large, population growth, and the potential impacts of climate change on water resources may cause water use restrictions that affect entergy and its subsidiaries.
entergy and its subsidiaries may not be adequately hedged against changes in commodity prices, which could materially affect entergy's and its subsidiaries' results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity.
to manage near-term financial exposure related to commodity price fluctuations, entergy and its subsidiaries, including the utility operating companies and the entergy wholesale commodities business, may enter into contracts to hedge portions of their purchase and sale commitments, fuel requirements, and inventories of natural gas, uranium and its conversion and enrichment, coal, refined products, and other commodities, within established risk management guidelines. as part of this strategy, entergy and its subsidiaries may utilize fixed- and variable-price forward physical purchase and sales contracts, futures, financial swaps, and option contracts traded in the over-
the-counter markets or on exchanges. however, entergy and its subsidiaries normally cover only a portion of the exposure of their assets and positions to market price volatility, and the coverage will vary over time. in addition, entergy also elects to leave certain volumes during certain years unhedged. to the extent entergy and its subsidiaries have unhedged positions, fluctuating commodity prices can materially affect entergy's and its subsidiaries' results of operations and financial position.
although entergy and its subsidiaries devote a considerable effort to these risk management strategies, they cannot eliminate all the risks associated with these activities. as a result of these and other factors, entergy and its subsidiaries cannot predict with precision the impact that risk management decisions may have on their business, results of operations, or financial position.
entergy has guaranteed or indemnified the performance of a portion of the obligations relating to hedging and risk management activities. reductions in entergy's or its subsidiaries' credit quality or changes in the market prices of energy commodities could increase the cash or letter of credit collateral required to be posted in connection with hedging and risk management activities, which could materially affect entergy's or its subsidiaries' liquidity and financial position.
the utility operating companies and the entergy wholesale commodities business are exposed to the risk that counterparties may not meet their obligations, which may materially affect the utility operating companies and entergy wholesale commodities.
the hedging and risk management practices of the utility operating companies and the entergy wholesale commodities business are exposed to the risk that counterparties that owe entergy and its subsidiaries money, energy, or other commodities will not perform their obligations. currently, some hedging agreements contain provisions that require the counterparties to provide credit support to secure all or part of their obligations to entergy or its subsidiaries. if the counterparties to these arrangements fail to perform, entergy or its subsidiaries may enforce and recover the proceeds from the credit support provided and acquire alternative hedging arrangements, which credit support may not always be adequate to cover the related obligations. in such event, entergy and its subsidiaries might incur losses in addition to amounts, if any, already paid to the counterparties. in addition, the credit commitments of entergy's lenders under its bank facilities may not be honored for a variety of reasons, including unexpected periods of financial distress affecting such lenders, which could materially affect the adequacy of its liquidity sources.
the wall street transparency and accountability act of 2010 and rules and regulations promulgated under the act may adversely affect the ability of the utility operating companies and the entergy wholesale commodities business to utilize certain commodity derivatives for hedging and mitigating commercial risk.
the wall street transparency and accountability act of 2010, which was enacted on july 21, 2010 as part of the dodd-frank wall street reform and consumer protection act (act), and the rules and regulations promulgated under the act impose governmental regulation on the over-the-counter derivative market, including the commodity
table of contents part i item 1a & 1b entergy corporation, utility operating companies, and system energy swaps used by the utility operating companies and the entergy wholesale commodities business to hedge and mitigate commercial risk. under the act, certain swaps are subject to mandatory clearing and exchange trading requirements.
swap dealers and major market participants in the swap market are subject to capital, margin, registration, reporting, recordkeeping, and business conduct requirements with respect to their swap activities. entergy is not a swap dealer or a major swap participant, and does not expect to qualify as either in the future. non-swap dealers and non-major swap participants, such as entergy, are subject to reporting, recordkeeping, and business conduct requirements (i.e., anti-manipulation, anti-disruptive trading practices, and whistleblower provisions) with respect to their swap activities. position limits may also apply to certain swaps activities. position limit rules promulgated by the commodity futures trading commission were vacated by the us district court for the district of columbia. the commodity futures trading commission has subsequently proposed new position limit rules. if the commodity futures trading commission's issues final position limit rules, those rules may apply to certain of entergy's swaps activities.
the act required the applicable regulators, which in the case of commodity swaps will be the commodity futures trading commission, to engage in substantial rulemaking in order to implement the provisions of the act and such rulemaking has been largely completed. both the utility operating companies and the entergy wholesale commodities business currently utilize commodity swaps to hedge and mitigate commodity price risk. it is not known whether the act and regulations promulgated under the act will have an adverse effect upon the market for the commodity swaps used by the utility operating companies and the entergy wholesale commodities business. however, to the extent that the act and regulations promulgated under the act have the effect of increasing the price of such commodity swaps or limiting or reducing the availability of such commodity swaps, whether through the imposition of additional capital, margin, or compliance costs upon market participants, the imposition of position limits, or otherwise, the financial performance of the utility operating companies and/or the entergy wholesale commodities business may be adversely affected. to the extent that the utility operating companies and the entergy wholesale commodities business may be required to post margin in connection with existing or future commodity swaps in addition to any margin currently posted by such entities, such entities may need to secure additional sources of capital to meet such liquidity needs or cease utilizing such commodity swaps.
market performance and other changes may decrease the value of benefit plan assets, which then could require additional funding.
the performance of the capital markets affects the values of the assets held in trust under entergy's pension and postretirement benefit plans. a decline in the market value of the assets may increase the funding requirements relating to entergy's benefit plan liabilities. volatility in the capital markets has affected the market value of these assets, which may affect entergy's planned levels of contributions in the future. additionally, changes in interest rates affect the liabilities under entergy's pension and postretirement benefit plans; as interest rates decrease, the liabilities increase, potentially requiring additional funding. the funding requirements of the obligations related to the pension benefit plans can also increase as a result of changes in, among other factors, retirement rates, life expectancy assumptions, or federal regulations. for further information regarding entergy's pension and other postretirement benefit plans, refer to the "
- qualified pension and other postretirement benefits " section of management's financial discussion and analysis for entergy and each of its registrant subsidiaries and note 11 to the financial statements.
the litigation environment in the states in which certain entergy subsidiaries operate poses a significant risk to those businesses.
entergy and its subsidiaries are involved in the ordinary course of business in a number of lawsuits involving employment, commercial, asbestos, hazardous material and ratepayer matters, and injuries and damages issues, among other matters. the states in which the utility operating companies operate, in particular louisiana, mississippi, and texas, have proven to be unusually litigious environments. judges and juries in these states have demonstrated a willingness to grant large verdicts, including punitive damages, to plaintiffs in personal injury, property damage, and
table of contents part i item 1a & 1b entergy corporation, utility operating companies, and system energy business tort cases. entergy and its subsidiaries use legal and appropriate means to contest litigation threatened or filed against them, but the litigation environment in these states poses a significant business risk.
domestic or international terrorist attacks, including cyber attacks, and failures or breaches of entergy's and its subsidiaries' technology systems may adversely affect entergy's results of operations.
as power generators and distributors, entergy and its subsidiaries face heightened risk of an act or threat of terrorism, including physical and cyber attacks, either as a direct act against one of entergy's generation facilities, transmission operations centers, or distribution infrastructure used to manage and transport power to customers. an actual act could affect entergy's ability to operate the necessary information technology systems and network infrastructure. the utility operating companies also face heightened risk of an act or threat by cyber criminals, intent on accessing personal information for the purpose of committing identity theft.
entergy and its subsidiaries operate in a highly regulated industry that requires the continued operation of sophisticated information technology systems and network infrastructure in accordance with prescriptive standards.
despite the implementation of multiple layers of security by entergy and its subsidiaries, technology systems remain vulnerable to potential threats that could lead to unauthorized access or loss of availability to critical systems essential to the reliable operation of entergy's electric system. if entergy's or its subsidiaries'
technology systems were compromised and unable to recover timely to a normal state of operations, entergy or its subsidiaries may be unable to perform critical business functions that are essential to the company's well-being and the health, safety, and security needs of its customers. in addition, an attack on its information technology infrastructure may result in a loss of its confidential, sensitive, and proprietary information, including personal information of its customers, employees, vendors, and others in entergy's care.
if any such attacks, failures or breaches were to occur, entergy's and the utility operating companies' business, financial condition, and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. the risk of such attacks, failures, or breaches may cause entergy and the utility operating companies to incur increased capital and operating costs to implement increased security for its nuclear power plants and other facilities, such as additional physical facility security and additional security personnel, and for systems to protect its information technology and network infrastructure systems. such events may also expose entergy to an increased risk of judgments and fines.
changes in taxation as well as the inherent difficulty in quantifying potential tax effects of business decisions could negatively impact entergy's, the utility operating companies', and system energy's results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.
entergy and its subsidiaries make judgments regarding the potential tax effects of various transactions and results of operations to estimate their obligations to taxing authorities. these tax obligations include income, franchise, real estate, sales and use, and employment-related taxes. these judgments include provisions for potential adverse outcomes regarding tax positions that have been taken. entergy and its subsidiaries also estimate their ability to utilize tax benefits, including those in the form of carryforwards for which the benefits have already been reflected in the financial statements. changes in federal, state, or local tax laws, adverse tax audit results or adverse tax rulings on positions taken by entergy and its subsidiaries could negatively affect entergy's, the utility operating companies', and system energy's results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity. for further information regarding entergy's income taxes, refer to note 3 to the financial statements.
the effect of higher purchased gas cost charges to customers may adversely affect entergy gulf states louisiana's and entergy new orleans's results of operations and liquidity.
gas rates charged to retail gas customers are comprised primarily of purchased gas cost charges, which provide no return or profit to entergy gulf states louisiana or entergy new orleans, and distribution charges, which provide
table of contents part i item 1a & 1b entergy corporation, utility operating companies, and system energy a return or profit to the utility. distribution charges are affected by the amount of gas sold to customers.
purchased gas cost charges, which comprise most of a customer's bill and may be adjusted monthly, represent gas commodity costs that entergy gulf states louisiana or entergy new orleans recovers from its customers. entergy gulf states louisiana's or entergy new orleans's cash flows can be affected by differences between the time period when gas is purchased and the time when ultimate recovery from customers occurs. when purchased gas cost charges increase substantially reflecting higher gas procurement costs incurred by entergy gulf states louisiana or entergy new orleans, customer usage may decrease, especially in weaker economic times, resulting in lower distribution charges for entergy gulf states louisiana or entergy new orleans, which could adversely affect results of operations.
(system energy)
system energy owns and operates a single nuclear generating facility, and it is dependent on affiliated companies for all of its revenues.
system energy's operating revenues are derived from the allocation of the capacity, energy, and related costs associated with its 90% ownership/leasehold interest in grand gulf. charges under the unit power sales agreement are paid by the utility operating companies as consideration for their respective entitlements to receive capacity and energy. the useful economic life of grand gulf is finite and is limited by the terms of its operating license, which is currently due to expire on november 1, 2024. system energy filed in october 2011 an application with the nrc for an extension of grand gulf's operating license to 2044. system energy's financial condition depends both on the receipt of payments from the utility operating companies under the unit power sales agreement and on the continued commercial operation of grand gulf.
for information regarding the unit power sales agreement, the sale and leaseback transactions and certain other agreements relating to the entergy system companies' support of system energy (including the capital funds agreement), see the "
" section of note 8 to the financial statements and the " sale and leaseback transactions " section of note 10 to the financial statements, and the "
- system energy and related agreements " section of part i, item 1.
as a holding company, entergy corporation depends on cash distributions from its subsidiaries to meet its debt service and other financial obligations and to pay dividends on its common stock.
entergy corporation is a holding company with no material revenue generating operations of its own or material assets other than the stock of its subsidiaries. accordingly, all of its operations are conducted by its subsidiaries. entergy corporation's ability to satisfy its financial obligations, including the payment of interest and principal on its outstanding debt, and to pay dividends on its common stock depends on the payment to it of dividends or distributions by its subsidiaries. the payments of dividends or distributions to entergy corporation by its subsidiaries in turn depend on their results of operations and cash flows and other items affecting retained earnings, and on any applicable legal, regulatory, or contractual limitations on subsidiaries' ability to pay such dividends or distributions. provisions in the organizational documents, indentures for debt issuances, and other agreements of certain of entergy corporation's subsidiaries restrict the payment of cash dividends to entergy corporation. for further information regarding dividend or distribution restrictions to entergy corporation, see the "
" section of note 7 to the financial statements.
table of contents entergy arkansas, inc. and subsidiaries management's financial discussion and analysis results of operations net income
net income decreased by $40.6 million primarily due to higher other operation and maintenance expenses, lower other income, higher depreciation and amortization expenses, and a higher effective income tax rate, partially offset by higher net revenue.
net income increased $9.6 million primarily due to higher net revenue, higher other income, lower nuclear refueling outage expenses, and a lower effective income tax rate, partially offset by higher other operation and maintenance expenses, higher interest expense, and higher depreciation and amortization expenses.
net revenue consists of operating revenues net of: 1) fuel, fuel-related expenses, and gas purchased for resale, 2)
purchased power expenses, and 3) other regulatory credits. following is an analysis of the change in net revenue comparing 2014 to 2013.
the retail electric price variance is primarily due to an increase in the energy efficiency rider, as approved by the apsc, effective july 2013 and july 2014, and the effect of the apsc's order in the 2013 rate case, including an annual base rate increase effective january 2014, offset by a miso rider to provide customers credits in rates for transmission revenue received through miso. energy efficiency revenues are largely offset by costs included in other operation and maintenance expenses and have minimal effect on net income. see note 2 to the financial statements for further discussion of the rate case.

ano damage, outage, and nrc reviews on march 31, 2013, during a scheduled refueling outage at ano 1, a contractor-owned and operated heavy-lifting apparatus collapsed while moving the generator stator out of the turbine building. the collapse resulted in the death of an ironworker and injuries to several other contract workers, caused ano 2 to shut down, and damaged the ano turbine building. the turbine building serves both ano 1 and 2 and is a non-radiological area of the plant. ano
2 reconnected to the grid on april 28, 2013 and ano 1 reconnected to the grid on august 7, 2013. the total cost of assessment, restoration of off-site power, site restoration, debris removal, and replacement of damaged property and equipment was approximately $95 million. in addition, entergy arkansas incurred replacement power costs for ano
2 power during its outage and incurred incremental replacement power costs for ano 1 power because the outage extended beyond the originally-planned duration of the refueling outage. in february 2014 the apsc approved entergy arkansas's request to exclude from the calculation of its revised energy cost rate $65.9 million of deferred fuel and purchased energy costs incurred in 2013 as a result of the ano stator incident. the apsc authorized entergy arkansas to retain the $65.9 million in its deferred fuel balance with recovery to be reviewed in a later period after more information regarding various claims associated with the ano stator incident is available.
entergy arkansas is pursuing its options for recovering damages that resulted from the stator drop, including its insurance coverage and legal action. entergy is a member of nuclear electric insurance limited (neil), a mutual insurance company that provides property damage coverage to the members' nuclear generating plants, including ano.
neil has notified entergy that it believes that a $50 million course of construction sublimit applies to any loss associated with the lifting apparatus failure and stator drop at ano. entergy has responded that it disagrees with neil's position and is evaluating its options for enforcing its rights under the policy. during 2014, entergy arkansas collected $50 million from neil and is pursuing additional recoveries due under the policy. on july 12,
2013, entergy arkansas filed a complaint in the circuit court in pope county, arkansas against the owner of the heavy-lifting apparatus that collapsed, an engineering firm, a contractor, and certain individuals asserting claims of breach of contract, negligence, and gross negligence in connection with their responsibility for the stator drop.
shortly after the stator incident, the nrc deployed an augmented inspection team to review the plant's response. in july 2013 a second team of nrc inspectors visited ano to evaluate certain items that were identified as requiring follow-up inspection to determine whether performance deficiencies existed. in march 2014 the nrc issued an inspection report on the follow-up inspection that discussed two preliminary findings, one that was preliminarily determined to be "red with high safety significance" for unit 1 and one that was preliminarily determined to be
"yellow with substantial safety significance" for unit 2, with the nrc indicating further that these preliminary findings may warrant additional regulatory oversight. this report also noted that one additional item related to flood barrier effectiveness was still under review.
table of contents entergy arkansas, inc. and subsidiaries management's financial discussion and analysis in may 2014 the nrc met with entergy during a regulatory conference to discuss the preliminary red and yellow findings and entergy's response to the findings. during the regulatory conference, entergy presented information on the facts and assumptions the nrc used to assess the potential findings. the nrc used the information provided by entergy at the regulatory conference to finalize its decision regarding the inspection team's findings. in a letter dated june 23, 2014, the nrc classified both findings as "yellow with substantial safety significance." in an assessment follow-up letter for ano dated july 29, 2014, the nrc stated that given the two yellow findings, it determined that the performance at ano is in the "degraded cornerstone column," or column 3, of the nrc's reactor oversight process action matrix beginning the first quarter 2014. corrective actions in response to the nrc's findings have been taken and remain ongoing at ano. the nrc plans to conduct supplemental inspection activity to review the actions taken to address the yellow findings. entergy will continue to interact with the nrc to address the nrc's findings.
in september 2014 the nrc issued an inspection report on the flood barrier effectiveness issue that was still under review at the time of the march 2014 inspection report. while entergy believes that the flood barrier issues that led to the finding have been addressed at ano, nrc processes still required that the nrc assess the safety significance of the deficiencies. in its september 2014 inspection report, the nrc discussed a preliminary finding of "yellow with substantial safety significance" for the unit 1 and unit 2 auxiliary and emergency diesel fuel storage buildings. the nrc indicated that these preliminary findings may warrant additional regulatory oversight.
28, 2014. during the regulatory conference, entergy presented information related to the facts and assumptions used by the nrc in arriving at its preliminary finding of "yellow with substantial safety significance." in january 2015
the nrc issued its final risk significance determination for the flood barrier violation originally cited in the september 2014 report. the nrc's final risk significance determination was classified as "yellow with substantial safety significance."
the nrc's january 2015 letter did not advise ano of the additional level of oversight that will result from the yellow finding related to the flood barrier issue, and it stated that the nrc would inform ano of this decision by separate correspondence. the yellow finding may result in ano being placed into the "multiple/repetitive degraded cornerstone column" of the nrc's reactor oversight process action matrix. placement into this column would require significant additional nrc inspection activities at the ano site, including a review of the site's root cause evaluation associated with the flood barrier and stator issues, an assessment of the effectiveness of the site's corrective action program, an additional design basis inspection, a safety culture assessment, and possibly other inspection activities consistent with the nrc's inspection procedure. the additional nrc inspection activities at the site are expected to increase ano's operating costs.

2013 base rate filing in march 2013, entergy arkansas filed with the apsc for a general change in rates, charges, and tariffs. the filing assumed entergy arkansas's transition to miso in december 2013, and requested a rate increase of $174 million , including $49 million of revenue being transferred from collection in riders to base rates. the filing also proposed a new transmission rider and a capacity cost recovery rider. the filing requested a 10.4% return on common equity. in september 2013, entergy arkansas filed testimony reflecting an updated rate increase request of $145
million , with no change to its requested return on common equity of 10.4% . hearings in the proceeding began in october 2013, and in december 2013 the apsc issued an order. the order authorized a base rate increase of $81
million and included an authorized return on common equity of 9.3% . the order allows entergy arkansas to amortize its human capital management costs over a three-and-a-half year period, but also orders entergy arkansas to file a detailed report of the arkansas-specific costs, savings and final payroll changes upon conclusion of the human capital management strategic imperative. the detailed report was subsequently filed in february 2015. the substance of the report will be addressed in entergy arkansas's next base rate filing. new rates were implemented in the first billing cycle of march 2014, effective as of january 2014. additionally, in january 2014, entergy arkansas filed a petition for rehearing or clarification of several aspects of the apsc's order, including the 9.3%
authorized return on common equity. in february 2014 the apsc granted entergy arkansas's petition for the purpose of considering the additional evidence identified by entergy arkansas. in august 2014 the apsc issued an order amending certain aspects of the original order, including providing for a 9.5% authorized return on common equity.
pursuant to the august 2014 order, revised rates are effective for all bills rendered after december 31, 2013 and were implemented in the first billing cycle of october 2014.
on january 30, 2015, entergy arkansas filed with the apsc a notice of intent to file a rate case within 60 to 90
production cost allocation rider the apsc approved a production cost allocation rider for recovery from customers of the retail portion of the costs allocated to entergy arkansas as a result of the system agreement proceedings. these costs cause an increase in entergy arkansas's deferred fuel cost balance because entergy arkansas pays the costs over seven months but collects them from customers over twelve months. see note 2 to the financial statements and entergy corporation and subsidiaries "
management's financial discussion and analysis -
system agreement " for discussions of the system agreement proceedings.
in may 2014, entergy arkansas filed its annual redetermination of the production cost allocation rider to recover the $3 million unrecovered retail balance as of december 31, 2013 and the $67.8 million system agreement bandwidth remedy payment made in may 2014 as a result of the compliance filing pursuant to the ferc's february 2014 orders related to the bandwidth payments/receipts for the june - december 2005 period. in june 2014 the apsc suspended the annual redetermination of the production cost allocation rider and scheduled a hearing in september 2014. upon a joint motion of the parties, the apsc canceled the september 2014 hearing and in january 2015 the apsc issued an order approving entergy arkansas's request for recovery of the $3 million under-recovered amount based on the true-
up of the production cost allocation rider and the $67.8 million may 2014 system agreement bandwidth remedy payment subject to refund with interest, with recovery of these payments concluding with the last billing cycle in december
2015. the apsc also found that entergy arkansas is entitled to carrying charges pursuant to the current terms of the production cost allocation rider. entergy arkansas made its compliance filing pursuant to the order in january
2015 and the apsc issued its approval order, also in january 2015. the redetermined rate went into effect the first billing cycle of february 2015.
table of contents entergy arkansas, inc. and subsidiaries management's financial discussion and analysis energy cost recovery rider entergy arkansas's retail rates include an energy cost recovery rider to recover fuel and purchased energy costs in monthly customer bills. the rider utilizes the prior calendar-year energy costs and projected energy sales for the twelve-month period commencing on april 1 of each year to develop an energy cost rate, which is redetermined annually and includes a true-up adjustment reflecting the over- or under-recovery, including carrying charges, of the energy costs for the prior calendar year. the energy cost recovery rider tariff also allows an interim rate request depending upon the level of over- or under-recovery of fuel and purchased energy costs.
in october 2005 the apsc initiated an investigation into entergy arkansas's interim energy cost recovery rate. the investigation focused on entergy arkansas's 1) gas contracting, portfolio, and hedging practices; 2) wholesale purchases during the period; 3) management of the coal inventory at its coal generation plants; and 4) response to the contractual failure of the railroads to provide coal deliveries. in march 2006 the apsc extended its investigation to cover the costs included in entergy arkansas's march 2006 annual energy cost rate filing, and a hearing was held in the apsc investigation in october 2006.
in january 2007 the apsc issued an order in its review of the energy cost rate. the apsc found that entergy arkansas failed to maintain an adequate coal inventory level going into the summer of 2005 and that entergy arkansas should be responsible for any incremental energy costs that resulted from two outages caused by employee and contractor error. the coal plant generation curtailments were caused by railroad delivery problems and entergy arkansas has since resolved litigation with the railroad regarding the delivery problems. the apsc staff was directed to perform an analysis with entergy arkansas's assistance to determine the additional fuel and purchased energy costs associated with these findings and file the analysis within sixty days of the order. after a final determination of the costs is made by the apsc, entergy arkansas will be directed to refund that amount with interest to its customers as a credit on the energy cost recovery rider. entergy arkansas requested rehearing of the order.
in february 2010 the apsc denied entergy arkansas's request for rehearing, and held a hearing in september 2010 to determine the amount of damages, if any, that should be assessed against entergy arkansas. a decision is pending.
entergy arkansas expects the amount of damages, if any, to have an immaterial effect on its results of operations, financial position, or cash flows.
in january 2014, entergy arkansas filed a motion with the apsc relating to its redetermination of its energy cost rate to be filed in march 2014. in that motion, entergy arkansas requested that the apsc authorize entergy arkansas to exclude $65.9 million of deferred fuel and purchased energy costs incurred in 2013 from the redetermination of its 2014 energy cost rate. the $65.9 million is an estimate of the incremental fuel and replacement energy costs that entergy arkansas incurred as a result of the ano stator incident. entergy arkansas requested that the apsc authorize entergy arkansas to retain that amount in its deferred fuel balance, with recovery to be reviewed in a later period after more information is available regarding various claims associated with the ano stator incident.

table of contents entergy arkansas, inc. and subsidiaries management's financial discussion and analysis including costs recorded as regulatory assets of approximately $22 million. in the entergy arkansas 2013 rate case, the apsc approved inclusion of the construction spending in rate base and approved an increase in the normal storm cost accrual, which will effectively amortize the regulatory asset over a five-year period.
opportunity sales proceeding in june 2009, the lpsc filed a complaint requesting that the ferc determine that certain of entergy arkansas's sales of electric energy to third parties: (a) violated the provisions of the system agreement that allocate the energy generated by entergy system resources, (b) imprudently denied the entergy system and its ultimate consumers the benefits of low-cost entergy system generating capacity, and (c) violated the provision of the system agreement that prohibits sales to third parties by individual companies absent an offer of a right-of-first-refusal to other utility operating companies. the lpsc's complaint challenges sales made beginning in 2002 and requests refunds. in july 2009, the utility operating companies filed a response to the complaint requesting that the ferc dismiss the complaint on the merits without hearing because the lpsc has failed to meet its burden of showing any violation of the system agreement and failed to produce any evidence of imprudent action by the entergy system. in their response, the utility operating companies explained that the system agreement clearly contemplates that the utility operating companies may make sales to third parties for their own account, subject to the requirement that those sales be included in the load (or load shape) for the applicable utility operating company. the response further explained that the ferc already had determined that entergy arkansas's short-term wholesale sales did not trigger the "right-of-first-refusal" provision of the system agreement. while the d.c. circuit recently determined that the
"right-of-first-refusal" issue was not properly before the ferc at the time of its earlier decision on the issue, the lpsc raised no additional claims or facts that would warrant the ferc reaching a different conclusion.
the lpsc filed direct testimony in the proceeding alleging, among other things, (1) that entergy violated the system agreement by permitting entergy arkansas to make non-requirements sales to non-affiliated third parties rather than making such energy available to the other utility operating companies' customers; and (2) that over the period 2000 - 2009, these non-requirements sales caused harm to the utility operating companies' customers and these customers should be compensated for this harm by entergy. in subsequent testimony, the lpsc modified its original damages claim in favor of quantifying damages by re-running intra-system bills. the utility operating companies believe the lpsc's allegations are without merit. a hearing in the matter was held in august 2010.
in december 2010, the alj issued an initial decision. the alj found that the system agreement allowed for entergy arkansas to make the sales to third parties but concluded that the sales should be accounted for in the same manner as joint account sales. the alj concluded that "shareholders" should make refunds of the damages to the utility operating companies, along with interest. entergy disagreed with several aspects of the alj's initial decision and in january 2011 filed with the ferc exceptions to the decision.
the ferc issued a decision in june 2012 and held that, while the system agreement is ambiguous, it does provide authority for individual utility operating companies to make opportunity sales for their own account and entergy arkansas made and priced these sales in good faith. the ferc found, however, that the system agreement does not provide authority for an individual utility operating company to allocate the energy associated with such opportunity sales as part of its load, but provides a different allocation authority. the ferc further found that the after-the-fact accounting methodology used to allocate the energy used to supply the sales was inconsistent with the system agreement. quantifying the effect of the ferc's decision will require re-running intra-system bills for a ten-year period, and the ferc in its decision established further hearing procedures to determine the calculation of the effects. in july 2012, entergy and the lpsc filed requests for rehearing of the ferc's june 2012
decision, which are pending with the ferc.
as required by the procedural schedule established in the calculation proceeding, entergy filed its direct testimony that included a proposed illustrative re-run, consistent with the directives in ferc's order, of intra-
system bills for 2003, 2004, and 2006, the three years with the highest volume of opportunity sales. entergy's proposed illustrative re-run of intra-system bills shows that the potential cost for entergy arkansas would be up to $12 million
table of contents entergy arkansas, inc. and subsidiaries management's financial discussion and analysis for the years 2003, 2004, and 2006, excluding interest, and the potential benefit would be significantly less than that for each of the other utility operating companies. entergy's proposed illustrative re-run of the intra-system bills also shows an offsetting potential benefit to entergy arkansas for the years 2003, 2004, and 2006 resulting from the effects of the ferc's order on system agreement service schedules mss-1, mss-2, and mss-3, and the potential offsetting cost would be significantly less than that for each of the other utility operating companies.
entergy provided to the lpsc an illustrative intra-system bill recalculation as specified by the lpsc for the years
2003, 2004, and 2006, and the lpsc then filed answering testimony in december 2012. in its testimony the lpsc claims that the damages, excluding interest, that should be paid by entergy arkansas to the other utility operating company's customers for 2003, 2004, and 2006 are $42 million to entergy gulf states, inc., $7 million to entergy louisiana, $23 million to entergy mississippi, and $4 million to entergy new orleans. the ferc staff and certain intervenors filed direct and answering testimony in february 2013. in april 2013, entergy filed its rebuttal testimony in that proceeding, including a revised illustrative re-run of the intra-system bills for the years 2003,
2004, and 2006. the revised calculation determines the re-pricing of the opportunity sales based on consideration of moveable resources only and the removal of exchange energy received by entergy arkansas, which increases the potential cost for entergy arkansas over the three years 2003, 2004, and 2006 by $2.3 million from the potential costs identified in the utility operating companies' prior filings in september and october 2012. a hearing was held in may 2013 to quantify the effect of repricing the opportunity sales in accordance with the ferc's decision.
in august 2013 the presiding judge issued an initial decision in the calculation proceeding. the initial decision concludes that the methodology proposed by the lpsc, rather than the methodologies proposed by entergy or the ferc staff, should be used to calculate the payments that entergy arkansas is to make to the other utility operating companies. the initial decision also concludes that the other system agreement service schedules should not be adjusted and that payments by entergy arkansas should not be reflected in the rough production cost equalization bandwidth calculations for the applicable years. the initial decision does recognize that the lpsc's methodology would result in an inequitable windfall to the other utility operating companies and, therefore, concludes that any payments by entergy arkansas should be reduced by 20%. the utility operating companies are currently analyzing the effects of the initial decision. the lpsc, apsc, city council, and ferc staff filed briefs on exceptions and/or briefs opposing exceptions. entergy filed a brief on exceptions requesting that ferc reverse the initial decision and a brief opposing certain exceptions taken by the lpsc and ferc staff. the ferc's review of the initial decision is pending. no payments will be made or received by the utility operating companies until the ferc issues an order reviewing the initial decision and entergy submits a subsequent filing to comply with that order.

2012. the three orders require u.s. nuclear operators to undertake plant modifications and perform additional analyses that will, among other things, result in increased operating and capital costs associated with operating nuclear plants. the nrc, with input from the industry, is continuing to determine the specific actions required by the orders. entergy arkansas's estimated capital expenditures for 2015 through 2017 for complying with the nrc orders are included in the planned construction and other capital investments estimates given in "

environmental risks entergy arkansas's facilities and operations are subject to regulation by various governmental authorities having jurisdiction over air quality, water quality, control of toxic substances and hazardous and solid wastes, and other environmental matters. management believes that entergy arkansas is in substantial compliance with environmental regulations currently applicable to its facilities and operations. because environmental regulations are subject to change, future compliance costs cannot be precisely estimated.
critical accounting estimates the preparation of entergy arkansas's financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to apply appropriate accounting policies and to make estimates and judgments that can have a significant effect on reported financial position, results of operations, and cash flows. management has identified the following accounting policies and estimates as critical because they are based on assumptions and measurements that involve a high degree of uncertainty, and the potential for future changes in the assumptions and measurements that could produce estimates that would have a material effect on the presentation of entergy arkansas's financial position or results of operations.
" section of entergy corporation and subsidiaries management's financial discussion and analysis for discussion of the estimates inherent in accounting for nuclear decommissioning costs.
as a result of a revised decommissioning cost study. the revised estimates resulted in a $47.6 million increase in the decommissioning cost liabilities, along with a corresponding increase in the related asset retirement cost assets that will be depreciated over the remaining lives of the units.
unbilled revenue as discussed in note 1 to the financial statements, entergy arkansas records an estimate of the revenues earned for energy delivered since the latest customer billing. each month the estimated unbilled revenue amounts are recorded as revenue and a receivable, and the prior month's estimate is reversed. the difference between the estimate of the
table of contents entergy arkansas, inc. and subsidiaries management's financial discussion and analysis unbilled receivable at the beginning of the period and the end of the period is the amount of unbilled revenue recognized during the period. the estimate recorded is primarily based upon an estimate of customer usage during the unbilled period and the billed price to customers in that month. therefore, revenue recognized may be affected by the estimated price and usage at the beginning and end of each period, in addition to changes in certain components of the calculation.
qualified pension and other postretirement benefits entergy arkansas's qualified pension and other postretirement reported costs, as described in note 11 to the financial statements, are impacted by numerous factors including the provisions of the plans, changing employee demographics, and various actuarial calculations, assumptions, and accounting mechanisms. see the " qualified pension and other postretirement benefits
" section of entergy corporation and subsidiaries management's financial discussion and analysis for further discussion. because of the complexity of these calculations, the long-term nature of these obligations, and the importance of the assumptions utilized, entergy's estimate of these costs is a critical accounting estimate.

the retirement and mortality rate assumptions are reviewed every three-to-five years as part of an actuarial study that compares these assumptions to the actual experience of the pension and other postretirement plans. the 2014
actuarial study reviewed plan experience from 2010 through 2013. as a result of the 2014 actuarial study and the issuance of new mortality tables in october 2014 by the society of actuaries, changes were made to reflect modified demographic pattern expectations as well as longer life expectancies. these changes are reflected in the december
31, 2014 financial disclosures. adoption of the new mortality assumptions for 2015 resulted in an increase at december 31, 2014 of $106.9 million in the qualified pension benefit obligation and $16 million in the accumulated postretirement obligation. the new mortality assumptions increased anticipated 2015 qualified pension cost by approximately $15.4 million and other postretirement cost by approximately $2.2 million. pension funding guidelines, as established by the employee retirement income security act of 1974, as amended and the internal revenue code of 1986, as amended, are not expected to incorporate the october 2014 society of actuaries new mortality assumptions until after 2015, possibly 2016.

management's financial discussion and analysis entergy louisiana and entergy gulf states louisiana business combination in june 2014, entergy louisiana and entergy gulf states louisiana filed a business combination study report with the lpsc. the report contained a preliminary analysis of the potential combination of entergy louisiana and entergy gulf states louisiana into a single public utility, including an overview of the combination that identified its potential customer benefits. although not part of the business combination, entergy louisiana provided notice to the city council in june 2014 that it would seek authorization to transfer to entergy new orleans the assets that currently support the provision of service to entergy louisiana's customers in algiers. entergy louisiana subsequently filed the referenced application with the city council in october 2014. in the summer of 2014, entergy louisiana and entergy gulf states louisiana held technical conferences and face-to-face meetings with lpsc staff and other stakeholders to discuss potential effects of the combination, solicit suggestions and concerns, and identify areas in which additional information might be needed.
on september 30, 2014, entergy louisiana and entergy gulf states louisiana filed an application with the lpsc seeking authorization to undertake the transactions that would result in the combination of entergy louisiana and entergy gulf states louisiana into a single public utility.
the combination is subject to regulatory review and approval of the lpsc, the ferc, and the nrc. in june 2014, entergy submitted an application to the nrc for approval of river bend and waterford 3 license transfers as part of the steps to complete the business combination. the combination also could be subject to regulatory review of the city council if entergy louisiana continues to own the assets that currently support entergy louisiana's customers in algiers at the time the combination is effectuated. in november 2014, entergy louisiana filed an application with the city council seeking authorization to undertake the combination. the application provides that if the city council approves the algiers asset transfer before the business combination occurs, the city council may not need to issue a public interest finding regarding the combination. in december 2014, entergy louisiana and entergy gulf states louisiana filed applications with the ferc requesting authorization for the business combination and the algiers asset transfer. in january 2015, entergy services filed an application with the ferc for financing authority for the combined company. if approvals are obtained from the lpsc, the ferc, the nrc, and, if required, the city council, entergy louisiana and entergy gulf states louisiana expect the combination will be effected in the second half of 2015.
the procedural schedule in the lpsc business combination proceeding calls for lpsc staff and intervenor testimony to be filed in march 2015, with a hearing scheduled for june 2015. entergy louisiana and entergy gulf states louisiana have requested that the lpsc issue its decision regarding the business combination in august 2015. in the city council business combination proceeding, the city council announced through a resolution that it would not initiate an active review of the business combination filing, but instead would establish a business combination docket for the limited purpose of receiving information filings relative to the business combination proceedings at the lpsc.
it is currently contemplated that entergy louisiana and entergy gulf states louisiana will undertake multiple steps to effectuate the combination, which steps would include the following:
each of entergy louisiana and entergy gulf states louisiana will redeem or repurchase all of their
•  respective outstanding preferred membership interests (which interests have a $100 million liquidation value in the case of entergy louisiana and $10 million liquidation value in the case of entergy gulf states louisiana).

•  louisiana and new entergy gulf states louisiana to an affiliate the common membership interests of which will be owned by entergy louisiana, entergy gulf states louisiana and entergy corporation.
upon the completion of the steps, new entergy louisiana will hold substantially all of the assets, and will have assumed all of the liabilities, of entergy louisiana and entergy gulf states louisiana. entergy louisiana and entergy gulf states louisiana may modify or supplement the steps to be taken to effect the combination.
results of operations net income
net income increased slightly, by $0.8 million, primarily due to higher net revenue and lower other operation and maintenance expenses, substantially offset by a higher effective income tax rate, lower other income, higher depreciation and amortization expenses, higher interest expense, and higher taxes other than income taxes.
net income increased $2.7 million primarily due to higher net revenue and higher other income, substantially offset by higher other operation and maintenance expenses, higher depreciation and amortization expenses, higher taxes other than income taxes, and a higher effective income tax rate partially due to the settlement of the tax treatment related to hurricane katrina and hurricane rita louisiana act 55 financing in june 2012. see note 3 to the financial statements for additional discussion of the tax treatment.
table of contents entergy gulf states louisiana, l.l.c.
management's financial discussion and analysis net revenue
net revenue consists of operating revenues net of: 1) fuel, fuel-related expenses, and gas purchased for resale, 2)
purchased power expenses, and 3) other regulatory charges (credits). following is an analysis of the change in net revenue comparing 2014 to 2013.
the volume/weather variance is primarily due to an increase of 1,160 gwh, or 6%, in billed electricity usage, including the effect of more favorable weather on residential sales and higher industrial usage primarily in the chemicals industry.
the asset retirement obligation affects net revenue because entergy gulf states louisiana records a regulatory debit or credit for the difference between asset retirement obligation-related expenses and trust earnings plus asset retirement obligation-related costs collected in revenue. the variance is primarily caused by an increase in regulatory credits because of a decrease in decommissioning trust earnings and an increase in regulatory credits to realign the asset retirement obligation regulatory asset with regulatory treatment.
the miso deferral variance is due to the deferral in 2014 of the non-fuel miso-related charges, as approved by the lpsc. the deferral of non-fuel miso-related charges is partially offset in other operation and maintenance expenses. see note 2 to the financial statements for further discussion of the recovery of non-fuel miso-related charges.
the transmission equalization variance is primarily due to changes in transmission investment equalization billings under the entergy system agreement compared to the same period in 2013 primarily as a result of entergy arkansas's exit from the system agreement in december 2013.
the retail electric price variance is primarily due to an increase in purchased power capacity costs that are recovered through base rates set in the annual formula rate plan mechanism. see note 2 to the financial statements for further discussion of entergy gulf states louisiana's formula rate plan.

net revenue consists of operating revenues net of: 1) fuel, fuel-related expenses, and gas purchased for resale, 2)
purchased power expenses, and 3) other regulatory charges. following is an analysis of the change in net revenue comparing 2013 to 2012.
the louisiana act 55 financing savings obligation variance results from a regulatory charge recorded in the second quarter 2012 because entergy gulf states louisiana was required to share with customers the savings from the tax treatment related to the hurricane katrina and hurricane rita louisiana act 55 financing. see note 3 to the financial statements for additional discussion of the tax treatment.
the volume/weather variance is primarily due to an increase of 82 gwh, or 0.4%, in billed electricity usage as a result of the effect of more favorable weather, as compared to the prior period, primarily on residential sales.
other operation and maintenance expenses decreased primarily due to:
a decrease of $20.7 million in compensation and benefits costs primarily due to an increase in the discount rates used to determine net periodic pension and other postretirement benefit costs, other postretirement
•  benefit plan design changes, fewer employees, and a settlement charge recognized in september 2013 related to the payment of lump sum benefits out of the non-qualified pension plan.  see "critical accounting estimates"below and note 11 to the financial statements for further discussion of benefits costs;
•  a decrease of $7.2 million due to costs incurred in 2013 related to the now-terminated plan to spin off and merge the utility's transmission business; and
•  a decrease of $2.3 million in loss reserves.
the decrease was partially offset by:
•  an increase of $6.9 million due to administration fees in 2014 related to participation in the miso rto.
the lpsc approved deferral of these expenses resulting in no net income effect;
•  an increase of $3.6 million in outside regulatory, consulting, and legal fees;
•  an increase of $1.7 million in customer service costs primarily due to write-offs in 2014 of uncollectible customer accounts; and
table of contents entergy gulf states louisiana, l.l.c.
management's financial discussion and analysis taxes other than income taxes increased primarily due to an increase in local franchise taxes resulting from higher residential and commercial revenues as compared to prior year and an increase in ad valorem taxes resulting from higher assessments.
depreciation and amortization expenses increased primarily due to additions to plant in service.
other income decreased primarily due to higher realized gains in 2013 on the river bend decommissioning trust fund investments. there is no effect on net income as these investment gains are offset by a corresponding amount of regulatory charges.
interest expense increased primarily due to $3.6 million of carrying charges recorded in 2014 on storm restoration costs related to hurricane isaac, as approved by the lpsc, and the issuance of $110 million of 3.78% series first mortgage bonds in july 2014.
other operation and maintenance expenses increased primarily due to:
an increase of $15 million in compensation and benefits costs primarily due to a decrease in the discount rates used to determine net periodic pension and other postretirement benefit costs and a settlement charge,
•  recognized in september 2013, related to the payment of lump sum benefits out of the non-qualified pension plan.  see "critical accounting estimates" belowand note 11 to the financial statements for further discussion of benefits costs;
•  the deferral recorded in the second quarter 2012, as approved by the lpsc and the ferc, of costs related to the transition and implementation of joining the miso rto, which reduced expenses by $4.2 million in 2012;
an increase of $13.5 million resulting from implementation costs, severance costs, and curtailment and special termination benefits in 2013 related to the human capital management strategic imperative, partially
•  offset by the deferral, as approved by the lpsc, of $9.8 million of these costs.   see the "human capital management strategic imperative" section of entergy corporation and subsidiaries management's financial discussion and analysis for further discussion;
•  an increase of $3.5 million in fossil-fueled generation expenses due to an overall higher scope of work done during plant outages as compared to the prior year;
•  an increase of $2.9 million in loss reserves; and
also, other operation and maintenance expenses include $7.2 million in 2013 and $4.7 million in 2012 of costs incurred related to the now terminated plan to spin off and merge the transmission business.
taxes other than income taxes increased primarily due to an increase in local franchise taxes resulting from higher residential and commercial revenues as compared to prior year and an increase in ad valorem taxes resulting from higher assessments. franchise taxes have no effect on net income as these taxes are recovered through the franchise tax rider.
depreciation and amortization expenses increased primarily due to increased plant in service.
other income increased primarily due to higher realized gains in 2013 on the river bend decommissioning trust fund investments. there is no effect on net income as these investment gains are offset by a corresponding amount of regulatory charges.

nuclear matters entergy gulf states louisiana owns and, through an affiliate, operates the river bend nuclear power plant. entergy gulf states louisiana is, therefore, subject to the risks related to owning and operating a nuclear plant. these include risks from the use, storage, handling and disposal of high-level and low-level radioactive materials, regulatory requirement changes, including changes resulting from events at other plants, limitations on the amounts and types of insurance commercially available for losses in connection with nuclear operations, and technological and financial uncertainties related to decommissioning nuclear plants at the end of their licensed lives, including the sufficiency of funds in decommissioning trusts. in the event of an unanticipated early shutdown of river bend, entergy gulf states louisiana may be required to provide additional funds or credit support to satisfy regulatory requirements for decommissioning.
the nuclear industry continues to address susceptibility to stress corrosion cracking of certain materials within the reactor coolant system. the issue is applicable to river bend and is managed in accordance with industry standard practices and guidelines that include in-service examinations, replacements, and mitigation strategies.
developments in the industry or identification of issues at the nuclear units could require unanticipated remediation efforts that cannot be quantified in advance.
after the nuclear incident in japan resulting from the march 2011 earthquake and tsunami, the nrc established a task force to conduct a review of processes and regulations relating to nuclear facilities in the united states.
the task force issued a near-term (90-day) report in july 2011 that made initial recommendations, which were subsequently refined and prioritized after input from stakeholders. the task force then issued a second report in september 2011. based upon the task force's recommendations, the nrc issued three orders effective on march 12,
2012. the three orders require u.s. nuclear operators to undertake plant modifications and perform additional analyses that will, among other things, result in increased operating and capital costs associated with operating nuclear plants. the nrc, with input from the industry, is continuing to determine the specific actions required by the orders. entergy gulf states louisiana's estimated capital expenditures for 2015 through 2017 for complying with the nrc orders are included in the planned construction and other capital investments estimates given in "

management's financial discussion and analysis environmental risks entergy gulf states louisiana's facilities and operations are subject to regulation by various governmental authorities having jurisdiction over air quality, water quality, control of toxic substances and hazardous and solid wastes, and other environmental matters. management believes that entergy gulf states louisiana is in substantial compliance with environmental regulations currently applicable to its facilities and operations.
because environmental regulations are subject to change, future compliance costs cannot be precisely estimated.
critical accounting estimates the preparation of entergy gulf states louisiana's financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to apply appropriate accounting policies and to make estimates and judgments that can have a significant effect on reported financial position, results of operations, and cash flows.
management has identified the following accounting policies and estimates as critical because they are based on assumptions and measurements that involve a high degree of uncertainty, and the potential for future changes in the assumptions and measurements that could produce estimates that would have a material effect on the presentation of entergy's financial position or results of operations.
" section of entergy corporation and subsidiaries management's financial discussion and analysis for discussion of the estimates inherent in accounting for nuclear decommissioning costs.
in the fourth quarter 2014, entergy gulf states louisiana recorded a revision to its estimated decommissioning cost liability for river bend as a result of a revised decommissioning cost study. the revised estimate resulted in a
$20 million increase in the decommissioning cost liability, along with a corresponding increase in the related asset retirement cost asset that will be depreciated over the remaining useful life of the unit.
unbilled revenue as discussed in note 1 to the financial statements, entergy gulf states louisiana records an estimate of the revenues earned for energy delivered since the latest customer billing. each month the estimated unbilled revenue amounts are recorded as revenue and a receivable, and the prior month's estimate is reversed. the difference between the estimate of the unbilled receivable at the beginning of the period and the end of the period is the amount of unbilled revenue recognized during the period. the estimate recorded is primarily based upon an estimate of customer usage during the unbilled period and the billed price to customers in that month. therefore, revenue recognized may be affected by the estimated price and usage at the beginning and end of each period, in addition to changes in certain components of the calculation.
qualified pension and other postretirement benefits entergy gulf states louisiana's qualified pension and other postretirement reported costs, as described in note 11
to the financial statements, are impacted by numerous factors including the provisions of the plans, changing employee demographics, and various actuarial calculations, assumptions, and accounting mechanisms. see the "
qualified pension and other postretirement benefits
" section of entergy corporation and subsidiaries management's financial discussion and analysis for further discussion. because of the complexity of these calculations, the long-term nature of these obligations, and the importance of the assumptions utilized, entergy's estimate of these costs is a critical accounting estimate.

each fluctuation above assumes that the other components of the calculation are held constant.
total postretirement health care and life insurance benefit costs for entergy gulf states louisiana in 2014 were
$12.2 million. entergy gulf states louisiana expects 2015 postretirement health care and life insurance benefit costs of approximately $13.1 million. entergy gulf states louisiana contributed $8.3 million to its other postretirement plans in 2014 and expects to contribute approximately $8.9 million in 2015.
the retirement and mortality rate assumptions are reviewed every three-to-five years as part of an actuarial study that compares these assumptions to the actual experience of the pension and other postretirement plans. the 2014
actuarial study reviewed plan experience from 2010 through 2013. as a result of the 2014 actuarial study and the issuance of new mortality tables in october 2014 by the society of actuaries, changes were made to reflect modified demographic pattern expectations as well as longer life expectancies. these changes are reflected in the december
31, 2014 financial disclosures. adoption of the new mortality assumptions for 2015 resulted in an increase at december 31, 2014 of $51.3 million in the qualified pension benefit obligation and $11.8 million in the accumulated postretirement obligation. the new mortality assumptions increased anticipated 2015 qualified pension cost by approximately $7.6 million and other postretirement cost by approximately $1.6 million. pension funding guidelines, as established by the employee retirement income security act of 1974, as amended and the internal revenue code of
1986, as amended, are not expected to incorporate the october 2014 society of actuaries new mortality assumptions until after 2015, possibly 2016.

table of contents entergy louisiana, llc and subsidiaries management's financial discussion and analysis entergy louisiana and entergy gulf states louisiana business combination in june 2014, entergy louisiana and entergy gulf states louisiana filed a business combination study report with the lpsc. the report contained a preliminary analysis of the potential combination of entergy louisiana and entergy gulf states louisiana into a single public utility, including an overview of the combination that identified its potential customer benefits. although not part of the business combination, entergy louisiana provided notice to the city council in june 2014 that it would seek authorization to transfer to entergy new orleans the assets that currently support the provision of service to entergy louisiana's customers in algiers. entergy louisiana subsequently filed the referenced application with the city council in october 2014. in the summer of 2014, entergy louisiana and entergy gulf states louisiana held technical conferences and face-to-face meetings with lpsc staff and other stakeholders to discuss potential effects of the combination, solicit suggestions and concerns, and identify areas in which additional information might be needed.
on september 30, 2014, entergy louisiana and entergy gulf states louisiana filed an application with the lpsc seeking authorization to undertake the transactions that would result in the combination of entergy louisiana and entergy gulf states louisiana into a single public utility.
the combination is subject to regulatory review and approval of the lpsc, the ferc, and the nrc. in june 2014, entergy submitted an application to the nrc for approval of river bend and waterford 3 license transfers as part of the steps to complete the business combination. the combination also could be subject to regulatory review of the city council if entergy louisiana continues to own the assets that currently support entergy louisiana's customers in algiers at the time the combination is effectuated. in november 2014, entergy louisiana filed an application with the city council seeking authorization to undertake the combination. the application provides that if the city council approves the algiers asset transfer before the business combination occurs, the city council may not need to issue a public interest finding regarding the combination. in december 2014, entergy louisiana and entergy gulf states louisiana filed applications with the ferc requesting authorization for the business combination and the algiers asset transfer. in january 2015, entergy services filed an application with the ferc for financing authority for the combined company. if approvals are obtained from the lpsc, the ferc, the nrc, and, if required, the city council, entergy louisiana and entergy gulf states louisiana expect the combination will be effected in the second half of 2015.
the procedural schedule in the lpsc business combination proceeding calls for lpsc staff and intervenor testimony to be filed in march 2015, with a hearing scheduled for june 2015. entergy louisiana and entergy gulf states louisiana have requested that the lpsc issue its decision regarding the business combination in august 2015. in the city council business combination proceeding, the city council announced through a resolution that it would not initiate an active review of the business combination filing, but instead would establish a business combination docket for the limited purpose of receiving information filings relative to the business combination proceedings at the lpsc.
it is currently contemplated that entergy louisiana and entergy gulf states louisiana will undertake multiple steps to effectuate the combination, which steps would include the following:
each of entergy louisiana and entergy gulf states louisiana will redeem or repurchase all of their
•  respective outstanding preferred membership interests (which interests have a $100 million liquidation value in the case of entergy louisiana and $10 million liquidation value in the case of entergy gulf states louisiana).
•  under the texas business organizations code (txboc), entergy louisiana will allocate substantially all of its assets to a new subsidiary (new entergy louisiana) and new entergy louisiana will assume all

•  louisiana and new entergy gulf states louisiana to an affiliate the common membership interests of which will be owned by entergy louisiana, entergy gulf states louisiana and entergy corporation.
upon the completion of the steps, new entergy louisiana will hold substantially all of the assets, and will have assumed all of the liabilities, of entergy louisiana and entergy gulf states louisiana. entergy louisiana and entergy gulf states louisiana may modify or supplement the steps to be taken to effect the combination.
results of operations net income
net income increased $31.1 million primarily due to higher net revenue and higher other income, partially offset by higher other operation and maintenance expenses, higher depreciation and amortization expenses, and higher interest expense.
net income decreased $28.6 million primarily due to higher other operation and maintenance expenses, higher depreciation and amortization expenses, higher interest expense, and higher nuclear refueling outage expenses, partially offset by higher net revenue. also contributing to the decrease in net income was the settlement of the tax treatment related to the hurricane katrina and hurricane rita louisiana act 55 financing in june 2012, which resulted in a $142.7 million reduction of income tax expense partially offset by a $137.1 million ($84.3 million net-of-tax) regulatory charge, which reduced net revenue in 2012. see note 3 to the financial statements for additional discussion of the tax treatment.
table of contents entergy louisiana, llc and subsidiaries management's financial discussion and analysis net revenue
net revenue consists of operating revenues net of: 1) fuel, fuel-related expenses, and gas purchased for resale, 2)
purchased power expenses, and 3) other regulatory charges (credits). following is an analysis of the change in net revenue comparing 2014 to 2013.
the miso deferral variance is due to the deferral in 2014 of non-fuel miso-related charges, as approved by the lpsc. the deferral of non-fuel miso-related charges is partially offset in other operation and maintenance expenses. see note 2 to the financial statements for further discussion of the recovery of non-fuel miso-related charges.
the retail electric price variance is primarily due to an increase in affiliated purchased power capacity costs that are recovered through base rates set in the annual formula rate plan mechanism and a formula rate plan increase effective december 2014. entergy louisiana's formula rate plan is discussed in note 2 to the financial statements.
the asset retirement obligation affects net revenue because entergy louisiana records a regulatory debit or credit for the difference between asset retirement obligation-related expenses and trust earnings plus asset retirement obligation-related costs collected in revenue. the variance is primarily caused by an increase in regulatory credits because of a decrease in decommissioning trust earnings, increases in depreciation and accretion expenses, and an increase in regulatory credits to realign the asset retirement obligation regulatory asset with regulatory treatment.
the volume/weather variance is primarily due to an increase of 682 gwh, or 2%, in billed electricity usage, including the effect of more favorable weather on residential and commercial sales as compared to the prior year and an increase in industrial usage primarily due to increased consumption by a large industrial customer in the chemicals industry as a result of a prior year plant outage and the addition of new mid-small industrial customers.

ninemile point unit 6 self-build project in june 2011, entergy louisiana filed with the lpsc an application seeking certification that the public necessity and convenience would be served by entergy louisiana's construction of a combined-cycle gas turbine generating facility (ninemile 6) at its existing ninemile point electric generating station. ninemile 6 is a nominally-sized
560 mw unit that is expected to cost approximately $655 million to construct when spending is complete, excluding interconnection and transmission upgrades. entergy gulf states louisiana joined in the application, seeking certification of its purchase under a life-of-unit power purchase agreement of up to 25% of the capacity and energy
table of contents entergy louisiana, llc and subsidiaries management's financial discussion and analysis generated by ninemile 6. the ninemile 6 capacity and energy is allocated 55% to entergy louisiana, 25% to entergy gulf states louisiana, and 20% to entergy new orleans. in february 2012 the city council passed a resolution authorizing entergy new orleans to purchase 20% of the ninemile 6 energy and capacity. in march 2012 the lpsc unanimously voted to grant the certifications requested by entergy gulf states louisiana and entergy louisiana.
following approval by the lpsc, entergy louisiana issued full notice to proceed to the project's engineering, procurement, and construction contractor.
under terms approved by the lpsc, non-fuel costs may be recovered through entergy louisiana's formula rate plan beginning in the month after the unit is placed in service. in july 2014, entergy louisiana and entergy gulf states louisiana filed an unopposed stipulation with the lpsc that estimates a first year revenue requirement associated with ninemile 6 and provides a mechanism to update the revenue requirement as the in-service date approaches, which was subsequently approved by the lpsc. in late december 2014, roughly contemporaneous with the unit's placement in service, a final updated estimated revenue requirement of $51.1 million for entergy louisiana was filed. the december 2014 estimate forms the basis of rates implemented effective with the first billing cycle of january 2015.
entergy louisiana will submit project and cost information to the lpsc in mid-2015 to enable the lpsc to review the prudence of entergy louisiana's management of the project.
new nuclear development entergy gulf states louisiana and entergy louisiana have been developing and are preserving a project option for new nuclear generation at river bend. in the first quarter 2010, entergy gulf states louisiana and entergy louisiana each paid for and recognized on its books $24.9 million in costs associated with the development of new nuclear generation at the river bend site; these costs previously had been recorded on the books of entergy new nuclear utility development, llc, a system energy subsidiary. entergy gulf states louisiana and entergy louisiana will share costs going forward on a 50/50 basis, which reflects each company's current participation level in the project.
in march 2010, entergy gulf states louisiana and entergy louisiana filed with the lpsc seeking approval to continue the limited development activities necessary to preserve an option to construct a new unit at river bend. at its june 2012 meeting the lpsc voted to uphold an alj recommendation that the request of entergy gulf states louisiana and entergy louisiana be declined on the basis that the lpsc's rule on new nuclear development does not apply to activities to preserve an option to develop and on the further grounds that the companies improperly engaged in advanced preparation activities prior to certification. the lpsc directed that entergy gulf states louisiana and entergy louisiana be permitted to seek recovery of these costs in their upcoming rate case filings that were subsequently filed in february 2013. in the resolution of the rate case proceeding, the lpsc provided for an eight-
year amortization of costs incurred in connection with the potential development of a new nuclear generation at river bend, without carrying costs, beginning in december 2014, provided, however, that amortization of these costs shall not result in a future rate increase. as of december 31, 2014, entergy gulf states louisiana and entergy louisiana each have a regulatory asset of $29.2 million on its balance sheet related to these new nuclear generation development costs.

hurricane isaac in august 2012, hurricane isaac caused extensive damage to entergy louisiana's service area. the storm resulted in widespread power outages, significant damage primarily to distribution infrastructure, and the loss of sales during the power outages. in january 2013, entergy louisiana drew $187 million from its funded storm reserve escrow account. in april 2013, entergy gulf states louisiana and entergy louisiana filed a joint application with the lpsc relating to hurricane isaac system restoration costs. in may 2013, entergy gulf states louisiana, entergy louisiana, and the louisiana utilities restoration corporation (lurc), an instrumentality of the state of louisiana, filed with the lpsc an application requesting that the lpsc grant financing orders authorizing the financing of entergy gulf states louisiana's and entergy louisiana's storm costs, storm reserves, and issuance costs pursuant to act 55 of the louisiana regular session of 2007 (louisiana act 55). the lpsc staff filed direct testimony in september 2013 concluding that hurricane isaac system restoration costs incurred by entergy gulf states louisiana and entergy louisiana were reasonable and prudent, subject to proposed minor adjustments which totaled approximately 1% of each company's costs. following an evidentiary hearing and recommendations by the alj, the lpsc voted in june 2014 to approve a series of orders which (i) quantify the amount of hurricane isaac system restoration costs prudently incurred ($66.5 million for entergy gulf states louisiana and $224.3 million for entergy louisiana); (ii) determine the level of storm reserves to be re-established ($90 million for entergy gulf states louisiana and $200 million for entergy louisiana); (iii) authorize entergy gulf states louisiana and entergy louisiana to utilize louisiana act 55 financing for hurricane isaac system restoration costs; and (iv) grant other requested relief associated with storm reserves and act 55 financing of hurricane isaac system restoration costs.
entergy louisiana committed to pass on to customers a minimum of $23.9 million of customer benefits through annual customer credits of approximately $4.8 million for five years. approvals for the act 55 financings were obtained from the louisiana utilities restoration corporation (lurc) and the louisiana state bond commission.
in july 2014, entergy louisiana issued $190 million of 3.78% series first mortgage bonds due april 2025 and used the proceeds to re-establish and replenish its storm damage escrow reserves and for general corporate purposes.
in august 2014 the louisiana local government environmental facilities and community development authority (lcda)
issued $243.85 million in bonds under act 55 of the louisiana legislature. from the $240 million of bond proceeds loaned by the lcda to the lurc, the lurc deposited $13 million in a restricted escrow account as a storm damage reserve for entergy louisiana and transferred $227 million directly to entergy louisiana. entergy louisiana used the $227 million received from the lurc to acquire 2,272,725.89 class c preferred, non-voting, membership interest units of entergy holdings company llc, a company wholly-owned and consolidated by entergy, that carry a 7.5% annual distribution rate. distributions are payable quarterly commencing on september 15, 2014, and the membership interests have a liquidation price of $100 per unit. the preferred membership interests are callable at the option of entergy holdings company llc after ten years under the terms of the llc agreement. the terms of the membership interests include certain financial covenants to which entergy holdings company llc is subject, including the requirement to maintain a net worth of at least $1.75 billion.
entergy louisiana does not report the bonds on its balance sheet because the bonds are the obligation of the lcda and there is no recourse against entergy louisiana in the event of a bond default. to service the bonds, entergy louisiana collects a system restoration charge on behalf of the lurc, and remits the collections to the bond indenture trustee. entergy louisiana does not report the collections as revenue because it is merely acting as the billing and collection agent for the state.
little gypsy repowering project in april 2007, entergy louisiana announced that it intended to pursue the solid fuel repowering of a 538 mw unit at its little gypsy plant. in march 2009 the lpsc voted in favor of a motion directing entergy louisiana to
table of contents entergy louisiana, llc and subsidiaries management's financial discussion and analysis temporarily suspend the repowering project and, based upon an analysis of the project's economic viability, to make a recommendation regarding whether to proceed with the project. this action was based upon a number of factors including the recent decline in natural gas prices, as well as environmental concerns, the unknown costs of carbon legislation and changes in the capital/financial markets. in april 2009, entergy louisiana complied with the lpsc's directive and recommended that the project be suspended for an extended period of time of three years or more. in may 2009 the lpsc issued an order declaring that entergy louisiana's decision to place the little gypsy project into a longer-term suspension of three years or more is in the public interest and prudent.
in october 2009, entergy louisiana made a filing with the lpsc seeking permission to cancel the little gypsy repowering project and seeking project cost recovery over a five-year period. in june 2010 and august 2010, the lpsc staff and intervenors filed testimony. the lpsc staff (1) agreed that it was prudent to move the project from long-term suspension to cancellation and that the timing of the decision to suspend on a longer-term basis was not imprudent; (2) indicated that, except for $0.8 million in compensation-related costs, the costs incurred should be deemed prudent; (3) recommended recovery from customers over ten years but stated that the lpsc may want to consider 15 years; (4) allowed for recovery of carrying costs and earning a return on project costs, but at a reduced rate approximating the cost of debt, while also acknowledging that the lpsc may consider ordering no return; and (5) indicated that entergy louisiana should be directed to securitize project costs, if legally feasible and in the public interest. in the third quarter 2010, in accordance with accounting standards, entergy louisiana determined that it was probable that the little gypsy repowering project would be abandoned and accordingly reclassified $199.8 million of project costs from construction work in progress to a regulatory asset.
a hearing on the issues, except for cost allocation among customer classes, was held before the alj in november
2010. in january 2011 all parties participated in a mediation on the disputed issues, resulting in a settlement of all disputed issues, including cost recovery and cost allocation. the settlement provides for entergy louisiana to recover $200 million as of march 31, 2011, and carrying costs on that amount on specified terms thereafter. the settlement also provides for entergy louisiana to recover the approved project costs by securitization. in april
2011, entergy louisiana filed an application with the lpsc to authorize the securitization of the investment recovery costs associated with the project and to issue a financing order by which entergy louisiana could accomplish such securitization. in august 2011 the lpsc issued an order approving the settlement and also issued a financing order for the securitization. see note 5 to the financial statements for a discussion of the september

retail rates filings with the lpsc in may 2005 the lpsc approved a rate filing settlement that included the adoption of a three-year formula rate plan, the terms of which included an roe mid-point of 10.25% for the initial three-year term of the plan and permit entergy louisiana to recover incremental capacity costs outside of a traditional base rate proceeding. under the formula rate plan, over- and under-earnings outside an allowed regulatory range of 9.45% to 11.05% will be allocated 60% to customers and 40% to entergy louisiana. the initial formula rate plan filing was made in may 2006.
in november 2011 the lpsc approved a one-year extension of entergy louisiana's formula rate plan. in may 2012, entergy louisiana made its formula rate plan filing with the lpsc for the 2011 test year. the filing reflected a
9.63% earned return on common equity, which is within the earnings bandwidth and resulted in no cost of service rate
table of contents entergy louisiana, llc and subsidiaries management's financial discussion and analysis change under the formula rate plan. the filing also reflected an $18.1 million rate increase for the incremental capacity rider. in august 2012, entergy louisiana submitted a revised filing that reflected an earned return on common equity of 10.38%, which is still within the earnings bandwidth, resulting in no cost of service rate change.
the revised filing also indicated that an increase of $15.9 million should be reflected in the incremental capacity rider. the rate change was implemented, subject to refund, effective for bills rendered the first billing cycle of september 2012. subsequently, in december 2012, entergy louisiana submitted a revised evaluation report that reflected two items: 1) a $17 million reduction for the first-year capacity charges for the purchase by entergy gulf states louisiana from entergy louisiana of one-third of acadia unit 2 capacity and energy, and 2) an $88
million increase for the first-year retail revenue requirement associated with the waterford 3 replacement steam generator project, which was in-service in december 2012. these rate changes were implemented, subject to refund, effective with the first billing cycle of january 2013. in april 2013, entergy louisiana and the lpsc staff filed a joint report resolving the 2011 test year formula rate plan and recovery related to the grand gulf uprate. this report was approved by the lpsc in april 2013.
with completion of the waterford 3 replacement steam generator project, the lpsc is conducting a prudence review in connection with a filing made by entergy louisiana in april 2013 with regard to the following aspects of the replacement project: 1) project management; 2) cost controls; 3) success in achieving stated objectives; 4) the costs of the replacement project; and 5) the outage length and replacement power costs. in july 2014 the lpsc staff filed testimony recommending potential project and replacement power cost disallowances of up to $71 million , citing a need for further explanation or documentation from entergy louisiana. an intervenor filed testimony recommending disallowance of $141 million of incremental project costs, claiming the steam generator fabricator was imprudent. entergy louisiana provided further documentation and explanation requested by the lpsc staff. an evidentiary hearing was held in december 2014. at the hearing the parties maintained the positions reflected in pre-filed testimony. a post-hearing briefing schedule has not been established. entergy louisiana believes that the replacement steam generator costs were prudently incurred and applicable legal principles support their recovery in rates. nevertheless, entergy louisiana recorded a write-off of $16 million of waterford 3's plant balance in december 2014 because of the uncertainty associated with the resolution of the prudence review.
in connection with its decision to extend the formula rate plan to the 2011 test year, the lpsc required that a base rate case be filed by entergy louisiana, and the required filing was made on february 15, 2013. the filing anticipated entergy louisiana's integration into miso. in the filing entergy louisiana requested, among other relief:
authorization to increase the revenue it collects from customers by approximately$145 million(which does not
•  take into account a revenue offset of approximately$2 millionresulting from a proposed increase for those customers taking service under the qualifying facility standby service);

•  authorization to increase depreciation rates embedded in the proposed revenue requirement; and authorization to implement athree-year formula rate plan with a midpoint return on common equity of10.4%, plus or minus75basis points (the deadband), that would provide a means for the annual re-setting of rates
•  incremental transmission revenue requirements on the basis of a forward-looking test year as compared to the initial base year of 2014 with an annual true-up, that would retain the primary aspects of the prior formula rate plan, including a60%to customers/40%to entergy louisiana sharing mechanism for earnings outside the deadband, and a capacity rider mechanism that would permit recovery of incremental capacity additions approved by the lpsc.
following a hearing before an alj and the alj's issuance of a report of proceedings, in december 2013 the lpsc approved an unopposed settlement of the proceeding. the settlement provides for a $10 million rate increase effective with the first billing cycle of december 2014. major terms of the settlement include approval of a three
-year formula rate plan (effective for test years 2014-2016) modeled after the formula rate plan in effect for entergy louisiana for 2011, including the following: (1) a midpoint return on equity of 9.95% plus or minus 80
basis points, with 60 / 40 sharing of earnings outside of the bandwidth; (2) recovery outside of the sharing mechanism for the non-fuel miso-related costs, additional capacity revenue requirement, extraordinary items, such as the ninemile 6 project, and certain

(6) a cumulative $30 million cap on cost of service increases over the three -year formula rate plan cycle, except for those items outside of the sharing mechanism. existing depreciation rates will not change.

the nuclear industry continues to address susceptibility to stress corrosion cracking of certain materials within the reactor coolant system. the issue is applicable to waterford 3 and is managed in accordance with industry standard practices and guidelines that include in-service examinations, replacements, and mitigation strategies.
developments in the industry or identification of issues at the nuclear units could require unanticipated remediation efforts that cannot be quantified in advance.
after the nuclear incident in japan resulting from the march 2011 earthquake and tsunami, the nrc established a task force to conduct a review of processes and regulations relating to nuclear facilities in the united states.
the task force issued a near-term (90-day) report in july 2011 that made initial recommendations, which were subsequently refined and prioritized after input from stakeholders. the task force then issued a second report in september 2011. based upon the task force's recommendations, the nrc issued three orders effective on march 12,
2012. the three orders require u.s. nuclear operators to undertake plant modifications and perform additional analyses that will, among other things, result in increased operating and capital costs associated with operating nuclear plants. the nrc, with input from the industry, is continuing to determine the specific actions required by the orders. entergy louisiana's estimated capital expenditures for 2015 through 2017 for complying with the nrc orders are included in the planned construction and other capital investments estimates given in "

environmental risks entergy louisiana's facilities and operations are subject to regulation by various governmental authorities having jurisdiction over air quality, water quality, control of toxic substances and hazardous and solid wastes, and other environmental matters. management believes that entergy louisiana is in substantial compliance with environmental regulations currently applicable to its facilities and operations. because environmental regulations are subject to change, future compliance costs cannot be precisely estimated.
critical accounting estimates the preparation of entergy louisiana's financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to apply appropriate accounting policies and to make estimates and judgments that can have a significant effect on reported financial position, results of operations, and cash flows. management has identified the following accounting policies and estimates as critical because they are based on assumptions and measurements that involve a high degree of uncertainty, and the potential for future changes in the assumptions and measurements that could produce estimates that would have a material effect on the presentation of entergy louisiana's financial position or results of operations.

table of contents entergy louisiana, llc and subsidiaries management's financial discussion and analysis in the fourth quarter 2013, entergy louisiana recorded a revision to its estimated decommissioning cost liability for waterford 3 as a result of a revised decommissioning cost study. the revised estimate resulted in a $39.4
million increase in its decommissioning cost liability, along with a corresponding increase in the related asset retirement costs asset that will be depreciated over the remaining life of the unit.
unbilled revenue as discussed in note 1 to the financial statements, entergy louisiana records an estimate of the revenues earned for energy delivered since the latest customer billing. each month the estimated unbilled revenue amounts are recorded as revenue and a receivable, and the prior month's estimate is reversed. the difference between the estimate of the unbilled receivable at the beginning of the period and the end of the period is the amount of unbilled revenue recognized during the period. the estimate recorded is primarily based upon an estimate of customer usage during the unbilled period and the billed price to customers in that month. therefore, revenue recognized may be affected by the estimated price and usage at the beginning and end of each period, in addition to changes in certain components of the calculation.
qualified pension and other postretirement benefits entergy louisiana's qualified pension and other postretirement reported costs, as described in note 11 to the financial statements, are impacted by numerous factors including the provisions of the plans, changing employee demographics, and various actuarial calculations, assumptions, and accounting mechanisms. see the " qualified pension and other postretirement benefits
" section of entergy corporation and subsidiaries management's financial discussion and analysis for further discussion. because of the complexity of these calculations, the long-term nature of these obligations, and the importance of the assumptions utilized, entergy's estimate of these costs is a critical accounting estimate.

the retirement and mortality rate assumptions are reviewed every three-to-five years as part of an actuarial study that compares these assumptions to the actual experience of the pension and other postretirement plans. the 2014
actuarial study reviewed plan experience from 2010 through 2013. as a result of the 2014 actuarial study and the issuance of new mortality tables in october 2014 by the society of actuaries, changes were made to reflect modified demographic pattern expectations as well as longer life expectancies. these changes are reflected in the december

table of contents entergy mississippi, inc.
management's financial discussion and analysis results of operations net income
net income decreased $7.3 million primarily due to the write-off in 2014 of the regulatory asset associated with new nuclear generation development costs as a result of a joint stipulation entered into with the mississippi public utilities staff, subsequently approved by the mpsc, in which entergy mississippi agreed not to pursue recovery of the costs deferred by an mpsc order in the new nuclear generation docket. see note 2 to the financial statements for discussion of the new nuclear generation development costs and the joint stipulation. also contributing to the decrease were higher depreciation and amortization expenses and higher taxes other than income taxes. these decreases were significantly offset by higher net revenue and lower other operation and maintenance expenses.
net income increased $35.4 million primarily due to higher net revenue and a lower effective income tax rate, partially offset by higher other operation and maintenance expenses.
net revenue consists of operating revenues net of: 1) fuel, fuel-related expenses, and gas purchased for resale, 2)
purchased power expenses, and 3) other regulatory charges (credits). following is an analysis of the change in net revenue comparing 2014 to 2013.
2013. the increase in the storm damage rider is offset by other operation and maintenance expenses and has no effect on net income. see note 2 to the financial statements for a discussion of the formula rate plan and storm damage rider.
the reserve equalization variance is primarily due to an increase in reserve equalization revenue primarily due to the changes in the entergy system generation mix as a result of entergy arkansas's exit from the system agreement in december 2013.
table of contents entergy mississippi, inc.
management's financial discussion and analysis the transmission equalization variance is primarily due to changes in transmission investment equalization billings under the entergy system agreement compared to the same period in 2013 primarily as a result of entergy arkansas's exit from the system agreement in december 2013.
the volume/weather variance is primarily due to an increase of 86 gwh, or 1%, in billed electricity usage, including the effect of more favorable weather on residential sales as compared to the prior year and an increase in industrial. the increase in industrial usage is primarily in the primary metals and pipelines industries.
net revenue consists of operating revenues net of: 1) fuel, fuel-related expenses, and gas purchased for resale, 2)
purchased power expenses, and 3) other regulatory credits. following is an analysis of the change in net revenue comparing 2013 to 2012.
the retail electric price variance is primarily due to the recovery of hinds plant costs through the power management rider, as approved by the mpsc, effective with the first billing cycle of 2013 and a formula rate plan increase effective september 2013. the net income effect of the hinds plant cost recovery is limited to a portion representing an allowed return on equity on the net plant investment with the remainder offset by the hinds plant costs in other operation and maintenance expenses, depreciation expenses, and taxes other than income taxes. the increase is partially offset by a temporary increase in 2012 in the storm cost recovery rider, as approved by the mpsc for a five-month period effective august 2012. this temporary increase in revenues in 2012 was offset by costs included in other operation and maintenance expenses and had no effect on net income. see note 2 to the financial statements for discussion of the formula rate plan increase.
the reserve equalization variance is primarily due to increased reserve equalization revenue resulting from the acquisition of the hinds plant in november 2012.
other operation and maintenance expenses decreased primarily due to:
a decrease of $11.6 million in compensation and benefits costs primarily due to an increase in the discount rates used to determine net periodic pension and other postretirement benefit costs, other postretirement

•  incurred in 2014 compared to the prior year were offset by expected insurance proceeds and the deferral of repair costs, as approved by the mpsc.  see "baxter wilson plant event" below for further discussion.
the decrease was partially offset by:
•  an increase of $10 million in storm damage accruals, as approved by the mpsc, effective october 2013;

in october 2014, entergy mississippi and the mississippi public utilities staff entered into and filed joint stipulations that addressed the majority of issues in the proceeding. the stipulations provided for:
revision of entergy mississippi's formula rate plan by providing entergy mississippi with the ability to reflect known and measurable changes to historical rate base and certain expense amounts; resolving

in december 2014 the mpsc issued an order accepting the stipulations in their entirety and approving the revenue adjustments and rate changes effective with february 2015 bills.
in august 2012 the mpsc opened inquiries to review whether the current formulaic methodology used to calculate the return on common equity in both entergy mississippi's formula rate plan and mississippi power company's annual formula rate plan is still appropriate or can be improved to better serve the public interest. the intent of this inquiry and review was for informational purposes only; the evaluation of any recommendations for changes to the existing methodology would take place in a general rate case or in the existing formula rate plan docket. in march

2013 the mississippi public utilities staff filed its consultant's report which noted the return on common equity estimation methods used by entergy mississippi and mississippi power company are commonly used throughout the electric utility industry. the report suggested ways in which the methods used by entergy mississippi and mississippi power company might be improved, but did not recommend specific changes in the return on common equity formulas or calculations at that time. in june 2014 the mpsc expanded the scope of the august 2012 inquiry to study the merits of adopting a uniform formula rate plan that could be applied, where possible in whole or in part, to both entergy mississippi and mississippi power company in order to achieve greater consistency in the plans. the mpsc directed the mississippi public utilities staff to investigate and review entergy mississippi's formula rate plan rider schedule and mississippi power company's performance evaluation plan by considering the merits and deficiencies and possibilities for improvement of each and then to propose a uniform formula rate plan that, where possible, could be applicable to both companies. no procedural schedule has been set. in october 2014 the mississippi public utilities staff conducted a public technical conference to discuss performance benchmarking and its potential application to the electric utilities' formula rate plans.
in entergy mississippi's 2014 general rate case, the mississippi public utilities staff conducted a review of entergy mississippi's proposed changes to its formula rate plan and recommended changes in that proceeding that may be duplicative of the review being conducted simultaneously in the above-described formula rate plan docket.
consequently, the mpsc found in the general rate case order that the changes to entergy mississippi's formula rate plan schedule approved in that order are just and reasonable and should remain unchanged by any mpsc action in the above-described formula rate plan docket, but that any provisions of entergy mississippi's formula rate plan schedule not specifically addressed in the general rate case order may be reviewed and changed.
fuel and purchased power cost recovery entergy mississippi's rate schedules include an energy cost recovery rider that, effective january 1, 2013, is adjusted annually to reflect accumulated over- or under-recoveries. entergy mississippi's fuel cost recoveries are subject to annual audits conducted pursuant to the authority of the mpsc.
entergy mississippi had a deferred fuel balance of $60.4 million as of march 31, 2014. in may 2014, entergy mississippi filed for an interim adjustment under its energy cost recovery rider. the interim adjustment proposed a net energy cost factor designed to collect over a six-month period the under-recovered deferred fuel balance as of march 31, 2014 and also reflected a natural gas price of $4.50 per mmbtu. in may 2014, entergy mississippi and the public utilities staff entered into a joint stipulation in which entergy mississippi agreed to a revised net energy cost factor that reflected the proposed interim adjustment with a reduction in costs recovered through the energy cost recovery rider associated with the suspension of the doe nuclear waste storage fee. in june 2014 the mpsc approved the joint stipulation and allowed entergy mississippi's interim adjustment. in november 2014, entergy mississippi filed its annual redetermination of the annual factor to be applied under the energy cost recovery rider. due to lower gas prices and a lower deferred fuel balance, the redetermined annual factor was a decrease from the revised interim net energy cost factor. in january 2015 the mpsc approved the redetermined annual factor effective january 30, 2015.
mississippi attorney general complaint the mississippi attorney general filed a complaint in state court in december 2008 against entergy corporation, entergy mississippi, entergy services, and entergy power alleging, among other things, violations of mississippi statutes, fraud, and breach of good faith and fair dealing, and requesting an accounting and restitution. the complaint is wide ranging and relates to tariffs and procedures under which entergy mississippi purchases power not generated in mississippi to meet electricity demand. entergy believes the complaint is unfounded. in december 2008
the defendant entergy companies removed the attorney general's lawsuit to u.s. district court in jackson, mississippi. the mississippi attorney general moved to remand the matter to state court. in august 2012 the district court issued an opinion denying the attorney general's motion for remand, finding that the district court has subject matter jurisdiction under the class action fairness act.

management's financial discussion and analysis the defendant entergy companies answered the complaint and filed a counterclaim for relief based upon the mississippi public utilities act and the federal power act. in may 2009 the defendant entergy companies filed a motion for judgment on the pleadings asserting grounds of federal preemption, the exclusive jurisdiction of the mpsc, and factual errors in the attorney general's complaint. in september 2012 the district court heard oral argument on entergy's motion for judgment on the pleadings. the district court's ruling on the motion for judgment on the pleadings is pending.
in january 2014 the u.s. supreme court issued a decision in which it held that cases brought by attorneys general as the sole plaintiff to enforce state laws were not subject to the federal law that allowed federal courts to hear those cases as "mass action" lawsuits. one day later the attorney general renewed its motion to remand the entergy case back to state court, citing the u.s. supreme court's decision. the defendant entergy companies have responded to that motion and the district court held oral argument on the motion to remand in february 2014. entergy also has asserted federal question jurisdiction as a basis for the district court having jurisdiction and also has pending the motion for judgment on the pleadings.
storm damage accrual and storm cost recovery in two orders issued in july 2012 the mpsc temporarily increased entergy mississippi's storm damage provision monthly accrual from $0.75 million to $2 million for bills rendered during the billing months of august 2012
through december 2012, and approved recovery of $14.9 million in prudently incurred storm costs to be amortized over five months, beginning with august 2012 bills.
in august 2012, hurricane isaac caused damage to entergy mississippi's service area. the storm resulted in widespread power outages, significant damage primarily to distribution infrastructure, and the loss of sales during the power outages. total restoration costs for the repair and/or replacement of entergy mississippi's electric facilities damaged by hurricane isaac were $22 million.
were prudently incurred and chargeable to the storm damage provision, while approximately $700,000 in prudently incurred costs were more properly recoverable through the formula rate plan. entergy mississippi and the mississippi public utilities staff also agreed that the storm damage accrual should be increased from $750,000 per month to $1.75 million per month. in september 2013 the mpsc approved the joint stipulation with the increase in the storm damage accrual effective with october 2013 bills. in february 2015, entergy mississippi provided notice to the mississippi public utilities staff that the storm damage accrual would be set to zero effective with the march 2015 billing cycle as a result of entergy mississippi's storm damage accrual balance exceeding $15 million as of january 31, 2015, but will return to its current level when the storm damage accrual balance becomes less than

management's financial discussion and analysis environmental risks entergy mississippi's facilities and operations are subject to regulation by various governmental authorities having jurisdiction over air quality, water quality, control of toxic substances and hazardous and solid wastes, and other environmental matters. management believes that entergy mississippi is in substantial compliance with environmental regulations currently applicable to its facilities and operations. because environmental regulations are subject to change, future compliance costs cannot be precisely estimated.
critical accounting estimates the preparation of entergy mississippi's financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to apply appropriate accounting policies and to make estimates and judgments that can have a significant effect on reported financial position, results of operations, and cash flows. management has identified the following accounting policies and estimates as critical because they are based on assumptions and measurements that involve a high degree of uncertainty, and there is the potential for future changes in the assumptions and measurements that could produce estimates that would have a material impact on the presentation of entergy mississippi's financial position or results of operations.
unbilled revenue as discussed in note 1 to the financial statements, entergy mississippi records an estimate of the revenues earned for energy delivered since the latest customer billing. each month the estimated unbilled revenue amounts are recorded as revenue and a receivable, and the prior month's estimate is reversed. the difference between the estimate of the unbilled receivable at the beginning of the period and the end of the period is the amount of unbilled revenue recognized during the period. the estimate recorded is primarily based upon an estimate of customer usage during the unbilled period and the billed price to customers in that month. therefore, revenue recognized may be affected by the estimated price and usage at the beginning and end of each period, in addition to changes in certain components of the calculation.
qualified pension and other postretirement benefits entergy mississippi's qualified pension and other postretirement reported costs, as described in note 11 to the financial statements, are impacted by numerous factors including the provisions of the plans, changing employee demographics, and various actuarial calculations, assumptions, and accounting mechanisms. see the " qualified pension and other postretirement benefits
" section of entergy corporation and subsidiaries management's financial discussion and analysis for further discussion. because of the complexity of these calculations, the long-term nature of these obligations, and the importance of the assumptions utilized, entergy's estimate of these costs is a critical accounting estimate.

total postretirement health care and life insurance benefit income for entergy mississippi in 2014 was $982
thousand. entergy mississippi expects 2015 postretirement health care and life insurance benefit income of approximately $758 thousand. entergy mississippi contributed $8.5 million to its other postretirement plans in 2014
the retirement and mortality rate assumptions are reviewed every three-to-five years as part of an actuarial study that compares these assumptions to the actual experience of the pension and other postretirement plans. the 2014
actuarial study reviewed plan experience from 2010 through 2013. as a result of the 2014 actuarial study and the issuance of new mortality tables in october 2014 by the society of actuaries, changes were made to reflect modified demographic pattern expectations as well as longer life expectancies. these changes are reflected in the december
31, 2014 financial disclosures. adoption of the new mortality assumptions for 2015 resulted in an increase at december 31, 2014 of $33.5 million in the qualified pension benefit obligation and $4.6 million in the accumulated postretirement obligation. the new mortality assumptions increased anticipated 2015 qualified pension cost by approximately $4.8 million and other postretirement cost by approximately $0.6 million. pension funding guidelines, as established by the employee retirement income security act of 1974, as amended and the internal revenue code of
1986, as amended, are not expected to incorporate the october 2014 society of actuaries new mortality assumptions until after 2015, possibly 2016.

s financial discussion and analysis algiers asset transfer in october 2014, entergy louisiana and entergy new orleans filed an application with the city council seeking authorization to undertake a transaction that would result in the transfer from entergy louisiana to entergy new orleans of certain assets that currently support the provision of service to entergy louisiana's customers in algiers. the transaction is expected to result in the transfer of net assets of approximately $60 million. the algiers asset transfer is also subject to regulatory review and approval of the ferc. entergy louisiana also filed an application with the city council seeking authorization to undertake the entergy louisiana and entergy gulf states louisiana business combination. the application provides that if the city council approves the algiers asset transfer before the business combination occurs, the city council may not need to issue a public interest finding regarding the business combination. if the necessary approvals are obtained from the city council and the ferc, entergy louisiana expects to transfer the algiers assets to entergy new orleans in the second half of 2015. in november 2014 the city council approved a resolution establishing a procedural schedule that provides for a hearing on the joint application in late-may 2015, with a decision to be rendered no later than june 2015.
results of operations net income
net income increased $17 million primarily due to higher net revenue and lower other operation and maintenance expenses, partially offset by a higher effective income tax rate.
net income decreased $5.4 million primarily due to higher other operation and maintenance expenses, higher taxes other than income taxes, and higher interest expense, partially offset by higher net revenue and a lower effective income tax rate.
net revenue consists of operating revenues net of: 1) fuel, fuel-related expenses, and gas purchased for resale, 2)
purchased power expenses, and 3) other regulatory charges. following is an analysis of the change in net revenue comparing 2014 to 2013.

management's financial discussion and analysis the volume/weather variance is primarily due to an increase of 125 gwh, or 2%, in billed electricity usage, primarily in the residential and commercial sectors, including the effect of favorable weather on residential sales in 2014 as compared to the prior year and a 2% increase in the average number of electric customers.
the net gas revenue variance is primarily due to the effect of favorable weather, primarily in the residential and commercial sectors, in 2014 as compared to the prior year.
the transmission revenue variance is primarily due to changes as a result of participation in the miso rto in 2014.
net revenue consists of operating revenues net of: 1) fuel, fuel-related expenses, and gas purchased for resale, 2)
purchased power expenses, and 3) other regulatory charges. following is an analysis of the change in net revenue comparing 2013 to 2012.
the volume/weather variance is primarily due to an increase of 125 gwh, or 3%, in billed electricity usage in the residential and commercial sectors primarily due to the effects of hurricane isaac, which decreased sales volume in
2012, and in part to a 2% increase in the average number of both residential and commercial customers.
the rider revenue variance is primarily due to an increase in franchise tax rider revenue as a result of higher retail revenues. there is a corresponding increase in taxes other than income taxes, resulting in no effect on net income.
the net gas revenue variance is primarily due to the effect of more favorable weather, primarily in the residential and commercial sectors, in 2013 as compared to prior year.
the retail electric price variance is primarily due to a formula rate plan decrease effective september 2013. see note 2 to the financial statements for a discussion of the formula rate plan filing.
other operation and maintenance expenses decreased primarily due to:
a decrease of $7.7 million in compensation and benefits costs primarily due to an increase in the discount rates used to determine net periodic pension and other postretirement benefit costs, other postretirement
•  benefit plan design changes, fewer employees, and a settlement charge recognized in september 2013 related to the payment of lump sum benefits out of the non-qualified pension plan.  see "critical accounting estimates" below and  note 11 to the financial statements for further discussion of benefits costs;

•  a decrease of $6.7 million in fossil-fueled generation expenses due to an overall lower scope of work done during plant outages as compared to prior year; and
•  a decrease of $2.4 million in outside regulatory consultant fees.
other operation and maintenance expenses increased primarily due to:
•  an increase of $9 million in fossil-fueled generation expenses due to an overall higher scope of work done during plant outages as compared to prior year;
an increase of $4.4 million resulting from implementation costs, severance costs, and curtailment and
•  special termination benefits in 2013 related to the human capital management strategic imperative.  see the

•  recognized in september 2013 related to the payment of lump sum benefits out of the non-qualified pension plan.  see "critical accounting estimates" below and note 11 to the financial statements for further discussion of benefits costs.
the increase was partially offset by a decrease of $3 million in loss reserves and a decrease of $1.5 million due to expenses recorded in 2012 related to the energy smart program.
taxes other than income taxes increased primarily due to an increase in local franchise taxes resulting from higher electric and gas retail revenues as compared to prior year and an increase in ad valorem taxes resulting from higher assessments. franchise taxes have no effect on net income as these taxes are recovered through the franchise tax rider.
interest expense increased primarily due to the issuance of $100 million of 3.90% series first mortgage bonds in june 2013 and the issuance of $30 million of 5.00% series first mortgage bonds in november 2012, partially offset by the retirement, at maturity, of $70 million of 5.25% series first mortgage bonds in august 2013.
income taxes the effective income tax rates for 2014, 2013, and 2012 were 30%, 12.2%, and 29.8%, respectively. see note 3 to the financial statements for a reconciliation of the federal statutory rate of 35% to the effective income tax rates.

million in 2013. the decrease in cash flow was offset by the timing of collections from customers. see
below and note 11 to the financial statements for a discussion of qualified pension and other postretirement benefits funding.
net cash provided by operating activities increased $34.2 million in 2013 primarily due to the increased recovery of fuel costs and decreased hurricane isaac storm spending in 2013, partially offset by a decrease of $11.5 million in income tax refunds. the income tax refunds of $13 million in 2012 resulted primarily from a decrease of previously estimated 2011 taxable income due to the recognition of additional bonus depreciation.
•  a decrease in fossil-fueled generation construction expenditures primarily due to spending on the michoud turbine blade replacement projects in 2013;
•  a decrease in transmission construction expenditures as a result of decreased scope of work in 2014; and
the decrease was partially offset by receipts from the storm reserve escrow account of $7.8 million in 2013.

management's financial discussion and analysis critical accounting estimates the preparation of entergy new orleans's financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to apply appropriate accounting policies and to make estimates and judgments that can have a significant effect on reported financial position, results of operations, and cash flows. management has identified the following accounting policies and estimates as critical because they are based on assumptions and measurements that involve a high degree of uncertainty, and there is the potential for future changes in the assumptions and measurements that could produce estimates that would have a material impact on the presentation of entergy new orleans's financial position or results of operations.
unbilled revenue as discussed in note 1 to the financial statements, entergy new orleans records an estimate of the revenues earned for energy delivered since the latest customer billing. each month the estimated unbilled revenue amounts are recorded as revenue and a receivable, and the prior month's estimate is reversed. the difference between the estimate of the unbilled receivable at the beginning of the period and the end of the period is the amount of unbilled revenue recognized during the period. the estimate recorded is primarily based upon an estimate of customer usage during the unbilled period and the billed price to customers in that month. therefore, revenue recognized may be affected by the estimated price and usage at the beginning and end of each, in addition to changes in certain components of the calculation.
qualified pension and other postretirement benefits entergy new orleans's qualified pension and other postretirement reported costs, as described in note 11 to the financial statements, are impacted by numerous factors including the provisions of the plans, changing employee demographics, and various actuarial calculations, assumptions, and accounting mechanisms. see the " qualified pension and other postretirement benefits

the retirement and mortality rate assumptions are reviewed every three-to-five years as part of an actuarial study that compares these assumptions to the actual experience of the pension and other postretirement plans. the 2014
actuarial study reviewed plan experience from 2010 through 2013. as a result of the 2014 actuarial study and the issuance of new mortality tables in october 2014 by the society of actuaries, changes were made to reflect modified demographic pattern expectations as well as longer life expectancies. these changes are reflected in the december
31, 2014 financial disclosures. adoption of the new mortality assumptions for 2015 resulted in an increase at december 31, 2014 of $15 million in the qualified pension benefit obligation and $3.6 million in the accumulated postretirement obligation. the new mortality assumptions increased anticipated 2015 qualified pension cost by approximately $2.2 million and other postretirement cost by approximately $0.4 million. pension funding guidelines, as established by the employee retirement income security act of 1974, as amended and the internal revenue code of
1986, as amended, are not expected to incorporate the october 2014 society of actuaries new mortality assumptions until after 2015, possibly 2016.

industrial and commercial customers entergy texas's large industrial and commercial customers continually explore ways to reduce their energy costs. in particular, cogeneration is an option available to a portion of entergy texas's industrial customer base. entergy texas responds by working with industrial and commercial customers and negotiating electric service contracts to provide, under existing rate schedules, competitive rates that match specific customer needs and load profiles.
entergy texas actively participates in economic development, customer retention, and reclamation activities to increase industrial and commercial demand, from both new and existing customers. entergy texas does not currently expect additional significant losses to cogeneration because of the current economics of the electricity markets and entergy texas's marketing efforts in retaining industrial customers.
environmental risks entergy texas's facilities and operations are subject to regulation by various governmental authorities having jurisdiction over air quality, water quality, control of toxic substances and hazardous and solid wastes, and other environmental matters. management believes that entergy texas is in substantial compliance with environmental regulations currently applicable to its facilities and operations. because environmental regulations are subject to change, future compliance costs cannot be precisely estimated.
critical accounting estimates the preparation of entergy texas's financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to apply appropriate accounting policies and to make estimates and judgments that

unbilled revenue as discussed in note 1 to the financial statements, entergy texas records an estimate of the revenues earned for energy delivered since the latest customer billing. each month the estimated unbilled revenue amounts are recorded as revenue and a receivable, and the prior month's estimate is reversed. the difference between the estimate of the unbilled receivable at the beginning of the period and the end of the period is the amount of unbilled revenue recognized during the period. the estimate recorded is primarily based upon an estimate of customer usage during the unbilled period and the billed price to customers in that month. therefore, revenue recognized may be affected by the estimated price and usage at the beginning and end of each period and fuel price fluctuations, in addition to changes in certain components of the calculation.
qualified pension and other postretirement benefits entergy texas's qualified pension and other postretirement reported costs, as described in note 11 to the financial statements, are impacted by numerous factors including the provisions of the plans, changing employee demographics, and various actuarial calculations, assumptions, and accounting mechanisms. see the " qualified pension and other postretirement benefits

the retirement and mortality rate assumptions are reviewed every three-to-five years as part of an actuarial study that compares these assumptions to the actual experience of the pension and other postretirement plans. the 2014
actuarial study reviewed plan experience from 2010 through 2013. as a result of the 2014 actuarial study and the issuance of new mortality tables in october 2014 by the society of actuaries, changes were made to reflect modified demographic pattern expectations as well as longer life expectancies. these changes are reflected in the december
31, 2014 financial disclosures. adoption of the new mortality assumptions for 2015 resulted in an increase at december 31, 2014 of $30.8 million in the qualified pension benefit obligation and $8.2 million in the accumulated postretirement obligation. the new mortality assumptions increased anticipated 2015 qualified pension cost by approximately $4.3 million and other postretirement cost by approximately $1 million. pension funding guidelines, as established by the employee retirement income security act of 1974, as amended and the internal revenue code of
1986, as amended, are not expected to incorporate the october 2014 society of actuaries new mortality assumptions until after 2015, possibly 2016.

management's financial discussion and analysis system energy's principal asset currently consists of an ownership interest and a leasehold interest in grand gulf.
the capacity and energy from its 90% interest is sold under the unit power sales agreement to its only four customers, entergy arkansas, entergy louisiana, entergy mississippi, and entergy new orleans. system energy's operating revenues are derived from the allocation of the capacity, energy, and related costs associated with its
90% interest in grand gulf pursuant to the unit power sales agreement. payments under the unit power sales agreement are system energy's only source of operating revenues.
results of operations net income
net income decreased $17.3 million primarily due to a higher effective income tax rate and lower operating revenues resulting from lower rate base as compared with the same period in the prior year, partially offset by higher other regulatory credits. system energy records a regulatory debit or credit for the difference between asset retirement obligation-related expenses and trust earnings plus asset retirement obligation-related costs collected in revenue.
net income increased $1.8 million primarily due to higher operating income and a lower effective income tax rate, partially offset by lower other income. operating income was higher because of higher rate base compared to 2012
resulting from capital spending at grand gulf, including the uprate project. the lower effective income tax rate was primarily due to the reversal of a portion of the provision for uncertain tax positions. other income was lower due to afudc accrued on the grand gulf uprate project in 2012. grand gulf's spring 2012 refueling outage was completed in june 2012, and the majority of uprate-related capital improvements were completed during this outage.
income taxes the effective income tax rates for 2014, 2013, and 2012 were 46.4%, 37.7%, and 40.8%, respectively. see note 3 to the financial statements for a reconciliation of the federal statutory rate of 35% to the effective income tax rates.

period operating activities net cash flow provided by operating activities increased $148.6 million in 2014 primarily due to income tax refunds of $10.1 million in 2014 compared to income tax payments of $211.2 million in 2013. the increase was partially offset by spending on the grand gulf refueling outage in 2014 and an increase of $12.9 million in pension contributions in 2014. system energy made income tax payments in 2013 in accordance with the entergy corporation and subsidiary companies intercompany income tax allocation agreement. the income tax payments in 2013 resulted primarily from the reversal of temporary differences for which system energy had previously claimed a tax deduction. see "
" below and note 11 to the financial statements for a discussion of qualified pension and other postretirement benefits funding.
net cash provided by operating activities decreased $132.4 million in 2013 primarily due to income tax payments of
$211.2 million in 2013, as discussed above, compared to income tax refunds of $56.8 million in 2012, partially offset by spending on the grand gulf refueling outage in 2012. system energy received income tax refunds in 2012 in accordance with the entergy corporation and subsidiary companies intercompany income tax allocation agreement. the income tax refunds of $56.8 million in 2012 resulted primarily from a decrease of previously estimated 2011 taxable income due to the recognition of additional bonus depreciation.

sources of capital system energy's sources to meet its capital requirements include:
•  internally generated funds;
•  bank financing under new or existing facilities.
system energy may refinance, redeem, or otherwise retire debt prior to maturity, to the extent market conditions and interest and dividend rates are favorable.
all debt and common stock issuances by system energy require prior regulatory approval. debt issuances are also subject to issuance tests set forth in its bond indentures and other agreements. system energy has sufficient capacity under these tests to meet its foreseeable capital needs.
system energy's receivables from the money pool were as follows as of december 31 for each of the following years.

nuclear matters system energy owns and operates grand gulf. system energy is, therefore, subject to the risks related to owning and operating a nuclear plant. these include risks from the use, storage, handling and disposal of high-level and low-
level radioactive materials, regulatory requirement changes, including changes resulting from events at other plants, limitations on the amounts and types of insurance commercially available for losses in connection with nuclear operations, and technological and financial uncertainties related to decommissioning nuclear plants at the end of their licensed lives, including the sufficiency of funds in decommissioning trusts. in the event of an unanticipated early shutdown of grand gulf, system energy may be required to provide additional funds or credit support to satisfy regulatory requirements for decommissioning. grand gulf's operating license is currently due to expire in november

management's financial discussion and analysis
2024. in october 2011, system energy filed an application with the nrc for an extension of grand gulf's operating license to 2044, which application is pending.
in june 2012 the u.s. court of appeals for the d.c. circuit vacated the nrc's 2010 update to its waste confidence decision, which had found generically that a permanent geologic repository to store spent nuclear fuel would be available when necessary and that spent nuclear fuel could be stored at nuclear reactor sites in the interim without significant environmental effects, and remanded the case for further proceedings. the court concluded that the nrc had not satisfied the requirements of the national environmental policy act (nepa) when it considered environmental effects in reaching these conclusions. the waste confidence decision has been relied upon by nrc license renewal applicants to address some of the issues that the nepa requires the nrc to address before it issues a renewed license. certain nuclear opponents filed requests with the nrc asking it to address the issues raised by the court's decision in the license renewal proceedings for a number of nuclear plants including grand gulf. in august 2012 the nrc issued an order stating that it will not issue final licenses dependent upon the waste confidence decision until the d.c. circuit's remand is addressed, but also stating that licensing reviews and proceedings should continue to move forward. in september 2014 the nrc published a new final waste confidence rule, named continued storage of spent nuclear fuel, that for licensing purposes adopts non-site specific findings concerning the environmental impacts of the continued storage of spent nuclear fuel at reactor sites - for 60
years, 100 years and indefinitely - after the reactor's licensed period of operations. the nrc also issued an order lifting its suspension of licensing proceedings after the final rule's effective date in october 2014. after the final rule became effective, new york, connecticut, and vermont filed a challenge to the rule in the u.s. court of appeals. the final rule remains in effect while that challenge is pending unless the court orders otherwise.
the nuclear industry continues to address susceptibility to stress corrosion cracking of certain materials within the reactor coolant system. the issue is applicable to grand gulf and is managed in accordance with industry standard practices and guidelines that include in-service examinations, replacements, and mitigation strategies.
developments in the industry or identification of issues at the nuclear units could require unanticipated remediation efforts that cannot be quantified in advance.
after the nuclear incident in japan resulting from the march 2011 earthquake and tsunami, the nrc established a task force to conduct a review of processes and regulations relating to nuclear facilities in the united states.
the task force issued a near-term (90-day) report in july 2011 that made initial recommendations, which were subsequently refined and prioritized after input from stakeholders. the task force then issued a second report in september 2011. based upon the task force's recommendations, the nrc issued three orders effective on march 12,
2012. the three orders require u.s. nuclear operators to undertake plant modifications and perform additional analyses that will, among other things, result in increased operating and capital costs associated with operating nuclear plants. the nrc, with input from the industry, is continuing to determine the specific actions required by the orders. system energy's estimated capital expenditures for 2015 through 2017 for complying with the nrc orders are included in the planned construction and other capital investments estimates given in "

environmental risks system energy's facilities and operations are subject to regulation by various governmental authorities having jurisdiction over air quality, water quality, control of toxic substances and hazardous and solid wastes, and other environmental matters. management believes that system energy is in substantial compliance with environmental regulations currently applicable to its facilities and operations. because environmental regulations are subject to change, future compliance costs cannot be precisely estimated.
critical accounting estimates the preparation of system energy's financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to apply appropriate accounting policies and to make estimates and judgments that
table of contents system energy resources, inc.
management's financial discussion and analysis can have a significant effect on reported financial position, results of operations, and cash flows. management has identified the following accounting policies and estimates as critical because they are based on assumptions and measurements that involve a high degree of uncertainty, and there is the potential for future changes in the assumptions and measurements that could produce estimates that would have a material impact on the presentation of system energy's financial position or results of operations.
" section of entergy corporation and subsidiaries management's financial discussion and analysis for discussion of the estimates inherent in accounting for nuclear decommissioning costs.
in the fourth quarter 2014, system energy recorded a revision to its estimated decommissioning cost liability for grand gulf as a result of a revised decommissioning cost study. the revised estimate resulted in a $99.9 million increase in its decommissioning liability, along with a corresponding increase in the related asset retirement cost asset that will be depreciated over the remaining life of the unit.
in the fourth quarter 2013, system energy recorded a revision to its estimated decommissioning cost liability for grand gulf as a result of a revised decommissioning cost study. the revised estimate resulted in a $102.3 million increase in its decommissioning liability, along with a corresponding increase in the related asset retirement cost asset that will be depreciated over the remaining life of the unit.
qualified pension and other postretirement benefits system energy's qualified pension and other postretirement reported costs, as described in note 11 to the financial statements, are impacted by numerous factors including the provisions of the plans, changing employee demographics, and various actuarial calculations, assumptions, and accounting mechanisms. see the " qualified pension and other postretirement benefits
" section of entergy corporation and subsidiaries management's financial discussion and analysis for further discussion. because of the complexity of these calculations, the long-term nature of these obligations, and the importance of the assumptions utilized, entergy's estimate of these costs is a critical accounting estimate.

costs and funding total qualified pension cost for system energy in 2014 was $12.2 million. system energy anticipates 2015 qualified pension cost to be $16.6 million. system energy contributed $21.2 million to its pension plans in 2014 and estimates 2015 pension contributions to be approximately $20.8 million, although the required pension contributions will not be known with more certainty until the january 1, 2015 valuations are completed by april 1, 2015.
total postretirement health care and life insurance benefit costs for system energy in 2014 were $561 thousand.
system energy expects 2015 postretirement health care and life insurance benefit costs to approximate $481
thousand. system energy contributed $334 thousand to its other postretirement plans in 2014 and expects to contribute $475 thousand in 2015.
the retirement and mortality rate assumptions are reviewed every three-to-five years as part of an actuarial study that compares these assumptions to the actual experience of the pension and other postretirement plans. the 2014
actuarial study reviewed plan experience from 2010 through 2013. as a result of the 2014 actuarial study and the issuance of new mortality tables in october 2014 by the society of actuaries, changes were made to reflect modified demographic pattern expectations as well as longer life expectancies. these changes are reflected in the december
31, 2014 financial disclosures. adoption of the new mortality assumptions for 2015 resulted in an increase at december 31, 2014 of $17.7 million in the qualified pension benefit obligation and $3.1 million in the accumulated postretirement obligation. the new mortality assumptions increased anticipated 2015 qualified pension cost by approximately $2.7 million and other postretirement cost by approximately $0.4 million. pension funding guidelines, as established by the employee retirement income security act of 1974, as amended and the internal revenue code of
1986, as amended, are not expected to incorporate the october 2014 society of actuaries new mortality assumptions until after 2015, possibly 2016.

table of contents internal control over financial reporting
(entergy corporation, entergy arkansas, entergy gulf states louisiana, entergy louisiana, entergy mississippi, entergy new orleans, entergy texas, and system energy)
the managements of entergy corporation, entergy arkansas, entergy gulf states louisiana, entergy louisiana, entergy mississippi, entergy new orleans, entergy texas, and system energy (individually "registrant" and collectively the
"registrants") are responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting for the registrants. each registrant's internal control system is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the preparation and fair presentation of each registrant's financial statements presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
all internal control systems, no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations. therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation.
each registrant's management assessed the effectiveness of each registrant's internal control over financial reporting as of december 31, 2014 . in making this assessment, each registrant's management used the criteria set forth by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission (coso) in internal control -
integrated framework. the 2013 coso framework was utilized for management's assessment.
based on each management's assessment and the criteria set forth by the 2013 coso framework, each registrant's management believes that each registrant maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of december 31, 2014 .

table of contents attestation report of registered public accounting firm report of independent registered public accounting firm to the board of directors and shareholders of entergy corporation and subsidiaries new orleans, louisiana we have audited the internal control over financial reporting of entergy corporation and subsidiaries (the
"corporation") as of december 31, 2014, based on criteria established in internal control -integrated framework
(2013) issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission. the corporation's management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in item 9a, internal control over financial reporting. our responsibility is to express an opinion on the corporation's internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.
we conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board (united states). those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. we believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
a company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the company's principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, and effected by the company's board of directors, management, and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. a company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
because of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting, including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. also, projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

table of contents cd&a highlights executive compensation programs and practices entergy corporation regularly reviews its executive compensation programs to align them with commonly viewed best practices in the market. following are some highlights of entergy corporation's executive compensation practices:
•  require a "double trigger" for severance payments or equity acceleration in the event of a change in control
•  cap the maximum payout at 200% of target under the long-term performance unit program and under the annual incentive plan for members of the office of the chief executive
•  target the long-term compensation mix to give more weight to performance units than to time-based restricted stock and stock options combined
•  settle 100% of long-term performance unit payouts in shares of entergy stock
•  prohibit directors and officers from pledging or entering into hedging or other derivative transactions with respect to their entergy corporation shares things entergy corporation doesn't do
•  no 280(g) tax "gross up" payments in the event of a change in control
•  no option repricing or cash buy-outs for underwater options under the equity plans
•  no agreements providing for severance payments to executive officers that exceed 2.99 times annual base salary and annual incentive awards without shareholder approval
•  new officers are excluded from participation in the system executive retirement plan
•  no grants of supplemental service credit for newly-hired officers under any of entergy corporation's non-qualified retirement plans pay for performance philosophy entergy corporation's executive compensation programs are based on a philosophy of pay-for-performance that is embodied in the design of its annual and long-term incentive plans. in keeping with this philosophy approximately
80% of the annual target compensation of entergy corporation's chief executive officer is "at risk," equity or performance-based compensation.
2014 incentive pay outcomes pay outcomes for the named executive officers during 2014 demonstrated the application of this pay-for-performance philosophy.
annual incentive plan awards awards under entergy corporation's annual incentive plan are tied to its financial performance through the entergy achievement multiplier, which is the performance metric used to determine the funding of awards under the plan. for
2014, the entergy achievement multiplier was determined based in equal part on entergy corporation's success in achieving its operational earnings per share and operating cash flow goals. these goals were approved by the personnel committee at the beginning of the year based on entergy corporation's financial plan and the board's overall goals for entergy corporation and were consistent with its published earnings guidance.
table of contents for 2014, the personnel committee, based on the recommendation of the finance committee, determined that management exceeded its operational earnings per share goal of $5.00 per share by $0.83 per share and exceeded its operational operating cash flow goal of $3.43 billion by approximately $517 million. based on the targets previously determined by the committee, entergy corporation's outstanding financial performance in 2014 would have resulted in an entergy achievement multiplier of 200% of target. from a qualitative standpoint, the committee also took into account management's strong performance executing on entergy corporation's strategies in 2014 and various accomplishments and challenges in 2014. included in those challenges was a decline in entergy corporation's employee safety performance, as a result of which the committee decided to exercise its discretion to reduce the calculated entergy achievement multiplier to 195%. this resulted in payouts under the annual incentive plan to the named executive officers who are members of the office of the chief executive, including entergy corporation's chief executive officer, at 195% of each officer's target award, which the personnel committee considered to be appropriate in light of management's performance and the outstanding results achieved in 2014.
long-term performance unit program payouts under the long-term performance unit program, a substantial portion of targeted executive officer pay is tied directly to entergy corporation's relative total shareholder return. under this program, entergy corporation measures performance over a three-year period by assessing entergy's total shareholder return in relation to the total shareholder return of the companies included in the philadelphia utility index, with payouts based solely on entergy corporation's performance relative to the other companies in the index. entergy corporation measures performance based on relative total shareholder return because it encourages the executives to deliver superior shareholder value in relation to entergy corporation's peers and rewards not just stock price appreciation, but also the ability to deliver significant dividends to shareholders, and takes into account market fluctuations in the utility sector.
entergy corporation's total shareholder return, which had substantially lagged the returns of its peer group in
2012, improved significantly in 2013 and, for 2014, was near the top of the philadelphia utility index. as a result, following a review by the finance committee and the personnel committee of entergy corporation's total shareholder return in relation to the total shareholder return of the companies in the philadelphia utility index, the personnel committee determined that entergy corporation's relative total shareholder return fell within the third quartile of the philadelphia utility index for the 2012-2014 performance period, resulting in payouts of
64.64% of target. such payouts were made 100% in shares of entergy corporation stock that are required to be held by the executives until they satisfy the executive stock ownership guidelines.
what entergy corporation pays and why pay for performance philosophy entergy corporation's executive compensation programs are based on a philosophy of pay-for-performance that is embodied in the design of its annual and long-term incentive plans. entergy corporation believes the executive pay programs described in this section and in the accompanying tables have played a material role in its ability to drive strong financial and operational results and to attract and retain a highly experienced and successful management team. the annual incentive plan incentivizes and rewards the achievement of operational financial metrics that are deemed by the personnel committee to be consistent with the overall goals and strategic direction that the board has approved for entergy corporation. entergy corporation's long-term incentive programs further align the interests of its executives and its shareholders by directly tying the value of the equity awards granted to executives under these programs to the performance of entergy corporation's stock price and its total shareholder return. by incentivizing officers to achieve important financial and operational objectives and create long-term shareholder value, these programs play a key role in creating sustainable value for the benefit of all of entergy corporation's stakeholders, including its owners, customers, employees, and communities.
table of contents how entergy corporation sets target pay to develop a competitive compensation program, the personnel committee annually reviews compensation data from two sources:
survey data the committee uses published and private compensation survey data to develop marketplace compensation levels for the executive officers. the data, which are compiled by pay governance, llc, the committee's independent compensation consultant, compare the current compensation opportunities provided to each of the executive officers against the compensation opportunities provided to executives holding similar positions at companies with corporate revenues similar to entergy corporation's. for non-industry specific positions such as a chief financial officer, the committee reviews general industry data for total cash compensation (base salary and annual incentive) since the market for talent is broader than the utility sector. for management positions that are industry-specific such as group president, utility operations, the committee reviews data from utility companies for total cash compensation. however, for long-term incentives, all positions are reviewed relative to utility market data. the survey data reviewed by the committee cover hundreds of companies across a broad range of industries and over 60
investor-owned utility companies in the utility sector. in evaluating compensation levels against the survey data, the committee considers only the aggregated survey data. the identities of the companies participating in compensation survey data are not disclosed to, or considered by, the committee in its decision-making process and, thus, are not considered material by the committee.
the committee uses this survey data to develop compensation opportunities that are designed to deliver total target compensation at approximately the 50 th percentile of the surveyed companies. the survey data are the primary data used for purposes of assessing target compensation. as a result, mr. denault, entergy corporation's chief executive officer, is compensated at a higher level than the other named executive officers, reflecting market practices that compensate chief executive officers at greater potential compensation levels with more pay "at risk" than other named executive officers, due to the greater responsibilities and accountability required of a chief executive officer. in most cases, the committee considers its objectives to have been met if entergy corporation's chief executive officer and the eight (8) other executive officers who constitute what entergy corporation refers to as its office of the chief executive each have a target compensation opportunity that falls within the range of
85%-115% of the 50th percentile of the survey data. promoted officers or officers who are new to their roles may be transitioned into the targeted market range over time. actual compensation received by an individual officer may be above or below the targeted range based on an individual officer's skills, performance, experience and responsibilities, corporate performance, and internal pay equity. for 2014, the total target compensation of each of the named executive officers fell within the targeted range except for three officers whose total target compensation fell below the targeted range.
proxy analysis although the survey data described above are the primary data used in determining compensation, the committee reviews data derived from the proxy statements of companies included in the philadelphia utility index as an additional point of comparison. the proxy data are used to compare the compensation levels of the named executive officers with the compensation levels of the corresponding top five highest paid executive officers of the companies included in the philadelphia utility index, as reported in their proxy statements, based on pay rank and without regard to roles and responsibilities, except with respect to the chief executive officer and chief financial officer, for whom comparable roles are used. the personnel committee uses this analysis to evaluate the overall reasonableness of the entergy corporation's compensation programs. the following companies were included in the philadelphia utility index at the time the proxy data from the 2014 filings of the index were compiled:

incentives are designed to drive overall corporate performance, specific business unit strategies, and individual performance using performance and operational measures the committee believes correlate to shareholder value and align with entergy corporation's strategic vision and operating priorities. the committee establishes the performance measures and ranges of performance for the variable compensation elements. an individual's award is based primarily on corporate performance, market-based compensation levels, and individual performance.

short-term compensation the personnel committee determines the base salaries for all of the named executive officers who are members of the office of the chief executive based on competitive compensation data, performance considerations, and advice provided by the committee's independent compensation consultant. for the other named executive officers, their salaries are established by their immediate supervisors using the same criteria. the committee also considers internal pay equity; however, the committee has not established any predetermined formula against which the base salary of one named executive officer is measured against another officer or employee.
in 2014, all of the named executive officers received merit increases in their base salaries ranging from 2 to 5
percent. the increases in base salary were made in light of current economic conditions and the projected growth in executive salaries in 2014 based on the market data previously discussed in this cd&a under "what entergy corporation pays and why - how entergy corporation sets target pay," as well as an internal pay equity comparison.
table of contents the following table sets forth the 2013 and 2014 base salaries for the named executive officers. changes in base salaries for 2014 were effective in april.

annual incentive plan entergy corporation includes performance-based incentives in the named executive officers' compensation packages because it believes performance-based incentives encourage the named executive officers to pursue objectives consistent with the overall goals and strategic direction that the board has approved for entergy corporation.
under the annual incentive plan, entergy corporation uses a performance metric known as the entergy achievement multiplier to determine the percentage of target annual plan opportunities that will be paid each year to each named executive officer, subject to adjustment based on individual performance. for 2014, the personnel committee maintained the following target award levels of base salary for the named executive officers:
•  70% for mr. marsh, mr. savoff, and mr. west;
the target opportunities established for these officers were comparable to the target opportunities historically set for these positions and levels of responsibility. the named executive officers who are members of the office of the chief executive may earn a payout ranging from 0% to 200% of their target opportunity calculated as described in the table below. the target awards for the named executive officers (other than the entergy corporation named executive officers) were set by their respective supervisors (subject to ultimate approval of entergy corporation's chief executive officer) who allocated a potential incentive pool established by the personnel committee among various of their direct and indirect reports.
target awards are set based on an executive officer's position and executive management level within the entergy organization. executive management levels at entergy range from level 1 through level 4. at december 31, 2014, mr.
denault held a level 1 position, messrs. marsh, savoff, and west held positions in level 2, ms. mount and mr. may held level 3 positions and the remaining named executive officers held positions in level 4. accordingly, their respective incentive targets differ one from another based on the external market data developed by the committee's independent compensation consultant and the other factors noted above.
each year the personnel committee reviews the performance measures used to determine the entergy achievement multiplier. in december 2013, the personnel committee decided to retain for 2014 the performance measures used for determining the 2013 entergy achievement multiplier. these measures were operational earnings per share and operating cash flow, with each measure weighted equally. the committee considered a variety of other potential measures, but determined that operational earnings per share and operating cash flow continued to be the
table of contents best metrics to use because, among other things, they are objective measures that entergy corporation's investors consider to be important in evaluating its financial performance and because entergy corporation's goals in that regard are broadly communicated both internally and externally. this provides both discipline and transparency that the committee believes are important objectives of any well designed incentive compensation plan.
the personnel committee also engages in a rigorous process each year to establish the targets for the annual incentive plan with a goal of establishing target achievement levels that are consistent with entergy corporation's strategy and business objectives for the upcoming year, as reflected in its financial plan, and sufficient to drive results that represent a high level of achievement for entergy corporation, taking into consideration the applicable business environment and specific challenges facing it. these targets are approved based on a comprehensive review by the full board of entergy corporation's financial plan, including changes in commodity market conditions and other key drivers of anticipated changes in performance from the preceding year. the committee further confirms that the targets it approves are aligned with the earnings guidance that will be communicated to the financial markets, which assures that the internal targets approved for purposes of entergy corporation's incentive compensation plans are aligned with the external expectations set and communicated to its shareholders.
in december 2013, after full board review of management's 2014 financial plan for entergy corporation and engaging in the process discussed above, the committee determined the annual incentive plan targets to be used for purposes of determining annual bonuses for 2014. in keeping with its past practice, the committee also determined that for purposes of measuring performance against such targets, the committee would exclude the effect on as-reported results of activities related to special items that would be excluded in determining operational results, and the effect of any major storms that may occur during the year.

in january 2015, the finance and personnel committees reviewed entergy corporation's financial results against the performance objectives reflected in the table above. based on the finance committee's recommendation, the personnel committee determined that management exceeded its operational earnings per share goal of $5.00 per share by $0.83
per share and exceeded its operational operating cash flow goal of $3.43 billion by approximately $517 million.
operational results excluded from as-reported results special items recorded for (i) expenses associated with the shutdown in december 2014 of the vermont yankee nuclear power station and the related settlement agreement reached with the state of vermont in 2014, and (ii) expenses for the implementation of the human capital management strategic imperative in 2014. the exclusion of these items was consistent with the committee's decision to approve the annual incentive plan targets for 2014 on the basis of entergy corporation's operational financial results, because such results form the basis for entergy corporation's financial plan and guidance to investors and are the primary basis on which its financial performance is evaluated by investors.
based on the targets previously determined by the committee, entergy corporation's outstanding financial performance in 2014 exceeded the maximum target achievement approved by the committee, and would have resulted
table of contents in an entergy achievement multiplier of 200%. however, in determining the entergy achievement multiplier, the committee also took into account management's strong performance executing on entergy corporation's strategies in
2014 and various accomplishments and challenges in 2014. included in those challenges was a decline in entergy corporation's employee safety performance from 2013, which included an increase in osha recordable accidents from the preceding year and two electrical contact incidents involving critical safety rule violations. the committee concluded that despite management's outstanding performance overall and entergy corporation's strong financial performance for the year, this decline in safety performance warranted a downward adjustment in the entergy achievement multiplier to 195%.
based on the foregoing evaluation of management performance and the recommendation of the finance committee, the personnel committee certified an entergy achievement multiplier of 195% for 2014 for the members of the office of the chief executive. after the entergy achievement multiplier was established to determine overall funding for the annual incentive plan, entergy corporation's chief executive officer allocated incentive award funding to the business units based on their business unit results (referred to as the "line of business multiplier). individual awards were determined based on the line of business multiplier as well as individual officer performance taking into account customer, operational, and safety measures.
the following table shows the annual incentive plan payouts to each named executive officer for 2014.

long-term incentive compensation entergy corporation's goal for its long-term incentive compensation is to focus the executive officers on building shareholder value and to increase the executive officers' ownership of entergy corporation's common stock in order to more closely align their interest with those of its shareholders. in its long-term incentive compensation program, entergy corporation uses a mix of performance units, restricted stock, and stock options. performance units reward the named executive officers on the basis of total shareholder return, which is a measure of stock price appreciation and dividend payments, in relation to the companies in the philadelphia utility index.
restricted stock ties the executive officers' long-term financial interest to the long-term financial interests of entergy corporation's shareholders. stock options provide a direct incentive to increase the value of entergy corporation's common stock. in general, entergy corporation seeks to allocate the total value of long-term incentive compensation 60% to performance units and 40% to a combination of stock options and restricted stock, equally divided in value, all based on their grant date fair values. awards for individual named executive officers may vary from this target as a result of individual performance, promotions, and internal pay equity.
all of the performance units, shares of restricted stock, and stock options granted to the named executive officers in 2014 were awarded under entergy corporation's 2011 equity ownership plan and long-term cash
table of contents incentive plan ("2011 equity ownership plan"), which requires both a change in control and an involuntary job loss or substantial diminution of duties (a "double trigger") for the acceleration of these awards upon a change in control.
performance unit program entergy corporation issues performance unit awards to the named executive officers under its long-term performance unit program. each performance unit represents the value of one share of entergy corporation's common stock at the end of the three-year performance period, plus dividends accrued during the performance period. the personnel committee approves payout opportunities for the program at the outset of each performance period, and the program is structured to reward named executive officers only if performance goals approved by the personnel committee are met. the personnel committee has no discretion to make awards if minimum performance goals are not achieved.
the performance units granted under the long-term performance unit program and accrued dividends on any shares earned during the performance period are settled in shares of entergy common stock rather than cash. all shares paid out under the long-term performance unit program are required to be retained by the officers until applicable executive stock ownership requirements are met.
the long-term performance unit program specifies a minimum, target, and maximum achievement level, the achievement of which will determine the number of performance units that may be earned by each participant. entergy corporation measures performance by assessing entergy corporation's total shareholder return relative to the total shareholder return of the companies in the philadelphia utility index. the personnel committee identified the philadelphia utility index as the appropriate industry peer group for this purpose because the companies included in this index, in the aggregate, approximate entergy corporation in terms of business and scale. the personnel committee chose relative total shareholder return as a measure of performance because it reflects entergy corporation's creation of shareholder value relative to other electric utilities over the performance period. it also takes into account dividends paid by the companies in this index and normalizes certain events that affect the industry as a whole.
minimum, target, and maximum performance levels are determined by reference to the ranking of entergy corporation's total shareholder return against the total shareholder return of the companies in the philadelphia utility index.
the range of potential payouts under the program is shown below.

2013-2015, the 2014-2016, and the 2015-2017 performance periods.
performance unit program grants. subject to achievement of the applicable performance levels, the personnel committee established the following target performance unit payout opportunities for each of the 2012-2014,
2013-2015, and 2014-2016 performance periods. each named executive officer received a larger number of performance units in 2013 and 2014 than were granted to officers at their respective levels in the preceding years to reflect the lower stock price at the time of the award as compared to the preceding year and a slight increase in targeted long-term value required to result in awards approximating the 50 th percentile of the utility market data.

payout for the 2012-2014 performance period . in january 2015, the committee reviewed the entergy corporation's total shareholder return for the 2012-2014 performance period in order to determine the payout to participants for the 2012-2014 performance period. the committee compared entergy corporation's total shareholder return against the total shareholder return of the companies that comprise the philadelphia utility index, with the performance measures and range of potential payouts for the 2012-2014 performance similar to the range of payouts discussed above for the 2014-2016 performance period. as recommended by the finance committee, the personnel committee determined that entergy corporation's relative total shareholder return fell within the third quartile of the philadelphia utility index for the 2012-2014 performance period, resulting in payouts to the named executive officers of 64.64% of target. beginning with the 2012-2014 performance period, payouts under the performance unit program are made in shares of entergy common stock. for the 2012-2014 performance period, the following numbers of shares of entergy common stock were issued:
•  mr. savoff and mr. west - 3,888 shares;
stock options and restricted stock entergy corporation grants stock options and restricted stock as part of the long-term incentive program to its executive officers. as previously discussed, the personnel committee considers several factors in determining the number of stock options and shares of restricted stock it will grant to the named executive officers, including individual performance, prevailing market practice, targeted long-term value created by the use of stock options and restricted stock, and the potential dilutive effect of stock option and restricted stock grants. the committee's assessment of individual performance of each named executive officer is the most important factor in determining the number of shares of restricted stock and stock options awarded, except with respect to the chief executive officer for whom comparative market data is the most important factor. mr. denault's 2014 awards are comparable to historical awards granted to entergy corporation's chief executive officer and reflects the decreased stock price at the time of grant. the committee, in consultation with entergy corporation's chief executive officer, reviews each other named executive officer's performance, role and responsibilities, strengths, and developmental opportunities. stock option and restricted stock awards for entergy corporation's chief executive officer are determined solely by the personnel committee on the basis of the same considerations. for all equity awards, the committee also considers entergy corporation's significant achievements for the prior year.
table of contents the following table sets forth the number of stock options and shares of restricted stock granted to each named executive officer in 2014. the exercise price for each option was $63.17, which was the closing price of entergy's common stock on the date of grant.

benefits, perquisites, agreements and post-termination plans retirement plans the named executive officers participate in an entergy corporation-sponsored tax qualified final average pay defined benefit pension plan that covers a broad group of employees. in addition, each named executive officer participates in the pension equalization plan, a non-qualified restoration plan, and the system executive retirement plan, a non-qualified supplemental retirement plan. both plans are sponsored by entergy corporation.
under the terms of the pension equalization plan and system executive retirement plan, an employee participating in both plans is eligible to receive only the greater of the two benefits computed in accordance with the terms of, and conditions of each plan.
effective july 1, 2014, the pension equalization plan was amended to provide that employees who participate in entergy corporation's new cash balance pension plan are not eligible to participate in the pension equalization plan. these employees instead will participate in a new cash balance restoration plan. in addition, the pension equalization plan and all other non-qualified plans sponsored by entergy corporation were amended, as necessary, to eliminate the grant of supplemental credited service to new executive officers under any of those plans. the plan amendments were authorized by the personnel committee after reviewing comparative market data to better align entergy corporation's retirement plans with emerging market practice. also to better align with emerging market practice, effective july 1, 2014, the system executive retirement plan and the supplemental retirement plan of entergy corporation and subsidiaries were closed to new participants.
see the 2014 pension benefits table for additional information regarding the operation of the plans described under this caption.
savings plan the named executive officers are eligible to participate in entergy corporation-sponsored savings plan that covers a broad group of employees. the savings plan is a tax-qualified 401(k) retirement savings plan, wherein total combined before-tax and after-tax contributions may not exceed 30% of a participant's base salary up to certain contribution limits defined by law. in addition, under the savings plan, the employer of savings plan participants, who participate in the final average pay defined benefit pension plan, matches an amount equal to seventy cents for each dollar contributed by participating employees, including the named executive officers, with respect to the first six percent of their eligible earnings under the plan for that pay period.
table of contents executive deferred compensation plan the named executive officers are eligible to defer up to 100% of their annual incentive plan awards into either or both of the entergy corporation-sponsored executive deferred compensation plan and the 2011 equity plan. in addition, they are eligible to defer up to 100% of their base salary into the executive deferred compensation plan.
entergy corporation believes that providing this benefit is important as a retention and recruitment tool because many, if not all, of the companies with which it competes for executive talent provide a similar arrangement to their senior executive officers. see the 2014 non-qualified deferred compensation discussion for additional information regarding the operation of the executive deferred compensation plan.
health & welfare benefits the named executive officers are eligible to participate in various health and welfare benefits available to a broad group of employees. these benefits include medical, dental, and vision coverage, life and accidental death and dismemberment insurance, business travel accident insurance, and long-term disability insurance. eligibility, coverage levels, potential employee contributions, and other plan design features are the same for the named executive officers as for the broad employee population.
executive disability plan all of the executive officers, including the named executive officers, are eligible to participate in the executive disability plan of entergy corporation and subsidiaries. individuals who elect to participate in this plan and become disabled under the terms of the plan are eligible for 65% of the difference between their base salary and
$276,923 (i.e. the base salary that produces the maximum $15,000 monthly disability payment under the general long-
perquisites entergy corporation provides the named executive officers with a limited number of perquisites and other personal benefits as part of providing a competitive executive compensation program and for employee retention. the personnel committee reviews all perquisites, including the personal use of corporate aircraft, on an annual basis.
in 2014, the named executive officers were offered corporate aircraft usage, relocation assistance, annual physical exams, and event tickets. named executive officers who are not members of the office of chief executive were provided in 2014 with club dues and tax gross up payment on some perquisites. for security and business convenience reasons, entergy corporation's chief executive officer is allowed to use corporate aircraft at entergy corporation's expense for personal use. the other named executive officers may use corporate aircraft for personal travel subject to the approval of entergy corporation's chief executive officer. from time to time, tickets to cultural and sporting events are made available to employees, including the named executive officers, for business purposes. if not utilized for business purposes, the tickets are made available to employees, including the named executive officers, for personal use. entergy corporation does not provide personal financial counseling.
relocation benefits to executive officers, including tax gross-up payments, are similar to those provided to all eligible employees. for additional information regarding perquisites, see the "all other compensation" column in the summary compensation table.
post-termination agreements and other compensation arrangements the committee believes that retention and transitional compensation arrangements are an important part of overall compensation. the committee believes that these arrangements help to secure the continued employment and dedication of the named executive officers, notwithstanding any concern that they might have at the time of a change in control regarding their own continued employment. in addition, the committee believes that these arrangements are important as recruitment and retention devices, as all or nearly all of the companies with which entergy corporation competes for executive talent have similar arrangements in place for its senior employees.
to achieve these objectives, entergy corporation has established a system executive continuity plan under which each of the named executive officers is entitled to receive "change in control" payments and benefits if such
table of contents officer's employment is involuntarily terminated in connection with a change in control of entergy corporation.
severance payments under the system executive continuity plan are based on a multiple of the sum of an executive officer's annual base salary plus his or her average annual incentive plan award for the two fiscal years immediately preceding the fiscal year in which the termination of employment occurs. under no circumstances can this multiple exceed 2.99 times the sum of (a) the executive officer's annual base salary as in effect at any time within one year prior to the commencement of a change in control period or if higher, immediately prior to a circumstance constituting good reason plus (b) his or her annual incentive, calculated using the average annual target opportunity derived under the annual incentive plan for the two calendar years immediately preceding the calendar year in which the officer's termination occurs, or if higher the annual incentive award actually received under the annual incentive plan for the fiscal year immediately preceding the fiscal year in which the termination of employment occurs. entergy corporation strives to ensure that the benefits and payment levels under the system executive continuity plan are consistent with market practices. executive officers, including the named executive officers, will not receive any tax gross-up payments on any severance benefits received under this plan. for more information regarding the system executive continuity plan, see "system executive continuity plan."
in certain cases, the committee may approve the execution of a retention agreement with an individual executive officer. these decisions are made on a case by case basis to reflect specific retention needs or other factors, including market practice. if a retention agreement is entered into with an individual officer, the committee considers the economic value associated with that agreement in making overall compensation decisions for that officer. entergy corporation has voluntarily adopted a policy that any employment or severance agreements providing severance benefits in excess of 2.99 times the sum of an officer's annual base salary and annual incentive award
(other than the value of the vesting or payment of an outstanding equity-based award or the pro rata vesting or payment of an outstanding long-term incentive award) must be approved by entergy corporation's shareholders.
entergy corporation has a retention agreement with mr. denault. in general, mr. denault's retention agreement provides for severance payments and other benefits in the event of termination of employment other than for cause or on account of death or disability in lieu of those provided under the system executive continuity plan. as with any severance benefits paid under the system executive continuity plan, mr. denault will not receive tax gross-up payments on any severance benefits he may receive under his agreement. mr. denault's retention agreement was entered into in 2006 when he was entergy corporation's chief financial officer and was designed to reflect the competition for chief financial officer talent in the marketplace at that time and the committee's assessment of the critical role this position plays in executing entergy corporation's long-term financial and other strategic objectives. based on the market data provided by its former independent compensation consultant, the committee believes the benefits and payment levels under mr. denault's retention agreement are consistent with market practices.
for additional information regarding the system executive continuity plan and mr. denault's retention agreement described above, see "2014 potential payments upon termination or change in control."
compensation policies and practices entergy corporation strives to ensure that its compensation philosophy and practices are in line with the best practices of companies in the utility industry as well as other companies in the s&p 500. some of these practices include the following:
clawback provisions entergy corporation has adopted a clawback policy that covers all individuals subject to section 16 of the exchange act, including all of the members of the office of the chief executive. under the policy, the committee will require reimbursement of incentives paid to these executive officers where:
(i) the payment was predicated upon the achievement of certain financial results with respect to the
•  applicable performance period that were subsequently determined to be the subject of a material restatement other than a restatement due to changes in accounting policy; or (ii) a material miscalculation of a performance award
table of contents occurs, whether or not the financial statements were restated and, in either such case, a lower payment would have been made to the executive officer based upon the restated financial results or correct calculation; or in the board of directors' view, the executive officer engaged in fraud that caused or partially caused the
•  need for a restatement or caused a material miscalculation of a performance award, in each case, whether or not the financial statements were restated.
the amount the committee requires to be reimbursed is equal to the excess of the gross incentive payment made over the gross payment that would have been made if the original payment had been determined based on the restated financial results or correct calculation. further, following a material restatement of the financial statements, entergy corporation will seek to recover any compensation received by its chief executive officer and chief financial officer that is required to be reimbursed under section 304 of the sarbanes-oxley act of 2002.
stock ownership guidelines and share retention requirements for many years, entergy corporation has had stock ownership guidelines for executives, including the named executive officers. these guidelines are designed to align the executives' long-term financial interests with those of shareholders. annually, the personnel committee monitors the executive officers' compliance with these guidelines. the ownership guidelines are as follows:
role                       value of common stock to be owned chief executive officer    6 times base salary executive vice presidents  3 times base salary senior vice presidents     2 times base salary vice presidents            1 time base salary further, to ensure compliance with the guidelines, until an executive officer satisfies the stock ownership guidelines, the officer must retain:
•  all net after-tax shares paid out under the long-term performance unit program;
•  all net after-tax shares of entergy corporation's restricted stock received upon vesting; and at least 75% of the after-tax net shares received upon the exercise of entergy corporation stock options, except for stock options granted before january 1, 2014, as to which the executive officer must retain at least 75% of the after-tax net shares until the earlier of achievement of the stock ownership guidelines or
•  five years from the date of exercise.
trading controls and anti-pledging and anti-hedging policies executive officers, including the named executive officers, are required to receive the permission of entergy corporation's general counsel prior to entering into any transaction involving entergy corporation securities, including gifts, other than the exercise of employee stock options. trading is generally permitted only during open trading windows occurring immediately following the release of earnings. employees, who are subject to trading restrictions, including the named executive officers, may enter into trading plans under rule 10b5-1 of the exchange act, but these trading plans may be entered into only during an open trading window and must be approved by entergy corporation. the named executive officer bears full responsibility if he or she violates company policy by permitting shares to be bought or sold without pre-approval or when trading is restricted.
entergy corporation also prohibits its directors and executive officers, including the named executive officers, from pledging any entergy corporation's securities or entering into margin accounts involving entergy securities.
it prohibits these transactions because of the potential that sales of entergy corporation's securities could occur outside trading periods and without the required approval of the general counsel.
entergy corporation also has adopted an anti-hedging policy that prohibits officers, directors, and employees from entering into hedging or monetization transactions involving its common stock. prohibited transactions include,
table of contents without limitation, zero-cost collars, forward sale contracts, purchase or sale of options, puts, calls, straddles or equity swaps or other derivatives that are directly linked to the entergy corporation's stock or transactions involving "short-sales" of its stock. entergy corporation's board of directors adopted this policy to require officers, directors, and employees to continue to own entergy corporation stock with the full risks and rewards of ownership, thereby ensuring continued alignment of their objectives with those of entergy corporation's other shareholders.
roles and responsibilities role of the personnel committee the personnel committee has overall responsibility for approving the compensation program for the named executive officers and makes all final compensation decisions regarding the named executive officers. the committee works with entergy corporation's executive management to ensure that the compensation policies and practices are consistent with entergy corporation's values and support the successful recruitment, development, and retention of executive talent so entergy corporation can achieve its business objectives and optimize its long-term financial returns. each year, entergy corporation's senior vice president, human resources and chief diversity officer presents the proposed compensation model for the following year, including the compensation elements, mix of elements and measures for each element and consults with entergy corporation's chief executive officer on recommended compensation for senior executives. the committee evaluates executive pay each year to ensure that the compensation policies and practices are consistent with entergy corporation's philosophy. the personnel committee is responsible for, among its other duties, the following actions related to the named executive officers:
•  developing and implementing compensation policies and programs for hiring, evaluating, and setting compensation for the executive officers, including any employment agreement with an executive officer;
•  evaluating the performance of entergy corporation's chairman and chief executive officer; and
•  reporting, at least annually, to the board on succession planning, including succession planning for the chief executive officer.
role of the chief executive officer the personnel committee solicits recommendations from entergy corporation's chief executive officer with respect to compensation decisions for the other named executive officers. entergy corporation's chief executive officer provides the personnel committee with an assessment of the performance of each of the other named executive officers and recommends compensation levels to be awarded to each of them. in addition, the committee may request that the chief executive officer provide management feedback and recommendations on changes in the design of compensation programs, such as special retention plans or changes in the structure of bonus programs. however, entergy corporation's chief executive officer does not play any role with respect to any matter affecting his own compensation, nor does he have any role determining or recommending the amount, or form of, director compensation.
the personnel committee also relies on the recommendations of senior human resources executives with respect to compensation decisions, policies, and practices.
entergy corporation's chief executive officer may attend meetings of the personnel committee only at the invitation of the chair of the personnel committee and cannot call a meeting of the committee. in addition, he is not in attendance at the portion of any meeting when the committee approves the compensation to be paid to the named executive officers. since he is not a member of the committee, he has no vote on matters submitted to the committee. during 2014, mr. denault attended 6 meetings of the personnel committee.
role of the compensation consultant entergy corporation's personnel committee has the sole authority for the appointment, compensation, and oversight of its outside compensation consultant. in 2014, the personnel committee retained pay governance llc as its independent compensation consultant to assist it in, among other things, evaluating different compensation programs, and developing market data to assess the compensation programs.
table of contents during 2014, pay governance assisted the committee with its responsibilities related to entergy corporation's compensation programs for its executives. the committee directed pay governance to: (i) regularly attend meetings of the committee; (ii) conduct studies of competitive compensation practices; (iii) identify market surveys and proxy peer group; (iv) review base salary, annual incentives, and long-term incentive compensation opportunities relative to competitive practices; and (v) develop conclusions and recommendations related to the executive compensation plan for consideration by the committee. a senior consultant from pay governance attended all personnel committee meetings to which he was invited in 2014.
compensation consultant independence to maintain the independence of the personnel committee's compensation consultant, the board has adopted a policy that any consultant (including its affiliates) retained by the board of directors or any committee of the board of directors to provide advice or recommendations on the amount or form of executive and director compensation should not be retained by entergy corporation or any of its affiliates to provide other services in an aggregate amount that exceeds $120,000 in any year. in 2014, the personnel committee's independent compensation consultant, pay governance llc, did not provide any services to entergy corporation other than its services to the personnel committee. annually, the committee reviews the relationship with its compensation consultant including services provided, quality of those services, and fees associated with services in its evaluation of the executive compensation consultant's independence. the committee also assesses pay governance's independence under nyse rules and has concluded that no conflict of interests exists that would prevent pay governance from independently advising the personnel committee.
tax and accounting considerations section 162(m) of the code limits the tax deductibility by a publicly held corporation of compensation in excess of
$1 million paid to the chief executive officer or any of its other named executive officers who may be section
162(m) covered employees, unless that compensation is "performance-based compensation" within the meaning of section 162(m). the personnel committee considers deductibility under section 162(m) as it structures the compensation packages that are provided to its named executive officers. likewise, the personnel committee considers financial accounting consequences as it structures the compensation packages that are provided to the named executive officers. however, the personnel committee and the board believe that it is in the best interest of entergy corporation that the personnel committee retains the flexibility and discretion to make compensation awards, whether or not deductible. this flexibility is necessary to foster achievement of performance goals established by the personnel committee, as well as other corporate goals that the committee deems important to entergy corporation's success, such as encouraging employee retention and rewarding achievement of key goals.
personnel committee report the personnel committee report included in the entergy corporation proxy statement is incorporated by reference, but will not be deemed to be "filed" in this annual report on form 10-k. none of the subsidiaries has a compensation committee or other board committee performing equivalent functions. the board of directors of each of the subsidiaries is comprised of individuals who are officers or employees of entergy corporation or one of the subsidiaries. these boards do not make determinations regarding the compensation paid to executive officers of the subsidiaries.

qualified retirement benefits the qualified retirement plan in which the named executive officers participate is a funded, tax-qualified, noncontributory defined benefit pension plan that provides benefits to most of the non-bargaining unit employees of entergy system companies. all named executive officers are participants in this plan. benefits under the tax-
qualified pension plan are calculated as an annuity payable at age 65 and generally equal to 1.5% of a participant's final average monthly earnings (fame) multiplied by years of service (not to exceed 40). "earnings"
for purposes of calculating fame generally includes the employee's base salary and eligible annual incentive award and excludes all other bonuses. fame is calculated using the employee's average monthly earnings for the 60
consecutive months in which the employee's earnings were highest during the 120 month period immediately preceding the employee's retirement and includes up to 5 annual bonuses paid during the 60 month period. benefits under the tax-qualified plan are payable monthly after attainment of at least age 55 and after separation from an entergy system company. the amount of annual earnings that may be considered in calculating benefits under the tax-
qualified pension plan is limited by federal law. participants are 100% vested in their benefit upon completing 5
years of vesting service or upon attainment of age 65 while an active employee participant in the plan.
contributions to the pension plan are made entirely by the entergy system employer and are paid into a trust fund from which the benefits of participants will be paid.
normal retirement under the plan is age 65. employees who terminate employment prior to age 55 may receive a reduced deferred vested retirement benefit commencing as early as age 55 that is based on the normal retirement benefit (reduced by 7% per year for the first 5 years commencement precedes age 65, and reduced by 6% for each additional year commencement precedes age 65). employees who are at least age 55 with 10 years of vesting service upon termination of employment are entitled to a subsidized early retirement benefit beginning as early as age 55.
the subsidized early retirement benefit is equal to the normal retirement benefit reduced by 2% per year for each year that early retirement precedes age 65.
mr. denault, mr. mcdonald, and mr. savoff are eligible for subsidized early retirement benefits.
table of contents non-qualified retirement benefits the named executive officers are eligible to participate in certain non-qualified retirement benefit plans that provide retirement income, including the pension equalization plan and the system executive retirement plan. each of these plans is an unfunded non-qualified defined benefit pension plan that provides benefits to key management employees. in these plans, as described below, an executive is typically enrolled in one or more plans but only paid the amount due under the plan that provides the highest benefit. in general, upon disability, participants in the pension equalization plan and the system executive retirement plan remain eligible for continued service credits until the earlier of recovery, separation from service due to disability, or retirement eligibility.
generally, spouses of participants who die before commencement of benefits may be eligible for a portion of the participant's accrued benefit.
all of the named executive officers participate in both the pension equalization plan and the system executive retirement plan.
the pension equalization plan the pension equalization plan is a non-qualified unfunded restoration retirement plan that provides for the payment to participants from entergy corporation's general assets of a single lump sum cash distribution upon separation from service generally equal to the actuarial present value of the difference between the amount that would have been payable as an annuity under the tax-qualified pension plan, but for internal revenue code limitations on pension benefits and earnings that may be considered in calculating tax-qualified pension benefits, and the amount actually payable as an annuity under the tax-qualified pension plan. the pension equalization plan also takes into account as eligible earnings certain incentive awards paid under the annual incentive plan and includes supplemental credited service granted to a participant in calculating his or her benefit. participants receive their pension equalization plan benefit in the form of a single sum cash distribution. the benefits under this plan are offset by benefits payable from the qualified retirement plan and may be offset by prior employer benefits. the pension equalization plan benefit attributable to supplemental credited service is not vested until age 65. subject to the prior written consent of the entergy system company employer (which consent is deemed given if the participant's employment is terminated within twenty-four months following a change in control by the employer without "cause" or by the participant for "good reason," as each is defined in the plan), an employee with supplemental credited service who terminates employment prior to age 65 may be vested in his or her benefit, with payment of the lump sum benefit generally at separation from service unless delayed six months under internal revenue code section 409a. benefits payable prior to age 65 are subject to the same reductions as qualified plan benefits.
effective july 1, 2014, participants in the pension equalization plan will not be provided with supplemental credited service unless the grant of supplemental credited service was approved and accepted in writing by the plan administrator prior to july 1, 2014. in addition, the pension equalization plan was amended effective july 1, 2014
the system executive retirement plan the system executive retirement plan is a non-qualified supplemental retirement plan that provides for a single sum payment at age 65. like the pension equalization plan, the system executive retirement plan is designed to provide for the payment to participants from entergy corporation's general assets of a single-sum cash distribution upon the participant's separation from service. the single-sum benefit is generally equal to the actuarial present value of a specified percentage of the participant's "final average monthly compensation" (which is generally 1/36th of the sum of the participant's annual rate of base salary and annual incentive plan award for the 3 highest years during the last 10 years preceding termination of employment), after first being reduced by the value of the participant's tax-qualified retirement plan benefit and typically any prior employer pension benefit available to the participant.
table of contents while the system executive retirement plan has a replacement ratio schedule from one year of service to the maximum of 30 years of service, the table below offers a sample ratio at 20 and 30 years of service.
years of    executives at                                               executives at service     management       executives at management levels 2 and 3    management level 1                                                     level 4
the system executive retirement plan benefit is not vested until age 65. subject to the prior written consent of the entergy system company employer, an employee who terminates his or her employment prior to age 65 may be vested in the system executive retirement plan benefit, with payment of the lump sum benefit generally at separation from service unless delayed six months under code section 409a. benefits payable prior to age 65 are subject to the same reductions as qualified plan benefits. further, in the event of a change in control, participants whose employment is terminated without "cause" or by the employee for "good reason," as each is defined in the plan are also eligible for a subsidized lump sum benefit payment, even if they do not currently meet the age or service requirements for early retirement under that plan or have company permission to separate from employment. such lump sum benefit is payable generally at separation from service unless delayed 6 months under code section 409a.
2011 equity ownership plan allow for the deferral of compensation for the named executive officers. as of december
31, 2014, none of the named executive officers had deferred compensation balances under the equity ownership plans or the executive deferred compensation plan.
as of december 31, 2014, mr. savoff and mr. may had deferred account balances under a frozen defined contribution restoration plan. these amounts are deemed invested, as chosen by the participant, in certain t. rowe price investment funds that are also available to participants under the savings plan. mr. savoff and mr. may have elected to receive the deferred account balances after they retire. the defined contribution restoration plan, until it was frozen in 2005, credited eligible employees' deferral accounts with employer contributions to the extent contributions under the qualified savings plan in which the employee participated were subject to limitations imposed by the internal revenue code.

2014 potential payments upon termination or change in control entergy corporation has plans and other arrangements that provide compensation to a named executive officer if his or her employment terminates under specified conditions, including following a change in control of entergy corporation. in addition, entergy corporation has entered into a retention agreement with mr. denault that provides for payments upon certain employment termination events. there are no plans or agreements that would provide for payments to any of the named executive officers solely upon a change in control.
the tables below reflect the amount of compensation each of the named executive officers would have received if his or her employment with an entergy system company had been terminated under various scenarios as of december 31,
2014. for purposes of these tables, entergy corporation assumed that its stock price was $87.48, the closing market price on that date.

pension benefits in addition to the payments and benefits in the table, mr. denault also would have been entitled to receive his vested pension benefits.  if mr. denault's employment were terminated under certain conditions
(2)  relating to a change in control, he would also be eligible for early retirement benefits.  for a description of these benefits, see "2014 pension benefits."  in addition, mr. denault is subject to the following provisions:
mr. denault's retention agreement provides that, unless his employment is terminated for cause, he will be granted an additional 15 years of service under the system executive retirement plan if he continues to work
•  for an entergy system company employer and after age 55, retires with the permission of his employer or his employment is terminated due to death or disability.  if mr. denault's employment is terminated for cause, he will forfeit his benefit under the system executive retirement plan.
under his retention agreement, if mr. denault's employment is terminated by mr. denault for good reason or
•  by entergy corporation not for cause (regardless of whether there is a change in control) or on account of disability, mr. denault would be eligible for subsidized retirement and the additional 15 years of service upon his separation of service even if he does not have permission to separate from employment.
in addition to the payments and benefits in the table, mr. mcdonald and mr. savoff each would have been eligible to retire and entitled to receive his vested pension benefits.  for a description of the pension benefits available see, "2014 pension benefits." in the event of a termination by entergy corporation
(3)  without cause or by the executive for good reason in connection with a change in control, mr. mcdonald and mr. savoff each would be eligible for subsidized early retirement benefits under the system executive retirement plan even if he does not have permission to separate from employment.  if mr. mcdonald's and mr. savoff's
table of contents employment were terminated for cause, he would not receive a benefit under the system executive retirement plan.
in addition to the payments and benefits in the table, if a named executive officer's, other than messrs.
denault, mcdonald, and savoff, employment was terminated under certain conditions relating to a change in control, he or she also would have been entitled to receive his or her vested pension benefits upon
(4)  attainment of age 55 and would have been eligible for early retirement benefits under the system executive retirement plan calculated using early retirement reduction factors.  for a description of the pension benefits, see "2014 pension benefits."  if the named executive officers', other than messrs. denault, mcdonald, and savoff, employment were terminated for cause, he or she would forfeit his or her benefit under the system executive retirement plan.
severance payments in the event of a termination (not due to death or disability) by mr. denault for good reason or by entergy corporation not for cause (regardless of whether there is a change in control), mr. denault would be entitled to receive, pursuant to his retention agreement, a lump sum severance payment equal to the product of 2.99 times the sum of (a) his annual base salary as in effect at any time within one year prior to the effective date of the retention agreement or, if higher, immediately prior to a circumstance
(5)  constituting good reason plus (b) the greater of (i) his actual annual incentive award under the annual incentive plan for the calendar year immediately preceding the calendar year in which mr. denault's termination date occurs or (ii) mr. denault's annual incentive plan target award for the calendar year in which the effective date of the retention agreement occurred.  for purposes of this table, we have calculated the award using a base salary of $1,110,000 and his preceding year's actual annual incentive award, $1,770,720.
in the event of a termination (not due to death or disability) by the executive for good reason or by entergy corporation not for cause during the period beginning upon the occurrence of a "potential change in control" (as defined in the system executive continuity plan) and ending on the 2ndanniversary of a change in control, each named executive officer, other than mr. denault, would be entitled to receive pursuant to the system executive continuity plan a lump sum severance payment equal to the product of for
(6)  mr. marsh, mr. savoff, and mr. west 2.99 times, for mr. may and ms. mount 2 times and mr. fisackerly, mr.
mcdonald, ms. rainer, and mr. rice 1 time the sum of (a) his or her annual base salary as in effect at any time within one year prior to the commencement of a change in control period or, if higher, immediately prior to a circumstance constituting good reason plus (b) his or her annual incentive, calculated using the average annual target opportunity derived under the annual incentive plan for the two calendar years immediately preceding the calendar year in his or her termination occurs. for purposes of this table, it assumes the following target opportunity and base salary:
named executive officer  target opportunity  base salary haley r. fisackerly      40%                    $302,934
mark t. savoff           70%                     644,896
performance units in the event of a termination due to death or disability, by mr. denault for good reason, or by entergy corporation not for cause (in all cases, regardless of whether there is a change in control), mr. denault
(7)  would have forfeited his performance units for all open performance periods and would have been entitled to receive a single-lump sum severance payment pursuant to his retention agreement that would not be based on any outstanding performance periods.  the payment would be calculated using the average annual number of performance
table of contents units he would have been entitled to receive under the performance unit program with respect to the two most recent performance periods preceding the calendar year in which his termination occurs, assuming all performance goals were achieved at target. for purposes of the table, the value of mr. denault's severance payment was calculated by taking an average of the target performance units from the 2010-2012 performance unit program (22,300 units) and the 2011-2013 performance unit program (26,000 units). this average number of units (24,150 units) multiplied by the closing price of entergy stock on december 31, 2014 ($87.48) would equal a severance payment of $2,112,642 for the forfeited performance units.
in the event of mr. denault's retirement not related to a change in control, mr. denault would not have forfeited his performance units for all open performance periods, but rather such performance unit awards would have been pro-rated based on his number of months of participation in each open performance unit program performance cycle.
the amount of the award is based on actual performance achieved, with a stock price set as of the end of the performance period, and payable in the form of a lump sum after the completion of the performance period. for purposes of the table, the value of mr. denault's awards were calculated as follows:
2013 - 2015 plan - 24,770 (24/36*37,156) performance units at target, assuming a stock price of $87.48
2014 - 2016 plan - 13,333 (12/36*40,000) performance units at target, assuming a stock price of $87.48
in the event of a qualifying termination related to a change in control, each named executive officer, other than mr. denault, would have forfeited his or her performance units for the 2013-2015 and 2014-2016
performance periods and would have been entitled to receive, pursuant to the 2011 equity ownership plan, a single-lump sum severance payment that would not be based on any outstanding performance periods.  for
(8)  both the 2013-2015 and the 2014-2016 performance periods, the payment would have been calculated using the average annual number of performance units he or she would have been entitled to receive under each performance unit program with respect to the two most recent performance periods preceding (but not including) the calendar year in which his or her termination occurs, assuming all performance goals were achieved at target multiplied by the closing price of entergy stock on december 31, 2014.
for purposes of the table, the value of the severance payment for mr. fisackerly, mr. mcdonald, ms. rainer and mr.
rice was calculated by taking an average of the target performance units from the 2010-2012 performance unit program (1,000 units) and the 2011-2013 performance unit program (1,200 units). this average number of units
(1,100) multiplied by the closing price of entergy stock on december 31, 2014 ($87.48) would equal a severance payment of for the forfeited performance units equal to $96,228.
the value of severance payment for mr. may and ms. mount was calculated by taking an average of the target performance units from the 2010-2012 performance unit program (2,200 units) and the 2011-2013 performance unit program (2,500 units). this average number of units (2,350) multiplied by the closing price of entergy stock on december 31, 2014 ($87.48) would equal a severance payment of for the forfeited performance units equal to
the value of severance payment for mr. marsh, mr. savoff, and mr. west was calculated by taking an average of the target performance units from the 2010-2012 performance unit program (5,300 units) and the 2011-2013 performance unit program (5,900 units). this average number of units (5,600) multiplied by the closing price of entergy stock on december 31, 2014 ($87.48) would equal a severance payment of for the forfeited performance units equal to
in the event of death or disability, or retirement in the case of mr. mcdonald or mr. savoff, each named executive officer, other than mr. denault, would not have forfeited his performance units for all open performance periods, but rather such performance unit awards would have been pro-rated based on his or her number of months of participation in each open performance unit program performance cycle, in accordance with his or her grant agreement under the performance unit program. the amount of the award is based on actual performance achieved, with a stock price set as of the end of the performance period, and payable in the form of a lump sum after the completion of the performance period. for purposes of the table, the value of the awards were calculated as follows:
table of contents mr. fisackerly's, mr. mcdonald's, ms. rainer's and mr. rice's awards:
2013 - 2015 plan - 1,267 (24/36*1,900) performance units at target, assuming a stock price of $87.48

under certain circumstances described below, the payments and benefits received by a named executive officer pursuant to the system executive continuity plan may be forfeited and, in certain cases, subject to repayment.
benefits are no longer payable under the system executive continuity plan, and unvested performance units under the performance unit program are subject to forfeiture, if the executive:

termination for cause if a named executive officer's employment is terminated for "cause" (as defined in the system executive continuity plan and described above under "termination related to a change in control"), he or she is generally entitled to the same compensation and separation benefits described below under "voluntary resignation," except that all options are no longer exercisable.
voluntary resignation if a named executive officer voluntarily resigns from his or her entergy system company employer, he or she is entitled to all accrued benefits and compensation as of the separation date, including qualified pension benefits
(if any) and other post-employment benefits on terms consistent with those generally available to other salaried employees. in the case of voluntary resignation, the officer would forfeit all unvested stock options, shares of restricted stock, and restricted units as well as any perquisites to which he or she is entitled as an officer. in addition, the officer would forfeit, except as described below, his or her right to receive incentive payments under any outstanding performance periods under the long-term performance unit program or the annual incentive plan. if the officer resigns after the completion of an annual incentive plan or long-term performance unit program performance period, he or she could receive a payout under the long-term performance unit program based on the outcome of the
table of contents performance cycle and could, at the entergy corporation's discretion, receive an annual incentive payment under the annual incentive plan. any vested stock options held by the officer as of the separation date will expire the earlier of ten years from date of grant or 90 days from the last day of active employment.

table of contents entergy audit committee guidelines for pre-approval of independent auditor services the audit committee has adopted the following guidelines regarding the engagement of entergy's independent auditor to perform services for entergy:
the independent auditor will provide the audit committee, for approval, an annual engagement letter
1.  outlining the scope of services proposed to be performed during the fiscal year, including audit services and other permissible non-audit services (e.g. audit-related services, tax services, and all other services).
for other permissible services not included in the engagement letter, entergy management will submit a description of the proposed service, including a budget estimate, to the audit committee for pre-approval.
2.  management and the independent auditor must agree that the requested service is consistent with the sec's rules on auditor independence prior to submission to the audit committee.  the audit committee, at its discretion, will pre-approve permissible services and has established the following additional guidelines for permissible non-audit services provided by the independent auditor:
•  aggregate non-audit service fees are targeted at fifty percent or less of the approved audit service fee.
•  all other services should only be provided by the independent auditor if it is the only qualified provider of that service or if the audit committee specifically requests the service.
3.  the audit committee will be informed quarterly as to the status of pre-approved services actually provided by the independent auditor.
to ensure prompt handling of unexpected matters, the audit committee delegates to the audit committee chair
4.  or its designee the authority to approve permissible services and fees.  the audit committee chair or designee will report action taken to the audit committee at the next scheduled audit committee meeting.

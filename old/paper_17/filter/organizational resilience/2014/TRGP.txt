item 1a.   risk factors.
the nature of our business activities subjects us to certain hazards and risks. you should consider carefully the following risk factors together with all of the other information contained in this report. if any of the following risks were actually to occur, then our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.
risks related to our business our cash flow is dependent upon the ability of the partnership to make cash distributions to us.
our cash flow consists entirely of cash distributions from the partnership. the amount of cash that the partnership will be able to distribute to its partners, including us, each quarter principally depends upon the amount of cash it generates from its business. for a description of certain factors that can cause fluctuations in the amount of cash that the partnership generates from its business, please read "-risks inherent in the partnership's business" and "management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations-factors that significantly affect our results." the partnership may not have sufficient available cash each quarter to continue paying distributions at their current level or at all. if the partnership reduces its per unit distribution, because of reduced operating cash flow, higher expenses, capital requirements or otherwise, we will have less cash available to pay dividends to our stockholders and would probably be required to reduce the dividend per share of common stock. the amount of cash the partnership has available for distribution depends primarily upon the partnership's cash flow, including cash flow from the release of reserves as well as borrowings, and is not solely a function of profitability, which will be affected by non-cash items. as a result, the partnership may make cash distributions during periods when it records losses and may not make cash distributions during periods when it records profits.
once we receive cash from the partnership and the general partner, our ability to distribute the cash received to our stockholders is limited by a number of factors, including:
•   our obligation to satisfy tax obligations associated with previous sales of assets to the partnership;
•   restrictions on distributions contained in any existing or future debt agreements;
•   our general and administrative expenses, including expenses we incur as a result of being a public company as well as other operating expenses;
•   expenses of the general partner;
•   reserves we establish in order for us to maintain our 2% general partner interest in the partnership upon the issuance of additional partnership securities by the partnership; and
•   reserves our board of directors establishes for the proper conduct of our business, to comply with applicable law or any agreement binding on us or our subsidiaries or to provide for future dividends by us.
the actual amount of cash that is available for dividends to our stockholders will depend on numerous factors, many of which are beyond our control.
a reduction in the partnership's distributions will disproportionately affect the amount of cash distributions to which we are entitled.
our ownership of the idrs in the partnership entitles us to receive specified percentages of the amount of cash distributions made by the partnership to its limited partners only in the event that the partnership distributes more than $0.3881 per unit for such quarter. as a result, the holders of the partnership's common units have a priority over our idrs to the extent of cash distributions by the partnership up to and including $0.3881 per unit for any quarter.
our idrs entitle us to receive increasing percentages, up to 48%, of all cash distributed by the partnership. because the partnership's distribution rate is currently above the maximum target cash distribution level on the idrs, future growth in distributions we receive from the partnership will not result from an increase in the target cash distribution level associated with the idrs. furthermore, a decrease in the amount of distributions by the partnership to less than $0.50625 per unit per quarter would reduce the general partner's percentage of the incremental cash distributions above $0.3881 per common unit per quarter from 48% to 23%. as a result, any such reduction in quarterly cash distributions from the partnership would have the effect of disproportionately reducing the distributions that we receive from the partnership based on our idrs as compared to distributions we receive from the partnership with respect to our 2% general partner interest and our common units.
we currently manage our investment in the partnership through our ownership interest in the general partner. the partnership's partnership agreement, however, gives unitholders of the partnership the right to remove the general partner upon the affirmative vote of holders of 662⁄3% of the partnership's outstanding units. if the general partner were removed as general partner of the partnership, it would receive cash or common units in exchange for its 2% general partner interest and the idrs and would also lose its ability to manage the partnership. while the cash or common units the general partner would receive are intended under the terms of the partnership's partnership agreement to fully compensate us in the event such an exchange is required, the value of the investments we make with the cash or the common units may not over time be equivalent to the value of the general partner interest and the idrs had the general partner retained them.
in addition, if the general partner is removed as general partner of the partnership, we would face an increased risk of being deemed an investment company. please read "-if in the future we cease to manage and control the partnership, we may be deemed to be an investment company under the investment company act of 1940."
the partnership, without our stockholders' consent, may issue additional common units or other equity securities, which may increase the risk that the partnership will not have sufficient available cash to maintain or increase its cash distribution level per common unit.
because the partnership distributes to its partners most of the cash generated by its operations, it relies primarily upon external financing sources, including debt and equity issuances, to fund its acquisitions and expansion capital expenditures. accordingly, the partnership has wide latitude to issue additional common units on the terms and conditions established by its general partner. we receive cash distributions from the partnership on the general partner interest, idrs and common units that we own. because a significant portion of the cash we receive from the partnership is attributable to our ownership of the idrs, payment of distributions on additional partnership common units may increase the risk that the partnership will be unable to maintain or increase its quarterly cash distribution per unit, which in turn may reduce the amount of distributions we receive attributable to our common units, general partner interest and idrs and the available cash that we have to pay as dividends to our stockholders.
the general partner, with our consent but without the consent of our stockholders, may limit or modify the incentive distributions we are entitled to receive, which may reduce cash dividends to you.
we own the general partner, which owns the idrs in the partnership that entitle us to receive increasing percentages, up to a maximum of 48% of any cash distributed by the partnership as certain target distribution levels are reached in excess of $0.3881 per common unit in any quarter. a substantial portion of the cash flow we receive from the partnership is provided by these idrs. because of the high percentage of the partnership's incremental cash flow that is distributed to the idrs, certain potential acquisitions might not increase cash available for distribution per partnership unit. in order to facilitate acquisitions by the partnership or for other reasons, the board of directors of the general partner may elect to reduce the idrs payable to us with our consent. these reductions may be permanent reductions in the idrs or may be reductions with respect to cash flows from the potential acquisition. if distributions on the idrs were reduced for the benefit of the partnership units, the total amount of cash distributions we would receive from the partnership, and therefore the amount of cash dividends we could pay to our stockholders, would be reduced.
in the future, we may not have sufficient cash to pay estimated dividends.
because our only source of operating cash flow consists of cash distributions from the partnership, the amount of dividends we are able to pay to our stockholders may fluctuate based on the level of distributions the partnership makes to its partners, including us. the partnership may not continue to make quarterly distributions at the 2014 fourth quarter distribution level of $ 0.81000 per common unit, or may not distribute any other amount, or increase its quarterly distributions in the future. in addition, while we would expect to increase or decrease dividends to our stockholders if the partnership increases or decreases distributions to us, the timing and amount of such changes in distributions, if any, will not necessarily be comparable to the timing and amount of any changes in dividends made by us. factors such as reserves established by our board of directors for our estimated general and administrative expenses as well as other operating expenses, reserves to satisfy our debt service requirements, if any, and reserves for future dividends by us may affect the dividends we make to our stockholders. the actual amount of cash that is available for dividends to our stockholders will depend on numerous factors, many of which are beyond our control.
because we plan on distributing a substantial amount of our cash flow, our growth may not be as fast as the growth of businesses that reinvest their available cash to expand ongoing operations. in fact, because currently our only cash-generating assets are common units and general partner interests in the partnership, our growth will be substantially dependent upon the partnership. if we issue additional shares of common stock or we incur debt, the payment of dividends on those additional shares or interest on that debt could increase the risk that we will be unable to maintain or increase our cash dividend levels.
our rate of growth may be reduced to the extent we purchase additional units from the partnership, which will reduce the relative percentage of the cash we receive from the idrs.
our business strategy includes, where appropriate, supporting the growth of the partnership by purchasing the partnership's units or lending funds or providing other forms of financial support to the partnership to provide funding for the acquisition of a business or asset or for a growth project. to the extent we purchase common units or securities not entitled to a current distribution from the partnership, the rate of our distribution growth may be reduced, at least in the short term, as less of our cash distributions will come from our ownership of idrs, whose distributions increase at a faster rate than those of our other ownership interests.
we have a credit facility that contains various restrictions on our ability to pay dividends to our stockholders, borrow additional funds or capitalize on business opportunities.
we have a credit facility that contains various operating and financial restrictions and covenants. our ability to comply with these restrictions and covenants may be affected by events beyond our control, including prevailing economic, financial and industry conditions. if we are unable to comply with these restrictions and covenants, any future indebtedness under this credit facility may become immediately due and payable and our lenders' commitments to make further loans to us may terminate. we might not have, or be able to obtain, sufficient funds to make these accelerated payments.
our credit facility limits our ability to pay dividends to our stockholders during an event of default or if an event of default would result from such dividend. in addition, any future borrowings may:
•   adversely affect our ability to obtain additional financing for future operations or capital needs;
•   limit our ability to pursue acquisitions and other business opportunities;
•   make our results of operations more susceptible to adverse economic or operating conditions; or
our payment of any principal and interest will reduce our cash available for dividends to our stockholders. in addition, we are able to incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future. if we incur additional debt, the risks associated with our leverage would increase. for more information regarding our credit facility, please see note 10 of the "consolidated financial statements" beginning on page f-1 in this form 10-k.
if dividends on our shares of common stock are not paid with respect to any fiscal quarter, our stockholders will not be entitled to receive that quarter's payments in the future.
dividends to our stockholders are not cumulative. consequently, if dividends on our shares of common stock are not paid with respect to any fiscal quarter, our stockholders will not be entitled to receive that quarter's payments in the future.
the partnership's practice of distributing all of its available cash may limit its ability to grow, which could impact distributions to us and the available cash that we have to dividend to our stockholders.
because currently our only cash-generating assets are common units and general partner interests in the partnership, including the idrs, our growth will be dependent upon the partnership's ability to increase its quarterly cash distributions. the partnership has historically distributed to its partners most of the cash generated by its operations. as a result, it relies primarily upon external financing sources, including debt and equity issuances, to fund its acquisitions and expansion capital expenditures. accordingly, to the extent the partnership is unable to finance growth externally; its ability to grow will be impaired because it distributes substantially all of its available cash. also, if the partnership incurs additional indebtedness to finance its growth, the increased interest expense associated with such indebtedness may reduce the amount of available cash that the partnership distributes to us, which in turn may reduce the amount of available cash that we can distribute to our stockholders. in addition, to the extent the partnership issues additional common units in connection with any acquisitions or growth capital expenditures, the payment of distributions on those additional common units may increase the risk that the partnership will be unable to maintain or increase its per unit distribution level, which in turn may impact the cash available for dividends to our stockholders.
the trp revolver and indentures contain covenants limiting its ability to incur indebtedness, grant liens, engage in transactions with affiliates and make distributions. the trp revolver also contains covenants requiring the partnership to maintain certain financial ratios. the partnership is prohibited from making any distribution to unitholders if such distribution would cause an event of default or otherwise violate a covenant under the trp revolver or the indentures, which in turn may impact the cash available for dividends to our stockholders.
if in the future we cease to manage and control the partnership, we may be deemed to be an investment company under the investment company act of 1940.
if we cease to manage and control the partnership and are deemed to be an investment company under the investment company act of 1940, we would either have to register as an investment company under the investment company act of 1940, obtain exemptive relief from the sec or modify our organizational structure or our contractual rights to fall outside the definition of an investment company. registering as an investment company could, among other things, materially limit our ability to engage in transactions with affiliates, including the purchase and sale of certain securities or other property to or from our affiliates, restrict our ability to borrow funds or engage in other transactions involving leverage and require us to add additional directors who are independent of us and our affiliates, and adversely affect the price of our common stock.
if we lose any of our named executive officers, our business may be adversely affected.
our success is dependent upon the efforts of the named executive officers. our named executive officers are responsible for executing our and the partnership's business strategies and, when appropriate to our primary business objective, facilitating the partnership's growth through various forms of financial support provided by us, including, but not limited to, modifying the partnership's idrs, exercising the partnership's idr reset provision contained in its partnership agreement, making loans, making capital contributions in exchange for yielding or non-yielding equity interests or providing other financial support to the partnership. there is substantial competition for qualified personnel in the midstream natural gas industry. we may not be able to retain our existing named executive officers or fill new positions or vacancies created by expansion or turnover. we have not entered into employment agreements with any of our named executive officers. in addition, we do not maintain "key man" life insurance on the lives of any of our named executive officers. a loss of one or more of our named executive officers could harm our and the partnership's business and prevent us from implementing our and the partnership's business strategies.
if we fail to maintain an effective system of internal controls, we may not be able to accurately report our financial results or prevent fraud. in addition, potential changes in accounting standards might cause us to revise our financial results and disclosure in the future.
effective internal controls are necessary for us to provide timely and reliable financial reports and effectively prevent fraud. if we cannot provide timely and reliable financial reports or prevent fraud, our reputation and operating results would be harmed. we continue to enhance our internal controls and financial reporting capabilities. these enhancements require a significant commitment of resources, personnel and the development and maintenance of formalized internal reporting procedures to ensure the reliability of our financial reporting. our efforts to update and maintain our internal controls may not be successful, and we may be unable to maintain adequate controls over our financial processes and reporting in the future, including future compliance with the obligations under section 404 of the sarbanes-oxley act of 2002. any failure to maintain effective controls or difficulties encountered in the effective improvement of our internal controls could prevent us from timely and reliably reporting our financial results and may harm our operating results. ineffective internal controls could also cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information. in addition, the financial accounting standards board or the sec could enact new accounting standards that might impact how we or the partnership are required to record revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities. any significant change in accounting standards or disclosure requirements could have a material effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and ability to comply with our and the partnership's debt obligations.
an increase in interest rates may cause the market price of our common stock to decline.
like all equity investments, an investment in our common stock is subject to certain risks. in exchange for accepting these risks, investors may expect to receive a higher rate of return than would otherwise be obtainable from lower-risk investments. accordingly, as interest rates rise, the ability of investors to obtain higher risk-adjusted rates of return by purchasing government-backed debt securities may cause a corresponding decline in demand for riskier investments generally, including yield-based equity investments. reduced demand for our common stock resulting from investors seeking other more favorable investment opportunities may cause the trading price of our common stock to decline.
future sales of our common stock in the public market could lower our stock price, and any additional capital raised by us through the sale of equity or convertible securities may dilute your ownership in us.
we or our stockholders may sell shares of common stock in subsequent public offerings. we may also issue additional shares of common stock or convertible securities. as of december 31, 2014, we have 42,143,463 outstanding shares of common stock. certain of our existing stockholders, including our executive officers, and certain of our directors are party to a registration rights agreement with us which requires us to affect the registration of their shares in certain circumstances no earlier than the expiration of the lock-up period contained in the underwriting agreement of our initial public offering.
we cannot predict the size of future issuances of our common stock or the effect, if any, that future issuances and sales of shares of our common stock will have on the market price of our common stock. sales of substantial amounts of our common stock (including shares issued in connection with an acquisition), or the perception that such sales could occur, may adversely affect prevailing market prices of our common stock.
our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws, as well as delaware law, contain provisions that could discourage acquisition bids or merger proposals, which may adversely affect the market price of our common stock.
our amended and restated certificate of incorporation authorizes our board of directors to issue preferred stock without stockholder approval. if our board of directors elects to issue preferred stock, it could be more difficult for a third-party to acquire us. in addition, some provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws could make it more difficult for a third-party to acquire control of us, even if the change of control would be beneficial to our stockholders, including provisions which require:
•   a classified board of directors, so that only approximately one-third of our directors are elected each year;
•   limitations on the removal of directors; and
•   limitations on the ability of our stockholders to call special meetings and establish advance notice provisions for stockholder proposals and nominations for elections to the board of directors to be acted upon at meetings of stockholders.
delaware law prohibits us from engaging in any business combination with any "interested stockholder," meaning generally that a stockholder who beneficially owns more than 15% of our stock cannot acquire us for a period of three years from the date this person became an interested stockholder, unless various conditions are met, such as approval of the transaction by our board of directors. please read "description of our capital stock-anti-takeover effects of provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, our amended and restated bylaws and delaware law."
the duties of our officers and directors may conflict with those owed to the partnership and these officers and directors may face conflicts of interest in the allocation of administrative time among our business and the partnership's business.
substantially all of our officers and certain members of our board of directors are officers and/or directors of the general partner and, as a result, have separate duties that govern their management of the partnership's business. these officers and directors may encounter situations in which their obligations to us, on the one hand, and the partnership, on the other hand, are in conflict. the resolution of these conflicts may not always be in our best interest or that of our stockholders.
in addition, our officers who also serve as officers of the general partner may face conflicts in allocating their time spent on our behalf and on behalf of the partnership. these time allocations may adversely affect our or the partnership's results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. for a discussion of our officers and directors that will serve in the same capacity for the general partner and the amount of time we expect them to devote to our business, please read "management."
risks inherent in the partnership's business because we are directly dependent on the distributions we receive from the partnership, risks to the partnership's operations are also risks to us. we have set forth below risks to the partnership's business and operations, the occurrence of which could negatively impact the partnership's financial performance and decrease the amount of cash it is able to distribute to us.
the partnership has a substantial amount of indebtedness which may adversely affect its financial position.
the partnership has a substantial amount of indebtedness. as of december 31, 2014, the partnership had $2,808.6 million outstanding under its senior unsecured notes, excluding $25.2 million in unamortized discounts. the partnership also had $182.8 million outstanding under its accounts receivable securitization facility (the "securitization facility"). in addition, the partnership had $0 million of borrowings outstanding, $41.7 million of letters of credit outstanding and $1,155.9 million of additional borrowing capacity available under the trp revolver. the $1.2 billion trp revolver allows it to request increases in commitments up to an additional $300 million. for the years ended december 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, the partnership's consolidated interest expense was $143.8 million, $131.0 million and $116.8 million, respectively. in addition, the partnership expects that its indebtedness will increase following the closing of the atlas mergers. for example, as of january 31, 2015, on a pro forma as adjusted basis to give effect to certain atlas merger-related items set forth under "item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations-liquidity and capital resources," the partnership would have had $867.7 million of borrowings outstanding, $41.7 million of letters of credit outstanding and $568.5 million of additional borrowing capacity available under the trp revolver.
this substantial level of indebtedness increases the possibility that the partnership may be unable to generate cash sufficient to pay, when due, the principal of, interest on or other amounts due in respect of indebtedness. this substantial indebtedness, combined with lease and other financial obligations and contractual commitments, could have other important consequences to the partnership, including the following:
•   its ability to obtain additional financing, if necessary, for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions or other purposes may be impaired or such financing may not be available on favorable terms;
•   satisfying its obligations with respect to indebtedness may be more difficult and any failure to comply with the obligations of any debt instruments could result in an event of default under the agreements governing such indebtedness;
•   the partnership will need a portion of cash flow to make interest payments on debt, reducing the funds that would otherwise be available for operations and future business opportunities;
•   the partnership's debt level will make it more vulnerable to competitive pressures or a downturn in its business or the economy generally; and
•   the partnership's debt level may limit flexibility in planning for, or responding to, changing business and economic conditions.
the partnership's ability to service its debt will depend upon, among other things, its future financial and operating performance, which will be affected by prevailing economic conditions and financial, business, regulatory and other factors, some of which are beyond its control. if the partnership's operating results are not sufficient to service its current or future indebtedness, it will be forced to take actions such as reducing or delaying business activities, acquisitions, investments or capital expenditures, selling assets, restructuring or refinancing debt, or seeking additional equity capital, and such results may be adversely affect our ability to make cash distributions. the partnership may not be able to affect any of these actions on satisfactory terms, or at all.
increases in interest rates could adversely affect the partnership's business.
the partnership has significant exposure to increases in interest rates. as of december 31, 2014, its total indebtedness was $2,991.4 million, excluding $25.2 million in unamortized discounts, of which $2,808.6 million was at fixed interest rates and $182.8 million was at variable interest rates. a one percentage point increase in the interest rate on the partnership's variable interest rate debt would have increased its consolidated annual interest expense by approximately $1.8 million. as a result of this amount of variable interest rate debt, the partnership's financial condition could be adversely affected by increases in interest rates.
despite current indebtedness levels, the partnership may still be able to incur substantially more debt. this could increase the risks associated with the partnership's substantial leverage.
the partnership may be able to incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future. as of december 31, 2014, the partnership had $182.8 million of borrowings outstanding under its securitization facility. in addition, the partnership had $0 million of borrowings outstanding, $44.1 million of letters of credit outstanding and $1,155.9 million of additional borrowing capacity available under the trp revolver. in addition, the partnership expects that its indebtedness will increase following the closing of the atlas mergers. for example, as of january 31, 2015, on a pro forma as adjusted basis to give effect to certain atlas merger-related items set forth under "item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations-liquidity and capital resources," the partnership would have had $867.7 million of borrowings outstanding, $41.7 million of letters of credit outstanding and $526.8 million of additional borrowing capacity available under the trp revolver. the partnership may be able to increase the borrowing capacity under the trp revolver by an additional $300 million if the partnership requests and is able to obtain commitments from lenders for such additional amounts. although the trp revolver contains restrictions on the incurrence of additional indebtedness, these restrictions are subject to a number of significant qualifications and exceptions, and any indebtedness incurred in compliance with these restrictions could be substantial. if the partnership incurs additional debt, the risks associated with its substantial leverage would increase.
the terms of the trp revolver and indentures may restrict its current and future operations, particularly its ability to respond to changes in business or to take certain actions.
the credit agreement governing the trp revolver, the agreements governing the securitization facility and the indentures governing the partnership's senior notes contain, and any future indebtedness the partnership incurs will likely contain, a number of restrictive covenants that impose significant operating and financial restrictions, including restrictions on its ability to engage in acts that may be in its best long-term interests. these agreements include covenants that, among other things, restrict the partnership's ability to:
•   create restrictions on the payment of distributions to its equity holders;
•   sell or transfer assets, including equity securities of its subsidiaries;
•   prepay, redeem and repurchase certain debt, other than loans under the trp revolver;
•   change business activities conducted by it.
in addition, the trp revolver requires the partnership to satisfy and maintain specified financial ratios and other financial condition tests. the partnership's ability to meet those financial ratios and tests can be affected by events beyond its control, and we cannot assure you that the partnership will meet those ratios and tests.
a breach of any of these covenants could result in an event of default under the trp revolver, the indentures, or the securitization facility, as applicable. upon the occurrence of such an event of default, all amounts outstanding under the applicable debt agreements could be declared to be immediately due and payable and all applicable commitments to extend further credit could be terminated. if the partnership is unable to repay the accelerated debt under the trp revolver, the lenders under the trp revolver could proceed against the collateral granted to them to secure that indebtedness. if the partnership is unable to repay the accelerated debt under the securitization facility, the lenders under the securitization facility could proceed against the collateral granted to them to secure the indebtedness. the partnership has pledged substantially all of its assets as collateral under the trp revolver and the accounts receivables of targa receivables llc under the securitization facility. if the indebtedness under the trp revolver, the indentures, or the securitization facility is accelerated, we cannot assure you that the partnership will have sufficient assets to repay the indebtedness. the operating and financial restrictions and covenants in these debt agreements and any future financing agreements may adversely affect the partnership's ability to finance future operations or capital needs or to engage in other business activities.
the partnership's cash flow is affected by supply and demand for natural gas and ngl products and by natural gas, ngl, crude oil and condensate prices, and decreases in these prices could adversely affect its results of operations and financial condition.
the partnership's operations can be affected by the level of natural gas and ngl prices and the relationship between these prices. the prices of crude oil, natural gas and ngls have been volatile and we expect this volatility to continue. the partnership's future cash flow may be materially adversely affected if it experiences significant, prolonged price deterioration. the markets and prices for natural gas and ngls depend upon factors beyond the partnership's control. these factors include demand for these commodities, which fluctuates with changes in market and economic conditions, and other factors, including:
•   the impact of seasonality and weather;
•   general economic conditions and economic conditions impacting the partnership's primary markets;
•   the economic conditions of the partnership's customers;
•   the level of domestic crude oil and natural gas production and consumption;
•   the availability of imported natural gas, liquefied natural gas, ngls and crude oil;
•   the availability of local, intrastate and interstate transportation systems and storage for residue natural gas and ngls;
•   the availability and marketing of competitive fuels and/or feedstocks;
•   the impact of energy conservation efforts; and
•   the extent of governmental regulation and taxation.
the partnership's primary natural gas gathering and processing arrangements that expose it to commodity price risk are its percent-of-proceeds arrangements. for the years ended december 31, 2014 and 2013, the partnership's percent-of-proceeds arrangements accounted for approximately 51% and 48%, respectively, of its gathered natural gas volume. under these arrangements, the partnership generally processes natural gas from producers and remits to the producers an agreed percentage of the proceeds from the sale of residue gas and ngl products at market prices or a percentage of residue gas and ngl products at the tailgate of the partnership's processing facilities. in some percent-of-proceeds arrangements, the partnership remits to the producer a percentage of an index-based price for residue gas and ngl products, less agreed adjustments, rather than remitting a portion of the actual sales proceeds. under these types of arrangements, the partnership's revenues and cash flows increase or decrease, whichever is applicable, as the prices of natural gas, ngls and crude oil fluctuates. please see "item 7a. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk."
because of the natural decline in production in the partnership's operating regions and in other regions from which it sources ngl supplies, its long-term success depends on its ability to obtain new sources of supplies of natural gas, ngls and crude oil which depends on certain factors beyond its control. any decrease in supplies of natural gas, ngls or crude oil could adversely affect the partnership's business and operating results.
the partnership's gathering systems are connected to crude oil and natural gas wells from which production will naturally decline over time, which means that the cash flows associated with these sources of natural gas and crude oil will likely also decline over time. the partnership's logistics assets are similarly impacted by declines in ngl supplies in the regions in which it operates as well as other regions from which it sources ngls. to maintain or increase throughput levels on the partnership's gathering systems and the utilization rate at its processing plants and it's treating and fractionation facilities, the partnership must continually obtain new natural gas, ngl and crude oil supplies. a material decrease in natural gas or crude oil production from producing areas on which the partnership relies, as a result of depressed commodity prices or otherwise, could result in a decline in the volume of natural gas or crude oil that it processes, ngl products delivered to its fractionation facilities or crude oil that the partnership gathers. the partnership's ability to obtain additional sources of natural gas, ngls and crude oil depends, in part, on the level of successful drilling and production activity near its gathering systems and, in part, on the level of successful drilling and production in other areas from which it sources ngl and crude oil supplies. the partnership has no control over the level of such activity in the areas of its operations, the amount of reserves associated with the wells or the rate at which production from a well will decline. in addition, the partnership has no control over producers or their drilling or production decisions, which are affected by, among other things, prevailing and projected energy prices, demand for hydrocarbons, the level of reserves, geological considerations, governmental regulations, the availability of drilling rigs, other production and development costs and the availability and cost of capital.
fluctuations in energy prices can greatly affect production rates and investments by third parties in the development of new oil and natural gas reserves. drilling and production activity generally decreases as crude oil and natural gas prices decrease. prices of crude oil and natural gas have been historically volatile, and we expect this volatility to continue. consequently, even if new natural gas or crude oil reserves are discovered in areas served by the partnership's assets, producers may choose not to develop those reserves. for example, current low prices for natural gas combined with relatively high levels of natural gas in storage could result in curtailment or shut-in of natural gas production. reductions in exploration and production activity, competitor actions or shut-ins by producers in the areas in which the partnership operates may prevent it from obtaining supplies of natural gas or crude oil to replace the natural decline in volumes from existing wells, which could result in reduced volumes through its facilities and reduced utilization of its gathering, treating, processing and fractionation assets.
if the partnership does not make acquisitions or develop growth projects for expanding existing assets or constructing new midstream assets on economically acceptable terms or fails to efficiently and effectively integrate acquired or developed assets with its asset base, its future growth will be limited. in addition, any acquisitions the partnership completes are subject to substantial risks that could adversely affect its financial condition and results of operations and reduce its ability to make distributions to unitholders.
the partnership's ability to grow depends, in part, on its ability to make acquisitions or develop growth projects that result in an increase in cash generated from operations per unit. the partnership is unable to acquire businesses from us in order to grow because our only assets are the interests in the partnership that we own. as a result, the partnership will need to focus on third-party acquisitions and organic growth. if the partnership is unable to make accretive acquisitions or develop accretive growth projects because it is (1) unable to identify attractive acquisition candidates and negotiate acceptable acquisition agreements or develop growth projects economically, (2) unable to obtain financing for these acquisitions or projects on economically acceptable terms, or (3) unable to compete successfully for acquisitions or growth projects, then the partnership's future growth and ability to increase distributions will be limited.
any acquisition or growth project involves potential risks, including, among other things:
•   operating a significantly larger combined organization and adding new or expanded operations;
•   difficulties in the assimilation of the assets and operations of the acquired businesses or growth projects, especially if the assets acquired are in a new business segment and/or geographic area;
•   the risk that crude oil and natural gas reserves expected to support the acquired assets may not be of the anticipated magnitude or may not be developed as anticipated;
•   the failure to realize expected volumes, revenues, profitability or growth;
•   coordinating geographically disparate organizations, systems and facilities;
•   the assumption of environmental and other unknown liabilities;
•   limitations on rights to indemnity from the seller in an acquisition or the contractors and suppliers in growth projects;
•   the failure to attain or maintain compliance with environmental and other governmental regulations;
•   inaccurate assumptions about the overall costs of equity or debt;
•   the diversion of management's and employees' attention from other business concerns; and
•   customer or key employee losses at the acquired businesses or to a competitor.
if these risks materialize, any acquired assets or growth project may inhibit the partnership's growth, fail to deliver expected benefits and/or add further unexpected costs. challenges may arise whenever businesses with different operations or management are combined, and the partnership may experience unanticipated delays in realizing the benefits of an acquisition or growth project. if the partnership consummates any future acquisition or growth project, its capitalization and results of operations may change significantly and you may not have the opportunity to evaluate the economic, financial and other relevant information that the partnership will consider in evaluating future acquisitions or growth projects.
the partnership's acquisition and growth strategy is based, in part, on its expectation of ongoing divestitures of energy assets by industry participants and new opportunities created by industry expansion. a material decrease in such divestitures or in opportunities for economic commercial expansion would limit the partnership's opportunities for future acquisitions or growth projects and could adversely affect its operations and cash flows available for distribution to its unitholders.
acquisitions may significantly increase the partnership's size and diversify the geographic areas in which it operates and growth projects may increase its concentration in a line of business or geographic region. the partnership may not achieve the desired effect from any future acquisitions or growth projects.
the partnership's expansion or modification of existing assets or the construction of new assets may not result in revenue increases and is subject to regulatory, environmental, political, legal and economic risks, which could adversely affect its results of operations and financial condition.
the construction of additions or modifications to the partnership's existing systems and the construction of new midstream assets involve numerous regulatory, environmental, political and legal uncertainties beyond its control and may require the expenditure of significant amounts of capital. if the partnership undertakes these projects, they may not be completed on schedule or at the budgeted cost or at all. moreover, the partnership's revenues may not increase immediately upon the expenditure of funds on a particular project. for instance, if the partnership builds a new fractionation facility or gas processing plant, the construction may occur over an extended period of time and the partnership will not receive any material increases in revenues until the project is completed. moreover, the partnership may construct facilities to capture anticipated future growth in production in a region in which such growth does not materialize. since the partnership is not engaged in the exploration for and development of natural gas and oil reserves, it does not possess reserve expertise and it often does not have access to third-party estimates of potential reserves in an area prior to constructing facilities in such area. to the extent the partnership relies on estimates of future production in any decision to construct additions to its systems, such estimates may prove to be inaccurate because there are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of future production. as a result, new facilities may not be able to attract enough throughput to achieve the partnership's expected investment return, which could adversely affect its results of operations and financial condition. in addition, the construction of additions to the partnership's existing gathering and transportation assets may require it to obtain new rights-of-way prior to constructing new pipelines. the partnership may be unable to obtain such rights-of-way to connect new natural gas supplies to its existing gathering lines or capitalize on other attractive expansion opportunities. additionally, it may become more expensive for the partnership to obtain new rights-of-way or to renew existing rights-of-way. if the cost of renewing or obtaining new rights-of-way increases, the partnership's cash flows could be adversely affected.
the partnership's acquisition and growth strategy requires access to new capital. tightened capital markets or increased competition for investment opportunities could impair the partnership's ability to grow through acquisitions or growth projects.
the partnership continuously considers and enters into discussions regarding potential acquisitions and growth projects. any limitations on the partnership's access to capital will impair its ability to execute this strategy. if the cost of such capital becomes too expensive, the partnership's ability to develop or acquire strategic and accretive assets will be limited. the partnership may not be able to raise the necessary funds on satisfactory terms, if at all. the primary factors that influence the partnership's initial cost of equity include market conditions, fees it pays to underwriters and other offering costs, which include amounts it pays for legal and accounting services. the primary factors influencing the partnership's cost of borrowing include interest rates, credit spreads, covenants, underwriting or loan origination fees and similar charges it pays to lenders. these factors may impair the partnership's ability to execute its acquisition and growth strategy.
in addition, the partnership is experiencing increased competition for the types of assets it contemplates purchasing or developing. current economic conditions and competition for asset purchases and development opportunities could limit its ability to fully execute its acquisition and growth strategy.
demand for propane is significantly impacted by weather conditions and therefore seasonal, and requires increases in inventory to meet seasonal demand.
weather conditions have a significant impact on the demand for propane because end-users principally utilize propane for heating purposes. warmer-than-normal temperatures in one or more regions in which the partnership operates can significantly decrease the total volume of propane it sells. lack of consumer demand for propane may also adversely affect the retailers with which the partnership transacts its wholesale propane marketing operations, exposing the partnership to retailers' inability to satisfy their contractual obligations to the partnership.
if the partnership fails to balance its purchases of natural gas and its sales of residue gas and ngls, its exposure to commodity price risk will increase.
the partnership may not be successful in balancing its purchases of natural gas and its sales of residue gas and ngls. in addition, a producer could fail to deliver promised volumes to the partnership or deliver in excess of contracted volumes, or a purchaser could purchase less than contracted volumes. any of these actions could cause an imbalance between the partnership's purchases and sales. if the partnership's purchases and sales are not balanced, it will face increased exposure to commodity price risks and could have increased volatility in its operating income.
the partnership's hedging activities may not be effective in reducing the variability of its cash flows and may, in certain circumstances, increase the variability of its cash flows. moreover, the partnership's hedges may not fully protect it against volatility in basis differentials. finally, the percentage of the partnership's expected equity commodity volumes that are hedged decreases substantially over time.
the partnership has entered into derivative transactions related to only a portion of its equity volumes. as a result, it will continue to have direct commodity price risk to the unhedged portion. the partnership's actual future volumes may be significantly higher or lower than it estimated at the time it entered into the derivative transactions for that period. if the actual amount is higher than the partnership estimated, it will have greater commodity price risk than it intended. if the actual amount is lower than the amount that is subject to its derivative financial instruments, the partnership might be forced to satisfy all or a portion of its derivative transactions without the benefit of the cash flow from its sale of the underlying physical commodity. the percentages of the partnership's expected equity volumes that are covered by its hedges decrease over time. to the extent the partnership hedges its commodity price risk, it may forego the benefits it would otherwise experience if commodity prices were to change in its favor. the derivative instruments the partnership utilizes for these hedges are based on posted market prices, which may be higher or lower than the actual natural gas, ngl and condensate prices that it realizes in its operations. these pricing differentials may be substantial and could materially impact the prices the partnership ultimately realizes. in addition, market and economic conditions may adversely affect the partnership's hedge counterparties' ability to meet their obligations. given volatility in the financial and commodity markets, the partnership may experience defaults by its hedge counterparties in the future. as a result of these and other factors, the partnership's hedging activities may not be as effective as it intended in reducing the variability of its cash flows, and in certain circumstances may actually increase the variability of its cash flows. please see "item 7a. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk."
if third-party pipelines and other facilities interconnected to the partnership's natural gas and crude oil gathering systems, terminals and processing facilities become partially or fully unavailable to transport natural gas and ngls, its revenues could be adversely affected.
the partnership depends upon third-party pipelines, storage and other facilities that provide delivery options to and from its gathering and processing facilities. since the partnership does not own or operate these pipelines or other facilities, their continuing operation in their current manner is not within its control. if any of these third-party facilities become partially or fully unavailable, or if the quality specifications for their facilities change so as to restrict the partnership's ability to utilize them, its revenues could be adversely affected.
the partnership's industry is highly competitive, and increased competitive pressure could adversely affect its business and operating results.
the partnership competes with similar enterprises in its respective areas of operation. some of the partnership's competitors are large oil, natural gas and ngl companies that have greater financial resources and access to supplies of natural gas and ngls than it does. some of these competitors may expand or construct gathering, processing, storage, terminaling and transportation systems that would create additional competition for the services the partnership provides to its customers. in addition, customers who are significant producers of natural gas may develop their own gathering, processing, storage, terminaling and transportation systems in lieu of using those operated by the partnership. the partnership's ability to renew or replace existing contracts with its customers at rates sufficient to maintain current revenues and cash flows could be adversely affected by the activities of its competitors and its customers. all of these competitive pressures could have a material adverse effect on the partnership's business, results of operations and financial condition.
the partnership typically does not obtain independent evaluations of natural gas or crude oil reserves dedicated to its gathering pipeline systems; therefore, supply volumes on its systems in the future could be less than it anticipates.
the partnership typically does not obtain independent evaluations of natural gas or crude oil reserves connected to its gathering systems due to the unwillingness of producers to provide reserve information as well as the cost of such evaluations. accordingly, the partnership does not have independent estimates of total reserves dedicated to its gathering systems or the anticipated life of such reserves. if the total reserves or estimated life of the reserves connected to the partnership's gathering systems is less than it anticipates and it is unable to secure additional sources of supply, then the volumes of natural gas transported on its gathering systems in the future could be less than it anticipates. a decline in the volumes on the partnership's systems could have a material adverse effect on its business, results of operations and financial condition.
a reduction in demand for ngl products by the petrochemical, refining or other industries or by the fuel or export markets, or a significant increase in ngl product supply relative to this demand, could materially adversely affect the partnership's business, results of operations and financial condition.
the ngl products the partnership produces have a variety of applications, including as heating fuels, petrochemical feedstocks and refining blend stocks. a reduction in demand for ngl products, whether because of general or industry-specific economic conditions, new government regulations, global competition, reduced demand by consumers for products made with ngl products (for example, reduced petrochemical demand observed due to lower activity in the automobile and construction industries), reduced demand for propane or butane exports whether for price or other reasons, increased competition from petroleum-based feedstocks due to pricing differences, mild winter weather for some ngl applications or other reasons, could result in a decline in the volume of ngl products the partnership handles or reduce the fees it charges for its services. also, increased supply of ngl products could reduce the value of ngls handled by the partnership and reduce the margins realized. the partnership's ngl products and their demand are affected as follows:
ethane. ethane is typically supplied as purity ethane and as part of an ethane-propane mix. ethane is primarily used in the petrochemical industry as feedstock for ethylene, one of the basic building blocks for a wide range of plastics and other chemical products. although ethane is typically extracted as part of the mixed ngl stream at gas processing plants, if natural gas prices increase significantly in relation to ngl product prices or if the demand for ethylene falls, it may be more profitable for natural gas processors to leave the ethane in the natural gas stream, thereby reducing the volume of ngls delivered for fractionation and marketing.
propane. propane is used as a petrochemical feedstock in the production of ethylene and propylene, as a heating, engine and industrial fuel, and in agricultural applications such as crop drying. changes in demand for ethylene and propylene could adversely affect demand for propane. the demand for propane as a heating fuel is significantly affected by weather conditions. the volume of propane sold is at its highest during the six-month peak heating season of october through march. demand for the partnership's propane may be reduced during periods of warmer-than-normal weather.
normal butane. normal butane is used in the production of isobutane, as a refined petroleum product blending component, as a fuel gas (either alone or in a mixture with propane) and in the production of ethylene and propylene. changes in the composition of refined petroleum products resulting from governmental regulation, changes in feedstocks, products and economics, and demand for heating fuel, ethylene and propylene could adversely affect demand for normal butane.
isobutane. isobutane is predominantly used in refineries to produce alkylates to enhance octane levels. accordingly, any action that reduces demand for motor gasoline or demand for isobutane to produce alkylates for octane enhancement might reduce demand for isobutane.
natural gasoline. natural gasoline is used as a blending component for certain refined petroleum products and as a feedstock used in the production of ethylene and propylene. changes in the mandated composition of motor gasoline resulting from governmental regulation, and in demand for ethylene and propylene, could adversely affect demand for natural gasoline.
ngls and products produced from ngls also compete with products from global markets. any reduced demand or increased supply for ethane, propane, normal butane, isobutane or natural gasoline in the markets the partnership accesses for any of the reasons stated above could adversely affect both demand for the services it provides and ngl prices, which could negatively impact its results of operations and financial condition.
the tax treatment of the partnership depends on its status as a partnership for u.s. federal income tax purposes as well as its not being subject to a material amount of entity-level taxation by individual states. if the internal revenue service ("irs") were to treat the partnership as a corporation for federal income tax purposes or the partnership becomes subject to a material amount of entity-level taxation for state tax purposes, then its cash available for distribution to its unitholders, including us, would be substantially reduced.
we currently own an approximate 10.9% limited partner interest, a 2% general partner interest and the idrs in the partnership. the anticipated after-tax economic benefit of our investment in the partnership depends largely on its being treated as a partnership for federal income tax purposes. a publicly traded partnership such as the partnership may be treated as a corporation for federal income tax purposes unless it satisfies a "qualifying income" requirement. based on the partnership's current operations we believe that the partnership satisfies the qualifying income requirement and will be treated as a partnership. failing to meet the qualifying income requirement or a change in current law could cause the partnership to be treated as a corporation for federal income tax purposes or otherwise subject the partnership to taxation as an entity. the partnership has not requested and does not plan to request a ruling from the irs with respect to its treatment as a partnership for federal income tax purposes.
if the partnership were treated as a corporation for federal income tax purposes, it would pay federal income tax on its taxable income at the corporate tax rate, which is currently a maximum of 35%, and would likely pay state income tax at varying rates. distributions to the partnership's unitholders, including us, would generally be taxed again as corporate distributions and no income, gains, losses or deductions would flow through to the partnership's unitholders, including us. if such tax was imposed upon the partnership as a corporation, its cash available for distribution would be substantially reduced. therefore, treatment of the partnership as a corporation would result in a material reduction in the anticipated cash flow and after-tax return to the partnership's unitholders, including us, and would likely cause a substantial reduction in the value of our investment in the partnership.
at the state level, because of widespread state budget deficits and other reasons, several states are evaluating ways to subject partnerships to entity-level taxation through the imposition of state income and franchise taxes and other forms of taxation. for example, the partnership is required to pay texas franchise tax at a maximum effective rate of 0.7% of its gross income apportioned to texas in the prior year. imposition of any similar tax on the partnership by additional states would reduce the cash available for distribution to partnership unitholders, including us.
current law may change so as to cause the partnership to be treated as a corporation for federal income tax purposes or otherwise subject the partnership to entity-level taxation for state or local income tax purposes. the present u.s. federal income tax treatment of publicly traded partnerships, including the partnership, or an investment in the partnership's common units may be modified by administrative, legislative or judicial changes or differing interpretations at any time. for example, from time to time, members of congress propose and consider substantive changes to the existing federal income tax laws that affect publicly traded partnerships. one such legislative proposal would eliminate the qualifying income exception to the treatment of all publicly traded partnerships as corporations upon which the partnership relies for its treatment as a partnership for u.s. federal income tax purposes. we are unable to predict whether any of these changes or other proposals will be reintroduced or will ultimately be enacted. any such changes could negatively impact the value of our investment in the partnership's common units.
the partnership's partnership agreement provides that if a law is enacted or existing law is modified or interpreted in a manner that subjects it to taxation as a corporation or otherwise subjects it to entity-level taxation for federal, state or local income tax purposes, the minimum quarterly distribution amount and the target distribution amounts may be adjusted to reflect the impact of that law on the partnership.
the partnership does not own most of the land on which its pipelines, terminals and compression facilities are located, which could disrupt its operations.
the partnership does not own most of the land on which its pipelines, terminals and compression facilities are located, and the partnership is therefore subject to the possibility of more onerous terms and/or increased costs to retain necessary land use if it does not have valid rights-of-way or leases or if such rights-of-way or leases lapse or terminate. the partnership sometimes obtains the rights to land owned by third parties and governmental agencies for a specific period of time. the partnership's loss of these rights, through its inability to renew right-of-way contracts or leases, or otherwise, could cause it to cease operations on the affected land, increase costs related to continuing operations elsewhere and reduce its revenue.
the partnership may be unable to cause its majority-owned joint ventures to take or not to take certain actions unless some or all of its joint venture participants agree.
the partnership participates in several majority-owned joint ventures whose corporate governance structures require at least a majority in interest vote to authorize many basic activities and require a greater voting interest (sometimes up to 100%) to authorize more significant activities. examples of these more significant activities include, among others, large expenditures or contractual commitments, the construction or acquisition of assets, borrowing money or otherwise raising capital, making distributions, transactions with affiliates of a joint venture participant, litigation and transactions not in the ordinary course of business. without the concurrence of joint venture participants with enough voting interests, the partnership may be unable to cause any of its joint ventures to take or not take certain actions, even though taking or preventing those actions may be in the best interests of the partnership or the particular joint venture.
in addition, subject to certain conditions, any joint venture owner may sell, transfer or otherwise modify its ownership interest in a joint venture, whether in a transaction involving third parties or the other joint owners. any such transaction could result in the partnership partnering with different or additional parties.
weather may limit the partnership's ability to operate its business and could adversely affect its operating results.
the weather in the areas in which the partnership operates can cause disruptions and in some cases suspension of its operations. for example, unseasonably wet weather, extended periods of below freezing weather, or hurricanes may cause disruptions or suspensions of the partnership's operations, which could adversely affect its operating results. potential climate changes may have significant physical effects, such as increased frequency and severity of storms, floods and other climatic events and could have an adverse effect on the partnership's operations.
the partnership's business involves many hazards and operational risks, some of which may not be insured or fully covered by insurance. if a significant accident or event occurs for which it is not fully insured, if the partnership fails to recover all anticipated insurance proceeds for significant accidents or events for which it is insured, or if the partnership fails to rebuild facilities damaged by such accidents or events, its operations and financial results could be adversely affected.
the partnership's operations are subject to many hazards inherent in gathering, compressing, treating, processing and selling natural gas; storing, fractionating, treating, transporting and selling ngls and ngl products; gathering, storing and terminaling crude oil; and storing and terminaling refined petroleum products, including:
•   damage to pipelines and plants, related equipment and surrounding properties caused by hurricanes, tornadoes, floods, fires and other natural disasters, explosions and acts of terrorism;
•   damage that is the result of the partnership's negligence or any of its employees' negligence;
•   leaks of natural gas, ngls, crude oil and other hydrocarbons or losses of natural gas or ngls as a result of the malfunction of equipment or facilities;
•   spills or other unauthorized releases of natural gas, ngls, crude oil, other hydrocarbons or waste materials that contaminate the environment, including soils, surface water and groundwater, and otherwise adversely impact natural resources; and
•   other hazards that could also result in personal injury, loss of life, pollution and/or suspension of operations.
these risks could result in substantial losses due to personal injury, loss of life, severe damage to and destruction of property and equipment, and pollution or other environmental damage, and may result in curtailment or suspension of the partnership's related operations. a natural disaster or other hazard affecting the areas in which the partnership operates could have a material adverse effect on its operations. for example, in 2005, hurricanes katrina and rita damaged gathering systems, processing facilities, ngl fractionators and pipelines along the gulf coast, including certain of the partnership's facilities, and curtailed or suspended the operations of various energy companies with assets in the region. the louisiana and texas gulf coast was similarly impacted in september 2008 as a result of hurricanes gustav and ike. the partnership is not fully insured against all risks inherent to its business. additionally, while the partnership is insured for pollution resulting from environmental accidents that occur on a sudden and accidental basis, it may not be insured against all environmental accidents that might occur, some of which may result in toxic tort claims. if a significant accident or event occurs that is not fully insured, if the partnership fails to recover all anticipated insurance proceeds for significant accidents or events for which it is insured, or if the partnership fails to rebuild facilities damaged by such accidents or events, its operations and financial condition could be adversely affected. in addition, the partnership may not be able to maintain or obtain insurance of the type and amount it desires at reasonable rates. as a result of market conditions, premiums and deductibles for certain of the partnership's insurance policies have increased substantially, and could escalate further. for example, following hurricanes katrina and rita, insurance premiums, deductibles and co-insurance requirements increased substantially, and terms were generally less favorable than terms that could be obtained prior to such hurricanes. insurance market conditions worsened as a result of the losses sustained from hurricanes gustav and ike in september 2008. as a result, the partnership experienced further increases in deductibles and premiums, and further reductions in coverage and limits, with some coverage unavailable at any cost.
the partnership may incur significant costs and liabilities resulting from performance of pipeline integrity programs and related repairs.
pursuant to the authority under the ngpsa and hlpsa, as amended by the psi act, the pipes act and the 2011 pipeline safety act, phmsa has established a series of rules requiring pipeline operators to develop and implement integrity management programs for certain gas and hazardous liquids pipelines that, in the event of a pipeline leak or rupture could affect "high consequence areas," which are areas where a release could have the most significant adverse consequences, including high-population areas, certain drinking water sources and unusually sensitive ecological areas.  among other things, these regulations require operators of covered pipelines to:
•   perform ongoing assessments of pipeline integrity;
•   identify and characterize applicable threats to pipeline segments that could impact a high consequence area;
•   implement preventive and mitigating actions.
in addition, states have adopted regulations similar to existing phmsa regulations for certain intrastate gas and hazardous liquids pipelines. the partnership currently estimates an average annual cost of $2.5 million between 2015 and 2017 to implement pipeline integrity management program testing along certain segments of its gas and hazardous liquids pipelines. this estimate does not include the costs, if any, of repair, remediation or preventative or mitigative actions that may be determined to be necessary as a result of the testing program, which costs could be substantial. at this time, the partnership cannot predict the ultimate cost of compliance with applicable pipeline integrity management regulations, as the cost will vary significantly depending on the number and extent of any repairs found to be necessary as a result of the pipeline integrity testing. the partnership will continue its pipeline integrity testing programs to assess and maintain the integrity of its pipelines. the results of these tests could cause the partnership to incur significant and unanticipated capital and operating expenditures for repairs or upgrades deemed necessary to ensure the continued safe and reliable operation of its pipelines.
moreover, changes to pipeline safety laws by congress and regulations by phmsa that result in more stringent or costly safety standards could have a significant adverse effect on the partnership and similarly situated midstream operators.  for instance, in august 2011, phmsa published an advance notice of proposed rulemaking in which the agency sought public comment on a number of changes to regulations governing the safety of gas transmission pipelines and gathering lines, including, for example, revisions to the definitions of "high consequence areas" and "gathering lines" and strengthening integrity management requirements as they apply to existing regulated operators and to currently exempt operators should certain exemptions be removed. most recently, in an august 2014  gao report to congress, the gao acknowledged phmsa's continued assessment of the safety risks posed by gathering lines and recommended that phmsa move forward with rulemaking to address larger-diameter, higher-pressure gathering lines, including subjecting such pipelines to emergency response planning requirements that currently do not apply.
unexpected volume changes due to production variability or to gathering, plant or pipeline system disruptions may increase the partnership's exposure to commodity price movements.
the partnership sells processed natural gas to third parties at plant tailgates or at pipeline pooling points. sales made to natural gas marketers and end-users may be interrupted by disruptions to volumes anywhere along the system. the partnership attempts to balance sales with volumes supplied from processing operations, but unexpected volume variations due to production variability or to gathering, plant or pipeline system disruptions may expose it to volume imbalances which, in conjunction with movements in commodity prices, could materially impact its income from operations and cash flow.
the partnership requires a significant amount of cash to service its indebtedness. the partnership's ability to generate cash depends on many factors beyond its control.
the partnership's ability to make payments on and to refinance its indebtedness and to fund planned capital expenditures depends on its ability to generate cash in the future. this, to a certain extent, is subject to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other factors that are beyond the partnership's control. we cannot assure you that the partnership will generate sufficient cash flow from operations, that future borrowings will be available to it under the trp revolver, that it will be able to sell its accounts receivables or make borrowings under its securitization facility, or otherwise in an amount sufficient to enable it to pay its indebtedness or to fund its other liquidity needs. the partnership may need to refinance all or a portion of its indebtedness at or before maturity. we cannot assure you that the partnership will be able to refinance any of its indebtedness on commercially reasonable terms or at all.
failure to comply with environmental laws or regulations or an accidental release into the environment may cause the partnership to incur significant costs and liabilities.
the partnership's operations are subject to stringent federal, tribal, state and local environmental laws and regulations governing the discharge of pollutants into the environment or otherwise relating to environmental protection. these laws and regulations may impose numerous obligations that are applicable to its operations including acquisition of a permit before conducting regulated activities, restrictions on the types, quantities and concentration of materials that can be released into the environment; limitation or prohibition of construction and operating activities in environmentally sensitive areas such as wetlands, urban areas, wilderness regions and other protected areas; requiring capital expenditures to comply with pollution control requirements and imposition of substantial liabilities for pollution resulting from its operations. numerous governmental authorities, such as the epa and analogous state agencies, have the power to enforce compliance with these laws and regulations and the permits issued under them, which can often require difficult and costly actions. failure to comply with these laws and regulations or any newly adopted laws or regulations may trigger a variety of administrative, civil and criminal penalties or other sanctions, the imposition of remedial obligations and the issuance of orders enjoining or conditioning future operations. certain environmental laws impose strict, joint and several liability for costs required to clean up and restore sites where hazardous substances, hydrocarbons or waste products have been released, even under circumstances where the substances, hydrocarbons or waste have been released by a predecessor operator.
there is inherent risk of incurring environmental costs and liabilities in connection with the partnership's operations due to its handling of natural gas, ngls, crude oil and other petroleum products because of air emissions and product-related discharges arising out of its operations, and as a result of historical industry operations and waste disposal practices. for example, an accidental release from one of the partnership's facilities could subject it to substantial liabilities arising from environmental cleanup and restoration costs, claims made by neighboring landowners and other third parties for personal injury, natural resource and property damages and fines or penalties for related violations of environmental laws or regulations. moreover, stricter laws, regulations or enforcement policies could significantly increase the partnership's operational or compliance costs and the cost of any remediation that may become necessary. the adoption of any laws, regulations or other legally enforceable mandates that result in more stringent air emission limitations or that restrict or prohibit the drilling of new natural gas wells for any extended period of time could increase the partnership's natural gas customers' operating and compliance costs as well as reduce the rate of production of natural gas or crude oil from operators with whom the partnership has a business relationship, which could have a material adverse effect on its results of operations and cash flows.
increased regulation of hydraulic fracturing could result in reductions or delays in drilling and completing new oil and natural gas wells, which could adversely impact the partnership's revenues by decreasing the volumes of natural gas, ngls or crude oil through its facilities and reducing the utilization of its assets.
hydraulic fracturing is a process used by oil and gas exploration and production operators in the completion of certain oil and gas wells whereby water, sand and chemicals are injected under pressure into subsurface formations to stimulate gas and, to a lesser extent, oil production. the process is typically regulated by state oil and gas commissions, but several federal agencies have asserted regulatory authority over certain aspects of the process, including the epa, which plans to propose effluent limit guidelines in the first half of 2015 for wastewater from shale gas extraction operations before being discharged to a treatment plant, and the bureau of land management, which proposed regulations applicable to hydraulic fracturing conducted on federal and indian oil and gas leases and is expected to issue a final rule in the first half of 2015.  in addition, congress has from time to time considered the adoption of legislation to provide for federal regulation of hydraulic fracturing. at the state level, a growing number of states have adopted or are considering legal requirements that could impose more stringent permitting, disclosure or well construction requirements on hydraulic fracturing activities, and states could elect to prohibit hydraulic fracturing altogether, as governor andrew cuomo of the state of new york announced in december 2014 with regard to fracturing activities in new york. in addition, local governments may seek to adopt ordinances within their jurisdictions regulating the time, place and manner of drilling activities in general or hydraulic fracturing activities in particular. for example, in november 2014, residents in denton, texas, approved a city ordinance prohibiting hydraulic fracturing within the city limits effective december 2, 2014 but the ordinance is subject to challenge. if new or more stringent federal, state or local legal restrictions or prohibitions relating to the hydraulic fracturing process are adopted in areas where the partnership's oil and natural gas exploration and production customers operate, those customers could incur potentially significant added costs to comply with such requirements and experience delays or curtailment in the pursuit of exploration, development or production activities, which could reduce demand for the partnership's gathering, processing and fractionation services.  further several federal governmental agencies are conducting reviews and studies on the environmental aspects of hydraulic fracturing activities, including the white house council on environmental quality and the epa, with the epa planning to issue a draft of its final report on hydraulic fracturing in the first half of 2015.  these studies, depending on their degree of pursuit and any meaningful results obtained, could spur initiatives to further regulate hydraulic fracturing, which events could delay or curtail production of natural gas by exploration and production operators, some of which are the partnership's customers, and thus reduce demand for the partnership's midstream services.
a change in the jurisdictional characterization of some of the partnership's assets by federal, state, tribal or local regulatory agencies or a change in policy by those agencies may result in increased regulation of its assets, which may cause its revenues to decline and operating expenses to increase or delay or increase the cost of expansion projects.
with the exception of the partnership's interest in vgs, its operations are generally exempt from ferc regulation under the nga, but ferc regulation still affects its non-ferc jurisdictional businesses and the markets for products derived from these businesses, including certain ferc reporting and posting requirements in a given year. the partnership believes that the natural gas pipelines in its gathering systems meet the traditional tests ferc has used to establish a pipeline's status as a gatherer not subject to regulation as a natural gas company. however, the distinction between ferc-regulated transmission services and federally unregulated gathering services is the subject of substantial, ongoing litigation, so the classification and regulation of the partnership's gathering facilities are subject to change based on future determinations by ferc, the courts or congress. in addition, the courts have determined that certain pipelines that would otherwise be subject to the ica are exempt from regulation by ferc under the ica as proprietary lines. the classification of a line as a proprietary line is a fact-based determination subject to ferc and court review. accordingly, the classification and regulation of some of the partnership's gathering facilities and transportation pipelines may be subject to change based on future determinations by ferc, the courts or congress.
the crude oil pipeline system that is part of the badlands assets has qualified for a temporary waiver of applicable ferc regulatory requirements under the ica based on current circumstances.  such waivers are subject to revocation, however, and should the pipeline's circumstances change, ferc could, either at the request of other entities or on its own initiative, assert that some or all of the transportation on this pipeline system is within its jurisdiction. in the event that ferc were to determine that this pipeline system no longer qualified for a waiver, the partnership would likely be required to file a tariff with ferc, provide a cost justification for the transportation charge, and provide service to all potential shippers without undue discrimination.  such a change in the jurisdictional status of transportation on this pipeline could adversely affect the partnership's results of operations.
various federal agencies within the u.s. department of the interior, particularly the bureau of land management, office of natural resources revenue (formerly the minerals management service) and the bureau of indian affairs, along with the three affiliated tribes, promulgate and enforce regulations pertaining to operations on the fort berthold indian reservation, on which the partnership operates a significant portion of its badlands gathering and processing assets. the three affiliated tribes is a sovereign nation having the right to enforce certain laws and regulations independent from federal, state and local statutes and regulations. these tribal laws and regulations include various taxes, fees and other conditions that apply to lessees, operators and contractors conducting operations on native american tribal lands. lessees and operators conducting operations on tribal lands can generally be subject to the native american tribal court system. one or more of these factors may increase the partnership's costs of doing business on the fort berthold indian reservation and may have an adverse impact on its ability to effectively transport products within the fort berthold indian reservation or to conduct its operations on such lands.
other ferc regulations may indirectly impact the partnership's businesses and the markets for products derived from these businesses. ferc's policies and practices across the range of its natural gas regulatory activities, including, for example, its policies on open access transportation, gas quality, ratemaking, capacity release and market center promotion, may indirectly affect the intrastate natural gas market. in recent years, ferc has pursued pro-competitive policies in its regulation of interstate natural gas pipelines. however, we cannot assure you that ferc will continue this approach as it considers matters such as pipeline rates and rules and policies that may affect rights of access to transportation capacity. for more information regarding the regulation of the partnership's operations, see "item 1. business-regulation of operations."
under the ep act of 2005, ferc has civil penalty authority under the nga to impose penalties for current violations of up to $1 million per day for each violation and disgorgement of profits associated with any violation. while the partnership's systems other than vgs have not been regulated by ferc as a natural gas company under the nga, ferc has adopted regulations that may subject certain of its otherwise non-ferc jurisdictional facilities to ferc annual reporting and daily scheduled flow and capacity posting requirements. additional rules and legislation pertaining to those and other matters may be considered or adopted by ferc from time to time. failure to comply with those regulations in the future could subject the partnership to civil penalty liability. for more information regarding regulation of the partnership's operations, see "item 1. business-regulation of operations."
the adoption of climate change legislation or regulations restricting emissions of ghgs could result in increased operating costs and reduced demand for the products and services the partnership provides.
in december 2009, the epa published its findings that emissions of carbon dioxide, methane and other ghgs present an endangerment to public health and the environment because emissions of such gases are, according to the epa, contributing to warming of the earth's atmosphere and other climatic changes. based on these findings, the epa has adopted rules under the clean air act that, among other things, establish psd construction and title v operating permit reviews for ghg emissions from certain large stationary sources that are also potential major sources of certain principal, or criteria, pollutant emissions, which reviews could require securing psd permits at covered facilities emitting ghgs and meeting "best available control technology" standards for those ghg emissions. in addition, the epa has adopted rules requiring the monitoring and annual reporting of ghg emissions from certain petroleum and natural gas system sources in the united states, including, among others, onshore processing, transmission, storage and distribution facilities. on december 9, 2014, the epa published a proposed rule that would expand the petroleum and natural gas system sources for which annual ghg emissions reporting is currently required to include ghg emissions reporting beginning in the 2016 reporting year for certain onshore gathering and boosting systems consisting primarily of gathering pipelines, compressors and process equipment used to perform natural gas compression, dehydration and acid gas removal. moreover, pursuant to president obama's strategy to reduce methane emissions, the obama administration announced on january 14, 2015, a goal to reduce methane emissions from the oil and gas sector by up to 45 percent from 2012 levels by 2025 and that, in furtherance of that goal, epa will propose in the summer of 2015 and finalize in 2016 new regulations that will set methane emission standards for oil and gas production and natural gas processing and transmission facilities. while congress has from time to time considered adopting legislation to reduce emissions of ghgs, there has not been significant activity in the form of adopted legislation.  in the absence of such federal climate legislation, a number of state and regional efforts have emerged that are aimed at tracking and/or reducing ghg emissions by means of cap and trade programs. the adoption of any legislation or regulations that requires reporting of ghgs or otherwise restricts emissions of ghgs from the partnership's equipment and operations could require us to incur significant added costs to reduce emissions of ghgs or could adversely affect demand for the natural gas and ngls the partnership gathers and processes or fractionates. moreover, if congress undertakes comprehensive tax reform in the coming year, it is possible that such reform may include a carbon tax, which could impose additional direct costs on operations and reduce demand for refined products, which could adversely affect the services the partnership provides.
federal and state legislative and regulatory initiatives relating to pipeline safety that require the use of new or more stringent safety controls or result in more stringent enforcement of applicable legal requirements could subject the partnership to increased capital costs, operational delays and costs of operation.
the 2011 pipeline safety act is the most recent federal legislation to amend the ngpsa and hlpsa pipeline safety laws, requiring increased safety measures for gas and hazardous liquids pipelines. among other things, the 2011 pipeline safety act directs the secretary of transportation to promulgate regulations relating to expanded integrity management requirements, automatic or remote-controlled valve use, excess flow valve use, leak detection system installation, testing to confirm the material strength of certain pipelines and operator verification of records confirming the maximum allowable pressure of certain intrastate gas transmission pipelines. the 2011 pipeline safety act also increases the maximum penalty for violation of pipeline safety regulations from $100,000 to $200,000 per violation per day and also from $1 million to $2 million for a related series of violations. the safety enhancement requirements and other provisions of the 2011 pipeline safety act as well as any implementation of phmsa regulations thereunder or any issuance or reinterpretation of guidance by phmsa or any state agencies with respect thereto could require us to install new or modified safety controls, pursue additional capital projects or conduct maintenance programs on an accelerated basis, any or all of which tasks could result in the partnership's incurring increased operating costs that could have a material adverse effect on the partnership's results of operations or financial position.  for example, phmsa and one or more state regulators, including the rrc, have recently expanded the scope of their regulatory inspections to include certain in-plant equipment and pipelines found within ngl fractionation facilities and associated storage facilities, to assess compliance with hazardous liquids pipeline safety requirements. these actions by phmsa are currently subject to judicial and administrative challenges by one or more midstream operators; however, to the extent that such challenges are unsuccessful, midstream operators of ngl fractionation facilities and associated storage facilities may be required to make operational changes or modifications at their facilities to meet standards beyond current osha, psm and epa rmp requirements, which changes or modifications may result in additional capital costs, possible operational delays and increased costs of operation that, in some instances, may be significant.
the enactment of derivatives legislation could have an adverse effect on the partnership's ability to use derivative instruments to reduce the effect of commodity price, interest rate and other risks associated with its business.
the dodd-frank wall street reform and consumer protection act (the "dodd-frank act"), enacted on july 21, 2010, established federal oversight and regulation of the over-the-counter derivatives market and entities, such as the partnership, that participate in that market. the dodd-frank act requires the cftc and the sec to promulgate rules and regulations implementing the dodd-frank act. although the cftc has finalized certain regulations, others remain to be finalized or implemented and it is not possible at this time to predict when this will be accomplished.
in november 2013, the cftc proposed new rules that would place limits on positions in certain core futures and equivalent swaps contracts for or linked to certain physical commodities, subject to exceptions for certain bona fide hedging transactions. as these new position limit rules are not yet final, the impact of those provisions on us is uncertain at this time.
the cftc has designated certain interest rate swaps and credit default swaps for mandatory clearing and the associated rules also will require the partnership, in connection with covered derivative activities, to comply with clearing and trade-execution requirements or take steps to qualify for an exemption to such requirements. although the partnership qualifies for the end-user exception from the mandatory clearing requirements for swaps entered to hedge its commercial risks, the application of the mandatory clearing and trade execution requirements to other market participants, such as swap dealers, may change the cost and availability of the swaps that the partnership uses for hedging. in addition, for uncleared swaps, the cftc or federal banking regulators may require end-users to enter into credit support documentation and/or post initial and variation margin. posting of collateral could impact liquidity and reduce cash available to the partnership for capital expenditures, therefore reducing its ability to execute hedges to reduce risk and protect cash flows. the proposed margin rules are not yet final, and therefore the impact of those provisions to the partnership is uncertain at this time.
the dodd-frank act also may require the counterparties to the partnership's derivative instruments to spin off some of their derivatives activities to a separate entity, which may not be as creditworthy as the current counterparty.
the full impact of the dodd-frank act and related regulatory requirements upon the partnership's business will not be known until the regulations are implemented and the market for derivatives contracts has adjusted. the dodd-frank act and any new regulations could significantly increase the cost of derivative contracts, materially alter the terms of derivative contracts, reduce the availability of derivatives to protect against risks the partnership encounters, reduce its ability to monetize or restructure its existing derivative contracts or increase its exposure to less creditworthy counterparties. if the partnership reduces its use of derivatives as a result of the dodd-frank act and regulations implementing the dodd-frank act, its results of operations may become more volatile and its cash flows may be less predictable, which could adversely affect its ability to plan for and fund capital expenditures.
finally, the dodd-frank act was intended, in part, to reduce the volatility of oil and natural gas prices, which some legislators attributed to speculative trading in derivatives and commodity instruments related to oil and natural gas. the partnership's revenues could therefore be adversely affected if a consequence of the dodd-frank act and implementing regulations is to lower commodity prices.
any of these consequences could have a material adverse effect on the partnership, its financial condition and its results of operations.
targa ngl has interstate ngl pipelines that are considered common carrier pipelines subject to regulation by ferc under the ica. more specifically, targa ngl owns a twelve-inch diameter pipeline that runs between lake charles, louisiana and mont belvieu, texas. this pipeline can move mixed ngl and purity ngl products. targa ngl also owns an eight-inch diameter pipeline and a twenty-inch diameter pipeline, each of which run between mont belvieu, texas and galena park, texas. the eight-inch and the twenty-inch pipelines are part of an extensive mixed ngl and purity ngl pipeline receipt and delivery system that provides services to domestic and foreign import and export customers. the ica requires that the partnership maintain tariffs on file with ferc for each of these pipelines. those tariffs set forth the rates the partnership charges for providing transportation services as well as the rules and regulations governing these services. the ica requires, among other things, that rates on interstate common carrier pipelines be "just and reasonable" and nondiscriminatory. all shippers on these pipelines are the partnership's subsidiaries.
terrorist attacks and the threat of terrorist attacks have resulted in increased costs to the partnership's business. continued hostilities in the middle east or other sustained military campaigns may adversely impact the partnership's results of operations.
the long-term impact of terrorist attacks, such as the attacks that occurred on september 11, 2001, and the threat of future terrorist attacks on the partnership's industry in general and on the partnership in particular is not known at this time. however, resulting regulatory requirements and/or related business decisions associated with security are likely to increase the partnership's costs.
increased security measures taken by the partnership as a precaution against possible terrorist attacks have resulted in increased costs to its business. uncertainty surrounding continued hostilities in the middle east or other sustained military campaigns may affect the partnership's operations in unpredictable ways, including disruptions of crude oil supplies and markets for its products, and the possibility that infrastructure facilities could be direct targets, or indirect casualties, of an act of terror.
changes in the insurance markets attributable to terrorist attacks may make certain types of insurance more difficult for the partnership to obtain. moreover, the insurance that may be available to the partnership may be significantly more expensive than its existing insurance coverage or coverage may be reduced or unavailable. instability in the financial markets as a result of terrorism or war could also affect the partnership's ability to raise capital.
risks related to the atlas mergers the atlas mergers are subject to conditions, including certain conditions that may not be satisfied on a timely basis, if at all. failure to complete the atlas mergers, or significant delays in completing the atlas mergers, could negatively affect our future business and financial results.
the completion of the atlas mergers is subject to a number of conditions, and each of the atlas mergers and the spin-off is contingent on one another. the completion of the atlas mergers is not assured and is subject to risks, including the risk that approval of targa's stock issuance by targa stockholders in connection with the atls merger or the approval of the atlas mergers by the unitholders of apl and atls, as applicable, or by governmental agencies is not obtained or that other closing conditions are not satisfied. if the atlas mergers are not completed, or if there are significant delays in completing the atlas mergers, our future business and financial results could be negatively affected, and each of the parties involved will be subject to several risks, including the following:
·   the parties may be liable for damages to one another under the terms and conditions of the merger agreements;
·   there may be negative reactions from the financial markets due to the fact that current prices may reflect a market assumption that the atlas mergers will be completed; and
·   the attention of our management and atlas management will have been diverted to the atlas mergers rather than our own operations and pursuit of other opportunities that could have been beneficial to our business.
we and atlas may have difficulty attracting, motivating and retaining employees in light of the atlas mergers.
the success of the combined entity after the atlas mergers will depend in part upon the ability of targa and atlas to retain their respective key employees. key employees may depart either before or after the atlas mergers because of issues relating to the uncertainty and difficulty of integration or a desire not to remain following the atlas mergers. accordingly, no assurance can be given that the combined entity will be able to retain key employees to the same extent as in the past.
we and atlas are subject to business uncertainties and contractual restrictions while the atlas mergers are pending, which could adversely affect each party's business and operations.
in connection with the atlas mergers, it is possible that some customers, suppliers and other persons with whom we or atlas have business relationships may delay or defer certain business decisions or, might decide to seek to terminate, change or renegotiate their relationship with us or atlas as a result of the atlas mergers, which could negatively affect the respective revenues, earnings and cash available for distribution of us and atlas, regardless of whether the atlas mergers are completed.
under the terms of the merger agreements, each of us and atlas is subject to certain restrictions on the conduct of its business prior to completing the atlas mergers, which may adversely affect our and atlas' ability to execute certain of our and its business strategies. such limitations could negatively affect each party's businesses and operations prior to the completion of the atlas mergers. furthermore, the process of planning to integrate the businesses and organizations for the post-merger period can divert management attention and resources and could ultimately have an adverse effect on each party.
we and atlas expect to incur substantial expenses in connection with completing the atlas mergers and integrating the businesses, operations, networks, systems, technologies, policies and procedures of atlas and us. there are a large number of systems that must be integrated, including billing, management information, purchasing, accounting and finance, sales, payroll and benefits, fixed assets, lease administration and regulatory compliance, and there are a number of factors beyond our and atlas' control that could affect the total amount or the timing of integration expenses. many of the expenses that will be incurred, by their nature, are difficult to estimate accurately at the present time. due to these factors, the transaction and integration expenses associated with the atlas mergers could, particularly in the near term, exceed any savings that the combined entity might otherwise realize from the elimination of duplicative expenses and the realization of economies of scale related to the integration of the businesses following the completion of the atlas mergers.
failure to successfully combine our business with the business of atlas in the expected time frame may adversely affect the future results of the combined entity, and, consequently, our ability to make payments on the notes.
the success of the atlas mergers will depend, in part, on our ability to realize the anticipated benefits and synergies from combining our business with the business of atlas. to realize these anticipated benefits, the businesses must be successfully integrated. if the combined entity is not able to achieve these objectives, or is not able to achieve these objectives on a timely basis, the anticipated benefits of the atlas mergers may not be realized fully or at all. in addition, the actual integration may result in additional and unforeseen expenses, which could reduce the anticipated benefits of the atlas mergers.
any acquisitions that we complete, including the atlas mergers, are subject to substantial risks.
any acquisition, including the atlas mergers, involves potential risks, including, among other things:
·   the validity of our assumptions about, among other things, revenues and costs, including synergies;
·   an inability to integrate successfully the businesses we acquire;
·   a decrease in our liquidity by using a significant portion of our available cash or borrowing capacity to finance acquisitions;
·   a significant increase in our interest expense or financial leverage if we incur additional debt to finance acquisitions;
·   the assumption of environmental and other unknown liabilities, losses or costs for which we are not indemnified or for which our indemnity is inadequate;
·   the diversion of management's attention from other business concerns;
·   an inability to hire, train or retain qualified personnel to manage and operate our growing business and assets;
·   the incurrence of other significant charges, such as impairment of goodwill or other intangible assets, asset devaluation or restructuring charges;
·   a failure to attain or maintain compliance with environmental and other governmental regulations;
·   unforeseen difficulties encountered in operating in new geographic areas; and
·   customer or key employee losses at the acquired businesses.
failure to complete the atlas mergers could negatively affect our future business and financial results.
prior to the completion of the atlas mergers, we and atlas may, by mutual agreement, amend or alter the terms of the merger agreements, including with respect to, among other things, the consideration payable by us or any covenants or agreements with respect to the parties' respective operations during the pendency thereof. any such amendments or alterations may have negative consequences to us, including, among other things, reducing our distributable cash flow.
we are subject to litigation related to the atlas mergers, see "item 3. legal proceedings." it is possible that additional claims beyond those that have already been filed will be brought by the current plaintiffs or by others in an effort to enjoin the atlas mergers or seek monetary relief from us. we cannot predict the outcome of these lawsuits, or others, nor can we predict the amount of time and expense that will be required to resolve the lawsuit(s). an unfavorable resolution of any such litigation surrounding the atlas mergers could delay or prevent the consummation of the atlas mergers. in addition, the cost to us defending the litigation, even if resolved in our favor, could be substantial.
item 7.   management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations
the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our historical financial statements and notes included in part iv of this annual report. also, the partnership files a separate annual report on form 10-k with the sec.
overview financial presentation targa resources corp. is a publicly traded delaware corporation formed in october 2005. our common stock is listed on the nyse under the symbol "trgp." in this annual report, unless the context requires otherwise, references to "we," "us," "our," the "company," or "targa" are intended to mean our consolidated business and operations.
we own general and limited partner interests, including incentive distribution rights ("idrs"), in targa resources partners lp (the "partnership"), a publicly traded delaware limited partnership that is a leading united states provider of midstream natural gas and ngl services, with a growing presence in crude oil gathering and petroleum terminaling. common units of the partnership are listed on the nyse under the symbol "ngls."
our primary business objective is to increase our cash available for dividends to our stockholders by assisting the partnership in executing its business strategy. we may potentially facilitate the partnership's growth through various forms of financial support, including, but not limited to, modifying the partnership's idrs, exercising the partnership's idr reset provision contained in its partnership agreement, making loans, making capital contributions in exchange for yielding or non-yielding equity interests or providing other financial support to the partnership to support its ability to make distributions. we also may potentially enter into other economic transactions intended to increase our ability to make cash available for dividends over time. in addition, we may potentially acquire assets that could be candidates for acquisition by the partnership, potentially after operational or commercial improvement or further development.
an indirect subsidiary of ours is the general partner of the partnership. because we control the general partner, under gaap we must reflect our ownership interest in the partnership on a consolidated basis. accordingly, the partnership's financial results are included in our consolidated financial statements even though the distribution or transfer of partnership assets are limited by the terms of the partnership agreement, as well as restrictive covenants in the partnership's lending agreements. the limited partner interests in the partnership not owned by us are reflected in our results of operations as net income attributable to noncontrolling interests. therefore, throughout this discussion, we make a distinction where relevant between financial results of the partnership versus those of us as a standalone parent including our non-partnership subsidiaries.
the partnership files its own separate annual report. the financial results presented in our consolidated financial statements will differ from the consolidated financial statements of the partnership primarily due to the effects of:
·   certain administrative assets and liabilities incumbent as a provider of operational and support services to the partnership;
·   certain non-operating assets and liabilities that we retained;
·   partnership distributions applicable to our general partner interest, incentive distribution rights and investment in partnership common units. while these are eliminated when preparing our consolidated financial statements, they nonetheless are the primary source of cash flow that supports the payment of dividends to our stockholders.
our operations currently, we have no separate, direct operating activities apart from those conducted by the partnership. as such, our cash inflows will primarily consist of cash distributions from our interests in the partnership. the partnership is required to distribute all available cash at the end of each quarter after establishing reserves to provide for the proper conduct of its business or to provide for future distributions.
the partnership's operations the partnership is a leading provider of midstream natural gas and ngl services in the united states, with a growing presence in crude oil gathering and petroleum terminaling. in connection with these business activities, the partnership buys and sells natural gas, ngls and ngl products, crude oil, condensate and refined products.
the partnership is engaged in the business of:
·   gathering, compressing, treating, processing and selling natural gas;
·   storing, fractionating, treating, transporting and selling ngls and ngl products, including services to lpg exporters;
the partnership reports its operations in two divisions: (i) gathering and processing, consisting of two reportable segments - (a) field gathering and processing and (b) coastal gathering and processing; and (ii) logistics and marketing, consisting of two reportable segments - (a) logistics assets and (b) marketing and distribution. the financial results of its hedging activities are reported in other.
the partnership's gathering and processing division includes assets used in the gathering of natural gas produced from oil and gas wells and processing this raw natural gas into merchantable natural gas by extracting ngls and removing impurities and assets used for crude oil gathering and terminaling. the field gathering and processing segment's assets are located in north texas, the permian basin of west texas and southeast new mexico and in north dakota. the coastal gathering and processing segment's assets are located in the onshore and near offshore regions of the louisiana gulf coast and the gulf of mexico.
the partnership's logistics and marketing division is also referred to as its downstream business. the partnership's downstream business includes all the activities necessary to convert mixed ngls into ngl products and provides certain value added services such as storing, terminaling, distributing and marketing of ngls, the storage and terminaling of refined petroleum products and crude oil and certain natural gas supply and marketing activities in support of our other businesses including services to lpg exporters.  it also includes certain natural gas supply and marketing activities in support of the partnership's other operations, as well as transporting natural gas and ngls.
the partnership's logistics assets segment is involved in transporting, storing, and fractionating mixed ngls; storing, terminaling, and transporting finished ngls, including services for exporting lpgs; and storing and terminaling of refined petroleum products. these assets are generally connected to and supplied in part by the partnership's gathering and processing segments and are predominantly located in mont belvieu and galena park, texas and in lake charles, louisiana.
the partnership's marketing and distribution segment covers activities required to distribute and market raw and finished ngls and all natural gas marketing activities. it includes (1) marketing the partnership's own ngl production and purchasing ngl products for resale in selected united states markets; (2) providing lpg balancing services to refinery customers; (3) transporting, storing and selling propane and providing related propane logistics services to multi-state retailers, independent retailers and other end-users; (4) providing propane, butane and services to lpg exporters; and (5) marketing natural gas available to the partnership from its gathering and processing division and the purchase and resale and other value added activities related to third-party natural gas in selected united states markets.
other contains the results of the partnership's commodity hedging activities included in operating margin and the mark-to-market gains/losses that did not receive designation as cash-flow hedges.
2014 developments logistics and marketing segment expansion international exports in september 2013, the partnership commissioned phase i of the international export expansion project, which includes its facilities at mont belvieu and the galena park marine terminal near houston, texas. phase i of this project expanded the partnership's export capability to approximately 3.5 to 4 mmbbl per month of propane and/or butane. included in the partnership's phase i expansion is the capability to export international grade low ethane propane. with the completion of phase i, the partnership's capabilities expanded to include loading vlgc vessels in addition to the small and medium-sized vessels that the partnership previously loaded for export.
as part of phase ii of this project during 2014, the partnership added incremental capacity and operational efficiencies with the addition of refrigeration, another dock, a new pipeline between mont belvieu and galena park and a de-ethanizer that increased the effective capacity to 7.0 mmbbl per month. the total cost of the partnership's international export expansion project was approximately $480 million.
condensate splitter or alternate project on march 31, 2014, the partnership announced the approval to construct a condensate splitter at its channelview terminal on the houston ship channel. the condensate splitter was supported by a long-term fee-based arrangement with noble americas corp., a subsidiary of noble group ltd. the initial project would have the capability to split approximately 35 mbbl/d of condensate into its various components, including naptha, kerosene, gas oil, jet fuel and liquefied petroleum gas, and will provide segregated storage for the condensate and components.
effective december 31, 2014, the partnership and noble agreed to modify the existing arrangements to build (i) a new terminal with significant storage capacity at patriot; or (ii) a condensate splitter at channelview with modified timing; or (iii) potentially both projects. the partnership and noble are evaluating these alternatives including final capabilities, capacities and capital costs. the modifications to the previous arrangements provide for the partnership to receive an upfront payment and an enhanced economic benefit over time. the projects are now expected to be completed by the end of 2016 or 2017, depending on final project scope and on permitting.
in july 2014, the partnership approved construction of a 100 mbbl/d fractionation expansion in mont belvieu, texas. the 100 mbbl/d expansion will be fully integrated with its existing gulf coast ngl storage, terminaling and delivery infrastructure, which includes an extensive network of connections to key petrochemical and industrial customers as well as the partnership's lpg export terminal at galena park, texas on the houston ship channel. all environmental and internal approvals required to commence construction of the expansion are in place, and construction is underway and the partnership expects completion of construction in mid-2016. construction of the expansion will proceed without disruption to existing operations, and the partnership estimates that total capital expenditures for the expansion and the related infrastructure enhancements at mont belvieu should be approximately $385 million.
field gathering and processing segment expansion badlands during 2013, the partnership invested approximately $250 million to expand its gathering and processing business in the williston basin, north dakota assets. the partnership increased its crude gathering and natural gas gathering operations substantially with the addition of pipelines and associated facilities and added an additional 20 mmcf/d natural gas processing plant. during 2014, the partnership invested approximately $165 million for further expansion of this business, including an additional cryogenic processing plant.
north texas and saou in may 2014, the partnership commenced commercial operations of the 200 mmcf/d cryogenic longhorn processing plant in north texas, and in june 2014, the partnership commenced commercial operations of the 200 mmcf/d cryogenic high plains processing plant in the permian basin. we believe these plants will enable north texas and saou to meet increasing production from continued producer activity in north texas and the eastern side of the permian basin.
growth investments in the permian and williston basins in october 2014, the partnership announced that it intends to build a new 300 mmcf/d cryogenic processing plant with an anticipated start-up in early 2016. this plan will also include related gathering and compression infrastructure in the delaware basin of winkler country, texas, west of the partnership's existing sand hills gas processing plant.
in october 2014, the partnership also announced  that it intends to build a new 200 mmcf/d cryogenic processing plant to be located in mckenzie county, north dakota with an anticipated start-up in 2016.
given the significant decrease in commodity prices and expected reductions in producer activity since those announcements, the partnership is reevaluating the capacity and expected timing for both of these projects.
in the current market environment, we are actively monitoring producer responses to changes in the commodity price environment and will continue to adjust our growth capital expenditure programs to meet expected producer requirements.
additionally, the partnership expects to have other growth capital expenditures in 2015 related to the continued build out of its gathering and processing systems and logistics capabilities.
pending atlas mergers on october 13, 2014, we and the partnership announced two proposed merger transactions which would result in the partnership's acquisition of atlas pipeline partners, l.p (apl), a delaware limited partnership, and the targa acquisition of atlas energy, l.p. (atls), a delaware limited partnership, which owns the apl general partner. upon consummation of these mergers, targa would relinquish all apl ownership interests and merge the apl general partner into the partnership. each of the transactions is contingent on one another, and the transactions are expected to close concurrently on february 28, 2015, subject to the approval of targa's stock issuance in connection with the atls merger by targa's stockholders and the approval of the atlas mergers by unitholders of atls and apl, as applicable, and other customary closing conditions.
apl is a provider of natural gas gathering, processing and treating services primarily in the anadarko, arkoma and permian basins located in the southwestern and mid-continent regions of the united states and in the eagle ford shale play in south texas; a provider of natural gas gathering services in the appalachian basin in the northeastern region of the united states and a provider of ngl transportation services in the southwestern region of the united states.
strategic rationale:
we believe that the combination of targa resources partners and apl creates a premier midstream franchise with increased scale and geographic diversity, and creates one of the largest diversified mlps on an enterprise value basis.
·   the acquisitions add the woodford/scoop, mississippi lime, eagle ford and additional permian assets to the partnership's existing permian, bakken, barnett, and louisiana gulf coast gathering and processing operations.
·   combined position across the permian basin enhances service capabilities in one of the most active producing basins in north america, with a combined 1,439 mmcf/d of processing capacity and 10,300 miles of pipelines.
·   strong growth outlook with significant announced combined organic growth capital expenditures.
·   growing ngl production from gathering and processing business supports the partnership's leading ngl fractionation and export position.
·   enhances credit profile and results in an estimated 60-70% pro forma fee-based margin.
·   underlying growth in the businesses drives incrementally higher distribution and dividend growth.
please see note 4 to the "consolidated financial statements" beginning on page f-1 of this annual report.
accounts receivable securitization facility the securitization facility provides up to $300.0 million of borrowing capacity at libor market index rates plus a margin through december 11, 2015. under the securitization facility, two of the partnership's consolidated subsidiaries (targa liquids marketing and trade llc ("tlmt") and targa gas marketing llc ("tgm")) sell or contribute receivables, without recourse, to another of its consolidated subsidiaries (targa receivables llc or "trllc"), a special purpose consolidated subsidiary created for the sole purpose of the securitization facility. trllc, in turn, sells an undivided percentage ownership in the eligible receivables to a third-party financial institution. receivables up to the amount of the outstanding debt under the securitization facility are not available to satisfy the claims of the creditors of tlmt, tgm or the partnership. any excess receivables are eligible to satisfy the claims of creditors of tlmt, tgm or the partnership. as of december 31, 2014, total funding under the securitization facility was $182.8 million.
other financing activities on july 21, 2014, standard & poor's ratings services ("s&p") raised the partnership's corporate credit rating to 'bb+' from 'bb' and raised the partnership's credit rating on its senior unsecured notes to 'bb+' from 'bb'.
on september 9, 2014, moody's investors service ("moody's") raised the partnership's corporate credit rating to 'ba1' from 'ba2' and raised the partnership's credit rating on its senior unsecured notes to 'ba2' from 'ba3'.
on october 13, 2014, in conjunction with the announced agreements to acquire apl and atls, s&p placed the partnership's 'bb+' corporate credit and senior unsecured debt ratings on creditwatch with positive implications. also on october 14, 2014, moody's affirmed the partnership's ba1 corporate family rating and ba2 senior unsecured note rating.
in october 2014, the partnership privately placed $800.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 41⁄8% senior notes due 2019 (the "41⁄8% notes"). the 41⁄8% notes resulted in approximately $790.8 million of net proceeds, which were used to reduce borrowings under the trp revolver and the partnership's securitization facility and for general partnership purposes.
in november 2014, the partnership redeemed its outstanding 77⁄8% senior notes due 2018 (the "77⁄8% notes") paying $259.8 million plus accrued interest per the terms of the note agreement to redeem the outstanding balance of the 77⁄8% notes. the redemption resulted in a $12.4 million loss on debt redemption for the year ended 2014, consisting of premiums paid of $9.9 million and a non-cash loss to write-off $2.5 million of unamortized debt issue costs.
in july 2013, the partnership filed with the sec a universal shelf registration statement that, subject to effectiveness at the time of use, allows the partnership to issue up to an aggregate of $800 million of debt or equity securities (the "july 2013 shelf"). in august 2013, the partnership entered into an equity distribution agreement under the july 2013 shelf (the "august 2013 eda"), pursuant to which the partnership may sell through its sales agents, at its option, up to an aggregate of $400 million of the partnership common units.  in may 2014, the partnership entered into an additional equity distribution agreement under the july 2013 shelf (the "may 2014 eda"), pursuant to which the partnership may sell through its sales agents, at its option, up to an aggregate of $400 million of the partnership common units.
during 2014, pursuant to the august 2013 eda and the may 2014 eda, the partnership issued a total of 7,175,096 common units representing total net proceeds of $408.4 million (net of commissions up to 1% of gross proceeds to the partnership's sales agent), which were used to reduce borrowings under the trp revolver and for general partnership purposes. we contributed $8.4 million to the partnership to maintain our 2% general partner interest during this period, of which $1.0 million was settled in january 2015.
recent accounting pronouncements in april 2014, the fasb issued asu no. 2014-08, presentation of financial statements (topic 205) and property, plant and equipment (topic 360), reporting discontinued operations and disclosures of disposals of components of an entity. the amendment, required to be applied prospectively for reporting periods beginning after december 15, 2014, limits discontinued operations reporting to disposals of components of an entity that represent strategic shifts that have, or will have, a major effect on operations and financial results.  the amendment requires expanded disclosures for discontinued operations and also requires additional disclosures regarding disposals of individually significant components that do not qualify as discontinued operations. early adoption is permitted, but only for disposals (or classifications as held for sale) that have not been reported in financial statements previously issued or available for issuance.
in may 2014, the fasb issued asu no. 2014-09, revenue from contracts with customers (topic 606), which supersedes the revenue recognition requirements in topic 605, revenue recognition, and most industry-specific guidance. the update also creates a new subtopic 340-40, other assets and deferred costs - contracts with customers, which provides guidance for the incremental costs of obtaining a contract with a customer and those costs incurred in fulfilling a contract with a customer that are not in the scope of another topic. the new revenue standard requires that entities should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entities expect to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. to achieve that core principle, the standard requires a five step process of identifying the contracts with customers, identifying the performance obligations in the contracts, determining the transaction price, allocating the transaction price to the performance obligations, and recognizing revenue when, or as, the performance obligations are satisfied. the amendment also requires enhanced disclosures regarding the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers.
the revenue recognition standard will be effective for us starting in the first quarter of 2017. early adoption is not permitted. we must retroactively apply the new revenue recognition standard to transactions in all prior periods presented, but will have a choice between either (1) restating each prior period presented or (2) presenting a cumulative effect adjustment in the first quarter report in 2017. we have commenced our analysis of the new standard and its impact on our revenue recognition practices.
in august 2014, the fasb issued asu no. 2014-15, presentation of financial statements-going concern (subtopic 205-40), disclosure of uncertainties about an entity's ability to continue as a going concern. the amendment is effective for the annual period beginning after december 15, 2016, and for annual and interim periods thereafter, with early adoption permitted. the amendment requires an entity's management to evaluate for each annual and interim reporting period whether there are conditions or events, considered in the aggregate, that raise substantial doubt about the entity's ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the date that the financial statements are issued or available to be issued.  if substantial doubt is raised, further analysis and disclosures are required, including management's plans to mitigate the adverse conditions or events.
in november 2014, fasb issued asu no. 2014-17, business combinations (topic 805): pushdown accounting (a consensus of the fasb emerging issues task force), with an effective date of november 18, 2014. the amendment provides an acquired entity the option to apply push-down accounting in its separate financial statements when a change-in-control event occurs.
factors that significantly affect the partnership's results the partnership's results of operations are substantially impacted by the volumes that move through its gathering, processing and logistics assets, changes in commodity prices, contract terms, the impact of hedging activities and the cost to operate and support assets.
volumes in the partnership's gathering and processing operations, plant inlet volumes and capacity utilization rates generally are driven by wellhead production and the partnership's competitive and contractual position on a regional basis and more broadly by the impact of prices for oil, natural gas and ngls on exploration and production activity in the areas of the partnership's operations. the factors that impact the gathering and processing volumes also impact the total volumes that flow to the downstream business. in addition, fractionation volumes are also affected by the location of the resulting mixed ngls, available pipeline capacity to transport ngls to the partnership's fractionators and its competitive and contractual position relative to other fractionators.
(2)   ngl prices are based on quarterly weighted average prices and annual averages of prices from mont belvieu non-tet monthly commercial index prices. illustrative targa ngl contains 44% ethane, 30% propane, 11% natural gasoline, 5% isobutane and 10% normal butane.
(3)   crude oil prices are based on quarterly weighted average prices and annual averages of daily prices from west texas intermediate commercial index prices as measured on the nymex.
contract terms, contract mix and the impact of commodity prices because of the potential for significant volatility of natural gas and ngl prices, the contract mix of the partnership's gathering and processing division, other than fee-based contracts in badlands and certain other gathering and processing services, can have a material impact on its profitability, especially those contracts that create direct exposure to changes in energy prices by paying the partnership for gathering and processing services with a portion of the commodities handled ("equity volumes").
contract terms in the gathering and processing division are based upon a variety of factors, including natural gas and crude quality, geographic location, competitive dynamics and the pricing environment at the time the contract is executed, and customer requirements. the partnership's gathering and processing contract mix and, accordingly, their exposure to crude, natural gas and ngl prices may change as a result of producer preferences, competition and changes in production as wells decline at different rates or are added, their expansion into regions where different types of contracts are more common and other market factors. for example, the partnership's badlands crude oil and natural gas contracts are essentially 100% fee-based.
the contract terms and contract mix of our downstream business can also have a significant impact on the partnership's results of operations. during periods of low relative demand for available fractionation capacity, rates were low and frac-or-pay contracts were not readily available. the current demand for fractionation services has grown resulting in increases in fractionation fees and contract term. in addition, reservation fees are required. increased demand for export services also supports fee-based contracts. contracts in the logistics assets segment are primarily fee-based arrangements while the marketing and distribution segment includes both fee-based and percent-of-proceeds contracts.
impact of the partnership's commodity price hedging activities the partnership has hedged the commodity price risk associated with a portion of its expected natural gas and condensate equity volumes through 2017 and ngl equity volumes through 2015 by entering into financially settled derivative transactions. historically, these transactions have included both swaps and purchased puts (or floors). the primary purpose of its commodity risk management activities is to hedge its exposure to price risk and to mitigate the impact of fluctuations in commodity prices on cash flow. the partnership also actively manages the downstream business product inventory and other working capital levels to reduce exposure to changing ngl prices. for additional information regarding the partnership's hedging activities, see "item 7a. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk-commodity price risk."
operating expenses variable costs such as fuel, utilities, power, service and repairs can impact the partnership's results as volumes fluctuate through its systems. continued expansion of existing assets will also give rise to additional operating expenses, which will affect the partnership's results. the employees supporting the partnership's operations are employees of targa resources llc, a delaware limited liability company, and an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of us. the partnership reimburses us for the payment of certain operating expenses, including compensation and benefits of operating personnel assigned to the partnership's assets.
general and administrative expenses we perform centralized corporate functions for the partnership, such as legal, accounting, treasury, insurance, risk management, health, safety, environmental, information technology, human resources, credit, payroll, internal audit, taxes engineering and marketing. other than our direct costs of being a separate public reporting company, these costs are reimbursed by the partnership. see "item 13. certain relationships and related transactions, and director independence."
general trends and outlook we expect the midstream energy business environment to continue to be affected by the following key trends: demand for the partnership's services, commodity prices, volatile capital markets and increased regulation. these expectations are based on assumptions made by us and information currently available to us. to the extent our underlying assumptions about or interpretations of available information prove to be incorrect, the partnership's actual results may vary materially from our expected results.
demand for the partnership's services fluctuations in energy prices can affect production rates and investments by third parties in the development of oil and natural gas reserves. generally, drilling and production activity will increase as energy prices increase. the recent substantial decline in oil, condensate, ngl and natural gas prices has led many exploration and production companies to reduce planned capital expenditures for drilling and production activities during 2015. in the partnership's field gathering and processing areas of operation, producers are likely to reduce their drilling activity to varying degrees, which may lead to lower oil, condensate, ngl and natural gas volume growth in the near term and reduced demand for the partnership's services. producer activity generates demand in the partnership's downstream business for fractionation and other fee-based services, which may decrease in the near term. as prices have declined, demand for the partnership's international export, storage and terminaling services has remained relatively constant, as demand for these services is based on a number of domestic and international factors.
commodity prices there has been, and we believe there will continue to be, significant volatility in commodity prices and in the relationships among ngl, crude oil and natural gas prices. in addition, the volatility and uncertainty of natural gas, crude oil and ngl prices impact drilling, completion and other investment decisions by producers and ultimately supply to the partnership's systems.
the partnership's operating income generally improves in an environment of higher natural gas, ngl and condensate prices, primarily as a result of its percent-of-proceeds contracts. the partnership's processing profitability is largely dependent upon pricing and the supply of and market demand for natural gas, ngls and condensate. pricing and supply are beyond its control and have been volatile. in a declining commodity price environment, without taking into account the partnership's hedges, the partnership will realize a reduction in cash flows under its percent-of-proceeds contracts proportionate to average price declines. due to the recent volatility in commodity prices, we are uncertain of what pricing and market demand for oil, condensate, ngls and natural gas will be throughout 2015, and, as a result, demand for the services that we provide may decrease. across the partnership's operations and particularly in the partnership's downstream business, the partnership benefits from long-term fee-based arrangements for its services, regardless of the actual volumes processed or delivered. the significant level of margin we derive from fee-based arrangements combined with the partnership's hedging arrangements helps to mitigate the partnership's exposure to commodity price movements. for additional information regarding the partnership's hedging activities, see "item 7a. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk-commodity price risk."
volatile capital markets the partnership is dependent on its abilities to access the equity and debt capital markets in order to fund acquisitions and expansion expenditures. global financial markets have been, and are expected to continue to be, volatile and disrupted and weak economic conditions may cause a significant decline in commodity prices. as a result, we and the partnership may be unable to raise equity or debt capital on satisfactory terms, or at all, which may negatively impact the timing and extent to which we and the partnership execute growth plans. prolonged periods of low commodity prices or volatile capital markets may impact our and the partnership's ability or willingness to enter into new hedges, fund organic growth, connect to new supplies of natural gas, execute acquisitions or implement expansion capital expenditures.
increased regulation additional regulation in various areas has the potential to materially impact the partnership's operations and financial condition. for example, increased regulation of hydraulic fracturing used by producers may cause reductions in supplies of natural gas, ngls, and crude oil from producers. please read "item 1a. risk factors-increased regulation of hydraulic fracturing could result in reductions or delays in drilling and completing new oil and natural gas wells, which could adversely impact the partnership's revenues by decreasing the volumes of natural gas, ngls or crude oil through its facilities and reducing the utilization of its assets." similarly, the forthcoming rules and regulations of the cftc may limit the partnership's ability or increase the cost to use derivatives, which could create more volatility and less predictability in its results of operations.
how we evaluate our operations our consolidated operations include the operations of the partnership due to our ownership and control of the general partner. we currently have no direct operating activities separate from those conducted by the partnership. our financial results differ from the partnership's due to the financial effects of: noncontrolling interests in the partnership, our separate debt obligations, certain non-operating costs associated with assets and liabilities that we retained and were not included in asset conveyances to the partnership, and certain general and administrative costs applicable to us as a separate public company. we monitor these non-partnership financial items to ensure proper reflection of the partnership and non-partnership results.
distributable cash flow management's primary measure of analyzing our performance is the non-gaap measure distributable cash flow.
we define distributable cash flow as distributions due to us from the partnership, less our specific general and administrative costs as a separate public reporting entity, the interest carry costs associated with our debt and taxes attributable to our earnings. distributable cash flow is a significant performance metric used by us and by external users of our financial statements, such as investors, commercial banks, research analysts and others to compare basic cash flows generated by us to the cash dividends we expect to pay our shareholders. using this metric, management and external users of our financial statements can quickly compute the coverage ratio of estimated cash flows to planned cash dividends. distributable cash flow is also an important financial measure for our shareholders since it serves as an indicator of our success in providing a cash return on investment. specifically, this financial measure indicates to investors whether or not we are generating cash flow at a level that can sustain or support an increase in our quarterly dividend rates. distributable cash flow is also a quantitative standard used throughout the investment community because the share value is generally determined by the share's yield (which in turn is based on the amount of cash dividends the entity pays to a shareholder).
the economic substance behind our use of distributable cash flow is to measure the ability of our assets to generate cash flow sufficient to pay dividends to our investors.
the gaap measure most directly comparable to distributable cash flow is net income. distributable cash flow should not be considered as an alternative to gaap net income. distributable cash flow is not a presentation made in accordance with gaap and has important limitations as an analytical tool. investors should not consider distributable cash flow in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under gaap. because distributable cash flow excludes some, but not all, items that affect net income and is defined differently by different companies in our industry, our definition of distributable cash flow may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies, thereby diminishing its utility.
our non-gaap measures management compensates for the limitations of distributable cash flow as an analytical tool by reviewing the comparable gaap measure, understanding the differences between the measures and incorporating these insights into its decision making process.

(2)   current period portion of amount established at our ipo to fund taxes on deferred gains related to drop down transactions that were treated as sales for income tax purposes.
how we evaluate the partnership's operations the partnership's profitability of its business segments is a function of the difference between: (i) the revenues the partnership receives from its operations, including fee-based revenues from services and revenues from the natural gas, ngls, crude oil and condensate the partnership sells, and (ii) the costs associated with conducting the partnership's operations, including the costs of wellhead natural gas, crude oil and mixed ngls that the partnership purchases as well as operating, general and administrative costs and the impact of commodity hedging activities. because commodity price movements tend to impact both revenues and costs, increases or decreases in the partnership's revenues alone are not necessarily indicative of increases or decreases in its profitability. the partnership's contract portfolio, the prevailing pricing environment for crude oil, natural gas and ngls and the volumes of crude oil, natural gas and ngl throughput on its systems are important factors in determining its profitability. the partnership's profitability is also affected by the ngl content in gathered wellhead natural gas, supply and demand for its products and services, utilization of its assets and changes in its customer mix.
the partnership's profitability is also impacted by fee-based revenues. the partnership's growth strategy, based on expansion of existing facilities as well as third-party acquisitions of businesses and assets, has increased the percentage of our revenues that are fee-based. fixed fees for services such as fractionation, storage, terminaling and crude oil gathering are not directly tied to changes in market prices for commodities.
management uses a variety of financial measures and operational measurements to analyze the partnership's performance. these include: (1) throughput volumes, facility efficiencies and fuel consumption, (2) operating expenses, (3) capital expenditures and (4) the following non-gaap measures: gross margin, operating margin, adjusted ebitda and distributable cash flow.
throughput volumes, facility efficiencies and fuel consumption the partnership's profitability is impacted by its ability to add new sources of natural gas supply and crude oil supply to offset the natural decline of existing volumes from oil and natural gas wells that are connected to its gathering and processing systems. this is achieved by connecting new wells and adding new volumes in existing areas of production, as well as by capturing crude oil and natural gas supplies currently gathered by third-parties. similarly, the partnership's profitability is impacted by its ability to add new sources of mixed ngl supply, typically connected by third-party transportation, to its downstream business' fractionation facilities. the partnership fractionates ngls generated by its gathering and processing plants, as well as by contracting for mixed ngl supply from third-party facilities.
in addition, the partnership seeks to increase operating margin by limiting volume losses, reducing fuel consumption and by increasing efficiency. with its gathering systems' extensive use of remote monitoring capabilities, the partnership monitors the volumes received at the wellhead or central delivery points along its gathering systems, the volume of natural gas received at its processing plant inlets and the volumes of ngls and residue natural gas recovered by its processing plants. the partnership also monitors the volumes of ngls received, stored, fractionated and delivered across its logistics assets. this information is tracked through its processing plants and downstream business facilities to determine customer settlements for sales and volume related fees for service and helps the partnership increase efficiency and reduces fuel consumption.
as part of monitoring the efficiency of its operations, the partnership measures the difference between the volume of natural gas received at the wellhead or central delivery points on its gathering systems and the volume received at the inlet of its processing plants as an indicator of fuel consumption and line loss. the partnership also tracks the difference between the volume of natural gas received at the inlet of the processing plant and the ngls and residue gas produced at the outlet of such plant to monitor the fuel consumption and recoveries of its facilities. similar tracking is performed for its crude oil gathering and logistics assets. these volume, recovery and fuel consumption measurements are an important part of the partnership's operational efficiency analysis and safety programs.
operating expenses operating expenses are costs associated with the operation of specific assets. labor, contract services, repair and maintenance, utilities and ad valorem taxes comprise the most significant portion of the partnership's operating expenses. these expenses, other than fuel and power, generally remain relatively stable and independent of the volumes through its systems, but fluctuate depending on the scope of the activities performed during a specific period.
capital expenditures capital projects associated with growth and maintenance projects are closely monitored. return on investment is analyzed before a capital project is approved, spending is closely monitored throughout the development of the project, and the subsequent operational performance is compared to the assumptions used in the economic analysis performed for the capital investment approval. the partnership has seen a substantial increase in its total capital spent since 2010 and currently has significant internal growth projects.
gross margin the partnership defines gross margin as revenues less purchases. it is impacted by volumes and commodity prices as well as by the partnership's contract mix and commodity hedging program. the partnership defines gathering and processing gross margin as total operating revenues from (1) the sale of natural gas, condensate, crude oil and ngls and (2) natural gas and crude oil gathering and service fee revenues less product purchases, which consist primarily of producer payments and other natural gas and crude oil purchases. logistics assets gross margin consists primarily of service fee revenue. gross margin for marketing and distribution equals total revenue from service fees, ngl and natural gas sales, less cost of sales, which consists primarily of ngl and natural gas purchases, transportation costs and changes in inventory valuation. the gross margin impacts of cash flow hedge settlements are reported in other.
operating margin the partnership defines operating margin as gross margin less operating expenses. operating margin is an important performance measure of the core profitability of the partnership's operations.
management reviews business segment gross margin and operating margin monthly as a core internal management process. we believe that investors benefit from having access to the same financial measures that management uses in evaluating the partnership's operating results. gross margin and operating margin provide useful information to investors because they are used as supplemental financial measures by management and by external users of the partnership's financial statements, including investors and commercial banks, to assess:
·   the financial performance of the partnership's assets without regard to financing methods, capital structure or historical cost basis;
·   the partnership's operating performance and return on capital as compared to other companies in the midstream energy sector, without regard to financing or capital structure; and
·   the viability of acquisitions and capital expenditure projects and the overall rates of return on alternative investment opportunities.
gross margin and operating margin are non-gaap measures. the gaap measure most directly comparable to gross margin and operating margin is net income. gross margin and operating margin are not alternatives to gaap net income and have important limitations as analytical tools. investors should not consider gross margin and operating margin in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of the partnership's results as reported under gaap. because gross margin and operating margin exclude some, but not all, items that affect net income and are defined differently by different companies in our industry, the partnership's definition of gross margin and operating margin may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies, thereby diminishing their utility.
management compensates for the limitations of gross margin and operating margin as analytical tools by reviewing the comparable gaap measures, understanding the differences between the measures and incorporating these insights into its decision-making processes.
adjusted ebitda the partnership defines adjusted ebitda as net income attributable to targa resources partners lp before: interest; income taxes; depreciation and amortization; gains or losses on debt repurchases and redemptions, early debt extinguishments and asset disposals; non-cash risk management activities related to derivative instruments; changes in the fair value of the badlands acquisition contingent consideration; non-cash compensation on partnership equity grants and the non-controlling interest portion of depreciation and amortization expenses. adjusted ebitda is used as a supplemental financial measure by the partnership and by external users of its financial statements such as investors, commercial banks and others. the economic substance behind the partnership's use of adjusted ebitda is to measure the ability of its assets to generate cash sufficient to pay interest costs, support its indebtedness and make distributions to its investors.
adjusted ebitda is a non-gaap financial measure. the gaap measures most directly comparable to adjusted ebitda are net cash provided by operating activities and net income attributable to targa resources partners lp. adjusted ebitda should not be considered as an alternative to gaap net cash provided by operating activities or gaap net income. adjusted ebitda has important limitations as an analytical tool. investors should not consider adjusted ebitda in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of the partnership's results as reported under gaap. because adjusted ebitda excludes some, but not all, items that affect net income and net cash provided by operating activities and is defined differently by different companies in the partnership's industry, the partnership's definition of adjusted ebitda may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies, thereby diminishing its utility.
management compensates for the limitations of adjusted ebitda as an analytical tool by reviewing the comparable gaap measures, understanding the differences between the measures and incorporating these insights into its decision-making processes.
distributable cash flow the partnership defines distributable cash flow as net income attributable to targa resources partners lp plus depreciation and amortization, deferred taxes and amortization of debt issue costs included in interest expense, adjusted for non-cash risk management activities related to derivative instruments, debt repurchases and redemptions, early debt extinguishments, non-cash compensation on partnership equity grants and asset disposals, less maintenance capital expenditures (net of any reimbursements of project costs) and changes in the fair value of the badlands acquisition contingent consideration. this measure includes any impact of noncontrolling interests.
distributable cash flow is a significant performance metric used by the partnership and by external users of the partnership's financial statements, such as investors, commercial banks and research analysts, to compare basic cash flows generated by the partnership (prior to the establishment of any retained cash reserves by the board of directors of its general partner) to the cash distributions the partnership expects to pay the partnership's unitholders. using this metric, the partnership's management and external users of its financial statements can quickly compute the coverage ratio of estimated cash flows to cash distributions. distributable cash flow is also an important financial measure for the partnership's unitholders since it serves as an indicator of the partnership's success in providing a cash return on investment. specifically, this financial measure indicates to investors whether or not the partnership is generating cash flow at a level that can sustain or support an increase in the partnership's quarterly distribution rates. distributable cash flow is also a quantitative standard used throughout the investment community with respect to publicly-traded partnerships and limited liability companies because the value of a unit of such an entity is generally determined by the unit's yield (which in turn is based on the amount of cash distributions the entity pays to a unitholder).

(2)   operating margin is a non-gaap financial measure and is discussed under "management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations - how we evaluate the partnership's operations".
(3)   plant natural gas inlet represents the volume of natural gas passing through the meter located at the inlet of a natural gas processing plant, other than in badlands, where it represents total wellhead gathered volume.
(5)   export volumes represent the quantity of ngl products delivered to third-party customers at our galena park marine terminal that are destined for international markets.
higher revenues, including the impact of hedging (a $29.4 million decrease to revenues), were primarily due to higher ngl volumes ($1,778.6 million), higher fee-based and other revenues ($438.1 million) and higher natural gas commodity sales prices ($201.4 million), partially offset by lower ngl and condensate prices ($65.6 million).
higher gross margin in 2014 reflects increased export activities and higher fractionation fees in our logistics and marketing segments and increased field gathering and processing throughput volumes associated with system expansions and increased producer activity, as well as higher natural gas prices. this significant growth in our asset base brought a higher level of operating expenses in 2014. see "-results of operations-by reportable segment" for additional information regarding changes in gross margin and operating margin on a segment basis.
the increase in depreciation and amortization expenses reflects increased planned amortization of the badlands intangible assets and higher depreciation related to major organic investments placed in service, including continuing development at badlands, the international export expansion project, high plains and longhorn plants, cbf train 4 and other system expansions.
general and administrative expenses were slightly lower due to the effect of lower non-cash expenses related to periodic valuations of unvested long term incentive plan awards, which offset increases in other overhead costs.
the increase in other operating income primarily relates to an insurance settlement in 2014 compared to losses on asset disposals recorded in 2013.
the increase in interest expense reflects higher outstanding borrowings and lower capitalized interest allocated to our major expansion projects, partially offset by lower overall interest rates.
losses on debt redemptions and amendments reflect premiums paid and the write-off of associated unamortized debt issue costs related to the redemptions of our 77⁄8% notes in 2014 and the outstanding balance of the 111⁄4% notes and $100 million of our 63⁄8% notes in 2013.
other expense in 2014 was primarily attributable to transaction costs related to the pending atlas mergers. in 2013 we recorded a gain from the elimination of the contingent consideration liability associated with the badlands acquisition.
higher revenues, including the impact of hedging (a $19.7 million decrease to revenues), were primarily due to the impact of higher commodity volumes ($373.9 million), higher realized prices on natural gas, condensate, and petroleum products ($261.2 million) and higher fee-based and other revenues ($234.4 million), offset by lower realized prices on ngls ($225.1 million).
higher gross margin in 2013 includes the contribution of the partnership's badlands acquisition. other favorable gross margin factors were increased volumes from system expansions and higher gas prices in the partnership's field gathering and processing segment and higher fractionation fees and increased export activities in the partnership's logistics and marketing segments. this significant growth in the partnership's asset base brought a higher level of operating expenses in 2013. see "-results of operations-by reportable segment" for additional information regarding changes in the components of gross and operating margin on a disaggregated basis.
the increase in depreciation and amortization expenses was primarily due to tangible and intangible assets acquired in the badlands acquisition and the timing of major organic investments placed in service including cbf train 4, phase i of the international export expansion project, and badlands continuing development.
higher general and administrative expenses reflected increased non-cash long term incentive-plan valuation expenses and increased expenses and compensation related costs to support the partnership's expanding business operations.
other operating expense in 2013 includes the loss due to a fire at the saunders plant. other operating expense in 2012 reflects a $15.4 million loss due to a write-off of the partnership's investment in the yscloskey joint venture processing plant. following hurricane isaac, the joint venture owners elected not to restart the plant. additionally, other operating (income) expense in 2012 includes $3.6 million in costs associated with the clean-up and repairs necessitated by hurricane isaac at the partnership's coastal straddle plants.
the increase in interest expense primarily reflects higher borrowings, partially offset by the impact of lower effective interest rates and increases in capitalized interest attributable to our major expansion projects.
the increase in equity earnings relates to the partnership's investment in gcf, which was profitable in 2013 compared to a loss in 2012 due to a planned shutdown of operations during the expansion of the facility.
losses on debt redemptions and amendments during 2013 are attributable to premiums paid and write-off of debt issue costs in connection with the redemption of the outstanding balance of the partnership's 111⁄4% notes and the redemption of $100 million of the partnership's 63⁄8% notes.
the increase in other income was attributable to the elimination of the contingent consideration associated with the badlands acquisition, reflecting management's assessment that the stipulated volumetric thresholds were not met.
the increase in earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests is primarily due to higher partnership earnings. additionally, net income attributable to noncontrolling interests was $3.5 million lower due to decreased net income of versado and vesco, partially offset by increased net income at cbf.
results of operations-by reportable segment we have segregated the following segment operating margins between partnership and trc non-partnership activities. partnership activities have been presented on a common control accounting basis, which reflects the dropdown transactions between targa and the partnership as if they occurred in prior periods. trc non-partnership segment results include certain assets and liabilities contractually excluded from the dropdown transactions and certain historical hedge activities that could not be reflected as such under gaap in the partnership common control results. see "-financial information - partnership versus non-partnership."

gross margin improvements in our field gathering and processing segment were fueled by throughput increases and higher natural gas sales prices partially offset by lower ngl and condensate sales prices and the impact of severe cold weather in the first quarter of 2014. the increase in plant inlet volumes was driven by system expansions and by increased producer activity which increased available supply across our areas of operation. gross margin in 2014 also benefited from the second quarter start-up of commercial operations at the longhorn plant in north texas and the high plains plant in saou. badlands crude oil and natural gas volumes increased significantly due to producer activities and system expansion. higher ngl sales reflect similar factors.
higher operating expenses were primarily driven by volume growth and system expansions and included additional labor costs, ad valorem taxes and compression and system maintenance expenses.
the increase in gross margin was primarily due to the inclusion of badlands operations in 2013, higher overall throughput volumes and higher natural gas and condensate sales prices partially offset by lower ngl sales prices. the increase in plant inlet volumes was largely attributable to new well connects which increased available supply across each of our areas of operations, offset by the saunders fire at versado and by other operational issues and severe cold weather.

(2)   plant natural gas inlet represents the volume of natural gas passing through the meter located at the inlet of a natural gas processing plant.
the decrease in coastal gathering and processing gross margin was primarily due to lower ngl sales prices, less favorable frac spreads and lower throughput volumes partially offset by new volumes at vesco with higher gpm and the availability of short-term higher gpm off-system volumes at lou. the overall decrease in plant inlet volumes was largely attributable to the decline of leaner off-system supply volumes and the idling of the big lake plant in november 2014 due to market conditions. gross ngl production at vesco during 2013 was impacted by a third-party ngl takeaway pipeline volume constraint.
operating expenses were relatively flat.
the decrease in gross margin was primarily due to lower ngl prices, less favorable frac spreads and lower throughput volumes at vesco and the other coastal straddles. the decrease in plant inlet volumes was largely attributable to the decline in offshore and off-system supply volumes and the impact of the yscloskey, calumet and other third-party plant shutdowns. in addition, volumes were constrained by operational issues at vesco and lou. this volume decrease was partially offset by the addition of the big lake plant in the third quarter 2012 and a full-year of operations in 2013 as some of the coastal straddle plants were not operational in 2012 after hurricane isaac. operational issues at vesco included the impact of damage to one of the two third-party pipelines that provide ngl takeaway capacity for vesco which constrained ngl production until repairs were completed in june 2013.
operating expenses were relatively flat.

logistics assets gross margin was significantly higher due to increased lpg export activity and increased fractionation activities, despite the increasing impact of ethane rejection.  lpg export volumes, which benefit both the logistics assets and marketing and distribution segments, averaged 177 mbbl/d in 2014 compared to 67 mbbl/d for 2013.  this increase was driven by phase i of our international export expansion project coming on-line in september 2013 and phase ii coming on-line during the second quarter and third quarter of 2014. higher fractionation volumes were primarily due to cbf train 4 which became operational in the third quarter of 2013. treating volumes improved in 2014 compared to 2013 due to higher customer throughput. terminaling and storage activity also increased, and capacity reservation fees were higher.
higher operating expenses reflect the expansion of our export and fractionation facilities, and increased fuel and power costs. partially offsetting these factors were higher system product gains in 2014.
gross margin increased primarily due to fractionation operations and lpg export activity. the lower year-to-date 2013 fractionation volumes were due to the planned maintenance turnaround at the cedar bayou facility, ethane rejection at certain gas processing plants and pipeline operating issues at non-partnership facilities. improvements in 2013 resulted from higher fractionation fees, cbf train 4 which commenced commercial operations during the third quarter of 2013 and higher contractual capacity reservation fees. gross margin results also include the impact of higher pass-through fuel costs. lpg export volumes, which benefit both the logistics assets and marketing and distribution segments, averaged 67 mbbl/d in 2013, compared to 32 mbbl/d for the previous year. the higher volumes reflect a significant increase in ongoing lpg export activity primarily due to our international export expansion project, which was placed into service in september 2013. terminaling rates per unit volume were also higher and storage revenues increased due to increased rates and new customers. gross margin for 2013 also benefitted from the renewable fuels project in our petroleum logistics business.
the increase in operating expenses primarily reflects increased power and fuel prices; expenses related to the start-up and operations of train 4 at cbf and increased maintenance costs, partially offset by higher system product gains.

marketing and distribution gross margin increased primarily due to higher lpg export activity (which benefits both logistics assets and marketing and distribution segments), higher wholesale and ngl marketing activities, higher terminal activity, higher barge utilization including increased barge fleet, and increased refinery services.  gross margin was partially offset by lower truck utilization and a reduced benefit associated with a contract settlement.
operating expenses increased primarily due to higher terminal activity, higher barge and railcar utilization partially offset by lower truck utilization.

other contains the financial effects of the partnership's hedging program on operating margin as it represents the cash settlements on derivative hedge contracts and mark-to-market gains and losses on its derivative contracts not designated as hedges. the primary purpose of the commodity risk management activities is to mitigate a portion of the impact of commodity prices on the partnership's operating cash flow. the partnership has hedged the commodity price associated with a portion of its expected (i) natural gas equity volumes in field gathering and processing operations and (ii) ngl and condensate equity volumes predominately in field gathering and processing as well as in the lou portion of the coastal gathering and processing operations that result from their percent of proceeds or liquids processing arrangements by entering into derivative instruments. because the partnership is essentially forward-selling a portion of its plant equity volumes, these hedge positions will move favorably in periods of falling commodity prices and unfavorably in periods of rising commodity prices.

our liquidity and capital resources we have no separate, direct operating activities apart from those conducted by the partnership. as such, our ability to finance our operations, including payment of dividends to our common stockholders, funding capital expenditures and acquisitions, or to meet our indebtedness obligations, will depend on cash inflows from future cash distributions to us from our interests in the partnership. the partnership is required to distribute all available cash at the end of each quarter after establishing reserves to provide for the proper conduct of its business or to provide for future distributions. see "part i - item 1a. risk factors." as of december 31, 2014, our interests in the partnership consisted of the following:
•   a 2% general partner interest, which we hold through our 100% ownership interest in the general partner of the partnership;
•   all of the outstanding idrs; and
•   12,945,659 of the 118,586,056 outstanding common units of the partnership, representing a 10.9% limited partnership interest.
our future cash flows will consist of distributions to us from our interests in the partnership. these cash distributions to us should provide sufficient resources to fund our operations, long-term debt obligations and tax obligations for at least the next twelve months. based on the anticipated levels of distributions from the partnership that we expect to receive, we also expect that we will be able to fund the projected quarterly cash dividends to our stockholders for the next twelve months.
the impact on us of changes in the partnership's distribution levels will vary depending on several factors, including the partnership's total outstanding partnership interests on the record date for the distribution, the aggregate cash distributions made by the partnership and the interests in the partnership owned by us. if the partnership increases distributions to its unitholders, including us, we would expect to increase dividends to our stockholders, although the timing and amount of such increased dividends, if any, will not necessarily be comparable to the timing and amount of the increase in distributions made by the partnership. in addition, the level of distributions we receive and of dividends we pay to our stockholders may be affected by the various risks associated with an investment in us and the underlying business of the partnership. please read "part i - item 1a. risk factors" for more information about the risks that may impact your investment in us.

the partnership's liquidity and capital resources the partnership's ability to finance its operations, including funding capital expenditures and acquisitions, meeting its indebtedness obligations, refinancing its indebtedness and meeting its collateral requirements, will depend on its ability to generate cash in the future. the partnership's ability to generate cash is subject to a number of factors, some of which are beyond its control. these include weather, commodity prices (particularly for natural gas and ngls) and ongoing efforts to manage operating costs and maintenance capital expenditures, as well as general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other factors.
the partnership's main sources of liquidity and capital resources are internally generated cash flow from operations, borrowings under the trp revolver, borrowings under the securitization facility, the issuance of additional common units and access to debt markets. the capital markets continue to experience volatility. the partnership's exposure to current credit conditions includes its credit facilities, cash investments and counterparty performance risks. the partnership continually monitors its liquidity and the credit markets, as well as events and circumstances surrounding each of the lenders to the trp revolver and securitization facility.

other potential capital resources include:
·   the partnership is in the process of seeking an amendment to the trp revolver to increase the facility size to approximately $1.6 billion from $1.2 billion and will maintain the right to request an additional $300 million in commitment increases. the amended trp revolver will continue to be due on october 3, 2017.
·   approximately $158.4 million in remaining capacity as of december 31, 2014 to issue common units pursuant to the may 2014 eda (see notes 10 and 11 of the "consolidated financial statements).
·   the partnership's ability to issue debt or equity securities pursuant to shelf registration statements, including availability under the partnership's july 2013 shelf and unlimited amounts under the partnership's april 2013 shelf.
a portion of the partnership's capital resources may be allocated to letters of credit to satisfy certain counterparty credit requirements. while the partnership's credit ratings have improved over time, these letters of credit reflect its non-investment grade status, as assigned to the partnership by moody's and s&p. they also reflect certain counterparties' views of its financial condition and ability to satisfy its performance obligations, as well as commodity prices and other factors.
pending atlas mergers on october 13, 2014, we and the partnership announced two proposed merger transactions which would result in the partnership's acquisition of apl, a delaware limited partnership, and our acquisition of atls, a delaware limited partnership which owns the apl general partner. upon consummation of these mergers, we would relinquish the apl general partner and idr ownership interests and merge the apl general partner into the partnership. each of the transactions is contingent on one another, and the transactions are expected to close concurrently on february 28, 2015, subject to the approval of targa's stock issuance in connection with the atls merger by targa's stockholders and the approval of the atlas mergers by unitholders of atls and apl, as applicable, and other customary closing conditions.
apl merger as merger consideration for the apl merger, holders of apl common units (other than certain common units held by the partnership or apl or their wholly owned subsidiaries, which will be cancelled) will be entitled to receive 0.5846 of the partnership's common units and a one-time cash payment of $1.26 for each apl common unit. the partnership will also redeem apl's class e preferred units for an aggregate amount of $126.5 million in cash. as of february 5, 2015, the total apl merger consideration would be valued at $5.0 billion. the portion of the merger consideration represented by the partnership's common units will fluctuate in value until the closing date as a result of fluctuations in the market price of its common units.
in connection with the apl merger, targa has agreed to reduce its incentive distribution rights for the four years following closing by fixed amounts of $37.5 million, $25.0 million, $10.0 million and $5.0 million, respectively. these annual amounts will be applied in equal quarterly installments for each successive four quarter period following closing.
atls merger atls holds the general partner's interest in apl as well as incentive distribution rights and 5.5% limited partner interest. under the terms of the atls merger, each existing holder of common units of atls, after giving effect to the spin-off of non-midstream assets, will be entitled to receive 0.1809 of our common shares and a cash payment of $9.12 for each atls common unit, which equates to 10.35 million shares of our common stock and $522 million in cash payments. additionally, we will provide atls with $88 million of cash for the repayment of a portion of the atls outstanding indebtedness and fund approximately $190 million related to change of control payments payable by atls. as of february 5, 2015, the total atls merger consideration would be valued at $1.6 billion. the portion of the merger consideration represented by our common shares will fluctuate in value until the closing date as a result of fluctuations in the market price of our common shares.
pre-closing merger financing activities we have arranged committed financing of $1.1 billion to replace our existing revolving credit facility and to fund the cash components of the atls merger, including cash merger consideration and approximately $190 million related to change of control payments payable by atls and transaction fees and expenses. in january 2015, as part of a new senior secured credit facility to syndicate the $1.1 billion in committed financing, we announced the launch of a $430 million senior secured term loan maturing 7 years after closing and a $670 million revolving credit facility maturing 5 years after closing. these facilities are subject to the closing of the pending atlas mergers and market conditions.
partnership pre-closing merger financing activities in january 2015, the partnership commenced cash tender offers for any and all of the outstanding apl senior notes. these tender offers are in connection with, and conditioned upon, the consummation of the proposed merger with apl. the proposed merger with apl, however, is not conditioned on the consummation of the tender offers. each tender offer is scheduled to expire on february 18, 2015, unless extended by the partnership at its sole discretion.
under the terms of the tender offer, apl noteholders will receive $1,015 per $1,000 principal if tendered before january 29, 2015 and $985 per $1,000 principal if tendered after that date. holders of tendered apl notes will also receive accrued and unpaid interest from the most recent interest payment date on their series of apl notes.
the outstanding apl senior notes consist of:
apl senior notes       amount tendered as of february 6, 2015
$500 million 65⁄8 due 2020   less than majority
the consummation of the merger with apl will result in a change of control under the apl indenture and obligate the apl issuers to make a change of control offer at $1,010 for each $1,000 principal plus accrued and unpaid interest from the most recent interest payment date. as permitted by the apl indenture, the partnership is making a change of control offer for any and all of the 2020 apl notes in lieu of the apl issuers and in advance of, and conditioned upon, the consummation of the merger with apl. the merger, however, is not conditioned on the consummation of the change of control offer. the change of control offer is also being made independently of the partnership's previously announced tender offer for the apl notes. the change of control offer is scheduled to expire on march 3, 2015, unless extended by the partnership. any 2020 apl notes that remain outstanding after consummation of the change of control offer will continue to be the obligation of the apl issuers under the governing indenture.
in january 2015, the partnership privately placed $1.1 billion in aggregate principal amount of 5% notes due 2018 (the "5% notes"). the 5% notes resulted in approximately $1,090.8 million of net proceeds, which will be used together with borrowings from the trp revolver, to fund the apl notes tender offers and the change of control offers for the apl notes pursuant to the indentures governing the 2020 apl notes the 2021 apl notes and the 2023 apl notes. the partnership expects to finance the cash portion of the apl merger with borrowings under the partnership's revolver.
in january 2015, moody's assigned a ba2 rating to the partnership's 5% notes. in addition, moody's affirmed all of the partnership's credit ratings but changed the partnership's outlook from positive to stable.

working capital working capital is the amount by which current assets exceed current liabilities. on a consolidated basis at the end of any given month, accounts receivable and payable tied to commodity sales and purchases are relatively balanced with receivables from ngl customers offset by plant settlements payable to producers. the factors that typically cause overall variability in the partnership's reported total working capital are: (1) the partnership's cash position; (2) liquids inventory levels and valuation, which the partnership closely manages; (3) changes in the fair value of the current portion of derivative contracts; and (4) major structural changes in the partnership's asset base or business operations, such as acquisitions or divestitures and certain organic growth projects.
the partnership's working capital increased $110.8 million exclusive of the impact of current debt obligations. this non-debt increase was driven by an increase in the partnership's net risk management working capital position due to changes in the forward prices of commodities, decreased capital spending due to the completion of 2013 projects, and increased ngl inventories. higher inventory volumes are primarily due to the effects of our expanding export activities and an additional build in wholesale field inventories to meet customer requirements. in addition, working capital was affected by the inclusion at december 31, 2014 of $182.8 million related to the securitization facility.
based on the partnership's anticipated levels of operations and absent any disruptive events, we believe that internally generated cash flow, borrowings available under the trp revolver and the securitization facility and proceeds from equity offerings and debt offerings should provide sufficient resources to finance its operations, capital expenditures, long-term debt obligations, collateral requirements, acquisition payments related to the atlas mergers and minimum quarterly cash distributions for at least the next twelve months.
the non-partnership working capital increased $0.7 million primarily due to higher compensation and benefits partially offset by lower federal income tax receivables for the year ended december 31, 2014.
we have incurred tax liabilities as a result of our sales of assets to the partnership. we have sufficient liquidity to satisfy the $48.8 million tax liability expected to be paid over the next 10 years.

cash flow from operating activities - partnership higher natural gas prices, sales and logistics fees related to export activities and higher ngl production volumes contributed to increased cash collections in 2014 compared to 2013 ($2,381.2 million), as well as higher cash payments to producers for commodity products ($1,903.7 million). the change in cash received related to derivatives reflects a net outflow of $4.9 million in 2014 compared to a net inflow in 2013 of $20.9 million due to the prices paid to counterparties compared to the fixed price the partnership received on those derivative contracts. lower cash general and administrative expenses were mainly due to the lower cash settlements on trc long term incentive plan costs in 2014 versus 2013 ($11.6 million). the increase in other cash payments during 2014 reflects transaction costs related to the atls mergers ($4.7 million).
higher natural gas prices, higher plant throughput volumes and increased export activities contributed to increased cash collections in 2013 compared to 2012 ($439.4 million). these factors also caused higher cash payments to producers and purchases of commodity products ($391.9 million). the change in cash received related to derivatives reflects higher commodity prices paid to counterparties compared to the fixed price the partnership received on those derivative contracts ($26.4 million). the decrease in other cash payments during 2013 was mainly attributable to the fees related to the badlands acquisition paid in 2012 ($6.6 million).

cash flow from investing activities - partnership the decrease in net cash used in investing activities for 2014 compared to 2013 was primarily due to lower cash outlays for capital expansion projects of $251.4 million.
the decrease in net cash used in investing activities for 2013 compared to 2012 was primarily due to a decrease in outlays for business acquisitions of $996.2 million and the absence of capital calls in 2013 at gcf ($16.8 million in 2012), partially offset by an increase in current capital expansion projects of $413.9 million and the purchase of material and supplies of $17.7 million related to our badlands expansion.

cash flow from financing activities - partnership the decrease in net cash provided by financing activities for 2014 compared to 2013 was primarily due to lower net borrowings under the partnership's debt facilities ($448.2 million), an increase in distributions to owners ($98.1 million), and a decrease in proceeds from equity offerings ($115.1 million).
the decrease in net cash provided by financing activities for 2013 compared to 2012 was primarily due to a lower net borrowing under the trp revolver ($347.0 million), lower issuance of senior notes ($375.0 million) and an increase in distributions to owners ($111.6 million), offset by higher net borrowings under the securitization facility ($279.7 million).
cash flow financing activities - non-partnership the increase in net cash provided by financing activities for 2014 compared to 2013 was primarily due to an increase in distributions received of $42.9 million, an increase in net borrowings under trc's senior secured revolving credit facility ("trc revolver") of $16.0 million, partially offset by an increase in dividends paid of $25.2 million.
financing activities provided a net source of cash in 2013 compared to an outflow in 2012 primarily due to the purchase in 2012 of partnership units for $47.0 million and an increase in distributions received of $45.6 million and an increase in borrowings on the trc revolver of $8.8 million, partially offset by an increase in dividends paid of $25.6 million.
capital requirements the partnership's capital requirements relate to capital expenditures, which are classified as expansion expenditures, maintenance expenditures or business acquisitions. expansion capital expenditures improve the service capability of the existing assets, extend asset useful lives, increase capacities from existing levels, add capabilities, reduce costs or enhance revenues, and fund acquisitions of businesses or assets. maintenance capital expenditures are those expenditures that are necessary to maintain the service capability of the partnership's existing assets, including the replacement of system components and equipment, which are worn, obsolete or completing their useful life, and expenditures to remain in compliance with environmental laws and regulations.  non-partnership currently does not have any capital expenditures.

the partnership estimates that its total growth capital expenditures for 2015 will be approximately $490 to $675 million on a gross basis (exclusive of increased capital spending resulting from the pending apl merger). given the partnership's objective of growth through acquisitions, expansions of existing assets and other internal growth projects, it anticipates that over time that it will invest significant amounts of capital to grow and acquire assets. future expansion capital expenditures may vary significantly based on investment opportunities. the partnership expects to fund future capital expenditures with funds generated from its operations, borrowings under the trp revolver and the securitization facility and proceeds from issuances of additional equity and debt securities. major organic growth projects for 2015 are discussed in "item 1. business-organic growth projects."
credit facilities and long-term debt the following table summarizes our debt obligations as of december 31, 2014 (in millions):
we consolidate the debt of the partnership with that of our own; however, we do not have the contractual obligation to make interest or principal payments with respect to the debt of the partnership. our debt obligations do not restrict the ability of the partnership to make distributions to us. trc's credit agreement has restrictions and covenants that may limit our ability to pay dividends to our stockholders. see note 10 of the "consolidated financial statements" beginning on page f-1 of this annual report for more information of the restrictions and covenants in trc's credit agreement.
compliance with debt covenants as of december 31, 2014, both we and the partnership were in compliance with the covenants contained in our various debt agreements.
trc revolving credit agreement in october 2012, we entered into a credit agreement that replaced our variable rate senior secured revolving credit facility due july 2014 with a new variable rate senior secured credit facility due october 3, 2017 (the "trc revolver"). the trc revolver increases available commitments to $150.0 million from $75.0 million, allows us to request up to an additional $100.0 million in commitment increases and includes a $30.0 million swing line sub-facility. outstanding letters of credit and related outstanding reimbursement obligations may not exceed $50.0 million in the aggregate.
in 2012, we incurred a charge of $0.2 million related to a partial write-off of debt issue costs associated with the previous credit facility as a result of a change in syndicate members under the new trc revolver. the remaining deferred debt issue costs along with the issue costs associated with the october 2012 amendment are amortized on a straight-line basis over the life of the trc revolver.
the trc revolver bears interest, at our option, at either (a) a base rate equal to the highest of the prime rate of deutsche bank trust company americas, the administrative agent, the federal funds rate plus 0.5% and the one-month libor rate plus 1.0%, plus an applicable margin ranging from 1.75% to 2.5% (dependent upon the company's consolidated leverage ratio), or (b) the libor rate plus an applicable margin ranging from 2.75% to 3.5% (dependent upon the company's consolidated leverage ratio).
we are required to pay a commitment fee ranging from 0.375% to 0.5% (dependent upon the company's consolidated leverage ratio) on the daily average unused portion of the trc revolver. additionally, issued and undrawn letters of credit bear interest at an applicable ranging from 2.75% to 3.5% (dependent upon the company's consolidated leverage ratio).
the trc revolver is secured by substantially all of the company's assets. the trc revolver requires us to maintain a consolidated leverage ratio (the ratio of consolidated funded indebtedness to consolidated adjusted ebitda) of no more than 4.00 to 1.00. the trc revolver restricts our ability to make dividends to shareholders if, on a pro forma basis after giving effect to such dividend, (a) any default or event of default has occurred and is continuing or (b) our consolidated leverage ratio exceeds 4.00 to 1.00. in addition, the trc revolver includes various covenants that may limit, among other things, our ability to incur indebtedness, grant liens, make investments, repay or amend the terms of certain other indebtedness, merge or consolidate, sell assets, and engage in transactions with affiliates.
in 2012, the partnership incurred a $1.7 million loss related to a partial write-off of debt issue costs associated with the previous credit facility as a result of a change in syndicate members under the new trp revolver. the remaining deferred debt issue costs along with the issue costs associated with the october 2012 amendment are amortized on a straight-line basis over the life of the trp revolver.
the trp revolver bears interest, at the partnership's option, either at the base rate or the eurodollar rate.  the base rate is equal to the highest of: (i) bank of america's prime rate; (ii) the federal funds rate plus 0.5%; or (iii) the one-month libor rate plus 1.0%, plus an applicable margin ranging from 0.75% to 1.75% (dependent on the partnership's ratio of consolidated funded indebtedness to consolidated adjusted ebitda). the eurodollar rate is equal to libor rate plus an applicable margin ranging from 1.75% to 2.75% (dependent on the partnership's ratio of consolidated funded indebtedness to consolidated adjusted ebitda).
the partnership is required to pay a commitment fee equal to an applicable rate ranging from 0.3% to 0.5% (dependent on the partnership's ratio of consolidated funded indebtedness to consolidated adjusted ebitda) times the actual daily average unused portion of the trp revolver. additionally, issued and undrawn letters of credit bear interest at an applicable rate ranging from 1.75% to 2.75% (dependent on the partnership's ratio of consolidated funded indebtedness to consolidated adjusted ebitda).
the trp revolver is collateralized by a majority of the partnership's assets. borrowings are guaranteed by the partnership's restricted subsidiaries.
the trp revolver restricts the partnership's ability to make distributions of available cash to unitholders if a default or an event of default (as defined in the trp revolver) exists or would result from such distribution. the trp revolver requires the partnership to maintain a ratio of consolidated funded indebtedness to consolidated adjusted ebitda of no more than 5.50 to 1.00. the trp revolver also requires the partnership to maintain a ratio of consolidated ebitda to consolidated interest expense of no less than 2.25 to 1.00. in addition, the trp revolver contains various covenants that may limit, among other things, the partnership's ability to incur indebtedness, grant liens, make investments, repay or amend the terms of certain other indebtedness, merge or consolidate, sell assets, and engage in transactions with affiliates (in each case, subject to the partnership's right to incur indebtedness or grant liens in connection with, and convey accounts receivable as part of, a permitted receivables financing).
the partnership's senior unsecured notes in january 2012, the partnership privately placed $400.0 million in aggregate principal amount of its 63⁄8% notes, resulting in approximately $395.5 million of net proceeds, which were used to reduce borrowings under the trp revolver and for general partnership purposes.
in october 2012, $400.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 51⁄4% notes were issued by the partnership at 99.5% of the face amount, resulting in gross proceeds of $398.0 million. an additional $200.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 51⁄4% notes were issued in december 2012 at 101.0% of the face amount, resulting in gross proceeds of $202.0 million. both issuances are treated as a single class of debt securities and have identical terms.
in november 2012, the partnership redeemed all of the outstanding 81⁄4% notes at a redemption price of 104.125% plus accrued interest through the redemption date. the redemption resulted in a premium paid on the redemption of $8.6 million, which is included as a cash outflow from financing activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows, and a write off of $2.5 million of unamortized debt issue costs.
in may 2013, the partnership privately placed $625.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 41⁄4% notes. the 41⁄4% notes resulted in approximately $618.1 million of net proceeds, which were used to reduce borrowings under the trp revolver and for general partnership purposes.
in june 2013, the partnership paid $106.4 million plus accrued interest, which included a premium of $6.4 million, to redeem $100.0 million of the outstanding 63⁄8% notes. the redemption resulted in a $7.4 million loss on debt redemption, including the write-off of $1.0 million of unamortized debt issue costs.
in july 2013, the partnership paid $76.8 million plus accrued interest, which included a premium of $4.1 million, per the terms of the note agreement to redeem the outstanding balance of the 111⁄4% notes. the redemption resulted in a $7.4 million loss on debt redemption in the third quarter 2013, including the write-off of $1.0 million of unamortized debt issue costs.
in october 2014, the partnership privately placed $800.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 41⁄8% senior notes due 2019 (the "41⁄8% notes"). the 41⁄8% notes resulted in approximately $790.8 million of net proceeds, which were used to reduce borrowings under the trp revolver and securitization facility and for general partnership purposes.
in november 2014, the partnership redeemed the outstanding 77⁄8% notes at a price of 103.938% plus accrued interest through the redemption date. the redemption resulted in a $12.4 million loss on redemption for the year ended 2014, consisting of premiums paid of $9.9 million and a non-cash loss to write-off $2.5 million of unamortized debt issue costs.
the terms of the senior unsecured notes outstanding as of december 31, 2014 were as follows:
"41⁄8% notes"   october 2014                         41⁄8%   november 15, 2019   may &amp; november 15th all issues of unsecured senior notes are obligations that rank pari passu in right of payment with existing and future senior indebtedness, including indebtedness under the trp revolver. they are senior in right of payment to any of the partnership's future subordinated indebtedness and are unconditionally guaranteed by the partnership. these notes are effectively subordinated to all secured indebtedness under the trp revolver, which is secured by a majority of its assets and the partnership's securitization facility, which is secured by accounts receivable pledged under it, to the extent of the value of the collateral securing that indebtedness. interest on all issues of senior unsecured notes is payable semi-annually in arrears.
the partnership's senior unsecured notes and associated indenture agreements restrict its ability to make distributions to unitholders in the event of default (as defined in the indentures). the indentures also restrict the partnership's ability and the ability of certain of the partnership's subsidiaries to: (i) incur additional debt or enter into sale and leaseback transactions; (ii) pay certain distributions on or repurchase equity interests (only if such distributions do not meet specified conditions); (iii) make certain investments; (iv) incur liens; (v) enter into transactions with affiliates; (vi) merge or consolidate with another company; and (vii) transfer and sell assets. these covenants are subject to a number of important exceptions and qualifications. if at any time when the notes are rated investment grade by both moody's and s&p (or rated investment grade by either moody's or s&p for the 63⁄8% notes, 51⁄4% notes, 41⁄4% notes and 41⁄8% notes) and no default or event of default (each as defined in the indentures) has occurred and is continuing, many of such covenants will terminate and we will cease to be subject to such covenants.
accounts receivable securitization facility the securitization facility provides up to $300.0 million of borrowing capacity at libor market index rates plus a margin through december 11, 2015. under the securitization facility, two of the partnership's consolidated subsidiaries (targa liquids marketing and trade llc ("tlmt") and targa gas marketing llc ("tgm")) sell or contribute receivables, without recourse, to another of its consolidated subsidiaries (targa receivables llc or "trllc"), a special purpose consolidated subsidiary created for the sole purpose of the securitization facility. trllc, in turn, sells an undivided percentage ownership in the eligible receivables to a third-party financial institution. receivables up to the amount of the outstanding debt under the securitization facility are not available to satisfy the claims of the creditors of tlmt, tgm or the partnership. any excess receivables are eligible to satisfy the claims of creditors of tlmt, tgm or the partnership. as of december 31, 2014, total funding under the securitization facility was $182.8 million.

critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in accordance with gaap requires our management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the period. actual results could differ from these estimates. the policies and estimates discussed below are considered by management to be critical to an understanding of our financial statements because their application requires the most significant judgments from management in estimating matters for financial reporting that are inherently uncertain. see the description of our accounting policies in the notes to the financial statements for additional information about our critical accounting policies and estimates.
property, plant and equipment and intangibles in general, depreciation and amortization is the systematic and rational allocation of an asset's cost, less its residual value (if any), to the period it benefits. our and the partnership's property, plant and equipment are depreciated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets. the estimate of depreciation incorporates assumptions regarding the useful economic lives and residual values of our assets. amortization expense attributable to intangible assets is recorded in a manner that closely resembles the expected pattern in which the partnership benefits from services provided to its customers. at the time assets are placed in service, we believe such assumptions are reasonable; however, circumstances may develop that would cause us to change these assumptions, which would change our depreciation/amortization amounts prospectively. examples of such circumstances include:
•   changes in energy prices;
•   changes in competition;
•   changes in laws and regulations that limit the estimated economic life of an asset;
•   changes in technology that render an asset obsolete;
•   changes in expected salvage values; and
•   changes in the forecast life of applicable resources basins.
we and the partnership evaluate long-lived assets, including related intangibles, of identifiable business activities for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate, in management's judgment, that the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable. as a result of this evaluation, the carrying value of gas processing facilities in the coastal gathering and processing segment and other was reduced by $7.3 million during the year ended december 31, 2014 as a result of reduced forecasted gas processing volumes due to market conditions and processing spreads in louisiana in the fourth quarter of 2014. these carrying value adjustments are included in depreciation and amortization expenses on our consolidated statements of operations. there have been no other significant changes impacting long-lived assets.
revenue recognition the partnership's operating revenues are primarily derived from the following activities:
•   sales of natural gas, ngls, condensate and petroleum products;
•   services related to compressing, gathering, treating, and processing of natural gas;
•   services related to gathering, storing and terminaling of crude oil; and
•   services related to ngl fractionation, terminaling and storage, transportation and treating.
we recognize revenues when all of the following criteria are met: (1) persuasive evidence of an exchange arrangement exists, if applicable; (2) delivery has occurred or services have been rendered; (3) the price is fixed or determinable and (4) collectability is reasonably assured.
price risk management (hedging)
the partnership's net income and cash flows are subject to volatility stemming from changes in commodity prices and interest rates. to reduce the volatility of our cash flows, the partnership has entered into derivative financial instruments related to a portion of its equity volumes to manage the purchase and sales prices of commodities. we are exposed to the credit risk of the partnership's counterparties in these derivative financial instruments. we also monitor ngl inventory levels with a view to mitigating losses related to downward price exposure.
the partnership's cash flow is affected by the derivative financial instruments it enters into to the extent these instruments are settled by (i) making or receiving a payment to/from the counterparty or (ii) making or receiving a payment for entering into a contract that exactly offsets the original derivative financial instrument. typically a derivative financial instrument is settled when the physical transaction that underlies the derivative financial instrument occurs.
one of the primary factors that can affect the partnership's operating results each period is the price assumptions used to value the partnership's derivative financial instruments, which are reflected at their fair values in the balance sheet. the relationship between the derivative financial instruments and the hedged item must be highly effective in achieving the offset of changes in cash flows attributable to the hedged risk both at the inception of the derivative financial instrument and on an ongoing basis. hedge accounting is discontinued prospectively when a derivative financial instrument becomes ineffective. gains and losses deferred in other comprehensive income related to cash flow hedges for which hedge accounting has been discontinued remain deferred until the forecasted transaction occurs. if it is probable that a hedged forecasted transaction will not occur, deferred gains or losses on the derivative financial instrument are reclassified to earnings immediately.
the estimated fair value of the partnership's derivative financial instruments was a net asset of $55.0 million as of december 31, 2014, net of an adjustment for credit risk. the credit risk adjustment is based on the default probabilities by year as indicated by the counterparties' credit default swap transactions. these default probabilities have been applied to the unadjusted fair values of the derivative financial instruments to arrive at the credit risk adjustment, which is immaterial for all periods covered by this annual report. the partnership has an active credit management process which is focused on controlling loss exposure to bankruptcies or other liquidity issues of counterparties.
use of estimates when preparing financial statements in conformity with gaap, management must make estimates and assumptions based on information available at the time. these estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, as well as the disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements. estimates and judgments are based on information available at the time such estimates and judgments are made. adjustments made with respect to the use of these estimates and judgments often relate to information not previously available. uncertainties with respect to such estimates and judgments are inherent in the preparation of financial statements. estimates and judgments are used in, among other things, (1) estimating unbilled revenues, product purchases and operating and general and administrative costs, (2) developing fair value assumptions, including estimates of future cash flows and discount rates, (3) analyzing long-lived assets for possible impairment, (4) estimating the useful lives of assets and (5) determining amounts to accrue for contingencies, guarantees and indemnifications. actual results, therefore, could differ materially from estimated amounts.

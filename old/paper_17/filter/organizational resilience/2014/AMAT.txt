item 1a:   risk factors the following factors could materially and adversely affect applied's business, financial condition or results of operations and cause reputational harm, and they should be carefully considered in evaluating the company and its business, in addition to other information presented elsewhere in this report.
as a supplier to the global semiconductor, flat panel display, and solar industries, applied is subject to business cycles, the timing, length and volatility of which can be difficult to predict and which vary by reportable segment. these industries historically have been cyclical due to sudden changes in customers' requirements for new manufacturing capacity and advanced technology, which depend in part on customers' capacity utilization, production volumes, access to affordable capital, end-use demand, consumer buying patterns, and inventory levels relative to demand, as well as the rate of technology transitions and general economic conditions. these changes have affected the timing and amounts of customers' purchases and investments in technology, and continue to affect applied's orders, net sales, operating expenses and net income.
to meet rapidly changing demand in the industries it serves, applied must accurately forecast demand and effectively manage its resources and production capacity for each of its segments as well as across multiple segments, and may incur unexpected or additional costs to align its business operations. during periods of increasing demand for its products, applied must have sufficient manufacturing capacity and inventory to meet customer demand; effectively manage its supply chain; attract, retain and motivate a sufficient number of qualified employees; and continue to control costs. during periods of decreasing demand, applied must reduce costs and align its cost structure with prevailing market conditions; effectively manage its supply chain; and motivate and retain key employees.
applied is exposed to risks associated with the uncertain global economy.
uncertain global economic conditions and weak or moderate growth in china, europe, and the united states, along with uncertainties in the financial markets, national debt and fiscal concerns in various regions, and government austerity measures, are posing challenges to the industries in which applied operates. the markets for semiconductors and flat panel displays in particular depend largely on consumer spending, while the solar market depends in part on government incentives and the availability of financing for pv installations. economic uncertainty and related factors exacerbate negative trends in business and consumer spending and may cause certain applied customers to push out, cancel, or refrain from placing orders for equipment or services, which may in turn reduce applied's net sales, reduce backlog, and affect applied's ability to convert backlog to sales. uncertain market conditions, difficulties in obtaining capital, or reduced profitability may also cause some customers to scale back operations, exit businesses, merge with other manufacturers, or file for bankruptcy protection and potentially cease operations, which can also result in lower sales and/or additional inventory or bad debt expense for applied. these conditions may similarly affect key suppliers, which could impair their ability to deliver parts and result in delays for applied's products or added costs. in addition, these conditions may lead to strategic alliances by, or consolidation of, other equipment manufacturers, which could adversely affect applied's ability to compete effectively.
uncertainty about future economic and industry conditions also makes it more challenging for applied to forecast its operating results, make business decisions, and identify and prioritize the risks that may affect its businesses, sources and uses of cash, financial condition and results of operations. applied may be required to implement additional cost reduction efforts, including restructuring activities, which may adversely affect applied's ability to capitalize on opportunities. in addition, applied maintains an investment portfolio that is subject to general credit, liquidity, foreign exchange, market and interest rate risks. the risks to applied's investment portfolio may be exacerbated if financial market conditions deteriorate and, as a result, the value and liquidity of the investment portfolio, as well as returns on pension assets, could be negatively impacted and lead to impairment charges. applied also maintains cash balances in various bank accounts globally in order to fund normal operations. if any of these financial institutions becomes insolvent, it could limit applied's ability to access cash in the affected accounts.
applied is exposed to risks as a result of ongoing changes in the various industries in which it operates.
the global semiconductor, flat panel display, solar and related industries in which applied operates are characterized by ongoing changes affecting some or all of these industries that impact demand for and/or the profitability of applied's products, including:
•   the nature, timing and degree of visibility of changes in end demand for electronic products, including those related to fluctuations in consumer buying patterns tied to seasonality or the introduction of new products, and the effects of these changes on foundry and other customers' businesses and, in turn, on demand for applied's products;
•   increasing capital requirements for building and operating new fabrication plants and customers' ability to raise the necessary capital;
•   differences in growth rates among the semiconductor, display and solar industries;
•   the increasing importance of establishing, improving and maintaining strong relationships with customers;
•   the increasing cost and complexity for customers to move from product design to volume manufacturing, which may slow the adoption rate of new manufacturing technology;
•   the need to continually reduce the total cost of manufacturing system ownership, due in part to greater demand for lower-cost consumer electronics compared to business information technology spending;
•   the heightened importance to customers of system reliability and productivity and the effect on demand for fabrication systems as a result of their increasing productivity, device yield and reliability;
•   manufacturers' ability to reconfigure and re-use fabrication systems;
•   the increasing importance of, and difficulties in, developing products with sufficient differentiation to influence customers' purchasing decisions;
•   requirements for shorter cycle times for the development, manufacture and installation of manufacturing equipment;
•   price and performance trends for semiconductor devices, displays and solar pvs, and the corresponding effect on demand for such products;
•   the increasing importance of the availability of spare parts to maximize the time that customers' systems are available for production;
•   the increasing role for and complexity of software in applied products; and
•   the increasing focus on reducing energy usage and improving the environmental impact and sustainability associated with manufacturing operations.
applied is exposed to risks as a result of ongoing changes specific to the semiconductor industry.
the largest proportion of applied's consolidated net sales and profitability has been and continues to be derived from sales of manufacturing equipment by the silicon systems group to the global semiconductor industry. in addition, a majority of the revenues of applied global services is from sales of service products to semiconductor manufacturers. the semiconductor industry is characterized by ongoing changes particular to this industry that impact demand for and/or the profitability of applied's semiconductor equipment and service products, including:
•   the increasing cost of research and development due to many factors, including: decreasing linewidths on a chip, the use of new materials, new and more complex device structures, more applications and process steps, increasing chip design costs, and the increasing cost and complexity of integrated manufacturing processes;
•   the need to reduce product development time, despite the increasing difficulty of technical challenges;
•   the growing number of types and varieties of semiconductors and number of applications across multiple substrate sizes;
•   the increasing cost and complexity for semiconductor manufacturers to move more technically advanced capability and smaller linewidths to volume manufacturing, and the resulting impact on the rates of technology transition and investment in capital equipment;
•   challenges in generating organic growth given semiconductor manufacturers' levels of capital expenditures and the allocation of capital investment to market segments that applied does not serve, such as lithography, or segments where applied's products have lower relative market presence;
•   the importance of increasing market positions in under-penetrated segments, such as etch and inspection;
•   the adoption of cloud-based memory storage particularly for mobility products, and the associated inhibiting effect on nand bit growth rates;
•   the increasing frequency and complexity of technology transitions and inflections, such as 3-d transistors and advanced interconnects, and applied's ability to timely and effectively anticipate and adapt to these changes;
•   shorter cycle times between order placements by customers (particularly foundries) and product shipment, which may lead to inventory write-offs and manufacturing inefficiencies that decrease gross margin;
•   competitive factors that make it difficult to enhance position, including challenges in securing development-tool-of-record (dtor) and production-tool-of-record (ptor) positions with customers;
•   shifts in sourcing strategies by computer and electronics companies that impact the equipment requirements of applied's foundry customers;
•   the concentration of new wafer starts in korea and taiwan, where applied's service penetration and service-revenue-per-wafer-start have been lower than in other regions; and
•   the increasing fragmentation of semiconductor markets, leading certain markets to become too small to support the cost of a new fabrication plant, while others require less technologically advanced products.
applied must accurately forecast, and allocate appropriate resources and investment towards addressing, key technology changes and inflections, such as the transition to 20nm devices, in order to enable opportunities for gains. in addition, the proposed industry transition from 300mm to 450mm wafers presents opportunities as well as risks and uncertainties, including those related to cost, technical complexity, timing, and the resulting effect on demand for manufacturing equipment and services.
applied is exposed to risks as a result of ongoing changes specific to the flat panel display industry.
the global flat panel display industry historically has experienced considerable volatility in capital equipment investment levels, due in part to the limited number of display manufacturers, the concentrated nature of end-use applications, excess production capacity relative to end-use demand, and panel manufacturer profitability. industry growth has depended primarily on consumer demand for increasingly larger and more advanced tvs and, more recently, on demand for smartphones and other mobile devices, which demand is highly sensitive to cost and improvements in technologies and features. the display industry is characterized by ongoing changes particular to this industry that impact demand for and/or the profitability of applied's display products, including:
•   the timing and extent of an expansion of manufacturing facilities in china by chinese display manufacturers and manufacturers from other countries, and the ability of non-chinese manufacturers to obtain government approvals on a timely basis;
•   the rate of transition to larger substrate sizes for tvs and the resulting effect on capital intensity in the industry and on applied's product differentiation, gross margin and return on investment;
•   the importance of new types of display technologies, such as low temperature polysilicon (ltps), organic light-emitting diode (oled) and metal oxide, and new touch panel films, such as anti-reflective and anti-fingerprint; and
•   uncertainty with respect to future display technology end-use applications and growth drivers.
applied is exposed to risks as a result of ongoing changes specific to the solar industry.
investment levels in capital equipment for the global solar industry have experienced considerable volatility. in recent years, global solar pv production capacity has exceeded end-use demand, causing customers to significantly reduce or delay investments in manufacturing capacity and new technology, or to cease operations. the global solar market is characterized by ongoing changes specific to this industry that impact demand for and/or the profitability of applied's solar products, including:
•   the need to continually decrease the cost-per-watt of electricity produced by solar pv products to at or below grid parity in more global regions by, among other things, reducing operating costs and increasing throughputs for solar pv manufacturing, and improving the conversion efficiency of solar pvs;
•   the variability and uncertainty of government energy policies and their effect in influencing the rate of growth of the solar pv market, including the availability and amount of incentives for solar power such as tax credits, feed-in tariffs, rebates, renewable portfolio standards that require electricity providers to sell a targeted amount of energy from renewable sources, and goals for solar installations on government facilities;
•   the number of solar pv manufacturers and amount of global production capacity for solar pvs, primarily in china;
•   the filing of regulatory unfair trade proceedings against solar pvs from china, where most of applied's solar equipment sales are concentrated, which has resulted in the assessment of duties on solar cells and modules imported from china and led to other trade-related conflicts and outcomes;
•   the varying levels of operating and industry experience among solar pv manufacturers and the resulting differences in the nature and extent of customer support services requested from applied;
•   challenges associated with marketing and selling manufacturing equipment and services to a diverse and diffuse customer base;
•   the growth of market segments in which applied does not participate, such as passivation and furnaces;
•   the availability and condition of used solar equipment, which impacts demand for new equipment;
•   complexities associated with government-affiliated entities as customers, for example in china;
•   the financial condition of solar pv customers and their access to affordable financing and capital; and
•   solar panel manufacturing overcapacity, which has led to weak industry operating performance and outlooks, deterioration of the solar equipment market, and a worsening of the financial condition of certain customers.
applied must continually innovate, commercialize its products, and adapt its business and product offerings to respond to competition and rapid technological changes.
as applied operates in a highly competitive environment in which innovation is critical, its future success depends on many factors, including the effective commercialization and customer acceptance of its equipment, services and related products. in addition, applied must successfully execute its growth strategy, including enhancing its presence in existing markets, expanding into related markets, cultivating new markets and exceeding industry growth rates, while constantly improving its operational performance. the development, introduction and support of a broadening set of products in more collaborative, geographically diverse, open and varied competitive environments have grown more complex and expensive over time. furthermore, new or improved products may entail higher costs and reduced profits. applied's performance may be adversely affected if it does not timely, cost-effectively and successfully:
•   identify and address technology inflections, market changes, new applications, customer requirements and end-use demand;
•   develop new products (including disruptive technologies), improve and/or develop new applications for existing products, and adapt similar products for use by customers in different applications and/or markets with varying technical requirements;
•   differentiate its products from those of competitors and any disruptive technologies, meet customers' performance specifications, appropriately price products, and achieve market acceptance;
•   maintain operating flexibility to enable different responses to different markets, customers and applications;
•   enhance its worldwide operations across all business segments to reduce cycle time, enable continuous quality improvement, reduce costs, and enhance design for manufacturability and serviceability;
•   focus on product development and sales and marketing strategies that address customers' high value problems and foster strong customer relationships;
•   allocate resources, including people and r&amp;d funding, among applied's products and between the development of new products and the enhancement of existing products, as most appropriate and effective for future growth;
•   reduce the cost and improve the productivity of capital invested in r&amp;d activities;
•   improve its manufacturing processes and achieve cost efficiencies across product offerings;
•   adapt to changes in value offered by companies in different parts of the supply chain;
•   qualify products for evaluation and, in turn, volume manufacturing with its customers; and
•   implement changes in its design engineering methodology, including those that enable reduction of material costs and cycle time, greater commonality of platforms and types of parts used in different systems, greater effectiveness of product life cycle management, and reduced energy usage and environmental impact.
applied is exposed to risks associated with a highly concentrated customer base.
applied's semiconductor customer base historically has been, and is becoming even more, highly concentrated as a result of economic and industry conditions. in fiscal 2014, three semiconductor manufacturers accounted for approximately 54 percent of silicon systems group net sales and two customers accounted for 33 percent of applied's consolidated net sales. applied's display customer base is also highly concentrated, while concentration within applied's solar customer base varies depending on the product line but is increasing due to challenging industry conditions. applied's customer base is also geographically-concentrated. see item 2, "management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations," for tabular presentations of net sales by geographic region.
in addition, certain customers have experienced significant ownership or management changes, consolidated with other manufacturers, outsourced manufacturing activities, or engaged in collaboration or cooperation arrangements with other manufacturers. customers have entered into strategic alliances or industry consortia that have increased the influence of key industry participants in technology decisions made by their partners. also, certain customers are making an increasingly greater percentage of their respective industry's capital equipment investments. further, claims or litigation involving key industry participants have resulted and may continue to result in changes in their sourcing strategies and other outcomes. in this environment, contracts or orders from a relatively limited number of manufacturers have accounted for, and are expected to continue to account for, a substantial portion of applied's business. the mix and type of customers, and sales to any single customer, may vary significantly from quarter to quarter and from year to year. as applied's products are configured to customer specifications, changing, rescheduling or canceling orders may result in significant, non-recoverable costs. if customers do not place orders, or they substantially reduce, delay or cancel orders, applied may not be able to replace the business, which could have a material adverse effect on the company's results of operations. major customers may also seek, and on occasion receive, pricing, payment, intellectual property-related, or other commercial terms that are less favorable to applied.
applied is exposed to the risks of operating a global business.
in fiscal 2014, approximately 78 percent of applied's net sales were to customers in regions outside the united states. moreover, china now represents the largest market for various electronic products, such as tvs, pcs, and smartphones. certain of applied's r&d and manufacturing facilities, as well as suppliers to applied, are also located outside the united states, including in singapore, taiwan, china, korea, israel, germany and italy. applied is also expanding its business and operations in new countries. the global nature of applied's business and operations, combined with the need to continually improve the company's operating cost structure, presents challenges, including but not limited to those arising from:
•   varying regional and geopolitical business conditions and demands;
•   political and social attitudes, laws, rules, regulations and policies within countries that favor domestic companies over non-domestic companies, including customer- or government-supported efforts to promote the development and growth of local competitors;
•   customer- or government-supported efforts to influence applied to conduct more of its operations and sourcing in a particular country, such as korea and china;
•   variations among, and changes in, local, regional, national or international laws and regulations (including intellectual property, labor, tax, and import/export laws), as well as the interpretation and application of such laws and regulations;
•   global trade issues, including those related to the interpretation and application of import and export licenses, as well as international trade disputes;
•   positions taken by governmental agencies regarding possible national commercial and/or security issues posed by international business operations;
•   challenges associated with managing more geographically diverse operations and projects, which require an effective organizational structure and appropriate business processes, procedures and controls;
•   a more diverse workforce with different experience levels, cultures, customs, business practices and worker expectations;
•   variations in the ability to develop relationships with local customers, suppliers and governments;
•   fluctuations in interest rates and currency exchange rates, including the relative strength or weakness of the u.s. dollar against the japanese yen, euro, taiwanese dollar, israeli shekel or chinese yuan;
•   the need to provide sufficient levels of technical support in different locations around the world;
•   political instability, natural disasters (such as earthquakes, floods or storms), pandemics, social unrest, terrorism or acts of war in locations where applied has operations, suppliers or sales, or that may influence the value chain of the industries that applied serves;
•   the need for an effective business continuity plan if a disaster or other event occurs that could disrupt business operations;
•   the need to regularly reassess the size, capability and location of global infrastructure and make appropriate changes;
•   hiring and integration of an increasing number of new workers, including in countries such as india and china;
•   uncertainties with respect to economic growth rates in various countries; and
•   uncertainties with respect to growth rates for the manufacture and sale of semiconductors, displays and solar pvs in the developing economies of certain countries.
many of these challenges are present in china and korea, which are experiencing significant growth of customers, suppliers and competitors to applied. applied further believes that china and korea present large potential markets for its products and opportunity for growth over the long term, although at lower projected levels of profitability and margins for certain products than historically have been achieved in other regions.
applied is exposed to risks associated with business combinations, acquisitions and strategic investments.
applied has made, and in the future may make, acquisitions of or investments in companies, technologies or products in existing, related or new markets for applied. business combinations, acquisitions and investments involve numerous risks that vary depending on their scale and nature, including but not limited to:
•   diversion of management's attention from other operational matters;
•   contractual restrictions on the conduct of applied's business during the pendency of a proposed transaction;
•   the failure of acquired businesses to meet or exceed expected returns;
•   requirements imposed by government regulators in connection with their review of a transaction, which may include, among other things, divestitures and/or restrictions on the conduct of applied's existing business or the acquired business;
•   ineffective integration of operations, systems, technologies, products or employees, which can impact the ability to realize anticipated synergies or other benefits;
•   inability to capitalize on characteristics of new markets that may be significantly different from applied's existing markets and where competitors may have stronger market positions and customer relationships;
•   the potential impact of the announcement or consummation of a proposed transaction on relationships with third parties;
•   potential changes in applied's credit rating, which could adversely impact the company's access to and cost of capital;
•   reductions in cash balances and/or increases in debt obligations to finance activities associated with a transaction, which reduce the availability of cash flow for general corporate or other purposes;
•   exposure to new operational risks, rules, regulations, worker expectations, customs and practices to the extent acquired businesses are located in regions where applied has not historically conducted business;
•   inadequacy or ineffectiveness of an acquired company's internal financial controls, disclosure controls and procedures, and/or environmental, health and safety, anti-corruption, human resource, or other policies or practices;
•   impairment of acquired intangible assets and goodwill as a result of changing business conditions, technological advancements or worse-than-expected performance of the segment;
•   the risk of litigation or claims associated with a proposed or completed transaction;
•   unknown, underestimated and/or undisclosed commitments or liabilities; and
•   the inappropriate scale of acquired entities' critical resources or facilities for business needs.
applied also makes strategic investments in other companies, including companies formed as joint ventures, which may decline in value and/or not meet desired objectives. the success of these investments depends on various factors over which applied may have limited or no control and, particularly with respect to joint ventures, requires ongoing and effective cooperation with strategic partners. the risks to applied's strategic investment portfolio may be exacerbated by unfavorable financial market and macroeconomic conditions and, as a result, the value of the investment portfolio could be negatively impacted and lead to impairment charges.
the proposed business combination with tokyo electron limited may not be completed or, if completed, the intended benefits may not be fully realized.
on september 24, 2013, applied announced an agreement with tokyo electron limited (tel), a japanese corporation and global supplier of semiconductor and flat panel display production equipment, and provider of technical support and services for semiconductor, flat panel display and pv panel production equipment, to effect a strategic combination of their respective businesses. under the agreement, which was amended february 14, 2014, the closing of the transaction is subject to customary conditions, including regulatory approvals. the proposed business combination is subject to the risk factors described immediately above, including the risks that the combination may not be consummated in a timely manner or at all; that required  regulatory approvals may not be obtained or may be subject to conditions that reduce the estimated benefits of the combination; that the businesses, operations, systems, technologies, products or employees of applied and tel may not be integrated successfully; and, following completion of the transaction, that ineffective integration, changes in laws or regulations, including tax laws or other factors, may impact the combined company's ability to realize anticipated synergies and benefits.
operating in multiple industries, and the entry into new markets and industries, entail additional challenges and obligations.
as part of its growth strategy, applied must successfully expand into related or new markets and industries, either with its existing products or with new products developed internally or obtained through acquisitions. the entry into different markets involves additional challenges, including those arising from:
•   the need to devote additional resources to develop new products for, and operate in, new markets;
•   the need to develop new sales and technical marketing strategies, cultivate relationships with new customers and meet different customer service requirements;
•   differing rates of profitability and growth among multiple businesses;
•   applied's ability to anticipate demand, capitalize on opportunities, and avoid or minimize risks;
•   the complexity of managing multiple businesses with variations in production planning, execution, supply chain management and logistics;
•   the adoption of new business models, business processes and systems;
•   applied's ability to rapidly expand or reduce its operations to meet increased or decreased demand, respectively, and the associated effect on working capital;
•new materials, processes and technologies;
•   the need to attract, motivate and retain employees with skills and expertise in these new areas;
•   new and more diverse customers and suppliers, including some with limited operating histories, uncertain and/or limited funding, evolving business models and/or locations in regions where applied does not have, or has limited, operations;
•   new or different competitors with potentially more financial or other resources, industry experience and/or established customer relationships;
•   entry into new industries and countries, with differing levels of government involvement, laws and regulations, and business, employment and safety practices;
•   the need to comply with, or work to establish, industry standards and practices.
in addition, applied from time to time receives funding from united states and other government agencies for certain strategic development programs to increase its research and development resources and address new market opportunities. as a condition to this government funding, applied may be subject to certain record-keeping, audit, intellectual property rights-sharing and/or other obligations.
manufacturing interruptions or delays could affect applied's ability to meet customer demand and lead to higher costs, while the failure to estimate customer demand accurately could result in excess or obsolete inventory.
applied's business depends on its timely supply of equipment, services and related products that meet the rapidly changing technical and volume requirements of its customers, which depends in part on the timely delivery of parts, components and subassemblies (collectively, parts) from suppliers, including contract manufacturers. some key parts are subject to long lead-times and/or obtainable only from a single supplier or limited group of suppliers, and some sourcing or subassembly is provided by suppliers located in countries other than the countries where applied conducts its manufacturing, including china and korea. cyclical industry conditions and the volatility of demand for manufacturing equipment increase capital, technical, operational and other risks for applied and for companies throughout its supply chain. further, these conditions may cause some suppliers to scale back operations, exit businesses, merge with other companies, or file for bankruptcy protection and possibly cease operations. applied may also experience significant interruptions of its manufacturing operations, delays in its ability to deliver products or services, increased costs or customer order cancellations as a result of:
•   the failure or inability of suppliers to timely deliver sufficient quantities of quality parts on a cost-effective basis;
•   volatility in the availability and cost of materials, including rare earth elements;
•   information technology or infrastructure failures; and
•   natural disasters or other events beyond applied's control (such as earthquakes, floods or storms, regional economic downturns, pandemics, social unrest, political instability, terrorism, or acts of war), particularly where it conducts manufacturing.
if a supplier fails to meet applied's requirements concerning quality, cost, socially-responsible business practices, or other performance factors, applied may transfer its business to alternative sources, which could entail manufacturing delays, additional costs, or other difficulties. in addition, if applied needs to rapidly increase its business and manufacturing capacity to meet increases in demand or expedited shipment schedules, this may exacerbate any interruptions in applied's manufacturing operations and supply chain and the associated effect on applied's working capital. moreover, if actual demand for applied's products is different than expected, applied may purchase more/fewer parts than necessary or incur costs for canceling, postponing or expediting delivery of parts. if applied purchases inventory in anticipation of customer demand that does not materialize, or if customers reduce or delay orders, applied may incur excess inventory charges.
the ability to attract, retain and motivate key employees is vital to applied's success.
applied's success, competitiveness and ability to execute on its global strategies and maintain a culture of innovation depend in large part on its ability to attract, retain and motivate key employees, especially in critical positions. achieving this objective may be difficult due to many factors, including fluctuations in global economic and industry conditions, management changes, applied's organizational structure, hiring practices of competitors and other companies, cost reduction activities (including workforce reductions and unpaid shutdowns), availability of career development opportunities, the ability to obtain necessary authorizations for workers to provide services outside their home countries, and the effectiveness of applied's compensation and benefit programs, including its share-based programs. restructuring programs present particular challenges to the extent they involve the departure of knowledgeable and experienced employees and the resulting need to identify and train existing or new workers to perform necessary functions, which may result in unexpected costs, reduced productivity, and/or difficulties with respect to internal processes and controls.
applied is exposed to various risks related to protection and enforcement of intellectual property rights.
applied's success depends in significant part on the protection of its intellectual property and other rights. infringement of applied's rights by a third party, such as the unauthorized manufacture or sale of equipment or spare parts, could result in uncompensated lost market and revenue opportunities for applied. policing any unauthorized use of intellectual property is difficult and costly and applied cannot be certain that the measures it has implemented will prevent misuse. applied's intellectual property rights may not provide significant competitive advantages if they are circumvented, invalidated, rendered obsolete by the rapid pace of technological change, or if applied does not adequately protect or assert these rights or obtain necessary licenses on commercially reasonable terms. furthermore, the laws and practices of other countries, including china, india, taiwan and korea, permit the protection and enforcement of applied's rights to varying extents, which may not be sufficient to adequately protect applied's rights. in addition, changes in intellectual property laws or their interpretation, such as recent changes in u.s. patent laws, may impact applied's ability to protect and assert its intellectual property rights, increase costs and uncertainties in the prosecution of patent applications and enforcement or defense of issued patents, and diminish the value of applied's intellectual property.
applied is exposed to risks related to cybersecurity threats and incidents.
in the conduct of its business, applied collects, uses, transmits and stores data on information technology systems. this data includes confidential information belonging to applied or its customers or other business partners, as well as personally-identifiable information of individuals. applied has experienced, and expects to continue to be subject to, cybersecurity threats and incidents, ranging from employee error or misuse to individual attempts to gain unauthorized access to information systems to sophisticated and targeted measures known as advanced persistent threats, none of which have been material to the company to date. applied devotes significant resources to network security, data encryption and other measures to protect its systems and data from unauthorized access or misuse. however, depending on their nature and scope, cybersecurity incidents could result in business disruption; the misappropriation, corruption or loss of confidential information and critical data (applied's and that of third parties); reputational damage; litigation with third parties; diminution in the value of applied's investment in research, development and engineering; data privacy issues; and increased cybersecurity protection and remediation costs.
applied is exposed to various risks related to legal proceedings.
applied from time to time is, and in the future may be, involved in legal proceedings or claims regarding patent infringement, intellectual property rights, antitrust, environmental regulations, securities, contracts, product performance, product liability, unfair competition, misappropriation of trade secrets, employment, workplace safety, and other matters. applied also on occasion receives notification from customers who believe that applied owes them indemnification or other obligations related to claims made against such customers by third parties.
legal proceedings and claims, whether with or without merit, and associated internal investigations, may (1) be time-consuming and expensive to prosecute, defend or conduct; (2) divert management's attention and other applied resources; (3) inhibit applied's ability to sell its products; (4) result in adverse judgments for damages, injunctive relief, penalties and fines; and/or (5) negatively affect applied's business. there can be no assurance regarding the outcome of current or future legal proceedings, claims or investigations.
the failure to successfully implement and conduct outsourcing activities and other operational initiatives could adversely affect results of operations.
to better align its costs with market conditions, locate closer to customers, enhance productivity, and improve efficiencies, applied conducts certain engineering, software development, manufacturing, sourcing and other operations in regions outside the united states, including india, taiwan, china, and korea. applied has implemented a distributed manufacturing model, under which certain manufacturing and supply chain activities are conducted in various countries, including the united states, europe, israel, singapore, taiwan and other countries in asia, and assembly of some systems is completed at customer sites. in addition, applied outsources certain functions to third parties, including companies in the united states, india, china, korea, malaysia and other countries. outsourced functions include contract manufacturing, engineering, customer support, software development, information technology support, finance and administrative activities. the expanding role of third party providers has required changes to applied's existing operations and the adoption of new procedures and processes for retaining and managing these providers, as well as redistributing responsibilities as warranted, in order to realize the potential productivity and operational efficiencies, assure quality and continuity of supply, and protect the intellectual property of applied and its customers, suppliers and other partners. if applied does not accurately forecast the amount, timing and mix of demand for products, or if contract manufacturers or other outsource providers fail to perform in a timely manner or at satisfactory quality levels, applied's ability to meet customer requirements could suffer, particularly during a market upturn.
in addition, applied must regularly implement or update comprehensive programs and processes to better align its global organizations, including initiatives to enhance the asia supply chain and improve back office and information technology infrastructure for more efficient transaction processing. applied also is implementing a multi-year, company-wide program to transform certain business processes or extend established processes, including enhancements or replacements to certain enterprise resource planning (erp) software systems. the implementation of additional functionality to the erp system entails certain risks, including difficulties with changes in business processes that could disrupt applied's operations, such as its ability to track orders and timely ship products, project inventory requirements, manage its supply chain and aggregate financial and operational data. during transitions applied must continue to rely on legacy information systems, which may be costly or inefficient, while the implementation of new initiatives may not achieve the anticipated benefits and may divert management's attention from other operational activities, negatively affect employee morale, or have other unintended consequences.
if applied does not effectively develop and implement its outsourcing and relocation strategies, if required export and other governmental approvals are not timely obtained, if applied's third party providers do not perform as anticipated, or if there are delays or difficulties in enhancing business processes, applied may not realize anticipated productivity improvements or cost efficiencies, and may experience operational difficulties, increased costs (including energy and transportation), manufacturing interruptions or delays, inefficiencies in the structure and/or operation of its supply chain, loss of its intellectual property rights, quality issues, reputational harm, increased product time-to-market, and/or inefficient allocation of human resources.
applied may incur impairment charges to goodwill or long-lived assets.
applied has a significant amount of goodwill and other acquired intangible assets related to acquisitions. goodwill and purchased intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are not amortized, but are reviewed for impairment annually during the fourth quarter of each fiscal year, and more frequently when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable. the review compares the fair value for each of applied's reporting units to its associated carrying value, including goodwill. factors that could lead to impairment of goodwill and intangible assets include adverse industry or economic trends, reduced estimates of future cash flows, declines in the market price of applied common stock, changes in applied's strategies or product portfolio, and restructuring activities. applied's valuation methodology for assessing impairment requires management to make judgments and assumptions based on historical experience and projections of future operating performance. applied may be required to record future charges to earnings during the period in which an impairment of goodwill or intangible assets is determined to exist.
changes in tax rates or tax assets and liabilities could affect results of operations.
as a global company, applied is subject to taxation in the united states and various other countries. significant judgment is required to determine and estimate worldwide tax liabilities. applied's future annual and quarterly tax rates could be affected by numerous factors, including changes in the: (1) applicable tax laws; (2) amount and composition of pre-tax income in countries with differing tax rates; (3) plans of the company to permanently reinvest certain funds held outside of the u.s.; and (4) valuation of applied's deferred tax assets and liabilities. as of october 26, 2014, applied intends to permanently reinvest approximately $2.1 billion of these funds outside of the u.s. and does not plan to repatriate these funds.
to better align with the international nature of its business, applied conducts certain manufacturing, supply chain, and other operations in asia, bringing these activities closer to customers and reducing operating costs. applied has received authorization to use tax incentives that provide that income earned in certain countries outside the u.s. will be subject to tax holidays or reduced income tax rates. to obtain the benefit of these tax incentives, applied must meet requirements relating to various activities. applied's ability to realize benefits from these incentives could be materially affected if, among other things, applicable requirements are not met or applied incurs net losses for which it cannot claim a deduction.
in addition, applied is subject to regular examination by the internal revenue service and other tax authorities, and from time to time initiates amendments to previously filed tax returns. applied regularly assesses the likelihood of favorable or unfavorable outcomes resulting from these examinations and amendments to determine the adequacy of its provision for income taxes, which requires estimates and judgments. although applied believes its tax estimates are reasonable, there can be no assurance that the tax authorities will agree with such estimates. applied may have to engage in litigation to achieve the results reflected in the estimates, which may be time-consuming and expensive. there can be no assurance that applied will be successful or that any final determination will not be materially different from the treatment reflected in applied's historical income tax provisions and accruals.
applied is subject to risks of non-compliance with environmental and safety regulations.
applied is subject to environmental and safety regulations in connection with its global business operations, including but not limited to: regulations related to the development, manufacture and use of its products; recycling and disposal of materials used in its products or in producing its products; the operation of its facilities; and the use of its real property. the failure or inability to comply with existing or future environmental and safety regulations, such as those related to climate change, could result in: (1) significant remediation liabilities; (2) the imposition of fines; (3) the suspension or termination of the development, manufacture, sale or use of certain of its products; (4) limitations on the operation of its facilities or ability to use its real property; and/or (5) a decrease in the value of its real property.
applied is exposed to various risks related to the regulatory environment.
applied is subject to various risks related to: (1) new, different, inconsistent or conflicting laws, rules and regulations that may be enacted by executive order, legislative bodies or regulatory agencies in the countries in which applied operates; (2) disagreements or disputes between national or regional regulatory agencies related to international trade; and (3) the interpretation and application of laws, rules and regulations. as a public company with global operations, applied is subject to the laws of multiple jurisdictions and the rules and regulations of various governing bodies, including those related to financial and other disclosures, corporate governance, privacy, and anti-corruption. changes and ambiguities in laws, regulations and standards create uncertainty and challenges regarding compliance matters. efforts to comply with new and changing regulations have resulted in, and are likely to continue to result in, increased general and administrative expenses and a diversion of management time and attention from revenue-generating activities to compliance activities.
item 7:   management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations introduction management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (md&a) is intended to facilitate an understanding of applied's business and results of operations. this md&a should be read in conjunction with applied's consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form 10-k. the following discussion contains forward-looking statements and should also be read in conjunction with the cautionary statement set forth at the beginning of this form 10-k. md&a consists of the following sections:
•   overview: a summary of applied's business and measurements
•   results of operations: a discussion of operating results
•   segment information: a discussion of segment operating results
•   business combinations: a summary of announced or completed business combinations and acquisitions
•   recent accounting pronouncements: a discussion of new accounting pronouncements and its impact to applied's consolidated financial statements
•   financial condition, liquidity and capital resources: an analysis of cash flows, sources and uses of cash, contractual obligations and financial position
•   off-balance sheet arrangements and contractual obligations
•   critical accounting policies and estimates: a discussion of critical accounting policies that require the exercise of judgments and estimates
•   non-gaap adjusted results: a presentation of results reconciling gaap to non-gaap adjusted measures overview applied provides manufacturing equipment, services and software to the global semiconductor, flat panel display, solar photovoltaic (pv) and related industries. applied's customers include manufacturers of semiconductor wafers and chips, flat panel liquid crystal and other displays, solar pv cells and modules, and other electronic devices. these customers may use what they manufacture in their own end products or sell the items to other companies for use in advanced electronic components. applied operates in four reportable segments: silicon systems group, applied global services, display, and energy and environmental solutions. a summary of financial information for each reportable segment is found in note 16 of notes to consolidated financial statements. a discussion of factors that could affect applied's operations is set forth under "risk factors" in part i, item 1a, which is incorporated herein by reference. product development and manufacturing activities occur primarily in the united states, europe, israel, and asia. applied's broad range of equipment and service products are highly technical and are sold primarily through a direct sales force.
applied's results are driven primarily by worldwide demand for semiconductors, which in turn depends on end-user demand for electronic products. each of applied's businesses is subject to cyclical industry conditions, as demand for manufacturing equipment and services can change depending on supply and demand for chips, display technologies, solar pvs and other electronic devices, as well as other factors, such as global economic and market conditions, and the nature and timing of technological advances in fabrication processes. in addition, a significant driver in the semiconductor and display industries is end-demand for mobile consumer products, which is characterized by seasonality that impacts the timing of customer investments in manufacturing equipment and, in turn, applied's business. in light of these conditions, applied's results can vary significantly year-over-year, as well as quarter-over-quarter.
applied's strategic priorities for fiscal 2015 include growing its presence in wafer fab and display equipment and services, and improving profitability in solar, as well as expanding applied's overall available market.
on september 24, 2013, applied announced an agreement with tokyo electron limited (tel), a japanese corporation and global supplier of semiconductor, and flat panel display production equipment, and provider of technical support and services for semiconductor, flat panel display and pv panel production equipment, to effect a combination of their respective businesses into a new combined company. the combination is expected to bring together leading technologies and products and create an expanded set of capabilities in precision materials engineering and patterning. in june 2014, the shareholders of applied and tel approved the proposed business combination. under the agreement, which was amended february 14, 2014, the closing of the transaction is subject to customary conditions, including regulatory approvals.
results of operations the following table presents certain significant measurements for the past three fiscal years:

(1)   fiscal 2014 amount differs from the unaudited consolidated financial statements included in applied's press release issued on november 13, 2014, reflecting an increase to provision for income taxes of $34 million and a decrease to earnings per diluted share of $0.03. this adjustment is not considered material and does not affect applied's previously announced non-gaap adjusted results.
reconciliations of non-gaap adjusted measures are presented under "non-gaap adjusted results" below. fiscal 2014, 2013 and 2012 each contained 52 weeks.
mobility, including the increasing technological functionality of mobile devices, continued to be the largest driver of semiconductor industry spending in fiscal 2014. during the year, demand for advanced mobile chips drove continued demand for semiconductor equipment by foundry customers. in addition, demand for semiconductor equipment from memory customers improved as manufacturers invested in technology upgrades. mobility also represents a significant driver of display industry spending, which has resulted in continued manufacturing capacity expansion for mobile applications. demand for larger lcd tvs is also driving investment in display equipment, although the tv manufacturing sector remains susceptible to cyclical conditions. investment in solar equipment remained low during fiscal 2014, despite continued end-market growth, due to ongoing excess manufacturing capacity in the industry.
applied expects the mobility trend to remain the main growth driver for the semiconductor industry, and in turn for the silicon systems group, in 2015. the growth in the semiconductor manufacturing equipment industry is expected to be driven by foundry and memory spending. applied also expects display equipment investment to remain healthy in 2015.
fiscal 2013 was characterized by strong demand for semiconductor equipment from foundry customers driven by demand for advanced mobile chips. in the second half of fiscal 2013, demand from foundry customers softened, reflecting seasonal consumer buying patterns for mobility products, while demand from memory and logic customers improved. mobility also represented a significant driver of display industry spending, and demand for mobile display equipment remained strong during fiscal 2013. fiscal 2013 was also characterized by a recovery in demand for tv manufacturing equipment compared to weak industry levels in fiscal 2012, resulting from higher consumer demand in emerging markets and for larger lcd tvs. investment in solar equipment remained low during fiscal 2013 due to continued excess manufacturing capacity in the industry.
fiscal 2012 was characterized by significant fluctuations in demand for semiconductor equipment, coupled with an extremely weak market environment for display and solar equipment. applied completed its acquisition of varian semiconductor equipment associates, inc. (varian) in the first quarter of fiscal 2012. mobility was the greatest influence on semiconductor industry spending in fiscal 2012. investment levels for display equipment were low in fiscal 2012 due to decreased capacity requirements for larger flat panel televisions, while demand for mobility products, such as smartphones and tablets, significantly influenced equipment spending. in the solar industry, fiscal 2012 was characterized by excess manufacturing capacity, which led to significantly reduced demand for crystalline-silicon (c-si) equipment, as well as weak operating performance and outlook.
2014                                                                        change                           2013               change                           2012

new orders increased in fiscal 2014 from fiscal 2013 across all segments, primarily due to higher demand for semiconductor equipment, semiconductor spares and services, and display equipment. new orders for the silicon systems group and applied global services continued to comprise a majority of applied's consolidated total new orders.
new orders for fiscal 2013 increased compared to fiscal 2012, primarily due to a recovery in demand for display manufacturing equipment and increased demand in semiconductor equipment, partially offset by lower demand for service products, as well as depressed demand for c-si solar equipment due to excess manufacturing capacity in the solar industry.
new orders by geographic region, determined by the product shipment destination specified by the customer, were as follows:
2014                                                    change                           2013               change                           2012
the changes in new orders from customers in the united states, japan, taiwan and korea for fiscal 2014 compared to fiscal 2013 primarily reflected changes in customers mix in the silicon systems group, while the increase in new orders from china resulted from increased demand from display manufacturing equipment.
the recovery in demand for display manufacturing equipment in fiscal 2013 led to the increase in new orders from customers in china. the change in the composition of new orders from customers in taiwan, korea, japan and the united states was primarily related to changes in customer demand for semiconductor equipment.
changes in backlog during fiscal 2014 and 2013 were as follows:
net adjustments           (31   )            (191   )
backlog consists of: (1) orders for which written authorizations have been accepted and assigned shipment dates are within the next 12 months, or shipment has occurred but revenue has not been recognized; and (2) contractual service revenue and maintenance fees to be earned within the next 12 months. applied's backlog at any particular time is not necessarily indicative of actual sales for any future periods, due to the potential for customer changes in delivery schedules or cancellation of orders. approximately 80 percent of the backlog as of the end of fiscal 2014 is anticipated to be shipped within the first two quarters of fiscal 2015.
applied's backlog was $2.9 billion at october 26, 2014 compared to $2.4 billion at october 27, 2013. backlog adjustments were negative for fiscal 2014 and totaled $31 million, consisting of financial debookings, foreign exchange and other adjustments.
backlog by reportable segment as of october 26, 2014 and october 27, 2013 was as follows:
2014                                                                           change                              2013

net sales for all segments increased in fiscal 2014 compared to fiscal 2013. the increase primarily reflected increased customer investments in semiconductor and display equipment, as well as semiconductor spares and services. the silicon systems group remains the largest contributor of net sales.
for fiscal 2013 as compared to fiscal 2012, net sales in display increased, reflecting the recovery of tv manufacturing equipment investment, while net sales across all other segments decreased. the decrease primarily reflected continued excess manufacturing capacity in the solar industry and lower investments in semiconductor equipment, spares and services.
net sales by geographic region, determined by the location of customers' facilities to which products were shipped, were as follows:
2014                                                    change                           2013               change                           2012
net sales from customers in china increased for fiscal 2014 compared to fiscal 2013 primarily due to greater investments in semiconductor, display and solar manufacturing equipment, while net sales from customers in the united states increased due to higher investments in semiconductor equipment.
the increase in net sales from customers in china in fiscal 2013 was primarily due to the recovery in demand for display manufacturing equipment. the changes in net sales from customers in korea, the united states and taiwan were primarily related to changes in customer demand for semiconductor equipment.

gross margin and non-gaap gross margin increased in fiscal 2014 compared to fiscal 2013 primarily reflecting higher net sales, the recovery of a regional customs duty assessment charge recorded in fiscal 2013, sales of display and solar tools that had been written down previously, lower manufacturing costs and change in product mix.
gross margin and non-gaap adjusted gross margin decreased in fiscal 2013 compared to fiscal 2012 primarily reflecting lower sales. gross margin percent and non-gaap adjusted gross margin percent increased in fiscal 2013 compared to fiscal 2012 despite lower sales, due primarily to lower inventory charges, a favorable product mix, and material cost reductions. gross margin and non-gaap adjusted gross margin during fiscal 2014, 2013 and 2012 included $53 million, $50 million and $54 million, respectively, of share-based compensation expense.
research, development and engineering research, development and engineering (rd&e) expenses for the past three fiscal years were as follows:
change
research, development and engineering      $1,428              $1,320              $1,237          $108                    $83
applied's future operating results depend to a considerable extent on its ability to maintain a competitive advantage in the equipment and service products it provides. management believes that it is critical to continue to make substantial investments in rd&e to assure the availability of innovative technology that meets the current and projected requirements of its customers' most advanced designs. applied has maintained and intends to continue its commitment to investing in rd&e in order to continue to offer new products and technologies. development cycles range from 12 to 36 months depending on whether the product is an enhancement of an existing product, which typically has a shorter development cycle, or a new product, which typically has a longer development cycle. most of applied's existing products resulted from internal development activities and innovations involving new technologies, materials and processes. in certain instances, applied acquires technologies, either in existing or new product areas, to complement its existing technology capabilities and to reduce time to market.
in fiscal 2014, applied increased its investments primarily in the areas of 3d chip technology and 300mm product development. applied's 3d rd&e investments were focused on products for overcoming the challenges of finfet and 3d nand designs at sub-2x nanometer nodes and enabling cost-effective manufacturing of these high-performance 3d chips. applied also developed new applications for its epitaxial technology to enable the industry's transition to nmos transistors at the 20nm node, thereby enabling chip makers to build faster devices and deliver next-generation mobile computing power.
rd&e expenses increased in fiscal 2014 compared to the prior year and also in fiscal 2013 compared to fiscal 2012, reflecting the impact of ongoing product development initiatives. as part of its growth strategy, applied has taken certain actions, including workforce reductions and reprioritization of existing spend, to enable increased funding for investments in technical capabilities and critical rd&e programs in current and new markets, with a focus on semiconductor technologies. rd&e expense during fiscal 2014, 2013 and 2012 included $66 million, $53 million and $54 million, respectively, of share-based compensation expense.
marketing and selling marketing and selling expenses for the past three fiscal years were as follows:
change
marketing and selling      $423              $433              $481          $(10          )         $(48          )
the decrease in marketing and selling expenses for fiscal 2014 compared to fiscal 2013 was mainly due to headcount reductions. the decrease in marketing and selling expenses for fiscal 2013 compared to fiscal 2012 was primarily attributable to savings from restructuring programs along with a reduction in the bad debt provision during the year as a result of lower risk exposures among display and solar customers. marketing and selling expenses during fiscal 2014, 2013 and 2012 included $23 million, $20 million and $22 million, respectively, of share-based compensation expense.
change
g&a expenses for fiscal 2014 increased slightly compared to fiscal 2013 primarily due to integration planning costs associated with the announced business combination with tel, partially offset by a gain on the sale of foreign exchange option contracts associated with the business combination and proceeds from a favorable litigation outcome. the decrease in g&a for fiscal 2013 compared to fiscal 2012 was primarily due to the absence of certain costs incurred during fiscal 2012 associated with the acquisition of varian, savings from restructuring programs, and lower share-based compensation expense, partially offset by costs associated with the proposed business combination with tel. g&a expenses during fiscal 2014, 2013 and 2012 included $35 million, $34 million and $52 million respectively, of share-based compensation expense.
impairment of goodwill in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014, applied performed an annual qualitative assessment to test goodwill for all of its reporting units for impairment. applied determined that it was more likely than not that each of its reporting units' fair values exceeded its respective carrying values and that it was not necessary to perform the two-step goodwill impairment test for any of its reporting units.
during fiscal 2013 and 2012, the solar industry faced a deterioration in market conditions associated with manufacturing overcapacity and weak operating performance and outlook, resulting in uncertainties regarding the timing and nature of a recovery in solar capital equipment expenditures. applied performed a two-step goodwill impairment test and, as a result, recorded $224 million and $421 million of goodwill impairment charges in its energy and environmental solutions segment in fiscal 2013 and 2012, respectively. in fiscal 2013, applied also performed an impairment test for long-lived assets associated with the energy and environmental solutions reporting unit and determined that the majority of intangible assets were impaired, mostly due to the lower long-term revenue and profitability outlook associated with products related to these intangible assets. accordingly, during fiscal 2013, applied recorded an impairment charge of $54 million related to these intangible assets, which was the amount by which the carrying value of these intangible assets exceeded their estimated fair value, based on discounted projected cash flows.
the evaluation of goodwill and intangible assets for impairment requires the exercise of significant judgment. in the event of future changes in business conditions, applied will reassess and update its forecasts and estimates used in future impairment analyses. if the results of these analyses are lower than current estimates, a material impairment charge may result at that time.

restructuring and asset impairments restructuring and asset impairment expenses for the past three fiscal years were as follows:
change
restructuring and asset impairments, net      $5             $63              $168          $(58          )         $(105         )
on october 3, 2012, applied announced a restructuring plan (the 2012 global restructuring plan) to realign its global workforce and enhance its ability to invest for growth. under this plan, applied implemented a voluntary retirement program and other workforce reduction actions that affected approximately 1,300 positions. as of january 26, 2014, principal activities related to this plan were complete. during fiscal 2014, 2013 and 2012, applied recognized $5 million, $39 million and $106 million, respectively, of employee-related costs in connection with the 2012 global restructuring plan. total costs incurred in implementing this plan were $150 million, none of which were allocated to the operating segments.
on may 10, 2012, applied announced a plan (the 2012 ees restructuring plan) to restructure its energy and environmental solutions segment in light of challenging industry conditions affecting the solar photovoltaic and light-emitting diode (led) equipment markets. as part of the 2012 ees restructuring plan, applied relocated certain manufacturing, business operations and customer support functions of its precision wafering systems business and ceased led development activities. this plan impacted approximately 300 positions globally. as of october 27, 2013, principal activities related to this plan were complete. total costs incurred in implementing this plan were $87 million, of which $13 million were inventory-related charges. during fiscal 2013 and 2012, applied recognized $26 million and $48 million, respectively, of restructuring and asset impairment charges in connection with the 2012 ees restructuring plan. as of october 26, 2014, there were no remaining severance accruals associated with restructuring reserves under this program.
also in fiscal 2013 and 2012, applied incurred $2 million and $14 million, respectively, of severance and other employee-related costs in connection with the integration of varian.
for further details, see note 11 of notes to consolidated financial statements.
change
interest expenses incurred were primarily associated with the senior unsecured notes issued in june 2011 to fund a portion of the consideration and certain costs associated with the acquisition of varian. interest expense remained flat during fiscal 2014 from the prior year and in fiscal 2013 compared to fiscal 2012.
interest income primarily includes interest earned on cash and investments and realized gains on sale of securities. interest and other income, net increased in fiscal 2014 compared to fiscal 2013 primarily due to realized gains on sales of securities recorded during fiscal 2014, partially offset by increased impairments of strategic investments. interest and other income, net increased in fiscal 2013 from fiscal 2012 primarily due to decreased impairments of strategic investments.
change
effective income tax rate       26.0   %        26.9   %          65.5   %                (0.9) point          (38.6) points the effective tax rate for fiscal 2014 was lower than the rate for fiscal 2013 due primarily to nondeductible goodwill impairment charges in fiscal 2013, offset by resolutions and changes related to prior years and expiration of the u.s. federal research and development tax credit.
the effective tax rate for fiscal 2013 was significantly lower than the rate for fiscal 2012 due primarily to the geographic composition of applied's pre-tax income, lower nondeductible goodwill impairment charges, and reinstatement of the u.s. federal research and development tax credit retroactive to its expiration in december 2012. these reductions were partially offset by a lower benefit in fiscal 2013 from the u.s. federal domestic production deduction.
segment information applied reports financial results in four segments: silicon systems group, applied global services, display, and energy and environmental solutions. a description of the products and services, as well as financial data, for each reportable segment can be found in note 16 of notes to consolidated financial statements. applied does not allocate to its reportable segments certain operating expenses that it manages separately at the corporate level. these unallocated costs include costs for share-based compensation; certain management, finance, legal, human resource, and rd&e functions provided at the corporate level; and unabsorbed information technology and occupancy. in addition, applied does not allocate to its reportable segments restructuring and asset impairment charges and any associated adjustments related to restructuring actions, unless these actions pertain to a specific reportable segment.
silicon systems group segment the silicon systems group segment includes semiconductor capital equipment for deposition, etch, ion implantation, rapid thermal processing, chemical mechanical planarization, metrology and inspection, and wafer packaging. development efforts are focused on solving customers' key technical challenges in transistor, patterning, interconnect and packaging performance as devices scale to advanced technology nodes. the mobility trend remains the largest influence on industry spending, as it drives device manufacturers to continually improve their ability to deliver high-performance, low-power processors and affordable solid-state storage in a small form factor.
with the acquisition of varian, applied acquired ion implantation technology for semiconductor as well as c-si solar cell manufacturing, which was recorded under the silicon systems group segment in fiscal 2012. in fiscal 2013, applied began marketing the solar implant products commercially through its energy and environmental solutions segment. accordingly, effective in the first quarter of fiscal 2013, applied accounts for its solar implant products under the energy and environmental solutions segment. the effect of the solar implant products was not material to the operations of either the silicon systems group or energy and environmental solutions segments.

the composition of new orders for the silicon systems group by end use application for the past three fiscal years was as follows:
one region accounted for at least 30 percent of total net sales for the silicon systems group segment for one or more of the past three fiscal years:
change
customers in taiwan accounted for 37 percent, 45 percent and 32 percent of total net sales for the silicon systems group in fiscal 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. customers in the united states, china and korea together contributed 47 percent, 37 percent and 54 percent of the total net sales for this segment in fiscal 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively.
financial results in the silicon systems group for fiscal 2014 compared to fiscal 2013 reflected the overall increase in wafer fab equipment spending in the semiconductor industry. the increase in new orders and net sales in fiscal 2014 compared to fiscal 2013 primarily reflected increased demand and spending from memory customers, as well as continued demand from foundry customers. three customers accounted for approximately 54 percent of net sales and three customers accounted for 75 percent of new orders in this segment in fiscal 2014. operating income and non-gaap adjusted operating income for fiscal 2014 increased compared to fiscal 2013, reflecting the increase in net sales, partially offset by changes in product mix and higher rd&e spend. in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014, new orders were $1.3 billion, a decrease of 15 percent compared to the prior quarter, primarily due to lower orders from memory and foundry customers. approximately 44 percent of net sales in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014 were for orders received and shipped within the quarter, which increased slightly from 43 percent in the third quarter of fiscal 2014.
the increase in new orders in fiscal 2013 compared to fiscal 2012 primarily reflected increased demand from memory customers. net sales decreased in fiscal 2013 from the prior year due to overall decreased wafer fab equipment spending in the semiconductor industry. three customers accounted for approximately 65 percent of new orders and net sales in this segment in fiscal 2013. operating income and non-gaap adjusted operating income for fiscal 2013 decreased compared to fiscal 2012, reflecting the decrease in net sales, changes in product mix and higher rd&e spend.
applied global services segment the applied global services segment encompasses integrated solutions to optimize equipment and fab performance and productivity, including spares, upgrades, services, remanufactured earlier generation equipment and factory automation software for semiconductor, display and solar products. customer demand for products and services is fulfilled through a global distribution system with trained service engineers located in close proximity to customer sites.

there were no individual regions that accounted for at least 30 percent of total net sales for the applied global services segment for any of the past three fiscal years.
new orders and net sales for fiscal 2014 increased compared to fiscal 2013 mainly due to increased demand for semiconductor spares and services, as well as 200mm equipment systems and equipment upgrades. operating income and non-gaap adjusted operating income increased in fiscal 2014 compared to the prior year, reflecting the increase in net sales as well as the recovery of a regional customs duty assessment charge recorded in fiscal 2013.
for fiscal 2013, new orders and net sales decreased compared to fiscal 2012 due primarily to lower demand and investments for semiconductor spares and services. the decrease in net sales was also due to lower investments in display upgrades. fiscal 2012 net sales also included $85 million in sales for a thin film solar production line. operating income and non-gaap adjusted operating income decreased in fiscal 2013 compared to fiscal 2012, reflecting lower sales and a $20 million customs duty assessment, partially offset by lower operating expenses from spending controls.
display segment the display segment encompasses products for manufacturing liquid crystal displays (lcds), organic light-emitting diodes (oleds), and other display technologies for tvs, personal computers (pcs), tablets, smart phones, and other consumer-oriented devices. the segment is focused on expanding its presence through technologically-differentiated equipment for manufacturing large-scale tvs; entry into new markets such as low temperature polysilicon (ltps), metal oxide, and touch panel sectors; and development of products that enable cost reductions through productivity and uniformity. display industry growth depends primarily on consumer demand for increasingly larger and more advanced lcd tvs and high resolution displays for next generation mobile devices.

the following regions accounted for at least 30 percent of total net sales for the display segment for one or more of the past three fiscal years:
change
in fiscal 2014, 2013, and 2012, customers in china accounted for 80 percent, 48 percent and 28 percent, respectively, of the display segment's total net sales. customers in korea and taiwan together accounted for 20 percent of total net sales for the display segment in fiscal 2014 compared to 42 percent in fiscal 2013, and 57 percent in fiscal 2012. the increase in net sales from customers in china reflected tv manufacturing capacity expansion, while the decrease in net sales from customers in korea and taiwan primarily related to lower sales of mobile display manufacturing equipment.
new orders and net sales for fiscal 2014 increased compared to the prior year reflecting strong tv manufacturing capacity expansions. operating income and non-gaap adjusted operating income increased over the prior year, due primarily to higher net sales, sales of tools for which inventory had been written down previously, better installation and warranty performance, and material and manufacturing cost reductions, partially offset by increased research and development expenses. four customers accounted for approximately 87 percent of new orders for the display segment in fiscal 2014, with two customers accounting for approximately 50 percent of new orders. four customers accounted for approximately 77 percent of net sales for this segment in fiscal 2014, with one customer accounting for approximately 40 percent of net sales. in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014, new orders were $130 million, down 56 percent from the prior quarter, primarily reflecting continued variability in industry order patterns. net sales in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014 were $190 million, up 60 percent compared to the prior quarter as a result of shipment of tv manufacturing equipment to customers in china.
fiscal 2013 operating results reflected a recovery in demand for tv manufacturing equipment and continued demand for advanced mobile display equipment, which resulted in increased new orders, net sales, operating income and non-gaap adjusted operating income compared to fiscal 2012. two customers accounted for approximately 50 percent of net sales for the display segment in fiscal 2013.
energy and environmental solutions segment the energy and environmental solutions segment includes products for fabricating crystalline-silicon (c-si), solar pv wafers and cells, as well as high throughput roll-to-roll deposition equipment for flexible electronics, packaging and other applications. this business is focused on delivering solutions to generate and conserve energy, with an emphasis on lowering the cost to produce solar modules and increasing conversion efficiency. while end-demand for solar pvs has been robust over the last several years, investment in capital equipment remained low as global pv production capacity exceeds anticipated demand. the solar equipment environment improved slightly in fiscal 2014 compared to the previous year.

in fiscal 2014, customers in china accounted for 62 percent of total net sales for the energy and environmental solutions segment compared to 58 percent in fiscal 2013, and 49 percent in fiscal 2012.
new orders and net sales for fiscal 2014 increased compared to fiscal 2013 but remained at low levels due to continued excess manufacturing capacity in the solar industry. one customer accounted for approximately 23 percent of net sales for this segment during fiscal 2014. operating margin and non-gaap adjusted operating margin increased for fiscal 2014 compared to prior year, reflecting increased net sales, lower inventory charges, sales of solar tools that were written down previously and continued cost reduction measures, proceeds from a favorable litigation outcome, and spending controls. in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014, new orders were $44 million, down from $66 million in the prior quarter, and net sales were $48 million, down 53 percent from the prior quarter.
fiscal 2013 financial results continued to reflect excess manufacturing capacity in the solar industry, which resulted in low levels of new orders and net sales, and consequently an operating loss for the segment. operating loss for fiscal 2013 included $278 million of goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges, as well as restructuring and asset impairment charges of $25 million associated with the 2012 ees restructuring plan discussed above. details on goodwill and intangible asset impairment and restructuring and asset impairment charges are also included in note 9 and note 11 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements.
business combinations tokyo electron limited on september 24, 2013, applied and tokyo electron limited (tel) entered into a business combination agreement, which was amended on february 14, 2014, to effect a strategic combination of their respective businesses into a new combined company. tel, a japanese corporation, is a global supplier of semiconductor and flat panel display production equipment, and a provider of technical support and services for semiconductor, flat panel display and photovoltaic panel production equipment. under the terms of the business combination agreement, tel shareholders will receive 3.25 shares of the new combined company for every tel share held. applied shareholders will receive one share of the new combined company for every applied share held. based on the number of shares of applied common stock and shares of tel common stock expected to be issued and outstanding immediately prior to the closing of the transaction, it is anticipated that, immediately following the transaction, former applied stockholders and former tel shareholders will own approximately 68% and 32%, respectively, of the new combined company.
the new combined company, eteris n.v., will have dual headquarters in tokyo and santa clara and dual listing of its shares on the tokyo stock exchange and nasdaq, and will be incorporated in the netherlands. in june 2014, the shareholders of applied and tel approved the proposed business combination. the closing of the transaction remains subject to customary conditions, including regulatory approvals. it is expected that the combined company will commence a $3.0 billion stock repurchase program targeted to be executed within 12 months following the closing of the transaction.
the business combination agreement contains mutual pre-closing covenants, including the obligation of applied and tel to conduct their businesses in the ordinary course consistent in all material respects with past practices. the agreement also contains termination rights for applied and tel and provides that upon certain events, such as a termination due to a change in recommendation by the other party or a termination relating to certain tax rulings, a termination fee of $400 million is payable.
on november 10, 2011, applied completed the acquisition of varian, a public company manufacturer of semiconductor processing equipment and the leading supplier of ion implantation equipment used by chip makers globally, for an aggregate purchase price of $4.2 billion in cash, net of cash acquired and assumed earned equity awards of $27 million, pursuant to an agreement and plan of merger dated as of may 3, 2011. applied's primary reasons for this acquisition were to complement existing product offerings and to provide opportunities for future growth. the acquired business is primarily included in results for the silicon systems group and applied global services segments.
applied funded the transaction with a combination of existing cash balances and debt. on june 8, 2011, applied issued senior unsecured notes in the aggregate principal amount of $1.75 billion and used the net proceeds of the notes to fund a portion of the consideration and certain costs associated with the acquisition. see note 10 of notes to consolidated financial statements for additional discussion of long-term debt.
for further details, see note 8 of notes to consolidated financial statements.
recent accounting pronouncements in may 2014, the financial accounting standards board (fasb) issued authoritative guidance that requires revenue recognition to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to a customer in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. this new standard will supersede most current revenue recognition guidance, including industry-specific guidance. the guidance becomes effective for applied in the first quarter of fiscal 2018, and can be applied either retrospectively or as a cumulative-effect adjustment as of the date of adoption. early adoption is prohibited. applied is currently evaluating the effect of this new guidance on applied's financial position and its ongoing financial reporting, including the selection of a transition method.
in april 2014, the fasb issued authoritative guidance that raises the threshold for a disposal transaction to qualify as a discontinued operation and requires additional disclosures about discontinued operations and disposals of individually significant components that do not qualify as discontinued operations. the authoritative guidance becomes effective prospectively for applied in the first quarter of fiscal 2016. early adoption is permitted, but only for disposals that have not been reported in financial statements previously issued.
in july 2013, the fasb issued authoritative guidance that will require an unrecognized tax benefit to be presented as a reduction of a deferred tax asset for a net operating loss carryforward, a similar tax loss or a tax credit carryforward, with certain exceptions. the authoritative guidance becomes effective for applied in the first quarter of fiscal 2015, with early adoption permitted. the guidance is not expected to have a significant impact on applied's financial position.
financial condition, liquidity and capital resources applied's cash, cash equivalents and investments increased to $4.1 billion at october 26, 2014 from $2.9 billion at october 27, 2013.
cash, cash equivalents and investments consist of the following:
sources and uses of cash a summary of cash provided by (used in) operating, investing, and financing activities is as follows:
cash provided by operating activities             $1,800                 $623           $1,851
operating activities cash from operating activities for fiscal 2014 was $1.8 billion, which reflects net income adjusted for the effect of non-cash charges and changes in working capital components. non-cash charges included depreciation, amortization, share-based compensation, unrealized loss on derivatives associated with announced business combination, restructuring and asset impairments and deferred income taxes. the increase in cash from operating activities from fiscal 2013 to fiscal 2014 was primarily due to higher business volume and improved working capital performance.
applied discounted $29 million of letters of credit issued by customers in fiscal 2014. applied did not utilize programs to discount letters of credit issued by customers in fiscal 2013 and 2012. discounting of letters of credit depends on many factors, including the willingness of financial institutions to discount the letters of credit and the cost of such arrangements. applied factored accounts receivable and discounted promissory notes of $45 million in fiscal 2014, and $93 million in fiscal 2012. there was no factoring of accounts receivable or discounting of promissory notes in fiscal 2013.
applied's working capital was $4.1 billion at october 26, 2014 and $3.2 billion at october 27, 2013.
days sales, inventory and payable outstanding at the end of each of the periods indicated are:
days sales outstanding varies due to the timing of shipments and the payment terms. days sales outstanding decreased at the end of fiscal 2014 compared to fiscal 2013 primarily due to an increase in revenue and better linearity. the days sales outstanding in fiscal 2012 included a favorable impact from the timing of the sale of thin film production line during the year. days inventory outstanding remained flat in fiscal 2012, 2013 and 2014. the increase in days payable outstanding from fiscal 2012 to fiscal 2013 primarily reflected an increase in accounts payable due to increase in inventory purchases near the end of the period to support projected customer demand.
investing activities applied used $161 million of cash in investing activities in fiscal 2014 and $4.7 billion in fiscal 2012. applied generated $215 million in cash from investing activities in fiscal 2013. capital expenditures were $241 million in fiscal 2014, $197 million in fiscal 2013, and $162 million in fiscal 2012. capital expenditures in fiscal 2014 were primarily for demonstration and test equipment and infrastructure improvements in north america, including creation of a new pilot operation facility and distribution center. capital expenditures in fiscal 2013 were primarily for demonstration and test equipment as well as laboratory tools and equipment upgrades in north america. capital expenditures in fiscal 2012 were primarily for various information technology expenditures in north america, including the addition of varian, and expansion of semiconductor assembly centers in singapore. proceeds from sales and maturities of investments, net of purchases of investments, totaled $67 million in fiscal 2014 and $406 million in fiscal 2013, while purchases of investments, net of proceeds from sales and maturities of investments, totaled $308 million in fiscal 2012. investing activities also included investments in technology and acquisitions of companies to allow applied to access new market opportunities or emerging technologies. in fiscal 2012, applied acquired varian for $4.2 billion, net of cash acquired.
applied's investment portfolio consists principally of investment grade money market mutual funds, u.s. treasury and agency securities, municipal bonds, corporate bonds and mortgage-backed and asset-backed securities, as well as equity securities. applied regularly monitors the credit risk in its investment portfolio and takes appropriate measures, which may include the sale of certain securities, to manage such risks prudently in accordance with its investment policies.
financing activities applied used cash in financing activities in the amount of $348 million in fiscal 2014, $519 million in fiscal 2013, and $1.8 billion in fiscal 2012 which activities included payment of cash dividends to stockholders and issuances and repurchases of common stock. applied did not repurchase any shares of its common stock during fiscal 2014. cash used to repurchase shares totaled $245 million in fiscal 2013 and $1.4 billion in fiscal 2012. the majority of these repurchases were made under a share repurchase program approved in march 2012 by applied's board of directors authorizing up to $3.0 billion in repurchases over the next three years ending in march 2015, of which $1.6 billion remained available for future stock repurchases at october 26, 2014. proceeds from stock issuances related to equity compensation awards were $137 million in fiscal 2014, $182 million in fiscal 2013, and $96 million in fiscal 2012.
during fiscal 2014, applied's board of directors declared four quarterly cash dividends of $0.10 per share each. during fiscal 2013, applied's board of directors declared three quarterly cash dividends of $0.10 per share each and one quarterly cash dividend of $0.09 per share. during fiscal 2012, applied's board of directors declared three quarterly cash dividends of $0.09 per share each and one quarterly cash dividend of $0.08 per share. cash paid in dividends during fiscal 2014, 2013 and 2012 amounted to $485 million, $456 million and $434 million, respectively. applied currently anticipates that cash dividends will continue to be paid on a quarterly basis, although the declaration of any future cash dividend is at the discretion of the board of directors and will depend on applied's financial condition, results of operations, capital requirements, business conditions and other factors, as well as a determination by the board of directors that cash dividends are in the best interests of applied's stockholders.
applied has credit facilities for unsecured borrowings in various currencies of up to $1.6 billion, of which $1.5 billion is comprised of a committed revolving credit agreement with a group of banks that is scheduled to expire in may 2017. this agreement provides for borrowings in united states dollars at interest rates keyed to one of the two rates selected by applied for each advance and includes financial and other covenants. these covenants require applied to maintain certain minimum financial ratios. applied was in compliance with all such covenants at october 26, 2014. remaining credit facilities in the amount of approximately $75 million are with japanese banks. applied's ability to borrow under these facilities is subject to bank approval at the time of the borrowing request, and any advances will be at rates indexed to the banks' prime reference rate denominated in japanese yen. no amounts were outstanding under any of these facilities at both october 26, 2014 and october 27, 2013, and applied has not utilized these credit facilities. in connection with the proposed business combination with tel, applied intends to amend or replace its undrawn $1.5 billion unsecured revolving credit agreement.
in fiscal 2011, applied established a short-term commercial paper program of up to $1.5 billion. at october 26, 2014 and october 27, 2013, applied did not have any commercial paper outstanding.
applied issued senior unsecured notes in the aggregate principal amount of $1.95 billion. the following table summarizes the notes issued:
the indenture governing the notes includes certain covenants with which applied was in compliance at october 26, 2014. see note 10 of notes to consolidated financial statements for additional discussion of long-term debt.
others during fiscal 2014 and 2013, applied did not record any additional bad debt provision but released $16 million and $13 million, respectively, of its allowance for doubtful accounts as a result of an overall lower risk profile of applied's customers. while applied believes that its allowance for doubtful accounts at october 26, 2014 is adequate, it will continue to closely monitor customer liquidity and economic conditions.
as of october 26, 2014, approximately $2.7 billion of cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities held by foreign subsidiaries may be subject to u.s. taxes if repatriated for u.s. operations. of this amount, applied intends to permanently reinvest approximately $2.1 billion of these funds outside of the u.s. and does not plan to repatriate these funds. for the remaining cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities held by foreign subsidiaries, u.s. taxes have been provided for in the financial statements.
although cash requirements will fluctuate based on the timing and extent of factors such as those discussed above, applied's management believes that cash generated from operations, together with the liquidity provided by existing cash balances and borrowing capability, will be sufficient to satisfy applied's liquidity requirements for the next 12 months. for further details regarding applied's operating, investing and financing activities, see the consolidated statements of cash flows in this report.
for details on standby letters of credit and other agreements with banks, see off-balance sheet arrangements below.
off-balance sheet arrangements in the ordinary course of business, applied provides standby letters of credit or other guarantee instruments to third parties as required for certain transactions initiated by either applied or its subsidiaries. as of october 26, 2014, the maximum potential amount of future payments that applied could be required to make under these guarantee agreements was approximately $46 million. applied has not recorded any liability in connection with these guarantee agreements beyond that required to appropriately account for the underlying transaction being guaranteed. applied does not believe, based on historical experience and information currently available, that it is probable that any amounts will be required to be paid under these guarantee agreements.
applied also has agreements with various banks to facilitate subsidiary banking operations worldwide, including overdraft arrangements, issuance of bank guarantees, and letters of credit. as of october 26, 2014, applied materials inc. has provided parent guarantees to banks for approximately $102 million to cover these arrangements.
applied also has operating leases for various facilities. total rent expense was $37 million for fiscal 2014, $36 million for fiscal 2013, and $38 million for fiscal 2012.
contractual obligations the following table summarizes applied's contractual obligations as of october 26, 2014:
operating lease obligations                                          70       28                                   28                  9                        5
1   represents applied's agreements to purchase goods and services consisting of applied's (a) outstanding purchase orders for goods and services; and (b) contractual requirements to make specified minimum payments even if applied does not take delivery of the contracted goods.
2   other long-term liabilities do not include noncurrent income taxes payable, noncurrent deferred income taxes payable and certain tax-related liabilities due to the uncertainty in the timing of future payments.
in addition to the contractual obligations disclosed above, applied has certain tax obligations. gross interest and penalties and unrecognized tax benefits that are not expected to result in payment or receipt of cash within one year have been reported as non-current liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet. as of october 26, 2014, the gross liability for unrecognized tax benefits was $134 million. increases or decreases to interest and penalties on uncertain tax positions are included in provision for income taxes in the consolidated statement of operations. interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions were $25 million as of october 26, 2014 and $7 million as of october 27, 2013, and were classified as a noncurrent liability in the consolidated balance sheets. at this time, applied is unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing of payments in individual years due to uncertainties in the timing of tax audit outcomes and, accordingly, such amounts are not included in the above contractual obligations table.
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of consolidated financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make judgments, assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported. note 1 of notes to consolidated financial statements describes the significant accounting policies used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements. certain of these significant accounting policies are considered to be critical accounting policies.
a critical accounting policy is defined as one that is both material to the presentation of applied's consolidated financial statements and that requires management to make difficult, subjective or complex judgments that could have a material effect on applied's financial condition or results of operations. specifically, these policies have the following attributes: (1) applied is required to make assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time of the estimate; and (2) different estimates applied could reasonably have used, or changes in the estimate that are reasonably likely to occur, would have a material effect on applied's financial condition or results of operations.
estimates and assumptions about future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty. applied bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions believed to be applicable and reasonable under the circumstances. these estimates may change as new events occur, as additional information is obtained and as applied's operating environment changes. these changes have historically been minor and have been included in the consolidated financial statements as soon as they became known. in addition, management is periodically faced with uncertainties, the outcomes of which are not within its control and will not be known for prolonged periods of time. these uncertainties include those discussed in part i, item 1a, "risk factors." based on a critical assessment of its accounting policies and the underlying judgments and uncertainties affecting the application of those policies, management believes that applied's consolidated financial statements are fairly stated in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america, and provide a meaningful presentation of applied's financial condition and results of operations.
management believes that the following are critical accounting policies and estimates:
revenue recognition applied recognizes revenue when all four revenue recognition criteria have been met: persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists; delivery has occurred or services have been rendered; sales price is fixed or determinable; and collectability is probable. each sale arrangement may contain commercial terms that differ from other arrangements. in addition, applied frequently enters into contracts that contain multiple deliverables. judgment is required to properly identify the accounting units of the multiple deliverable transactions and to determine the manner in which revenue should be allocated among the accounting units. moreover, judgment is used in interpreting the commercial terms and determining when all criteria of revenue recognition have been met in order for revenue recognition to occur in the appropriate accounting period. while changes in the allocation of the estimated sales price between the units of accounting will not affect the amount of total revenue recognized for a particular sales arrangement, any material changes in these allocations could impact the timing of revenue recognition, which could have a material effect on applied's financial condition and results of operations.
warranty costs applied provides for the estimated cost of warranty when revenue is recognized. estimated warranty costs are determined by analyzing specific product, current and historical configuration statistics and regional warranty support costs. applied's warranty obligation is affected by product and component failure rates, material usage and labor costs incurred in correcting product failures during the warranty period. as applied's customer engineers and process support engineers are highly trained and deployed globally, labor availability is a significant factor in determining labor costs. the quantity and availability of critical replacement parts is another significant factor in estimating warranty costs. unforeseen component failures or exceptional component performance can also result in changes to warranty costs. if actual warranty costs differ substantially from applied's estimates, revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be required, which could have a material adverse effect on applied's business, financial condition and results of operations.
allowance for doubtful accounts applied maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments. this allowance is based on historical experience, credit evaluations, specific customer collection history and any customer-specific issues applied has identified. changes in circumstances, such as an unexpected material adverse change in a major customer's ability to meet its financial obligation to applied or its payment trends, may require applied to further adjust its estimates of the recoverability of amounts due to applied, which could have a material adverse effect on applied's business, financial condition and results of operations.
inventory valuation inventories are generally stated at the lower of cost or market, with cost determined on a first-in, first-out basis. the carrying value of inventory is reduced for estimated obsolescence by the difference between its cost and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand. applied evaluates the inventory carrying value for potential excess and obsolete inventory exposures by analyzing historical and anticipated demand. in addition, inventories are evaluated for potential obsolescence due to the effect of known and anticipated engineering change orders and new products. if actual demand were to be substantially lower than estimated, additional adjustments for excess or obsolete inventory may be required, which could have a material adverse effect on applied's business, financial condition and results of operations.
goodwill and intangible assets applied reviews goodwill and intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of these assets may not be recoverable, and also annually reviews goodwill and intangibles with indefinite lives for impairment. intangible assets, such as purchased technology, are generally recorded in connection with a business acquisition. the value assigned to intangible assets is usually based on estimates and judgments regarding expectations for the success and life cycle of products and technology acquired. if actual product acceptance differs significantly from the estimates, applied may be required to record an impairment charge to reduce the carrying value of the reporting unit to its estimated fair value. the fair value of a reporting unit is estimated using both the income approach and the market approach taking into account such factors as future anticipated operating results and estimated cost of capital. management uses significant judgment when assessing goodwill for potential impairment, especially in emerging markets. a severe decline in market conditions could result in an unexpected impairment charge for impaired goodwill, which could have a material adverse effect on applied's business, financial condition and results of operations.
income taxes the effective tax rate is highly dependent upon the geographic composition of worldwide earnings, tax regulations governing each region, nondeductible expenses incurred in connection with acquisitions and availability of tax credits. management carefully monitors the changes in many factors and adjusts the effective tax rate as required. if actual results differ from these estimates, applied could be required to record a valuation allowance on deferred tax assets or adjust its effective tax rate, which could have a material adverse effect on applied's business, financial condition and results of operations.
applied accounts for income taxes by recognizing deferred tax assets and liabilities using statutory tax rates for the effect of temporary differences between the book and tax bases of recorded assets and liabilities, net operating losses and tax credit carryovers. deferred tax assets are also reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that a portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. management has determined that it is more likely than not that applied's future taxable income will be sufficient to realize its deferred tax assets, net of existing valuation allowance.
the calculation of tax liabilities involves significant judgment in estimating the impact of uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws. resolution of these uncertainties in a manner inconsistent with applied's expectations could have a material impact on applied's results of operations and financial condition.
non-gaap adjusted results management uses non-gaap adjusted results to evaluate operating and financial performance in light of business objectives and for planning purposes. applied believes these measures enhance investors' ability to review the company's business from the same perspective as management and facilitate comparisons of this period's results with prior periods. the non-gaap adjusted results presented below exclude the impact of the following, where applicable: certain items related to acquisitions or the announced business combination; restructuring charges and any associated adjustments; impairments of assets, goodwill, or investments; gain or loss on sale of strategic investments or facilities; and certain tax items. these non-gaap adjusted measures are not in accordance with gaap and may differ from non-gaap methods of accounting and reporting used by other companies. the presentation of this additional information should not be considered a substitute for results prepared in accordance with gaap.

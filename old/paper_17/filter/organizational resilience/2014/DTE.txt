item 1a. risk factors there are various risks associated with the operations of dte energy's utility and non-utility businesses. to provide a framework to understand the operating environment of dte energy, we are providing a brief explanation of the more significant risks associated with our businesses. although we have tried to identify and discuss key risk factors, others could emerge in the future. each of the following risks could affect our performance.
we are subject to rate regulation.  electric and gas rates for our utilities are set by the mpsc and the ferc and cannot be changed without regulatory authorization. we may be negatively impacted by new regulations or interpretations by the mpsc, the ferc or other regulatory bodies. our ability to recover costs may be impacted by the time lag between the incurrence of costs and the recovery of the costs in customers' rates. our regulators also may decide to disallow recovery of certain costs in customers' rates if they determine that those costs do not meet the standards for recovery under our governing laws and regulations. our utilities typically self-implement base rate changes six months after rate case filings in accordance with michigan law. however, if the final rates authorized by our regulators in the final rate order are lower than the amounts we collected during the self-implementation period, we must refund the difference with interest. our regulators may also disagree with our rate calculations under the various mechanisms that are intended to mitigate the risk to our utilities of certain aspects of our business. if we cannot agree with our regulators on an appropriate reconciliation of those mechanisms, it may impact our ability to recover certain costs through our customer rates. our regulators may also decide to eliminate these mechanisms in future rate cases, which may make it more difficult for us to recover our costs in the rates we charge customers. we cannot predict what rates the mpsc will authorize in future rate cases. new legislation, regulations or interpretations could change how our business operates, impact our ability to recover costs through rates or require us to incur additional expenses.
changes to michigan's electric customer choice program could negatively impact our financial performance.  the state of michigan currently experiences a hybrid market, where the mpsc continues to regulate electric rates for our customers, while alternative electric suppliers charge market-based rates. mpsc rate orders and energy legislation enacted by the state of michigan in 2008 have placed a 10% cap on the total potential retail access related migration. however, even with the legislated 10% cap on participation, there continues to be legislative and financial risk associated with the electric customer choice program. electric retail access migration is sensitive to market price and full service electric price changes. we are required under current regulation to provide full service to retail access customers that choose to return, potentially resulting in the need for additional generating capacity.
the miso regional energy market, including the state of michigan, is expected to face capacity constraints beginning in 2016 due primarily to the retirement of coal-fired generation caused by increasingly stringent environmental requirements. significant investment in new natural gas-fired generation and renewables will be required. under the current regulatory structure, retail access customers do not fund capacity costs potentially impacting electric supply reliability and utility customer affordability.
environmental laws and liability may be costly.  we are subject to and affected by numerous environmental regulations. these regulations govern air emissions, water quality, wastewater discharge and disposal of solid and hazardous waste. compliance with these regulations can significantly increase capital spending, operating expenses and plant down times and can negatively affect the affordability of the rates we charge to our customers.
uncertainty around future environmental regulations creates difficulty planning long-term capital projects in our generation fleet and gas distribution businesses. these laws and regulations require us to seek a variety of environmental licenses, permits, inspections and other regulatory approvals. we could be required to install expensive pollution control measures or limit or cease activities, including the retirement of certain generating plants, based on these regulations. additionally, we may become a responsible party for environmental cleanup at sites identified by a regulatory body. we cannot predict with certainty the amount and timing of future expenditures related to environmental matters because of the difficulty of estimating clean-up costs. there is also uncertainty in quantifying liabilities under environmental laws that impose joint and several liability on potentially responsible parties.
we may also incur liabilities as a result of potential future requirements to address climate change issues. proposals for voluntary initiatives and mandatory controls are being discussed both in the united states and worldwide to reduce greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide, a by-product of burning fossil fuels. if increased regulation of greenhouse gas emissions are implemented, the operations of our fossil-fuel generation assets may be significantly impacted. since there can be no assurances that environmental costs may be recovered through the regulatory process, our financial performance may be negatively impacted as a result of environmental matters.
future environmental regulation of natural gas extraction techniques including hydraulic fracturing being discussed both at the united states federal level and by some states may affect the profitability of natural gas extraction businesses which could affect demand for and profitability of our gas transportation businesses.
operation of a nuclear facility subjects us to risk. ownership of an operating nuclear generating plant subjects us to significant additional risks. these risks include, among others, plant security, environmental regulation and remediation, changes in federal nuclear regulation and operational factors that can significantly impact the performance and cost of operating a nuclear facility. while we maintain insurance for various nuclear-related risks, there can be no assurances that such insurance will be sufficient to cover our costs in the event of an accident or business interruption at our nuclear generating plant, which may affect our financial performance. in addition, while we have a nuclear decommissioning trust fund to finance the decommissioning of our nuclear generating plant, there can be no assurances that such fund will be sufficient to fund the cost of decommissioning.
the supply and/or price of energy commodities and/or related services may impact our financial results.  we are dependent on coal for much of our electrical generating capacity. our access to natural gas supplies is critical to ensure reliability of service for our utility gas customers. our non-utility businesses are also dependent upon supplies and prices of energy commodities and services. price fluctuations, fuel supply disruptions and changes in transportation costs could have a negative impact on the amounts we charge our utility customers for electricity and gas and on the profitability of our non-utility businesses. we have hedging strategies and regulatory recovery mechanisms in place to mitigate some of the negative fluctuations in commodity supply prices in our utility and non-utility businesses, but there can be no assurances that our financial performance will not be negatively impacted by price fluctuations. the price of energy also impacts the market for our non-utility businesses that compete with utilities and alternative electric suppliers.
the supply and/or price of other industrial raw and finished inputs and/or related services may impact our financial results.  we are dependent on supplies of certain commodities, such as copper and limestone, among others, and industrial materials and services in order to maintain day-to-day operations and maintenance of our facilities. price fluctuations or supply interruptions for these commodities and other items could have a negative impact on the amounts we charge our customers for our utility products and on the profitability of our non-utility businesses.
adverse changes in our credit ratings may negatively affect us.  regional and national economic conditions, increased scrutiny of the energy industry and regulatory changes, as well as changes in our economic performance, could result in credit agencies reexamining our credit rating. while credit ratings reflect the opinions of the credit agencies issuing such ratings and may not necessarily reflect actual performance, a downgrade in our credit rating below investment grade could restrict or discontinue our ability to access capital markets and could result in an increase in our borrowing costs, a reduced level of capital expenditures and could impact future earnings and cash flows. in addition, a reduction in our credit rating may require us to post collateral related to various physical or financially settled contracts for the purchase of energy-related commodities, products and services, which could impact our liquidity.
poor investment performance of pension and other postretirement benefit plan assets and other factors impacting benefit plan costs could unfavorably impact our liquidity and results of operations.  our costs of providing non-contributory defined benefit pension plans and other postretirement benefit plans are dependent upon a number of factors, such as the rates of return on plan assets, the level of interest rates used to measure the required minimum funding levels of the plans, future government regulation, and our required or voluntary contributions made to the plans. the performance of the debt and equity markets affects the value of assets that are held in trust to satisfy future obligations under our plans. we have significant benefit obligations and hold significant assets in trust to satisfy these obligations. these assets are subject to market fluctuations and will yield uncertain returns, which may fall below our projected return rates. a decline in the market value of the pension and other postretirement benefit plan assets will increase the funding requirements under our pension and other postretirement benefit plans if the actual asset returns do not recover these declines in the foreseeable future. additionally, our pension and other postretirement benefit plan liabilities are sensitive to changes in interest rates. as interest rates decrease, the liabilities increase, resulting in increasing benefit expense and funding requirements. also, if future increases in pension and other postretirement benefit costs as a result of reduced plan assets are not recoverable from our utility customers, the results of operations and financial position of our company could be negatively affected. without sustained growth in the plan investments over time to increase the value of our plan assets, we could be required to fund our plans with significant amounts of cash. such cash funding obligations could have a material impact on our cash flows, financial position, or results of operations.
our ability to access capital markets is important.  our ability to access capital markets is important to operate our businesses and to fund capital investments. turmoil in credit markets may constrain our ability, as well as the ability of our subsidiaries, to issue new debt, including commercial paper, and refinance existing debt at reasonable interest rates. in addition, the level of borrowing by other energy companies and the market as a whole could limit our access to capital markets. our long term revolving credit facilities do not expire until 2018, but we regularly access capital markets to refinance existing debt or fund new projects at our utilities and non-utility businesses, and we cannot predict the pricing or demand for those future transactions.
construction and capital improvements to our power facilities and distribution systems subject us to risk. we are managing ongoing and planning future significant construction and capital improvement projects at multiple power generation and distribution facilities and our gas distribution system. many factors that could cause delays or increased prices for these complex projects are beyond our control, including the cost of materials and labor, subcontractor performance, timing and issuance of necessary permits, construction disputes and weather conditions. failure to complete these projects on schedule and on budget for any reason could adversely affect our financial performance and operations at the affected facilities and businesses.
our non-utility businesses may not perform to our expectations.  we rely on our non-utility operations for an increasing portion of our earnings. if our current and contemplated non-utility investments do not perform at expected levels, we could experience diminished earnings and a corresponding decline in our shareholder value.
our participation in energy trading markets subjects us to risk.  events in the energy trading industry have increased the level of scrutiny on the energy trading business and the energy industry as a whole. in certain situations we may be required to post collateral to support trading operations, which could be substantial. if access to liquidity to support trading activities is curtailed, we could experience decreased earnings potential and cash flows. energy trading activities take place in volatile markets and expose us to risks related to commodity price movements, deviations in weather and other related risks. we routinely have speculative trading positions in the market, within strict policy guidelines we set, resulting from the management of our business portfolio. to the extent speculative trading positions exist, fluctuating commodity prices can improve or diminish our financial results and financial position. we manage our exposure by establishing and enforcing strict risk limits and risk management procedures. during periods of extreme volatility, these risk limits and risk management procedures may not work as planned and cannot eliminate all risks associated with these activities.
our ability to utilize production tax credits may be limited.  to reduce u.s. dependence on imported oil, the internal revenue code provides production tax credits as an incentive for taxpayers to produce fuels and electricity from alternative sources. we generated production tax credits from coke production, landfill gas recovery, reduced emission fuel, renewable energy generation and gas production operations. all production tax credits taken after 2012 are subject to audit by the irs. if our production tax credits were disallowed in whole or in part as a result of an irs audit, there could be additional tax liabilities owed for previously recognized tax credits that could significantly impact our earnings and cash flows.
weather significantly affects operations.  at both utilities, deviations from normal hot and cold weather conditions affect our earnings and cash flow. mild temperatures can result in decreased utilization of our assets, lowering income and cash flow. at dte electric, ice storms, tornadoes, or high winds can damage the electric distribution system infrastructure and power generation facilities and require us to perform emergency repairs and incur material unplanned expenses. the expenses of storm restoration efforts may not be fully recoverable through the regulatory process. dte gas can experience higher than anticipated expenses from emergency repairs on its gas distribution infrastructure required as a result of weather related issues.
unplanned power plant outages may be costly.  unforeseen maintenance may be required to safely produce electricity or comply with environmental regulations. as a result of unforeseen maintenance, we may be required to make spot market purchases of electricity that exceed our costs of generation. our financial performance may be negatively affected if we are unable to recover such increased costs.
we rely on cash flows from subsidiaries.  dte energy is a holding company. cash flows from our utility and non-utility subsidiaries are required to pay interest expenses and dividends on dte energy debt and securities. should a major subsidiary not be able to pay dividends or transfer cash flows to dte energy, our ability to pay interest and dividends would be restricted.
renewable portfolio standards and energy efficiency programs may affect our business.  we are subject to existing michigan and potential future federal legislation and regulation requiring us to secure sources of renewable energy. we expect to comply with the existing state legislation, but we do not know what requirements may be added by federal legislation. in addition, there could be additional state requirements increasing the percentage of power required to be provided by renewable energy sources. we cannot predict the financial impact or costs associated with complying with potential future legislation and regulations. compliance with these requirements can significantly increase capital expenditures and operating expenses and can negatively affect the affordability of the rates we charge to our customers.
we are also required by michigan legislation to implement energy efficiency measures and provide energy efficiency customer awareness and education programs. these requirements necessitate expenditures and implementation of these programs creates the risk of reducing our revenues as customers decrease their energy usage. we cannot predict how these programs will impact our business and future operating results.
regional and national economic conditions can have an unfavorable impact on us.  our utility and non-utility businesses follow the economic cycles of the customers we serve and credit risk of counterparties we do business with. should national or regional economic conditions deteriorate, reduced volumes of electricity and gas, and demand for energy services we supply, collections of accounts receivable, reductions in federal and state energy assistance funding, and potentially higher levels of lost gas or stolen gas and electricity could result in decreased earnings and cash flow.
threats of terrorism or cyber-attacks could affect our business.  we may be threatened by problems such as computer viruses or terrorism that may disrupt our operations and could harm our operating results. our industry requires the continued operation of sophisticated information technology systems and network infrastructure. despite our implementation of security measures, all of our technology systems are vulnerable to disability or failures due to hacking, viruses, acts of war or terrorism and other causes. if our information technology systems were to fail and we were unable to recover in a timely way, we might be unable to fulfill critical business functions, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, and financial condition.
in addition, our generation plants, gas pipeline and storage facilities and electrical distribution facilities in particular may be targets of terrorist activities that could disrupt our ability to produce or distribute some portion of our energy products. we have increased security as a result of past events and we may be required by our regulators or by the future terrorist threat environment to make investments in security that we cannot currently predict.
failure to maintain the security of personally identifiable information could adversely affect us.  in connection with our business we collect and retain personally identifiable information of our customers, shareholders and employees. our customers, shareholders and employees expect that we will adequately protect their personal information, and the regulatory environment surrounding information security and privacy is increasingly demanding. a significant theft, loss or fraudulent use of customer, shareholder, employee or dte energy data by cybercrime or otherwise could adversely impact our reputation and could result in significant costs, fines and litigation.
failure to attract and retain key executive officers and other skilled professional and technical employees could have an adverse effect on our operations.  our business is dependent on our ability to attract and retain skilled employees. competition for skilled employees in some areas is high and the inability to attract and retain these employees could adversely affect our business and future operating results. in addition, we have an aging utility workforce and the failure of a successful transfer of knowledge and expertise could negatively impact our operations.
a work interruption may adversely affect us.  there are several bargaining units for the company's approximately 4,900 represented employees. the majority of represented employees are under contracts that expire in 2016 and 2017. a union choosing to strike would have an impact on our business. we are unable to predict the effect a work stoppage would have on our costs of operation and financial performance.
if our goodwill becomes impaired, we may be required to record a charge to earnings.  we annually review the carrying value of goodwill associated with acquisitions made by the company for impairment. factors that may be considered for purposes of this analysis include any change in circumstances indicating that the carrying value of our goodwill may not be recoverable such as a decline in stock price and market capitalization, future cash flows, and slower growth rates in our industry. we cannot predict the timing, strength or duration of any economic slowdown or subsequent recovery, worldwide or in the economy or markets in which we operate; however, when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of these assets may not be recoverable, the company may take a non-cash impairment charge, which could potentially materially impact our results of operations and financial position.
the company's businesses have safety risks. the company's electric and gas distribution systems, power plants, gas infrastructure, wind energy equipment and other facilities could be involved in incidents that result in injury or property loss to employees, customers, or the public. although we have insurance coverage for many potential incidents, depending upon the nature and severity of any incident, the company could experience financial loss, damage to its reputation, and negative consequences from regulatory agencies or other public authorities.
we may not be fully covered by insurance.  we have a comprehensive insurance program in place to provide coverage for various types of risks, including catastrophic damage as a result of acts of god, terrorism or a combination of other significant unforeseen events that could impact our operations. economic losses might not be covered in full by insurance or our insurers may be unable to meet contractual obligations.
item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations executive overview dte energy is a diversified energy company with 2014 operating revenues of approximately $12.3 billion and approximately $28.0 billion in assets. we are the parent company of dte electric and dte gas, regulated electric and natural gas utilities engaged primarily in the business of providing electricity and natural gas sales, distribution and storage services throughout michigan. we operate three energy-related non-utility segments with operations throughout the united states.
the following table summarizes our financial results:
the increase in 2014 income from continuing operations attributable to dte energy company is primarily due to higher earnings in the energy trading, electric, power and industrial projects, and gas storage and pipelines segments. the decrease in 2013 income from continuing operations attributable to dte energy company is primarily due to lower earnings in the energy trading segment, partially offset by higher earnings in the gas and power and industrial projects segments.
please see detailed explanations of segment performance in the following results of operations section.
dte energy's strategy is to achieve long-term earnings growth, a strong balance sheet and an attractive dividend yield.
our utilities' growth will be driven by base infrastructure, new generation and environmental compliance capital investments. we are focused on executing plans to achieve operational excellence and customer satisfaction with a focus on customer affordability. we operate in a constructive regulatory environment and have solid relationships with our regulators.
we have significant investments in our non-utility businesses. we employ disciplined investment criteria when assessing growth opportunities that leverage our assets, skills and expertise and provide diversity in earnings and geography. specifically, we invest in targeted energy markets with attractive competitive dynamics where meaningful scale is in alignment with our risk profile. we expect growth opportunities in the gas storage and pipelines and power and industrial projects segments.
a key priority for dte energy is to maintain a strong balance sheet which facilitates access to capital markets and reasonably priced short-term and long-term financing. near-term growth will be funded through internally generated cash flows and the issuance of debt. we have an enterprise risk management program that, among other things, is designed to monitor and manage our exposure to earnings and cash flow volatility related to commodity price changes, interest rates and counterparty credit risk.
capital investments our utility businesses require significant base capital investments each year in order to maintain and improve the reliability of asset bases, including power generation plants, distribution systems, storage fields and other facilities and fleets. dte electric's capital investments over the 2015-2019 period are estimated at $5.7 billion for base infrastructure, $1.4 billion for new generation and $400 million for environmental compliance. dte electric plans to seek regulatory approval in general rate case filings and renewable energy plan filings for capital expenditures consistent with prior ratemaking treatment.
dte gas's capital investments over the 2015-2019 period are estimated at $1 billion for base infrastructure and $600 million for gas main renewal, meter move out, and pipeline integrity programs. in april 2013, the mpsc issued an order approving an infrastructure recovery mechanism for dte gas and authorized the recovery of the cost of service related to $77 million of annual investment in its gas main renewal, meter move out, and pipeline integrity programs. in november 2014, dte gas filed an application with the mpsc for approval of an increased infrastructure recovery mechanism surcharge to recover an additional $47 million of annual capital expenditures for its gas main renewal program. dte gas plans to seek regulatory approval in general rate case filings for base infrastructure capital expenditures consistent with prior ratemaking treatment.
environmental matters we are subject to extensive environmental regulation. additional costs may result as the effects of various substances on the environment are studied and governmental regulations are developed and implemented. actual costs to comply could vary substantially. we expect to continue recovering environmental costs related to utility operations through rates charged to our customers.
dte electric is subject to the epa ozone and fine particulate transport and acid rain regulations that limit power plant emissions of sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides. since 2005, the epa and the state of michigan have issued additional emission reduction regulations relating to ozone, fine particulate, regional haze. mercury, and other air pollution. these rules will lead to additional emission controls on fossil-fueled power plants to reduce nitrogen oxide, sulfur dioxide, acid gases, particulate matter and mercury emissions. to comply with these requirements, dte electric spent approximately $2.2 billion through 2014. it is estimated that dte electric will make capital expenditures of approximately $100 million in 2015 and up to approximately $30 million of additional capital expenditures through 2019 based on current regulations.
as directed by a june 2013 presidential memorandum, the epa is implementing regulatory actions under the clean air act to address emissions of greenhouse gases (ghgs) from the utility sector and other sectors of the economy. among these actions, the epa is proposing performance standards for emissions of carbon dioxide from new and existing electric generating units (egus). the new source performance standards for new egus were proposed in september 2013 and the standards for existing, reconstructed and modified egus were proposed in june 2014. the epa plans to issue a final standard for both new and existing sources by july 2015 as described in the june 2013 presidential memorandum.
dte energy is an active participant in working with the epa and other stakeholders to shape the final performance standards for new and existing power plants. the carbon standards for new sources are not expected to have a material impact on the company, since the company has no plans to build new coal-fired generation. it is not possible to determine the potential impact of future regulations on existing sources at this time. pending or future legislation or other regulatory actions could have a material impact on our operations and financial position and the rates we charge our customers. impacts include expenditures for environmental equipment beyond what is currently planned, financing costs related to additional capital expenditures, the purchase of emission credits from market sources, higher costs of purchased power, and the retirement of facilities where control equipment is not economical. we would seek to recover these incremental costs through increased rates charged to our utility customers as authorized by the mpsc.
increased costs for energy produced from traditional coal-based sources could also increase the economic viability of energy produced from renewable, natural gas-fired generation and/or nuclear sources, from energy efficiency initiatives, and from the potential development of market-based trading of carbon offsets which could provide new business opportunities for our utility and non-utility segments. a june 2014 u.s. supreme court decision on the epa's authority to regulate ghg emissions under permitting programs of the clean air act is expected to have little effect on dte energy since the supreme court's decision upholds the epa's authority to regulate ghgs at sources that are already subject to permitting due to emissions of conventional pollutants. in addition, the supreme court's ruling does not affect the epa's current proposed carbon performance standards at new or existing power plants. at the present time, it is not possible to quantify the financial impacts of these climate related regulatory initiatives on dte energy or its customers.
see note 17 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report, "commitments and contingencies" and items 1. and 2. business and properties for further discussion of environmental matters.
outlook the next few years will be a period of rapid change for dte energy and for the energy industry. our strong utility base, combined with our integrated non-utility operations, position us well for long-term growth.
looking forward, we will focus on several areas that we expect will improve future performance:
•   electric and gas customer satisfaction;
•   rate competitiveness and affordability;
•   regulatory stability and investment recovery for our utilities;
•   growth of our utility asset base;
•   employee engagement;
•   cost structure optimization across all business segments;
•   cash, capital and liquidity to maintain or improve our financial strength; and
•   investments that integrate our assets and leverage our skills and expertise.
we will continue to pursue opportunities to grow our businesses in a disciplined manner if we can secure opportunities that meet our strategic, financial and risk criteria.
results of operations the following sections provide a detailed discussion of the operating performance and future outlook of our segments.
electric our electric segment consists principally of dte electric.
operating revenues                                       $5,283              $5,199              $5,293

gross margin increased by $47 million in 2014 and decreased $4 million in 2013. revenues associated with certain mechanisms and surcharges are offset by related expenses elsewhere in the consolidated statements of operations.
the following table details changes in various gross margin components relative to the comparable prior period:
amortization of refundable revenue decoupling/deferred gain     $63              $-
base sales, inclusive of weather effect                         (48   )         (54   )

electric customer choice, including self generators (b)    5,033              5,200              5,197
operation and maintenance expense decreased $45 million in 2014 and decreased $52 million in 2013. the decrease in 2014 is primarily due to decreased employee benefit expenses of $68 million, decreased distribution operations expenses of $36 million, and decreased power plant generation expenses of $7 million, partially offset by higher restoration and line clearance expenses of $19 million, increased low income energy assistance of $17 million, and increased energy optimization and renewable energy expenses of $13 million. in addition, 2014 included $17 million of expenses related to the transition of pld customers to dte electric's distribution system effective july 1, 2014. in may 2014, the mpsc approved a trm that provides for recovery of the deferred net incremental revenue requirement associated with the transition that is reflected in the depreciation and amortization line in the consolidated statement of operations. the decrease in 2013 is primarily due to decreased employee benefit expenses of $90 million, decreased power plant generation expenses of $14 million and decreased low income energy assistance of $12 million, partially offset by increased restoration and line clearance expenses of $19 million, increased corporate administrative expenses of $17 million, increased uncollectible expenses of $11 million, increased energy optimization and renewable energy expenses of $8 million and increased distribution operations expenses of $8 million.
depreciation and amortization expense increased $31 million in 2014 and increased $75 million in 2013. the 2014 increase was due to $42 million of increased expense due to an increased depreciable base, increased amortization of regulatory assets of $3 million, primarily related to securitization, partially offset by $14 million associated with the trm. the 2013 increase was due to increased amortization of regulatory assets of $57 million, primarily related to securitization, and increased depreciation of $18 million due to an increased depreciable base.
other (income) and deductions decreased $36 million in 2014 and decreased $3 million in 2013. the decrease in 2014 was primarily due to decreased interest expenses of $18 million and the 2013 contribution to the dte energy foundation of $18 million. the decrease in 2013 was primarily due to 2012 one time expenses of $11 million related to michigan ballot proposals and increased investment earnings of $10 million, offset by a contribution to the dte energy foundation of $18 million.
outlook - we continue to move forward in our efforts to achieve operational excellence, sustained strong cash flows and earn our authorized return on equity. we expect that our planned significant capital investments will result in earnings growth. looking forward, additional factors may impact earnings such as weather, the outcome of regulatory proceedings, benefit plan design changes, investment returns and changes in discount rate assumptions in benefit plans and health care costs and uncertainty of legislative or regulatory actions regarding climate change and electric retail access. we expect to continue our efforts to improve productivity and decrease our costs while improving customer satisfaction with consideration of customer rate affordability.
in may 2014, dte electric filed an application with the nrc requesting a renewal of the license for its fermi 2 nuclear power plant. dte electric has requested a 20-year extension of its original license due to expire in 2025.
in december 2014, dte electric filed a rate case with the mpsc requesting an increase in base rates of $370 million based on a projected twelve month period ending june 30, 2016.
gas our gas segment consists principally of dte gas.
operating revenues                                       $1,636              $1,474              $1,315

operating income                                            295                 270                 234
operating income as a percent of operating revenues          18   %              18   %              18   %
gross margin increased $61 million in 2014 and increased $85 million in 2013. revenues associated with certain mechanisms and surcharges are offset by related expenses elsewhere in the consolidated statements of operations.
the following table details changes in various gross margin components relative to the comparable prior period:
infrastructure recovery mechanism                   7               3
gas markets (in bcf)
operation and maintenance expense increased $27 million in 2014 and increased $44 million in 2013. the increase in 2014 is primarily due to increased gas operations expenses of $32 million, increased uncollectible expenses of $4 million, and increased corporate administrative expenses of $3 million, partially offset by decreased employee benefit expenses of $10 million and reduced energy optimization expenses of $2 million. the increase in 2013 is primarily due to increased gas operations expenses of $24 million, increased maintenance and repair costs of $14 million, increased transmission costs of $14 million, increased corporate administrative expenses of $8 million and increased uncollectible expenses of $5 million, partially offset by decreased employee benefit expenses of $19 million and decreased energy optimization expenses of $3 million.
other (income) and deductions increased $27 million in 2014 and decreased $19 million in 2013. the increase in 2014 is primarily due to contributions to the dte energy foundation and other charitable organizations in 2014. the decrease in 2013 is due to lack of a contribution to the dte energy foundation in 2013, partially offset by a $5 million contribution to low income energy assistance funds.
outlook - we continue to move forward in our efforts to achieve operational excellence, sustained strong cash flows and earn our authorized return on equity. we expect that our planned significant infrastructure capital investments will result in earnings growth. looking forward, additional factors may impact earnings such as weather, the outcome of regulatory proceedings, benefit plan design changes, and investment returns and changes in discount rate assumptions in benefit plans and health care costs. we expect to continue our efforts to improve productivity and decrease our costs while improving customer satisfaction with consideration of customer rate affordability.
gas storage and pipelines our gas storage and pipelines segment consists of our non-utility gas pipelines and storage businesses.
operating revenues                              $203              $132             $96
operation and maintenance                         46                25              19

operating revenues increased $71 million in 2014 and increased $36 million in 2013. the increases were due primarily to increased volumes on the bluestone pipeline and additional segments placed in service in the susquehanna gathering system. storage revenue also increased due to weather favorability in early 2014, partially offset by lower market rates.
operation and maintenance expense increased $21 million in 2014 and increased $6 million in 2013. the increases were due primarily to increased activity on the bluestone and susquehanna projects and increased corporate overheads due to growth of this segment.
depreciation and amortization expense increased $11 million in 2014 and increased $15 million in 2013. the increases were due primarily to the growth of the bluestone and susquehanna projects.
other (income) and deductions decreased $17 million in 2014 and decreased $4 million in 2013. the decreases were due to decreased earnings from a pipeline investment and increased intercompany interest expense. the earnings from the pipeline investment were negatively impacted by a revenue deferral for depreciation collected in ferc-approved tariff rates in excess of depreciation expense.
outlook - our gas storage and pipelines business expects to maintain its steady growth by developing an asset portfolio with multiple growth platforms through investment in new projects and expansions. we will continue to look for additional investment opportunities and other storage and pipeline projects at favorable prices. the capacity expansion of bluestone lateral pipeline in susquehanna county, pennsylvania and broome county, new york, is progressing as planned. in 2014, we added a new compressor facility and 3.5 miles of 24-inch pipeline loop, expanding the system to 47.5 miles of pipe in service. expansion activities over the next twelve months include a second compressor facility and approximately 6 miles of additional pipeline loop to accommodate increased shipper demand. through our long term agreement with southwestern energy production company, we believe bluestone lateral and susquehanna gathering system are strategically positioned for future growth of the marcellus shale.
progress continues on preliminary development activities on the proposed nexus pipeline, a transportation path for natural gas from the utica shale in ohio to michigan and ontario. during 2014, several producers signed agreements as shippers, indicating their firm volume commitment subject to certain conditions customary in the pipeline industry. we are planning to have a partnership interest in the nexus pipeline.
power and industrial projects power and industrial projects is comprised primarily of projects that deliver energy and utility-type products and services to industrial, commercial and institutional customers; produce ref and sell electricity from renewable energy projects.

operating revenues increased $339 million in 2014 and increased $127 million in 2013. the 2014 increase is primarily due to a $354 million increase associated with higher volumes from ref projects and a $32 million increase associated with the start-up of a renewable power project, partially offset by a $46 million decrease due primarily to lower coal prices associated with the steel business. the 2013 increase is primarily due to a $161 million increase associated with higher volumes from ref projects and a $102 million increase due to the on-site energy projects acquired in the 2012 fourth quarter, partially offset by a $75 million decrease from exiting the coal transportation and marketing business and a $63 million decrease due primarily to lower coal prices associated with the steel business.
operation and maintenance expense increased $367 million in 2014 and increased $126 million in 2013. the 2014 increase is primarily due to a $365 million increase associated with higher volumes from ref projects, a $23 million increase associated with the start-up of a renewable power project and a $20 million increase due to higher volumes, maintenance and general administrative expenses in the steel business, partially offset by a $46 million decrease due primarily to lower coal prices associated with the steel business. the 2013 increase is primarily due to a $173 million increase associated with higher volumes from ref projects and an $84 million increase due to the on-site energy projects acquired in the 2012 fourth quarter, partially offset by a $67 million decrease from exiting the coal transportation and marketing business and a $67 million decrease due primarily to lower coal prices associated with the steel business.
depreciation and amortization expense increased by $5 million in 2014 and increased by $7 million in 2013. the 2014 increase is primarily due to $4 million associated with the start-up of a renewable power project. the 2013 increase is primarily due to $10 million associated with the on-site energy projects acquired in the 2012 fourth quarter, partially offset by a $3 million decrease from exiting the coal transportation and marketing business.
asset (gains) and losses, reserves and impairments, net increased by $8 million in 2014 and decreased by $1 million in 2013. the 2014 increase was due primarily to a gain associated with a sale of an on-site project in 2014 and an asset impairment recorded in the prior year.
other (income) and deductions decreased by $7 million in 2014 and increased $29 million in 2013 due primarily to variations in volumes of refined coal produced at ref sites with investors, and in 2014, lower equity earnings at various projects.
production tax credits increased by $44 million in 2014 and increased $9 million in 2013 primarily due to higher production volumes of refined coal that resulted in higher tax credits at ref projects.
outlook - the company has constructed and placed in service nine ref facilities including five facilities located at third party owned coal-fired power plants. the company has sold membership interests in four of the facilities. we continue to optimize these facilities by seeking investors for facilities operating at dte electric and other utility sites. we intend to relocate an underutilized facility, located at a dte electric site, to an alternative coal-fired power plant which may provide increased production and emission reduction opportunities in future years.
we expect sustained production levels of metallurgical coke and pulverized coal supplied to steel industry customers for 2015. substantially all of the metallurgical coke margin is maintained under long-term contracts. we have five renewable power generation facilities in operation. our on-site energy services will continue to be delivered in accordance with the terms of long-term contracts. we will continue to look for additional investment opportunities and other energy projects at favorable prices.
power and industrial projects will continue to leverage its extensive energy-related operating experience and project management capability to develop additional energy projects to serve energy intensive industrial customers.
energy trading energy trading focuses on physical and financial power and natural gas marketing and trading, structured transactions, enhancement of returns from dte energy's asset portfolio, and optimization of contracted natural gas pipeline transportation and storage, and generating capacity positions. energy trading also provides natural gas, power and related services, which may include the management of associated storage and transportation contracts on the customers' behalf, and the supply or purchase of renewable energy credits to various customers.

operating revenues and fuel, purchased power and gas were impacted by an increase in gas volumes and prices, primarily in our gas structured strategy for the year ended december 31, 2014.
gross margin increased $295 million in 2014 and decreased $109 million in 2013. the overall increase in gross margin in 2014 was primarily due to timing from mtm adjustments on certain transactions in our gas structured strategy.
the increase in gross margin in 2014 represents a $92 million increase in realized margins and a $203 million increase in unrealized margins. the $92 million increase in realized margins is due to $149 million of favorable results, primarily in our gas structured and gas transportation strategies, offset by $57 million of unfavorable results, primarily in our power full requirements, gas full requirements and gas trading strategies. the $203 million increase in unrealized margins is due to $211 million of favorable results, primarily in our gas structured and gas full requirements strategies, offset by $8 million of unfavorable results, primarily in our power full requirements strategy.
the decrease in gross margin in 2013 represents a $1 million decrease in realized margins and a $108 million decrease in unrealized margins. the $1 million decrease in realized margins is due to $40 million of unfavorable results, primarily in our power trading, power full requirements and gas transportation strategies, offset by $39 million of favorable results, primarily in our gas and coal trading and gas structured strategies. the $108 million decrease in unrealized margins is due to $123 million of unfavorable results, primarily in our gas structured, gas trading and gas transportation strategies, offset by $15 million of favorable results, primarily in our power full requirements strategy.
natural gas structured transactions typically involve a physical purchase or sale of natural gas in the future and/or natural gas basis financial instruments which are derivatives and a related non-derivative pipeline transportation contract. these gas structured transactions can result in significant earnings volatility as the derivative components are marked-to-market without revaluing the related non-derivative contracts. during the fourth quarter of 2014 we saw significant decreases in gas prices, and in the fourth quarter of 2013 significant increases in gas prices which led to the volatility in the accounting earnings due to the physical component being marked-to-market without an offsetting mark on the transportation component. included in the $149 million of favorable realized results for the year ended december 31, 2014 in our gas strategies is $65 million of timing related losses recognized in 2013 that reversed as the underlying contracts were settled. included in the $211 million of favorable unrealized results for the year ended december 31, 2014 in our gas strategies is $102 million of timing related gains which will reverse in future periods, and the absence of $89 million of timing related losses in 2013. we anticipate that approximately $50 million of unrealized gains will reverse during 2015 as the underlying contracts settle.
outlook - in the near-term, we expect market conditions to remain challenging and the profitability of this segment may be impacted by the volatility in commodity prices in the markets we participate in and the uncertainty of impacts associated with financial reform, regulatory changes and changes in operating rules of regional transmission organizations.
the energy trading portfolio includes financial instruments, physical commodity contracts and natural gas inventory, as well as contracted natural gas pipeline transportation and storage, and generation capacity positions. energy trading also provides natural gas, power and related services, which may include the management of associated storage and transportation contracts on the customers' behalf, and the supply or purchase of renewable energy credits to various customers. significant portions of the energy trading portfolio are economically hedged. most financial instruments and physical power and natural gas contracts are deemed derivatives, whereas natural gas inventory, pipeline transportation, renewable energy credits, and storage assets are not derivatives. as a result, we will experience earnings volatility as derivatives are marked-to-market without revaluing the underlying non-derivative contracts and assets. our strategy is to economically manage the price risk of these underlying non-derivative contracts and assets with futures, forwards, swaps and options. this results in gains and losses that are recognized in different interim and annual accounting periods.
corporate and other corporate and other includes various holding company activities and holds certain non-utility debt and energy-related investments. the 2014 net loss of $57 million represented an increase of $13 million from the 2013 net loss of $44 million due primarily to increased impairments of investments and increased deferred tax expense related to new york state income tax reform enacted march 31, 2014. the 2013 net loss of $44 million represented an improvement of $3 million from the 2012 net loss of $47 million due primarily to decreased impairments of investments.
see note 9 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report, "income taxes".
discontinued operations unconventional gas production in december 2012, the company sold its 100% equity interest in its unconventional gas production business which consisted of gas and oil production assets in the western barnett and marble falls shale areas of texas. see note 4 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report, "discontinued operations".
capital resources and liquidity cash requirements we use cash to maintain and expand our electric and natural gas utilities and to grow our non-utility businesses, retire and pay interest on long-term debt and pay dividends. we believe that we will have sufficient internal and external capital resources to fund anticipated capital and operating requirements. we expect that cash from operations in 2015 will be approximately $1.7 billion, or approximately $100 million lower than 2014, due primarily to decreased surcharge collections. we anticipate base level utility capital investments, environmental, renewable and energy optimization expenditures, expenditures for non-utility businesses and contributions to equity method investments in 2015 of approximately $2.6 billion. we plan to seek regulatory approval to include utility capital expenditures in our regulatory rate base consistent with prior treatment. capital spending for growth of existing or new non-utility businesses will depend on the existence of opportunities that meet our strict risk-return and value creation criteria.

cash from operating activities a majority of our operating cash flow is provided by our electric and natural gas utilities, which are significantly influenced by factors such as weather, electric customer choice, regulatory deferrals, regulatory outcomes, economic conditions, changes in working capital, and operating costs.
cash from operations decreased $315 million in 2014. the reduction in operating cash flow reflects an increase in cash expenditures for working capital items, partially offset by higher net income after adjusting for non-cash and non-operating items (primarily depreciation, depletion and amortization and deferred income taxes).
cash from operations decreased $55 million in 2013. the reduction in operating cash flow reflects lower cash generated from working capital items, partially offset by higher net income after adjusting for non-cash and non-operating items (primarily depreciation, depletion and amortization and deferred income taxes).
the change in working capital items in 2014 primarily related to fuel inventories, derivative assets and liabilities, and regulatory assets and liabilities, partially offset by the change in accounts receivable, net, accounts payable, and pension and other postretirement liabilities. the change in working capital items in 2013 primarily related to fuel inventories, derivative assets and liabilities and pension and other postretirement liabilities, partially offset by the change in accounts receivable, net.
cash used for investing activities cash inflows associated with investing activities are primarily generated from the sale of assets, while cash outflows are the result of plant and equipment expenditures. in any given year, we will look to realize cash from under-performing or non-strategic assets or matured fully valued assets.
capital spending within the utility business is primarily to maintain and improve our electric generation and electric and natural gas distribution infrastructure and to comply with environmental regulations and renewable energy requirements.
capital spending within our non-utility businesses is primarily for ongoing maintenance, expansion and growth. we look to make growth investments that meet strict criteria in terms of strategy, management skills, risks and returns. all new investments are analyzed for their rates of return and cash payback on a risk adjusted basis. we have been disciplined in how we deploy capital and will not make investments unless they meet our criteria. for new business lines, we initially invest based on research and analysis. we start with a limited investment, we evaluate results and either expand or exit the business based on those results. in any given year, the amount of growth capital will be determined by the underlying cash flows of the company with a clear understanding of any potential impact on our credit ratings.
net cash used for investing activities increased $154 million in 2014 due primarily to increased capital expenditures by our utility businesses, partially offset by decreased capital expenditures by our non-utility business and increased proceeds from sale of assets.
net cash used for investing activities increased $137 million in 2013 due primarily to increased capital expenditures by our utility businesses.
cash used for financing activities we rely on both short-term borrowing and long-term financing as a source of funding for our capital requirements not satisfied by our operations.
our strategy is to have a targeted debt portfolio blend of fixed and variable interest rates and maturity. we continually evaluate our leverage target, which is currently 50% to 53%, to ensure it is consistent with our objective to have a strong investment grade debt rating.
net cash from financing activities increased $478 million in 2014. the increase was primarily attributable to increases in short-term borrowings and issuances of long-term debt, partially offset by increased redemptions of long-term debt, repurchases of common stock and increased dividends on common stock.
net cash used for financing activities decreased $182 million in 2013. the decrease was primarily attributable to higher issuances of long-term debt, partially offset by higher redemptions of long-term debt.
outlook we expect cash flow from operations to increase over the long-term primarily as a result of growth from our utilities and non-utility businesses. we expect growth in our utilities to be driven primarily by capital spending to maintain and improve our electric generation and electric and natural gas distribution infrastructure and to comply with new and existing state and federal regulations that will result in additional environmental and renewable energy investments which will increase the base from which rates are determined. our non-utility growth is expected from additional investments primarily in our gas storage and pipelines and power and industrial projects segments.
we may be impacted by the timing of collection or refund of our various recovery and tracking mechanisms as a result of timing of mpsc orders. energy prices are likely to be a source of volatility with regard to working capital requirements for the foreseeable future. we are continuing our efforts to identify opportunities to improve cash flow through working capital initiatives and maintaining flexibility in the timing and extent of our long-term capital projects.
we have approximately $300 million in long-term debt maturing in the next twelve months. the repayment of the principal amount of the securitization debt is funded through a surcharge payable by dte electric's customers. the repayment of the other debt is expected to be paid through internally generated funds or the issuance of long-term debt.
dte energy has approximately $1.5 billion of available liquidity at december 31, 2014, consisting of cash and amounts available under unsecured revolving credit agreements.
we expect to issue equity of approximately $200 million in 2015 through our dividend reinvestment plan and pension and other employee benefit plans.
at the discretion of management, and depending upon financial market conditions, we anticipate making 2015 contributions to the pension plans of up to $180 million and up to $200 million to the other postretirement benefit plans. the planned contributions will be made in cash or a combination of cash and dte energy common stock.
various subsidiaries of the company have entered into contracts which contain ratings triggers and are guaranteed by dte energy. these contracts contain provisions which allow the counterparties to require that the company post cash or letters of credit as collateral in the event that dte energy's credit rating is downgraded below investment grade. certain of these provisions (known as "hard triggers") state specific circumstances under which the company can be required to post collateral upon the occurrence of a credit downgrade, while other provisions (known as "soft triggers") are not as specific. for contracts with soft triggers, it is difficult to estimate the amount of collateral which may be requested by counterparties and/or which the company may ultimately be required to post. the amount of such collateral which could be requested fluctuates based on commodity prices (primarily natural gas, power and coal) and the provisions and maturities of the underlying transactions. as of december 31, 2014, dte energy's contractual obligation to post collateral in the form of cash or letter of credit in the event of a downgrade to below investment grade, under both hard trigger and soft trigger provisions, was approximately $349 million.
we believe we have sufficient operating flexibility, cash resources and funding sources to maintain adequate amounts of liquidity and to meet our future operating cash and capital expenditure needs. however, virtually all of our businesses are capital intensive or require access to capital, and the inability to access adequate capital could adversely impact earnings and cash flows.
see notes 8, 9, 13, 15 and 18 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report, "regulatory matters", "income taxes", "long-term debt", "short-term credit arrangements and borrowings" and "retirement benefits and trusteed assets".
contractual obligations the following table details our contractual obligations for debt redemptions, leases, purchase obligations and other long-term obligations as of december 31, 2014:
capital lease obligations                                                         11                   8                   3                     -                         -
operating leases                                                                 219                  42                  62                    37                        78
(a)   excludes $14 million of unamortized discount on debt.
(c)   includes liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits of $9 million.
(d)   excludes other long-term liabilities of $192 million not directly derived from contracts or other agreements.
(e)   at december 31, 2014, we met the minimum pension funding levels required under the employee retirement income security act of 1974 (erisa) and the pension protection act of 2006 for our defined benefit pension plans. we may contribute more than the minimum funding requirements for our pension plans and may also make contributions to our other postretirement benefit plans; however, these amounts are not included in the table above as such amounts are discretionary. planned funding levels are disclosed in the capital resources and liquidity and critical accounting estimates sections herein and in note 18 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report, "retirement benefits and trusteed assets".
credit ratings credit ratings are intended to provide banks and capital market participants with a framework for comparing the credit quality of securities and are not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities. dte energy's credit ratings affect our cost of capital and other terms of financing as well as our ability to access the credit and commercial paper markets. management believes that our current credit ratings provide sufficient access to the capital markets. however, disruptions in the banking and capital markets not specifically related to us may affect our ability to access these funding sources or cause an increase in the return required by investors.
as part of the normal course of business, dte electric, dte gas and various non-utility subsidiaries of the company routinely enter into physical or financially settled contracts for the purchase and sale of electricity, natural gas, coal, capacity, storage and other energy-related products and services. certain of these contracts contain provisions which allow the counterparties to request that the company post cash or letters of credit in the event that the senior unsecured debt rating of dte energy is downgraded below investment grade. certain of these contracts for dte electric and dte gas contain similar provisions in the event that the senior unsecured debt rating of the particular utility is downgraded below investment grade. the amount of such collateral which could be requested fluctuates based upon commodity prices and the provisions and maturities of the underlying transactions and could be substantial. also, upon a downgrade below investment grade, we could have restricted access to the commercial paper market and if dte energy is downgraded below investment grade our non-utility businesses, especially the energy trading and power and industrial projects segments, could be required to restrict operations due to a lack of available liquidity. a downgrade below investment grade could potentially increase the borrowing costs of dte energy and its subsidiaries and may limit access to the capital markets. the impact of a downgrade will not affect our ability to comply with our existing debt covenants. while we currently do not anticipate such a downgrade, we cannot predict the outcome of current or future credit rating agency reviews.
in january 2014, based on a favorable view of the u.s. regulatory environment, moody's upgraded dte energy's unsecured debt rating from 'baa1' to 'a3' and upgraded the secured debt rating of dte electric and dte gas from 'a1' to 'aa3'.
critical accounting estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles require that management apply accounting policies and make estimates and assumptions that affect results of operations and the amounts of assets and liabilities reported in the financial statements. management believes that the areas described below require significant judgment in the application of accounting policy or in making estimates and assumptions in matters that are inherently uncertain and that may change in subsequent periods. additional discussion of these accounting policies can be found in the notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report.
regulation a significant portion of our business is subject to regulation. this results in differences in the application of generally accepted accounting principles between regulated and non-regulated businesses. dte electric and dte gas are required to record regulatory assets and liabilities for certain transactions that would have been treated as revenue or expense in non-regulated businesses. future regulatory changes or changes in the competitive environment could result in the discontinuance of this accounting treatment for regulatory assets and liabilities for some or all of our businesses. management believes that currently available facts support the continued use of regulatory assets and liabilities and that all regulatory assets and liabilities are recoverable or refundable in the current rate environment.

derivatives and hedging activities derivatives are generally recorded at fair value and shown as derivative assets or liabilities. changes in the fair value of the derivative instruments are recognized in earnings in the period of change, unless the derivative meets certain defined conditions and qualifies as an effective hedge. the normal purchases and normal sales exception requires, among other things, physical delivery in quantities expected to be used or sold over a reasonable period in the normal course of business. contracts that are designated as normal purchases and normal sales are not recorded at fair value. substantially all of the commodity contracts entered into by dte electric and dte gas meet the criteria specified for this exception.
fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date in a principal or most advantageous market. fair value is a market-based measurement that is determined based on inputs, which refer broadly to assumptions that market participants use in pricing assets and liabilities. these inputs can be readily observable, market corroborated or generally unobservable inputs. management makes certain assumptions it believes that market participants would use in pricing assets and liabilities, including assumptions about risk, and the risks inherent in the inputs to valuation techniques. credit risk of the company and our counterparties is incorporated in the valuation of the assets and liabilities through the use of credit reserves, the impact of which was immaterial at december 31, 2014 and 2013. management believes it uses valuation techniques that maximize the use of observable market-based inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs.
the fair values we calculate for our derivatives may change significantly as inputs and assumptions are updated for new information. actual cash returns realized on our derivatives may be different from the results we estimate using models. as fair value calculations are estimates based largely on commodity prices, we perform sensitivity analyses on the fair values of our forward contracts. see sensitivity analysis in item 7a. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk. see also the fair value section, herein.
see notes 11 and 12 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report, "fair value" and "financial and other derivative instruments".
allowance for doubtful accounts we establish an allowance for doubtful accounts based on historical losses and management's assessment of existing economic conditions, customer trends, and other factors. the allowance for doubtful accounts for our two utilities is calculated using the aging approach that utilizes rates developed in reserve studies and applies these factors to past due receivable balances. we believe the allowance for doubtful accounts is based on reasonable estimates.
asset impairments goodwill certain of our reporting units have goodwill or allocated goodwill resulting from purchase business combinations. we perform an impairment test for each of our reporting units with goodwill annually or whenever events or circumstances indicate that the value of goodwill may be impaired.
in performing step 1 of the impairment test, we compare the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying value including goodwill. if the carrying value including goodwill were to exceed the fair value of a reporting unit, step 2 of the test would be performed. step 2 of the impairment test requires the carrying value of goodwill to be reduced to its fair value, if lower, as of the test date.
for step 1 of the test, we estimate the reporting unit's fair value using standard valuation techniques, including techniques which use estimates of projected future results and cash flows to be generated by the reporting unit. such techniques generally include a terminal value that utilizes an earnings multiple approach, which incorporates the current market values of comparable entities. these cash flow valuations involve a number of estimates that require broad assumptions and significant judgment by management regarding future performance. we also employ market-based valuation techniques to test the reasonableness of the indications of value for the reporting units determined under the cash flow technique.
we performed our annual impairment test as of october 1, 2014 and determined that the estimated fair value of each reporting unit exceeded its carrying value, and no impairment existed. as part of the annual impairment test, we also compared the aggregate fair value of our reporting units to our overall market capitalization. the implied premium of the aggregate fair value over market capitalization is likely attributable to an acquisition control premium (the price in excess of a stock's market price that investors typically pay to gain control of an entity). the results of the test and key estimates that were incorporated are as follows.
as of october 1, 2014 valuation date:
(a)   percentage by which the fair value of equity of the reporting unit would need to decline to equal its carrying value, including goodwill.
(b)   multiple of enterprise value (sum of debt plus equity value) to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (ebitda).
we perform an annual impairment test each october. in between annual tests, we monitor our estimates and assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows, including the impact of movements in market indicators in future quarters and will update our impairment analyses if a triggering event occurs. while we believe our assumptions are reasonable, actual results may differ from our projections. to the extent projected results or cash flows are revised downward, the reporting unit may be required to write down all or a portion of its goodwill, which would adversely impact our earnings.
long-lived assets we evaluate the carrying value of our long-lived assets, excluding goodwill, when circumstances indicate that the carrying value of those assets may not be recoverable. conditions that could have an adverse impact on the cash flows and fair value of the long-lived assets are deteriorating business climate, condition of the asset, or plans to dispose of the asset before the end of its useful life. the review of long-lived assets for impairment requires significant assumptions about operating strategies and estimates of future cash flows, which require assessments of current and projected market conditions. an impairment evaluation is based on an undiscounted cash flow analysis at the lowest level for which independent cash flows of long-lived assets can be identified from other groups of assets and liabilities. impairment may occur when the carrying value of the asset exceeds the future undiscounted cash flows. when the undiscounted cash flow analysis indicates a long-lived asset is not recoverable, the amount of the impairment loss is determined by measuring the excess of the long-lived asset over its fair value. an impairment would require us to reduce both the long-lived asset and current period earnings by the amount of the impairment, which would adversely impact our earnings.
pension and other postretirement costs we sponsor defined benefit pension plans and other postretirement benefit plans for eligible employees of the company. the measurement of the plan obligations and cost of providing benefits under these plans involve various factors, including numerous assumptions and accounting elections. when determining the various assumptions that are required, we consider historical information as well as future expectations. the benefit costs are affected by, among other things, the actual rate of return on plan assets, the long-term expected return on plan assets, the discount rate applied to benefit obligations, the incidence of mortality, the expected remaining service period of plan participants, level of compensation and rate of compensation increases, employee age, length of service, the anticipated rate of increase of health care costs, benefit plan design changes and the level of benefits provided to employees and retirees. pension and other postretirement benefit costs attributed to the segments are included with labor costs and ultimately allocated to projects within the segments, some of which are capitalized.
we had pension costs of $179 million in 2014, $228 million in 2013 and $220 million in 2012. other postretirement benefit costs (credit) were $(123) million in 2014, $(42) million in 2013 and $151 million in 2012. pension and other postretirement benefit costs (credit) for 2014 are calculated based upon a number of actuarial assumptions, including an expected long-term rate of return on our plan assets of 7.75% for our pension plans and 8% for our other postretirement benefit plans. in developing our expected long-term rate of return assumptions, we evaluated asset class risk and return expectations, as well as inflation assumptions. projected returns are based on broad equity, bond and other markets. our 2015 expected long-term rate of return on pension plan assets is based on an asset allocation assumption utilizing active investment management of 47% in equity markets, 25% in fixed income markets, and 28% invested in other assets. because of market volatility, we periodically review our asset allocation and rebalance our portfolio when considered appropriate. given market conditions and financial market risk considerations, we are maintaining our long-term rate of return assumptions for our pension plans and our other postretirement plans at 7.75% and 8%, respectively for 2015. we believe these rates are reasonable assumptions for the long-term rate of return on our plan assets for 2015 given our investment strategy. we will continue to evaluate our actuarial assumptions, including our expected rate of return, at least annually.
we calculate the expected return on pension and other postretirement benefit plan assets by multiplying the expected return on plan assets by the market-related value (mrv) of plan assets at the beginning of the year, taking into consideration anticipated contributions and benefit payments that are to be made during the year. current accounting rules provide that the mrv of plan assets can be either fair value or a calculated value that recognizes changes in fair value in a systematic and rational manner over not more than five years. for our pension plans, we use a calculated value when determining the mrv of the pension plan assets and recognize changes in fair value over a three-year period. accordingly, the future value of assets will be impacted as previously deferred gains or losses are recognized. financial markets in 2014 contributed to our investment performance resulting in unrecognized net gains. as of december 31, 2014, we had $78 million of cumulative gains that remain to be recognized in the calculation of the mrv of pension assets related to investment performance in 2014, 2013 and 2012. for our other postretirement benefit plans, we use fair value when determining the mrv of other postretirement benefit plan assets, therefore all investment gains and losses have been recognized in the calculation of mrv for these plans.
the discount rate that we utilize for determining future pension and other postretirement benefit obligations is based on a yield curve approach and a review of bonds that receive one of the two highest ratings given by a recognized rating agency. the yield curve approach matches projected pension plan and other postretirement benefit payment streams with bond portfolios reflecting actual liability duration unique to our plans. the discount rate determined on this basis decreased to 4.12% for the pension plans and 4.1% for the other postretirement plans at december 31, 2014 from 4.95% at december 31, 2013.
the mortality assumptions that we used to determine the pension and other postretirement benefit obligations as of december 31, 2014, were updated to incorporate the rp-2014 mortality table issued by the society of actuaries in 2014 with the mp-2014 generational projection scale, with variations by type of plan and participant's union status and employment status.
we estimate that our 2015 total pension costs will approximate $218 million compared to $179 million in 2014 primarily due to lower discount rates and changes to the mortality tables, partially offset by greater than expected 2014 returns. our 2015 other postretirement benefit credit will approximate $(98) million compared to $(123) million in 2014 due to lower than expected returns, lower discount rate and changes to the mortality tables, partially offset by the continued impact of plan design changes and favorable retiree medical utilization trends. our health care trend rate for pre-65 participants assumes 7.5% for 2015, and 7% for 2016 and 2017, 6.5% for 2018, 6% in 2019, 5.75% in 2020, 5.5% in 2021, 5.25% in 2022, 5% in 2023, 4.75% in 2024, and 4.5% in 2025 and beyond. our health care trend rate for post-65 participants assumes 6.5% for 2015 and 6.25% for 2016 and 2017, 6% in 2018, 5.75% in 2019, 5.5% in 2020, 5.25% in 2021, 5% in 2022, 4.75% in 2023, and 4.5% in 2024 and beyond. future actual pension and other postretirement benefit costs (credit) will depend on future investment performance, changes in future discount rates and various other factors related to plan design.
lowering the expected long-term rate of return on our plan assets by one percentage point would have increased our 2014 pension costs by approximately $33 million. lowering the discount rate and the salary increase assumptions by one percentage point would have increased our 2014 pension costs by approximately $18 million. lowering the expected long-term rate of return on our plan assets by one percentage point would have decreased our 2014 other postretirement credit by approximately $15 million. lowering the discount rate assumption by one percentage point would have decreased our 2014 other postretirement credit by approximately $24 million. lowering the health care cost trend assumptions by one percentage point would have increased our other postretirement credit for 2014 by approximately $7 million.
the value of our qualified pension and other postretirement benefit plan assets was $5.5 billion at december 31, 2014 and $5.2 billion at december 31, 2013. at december 31, 2014, our qualified pension plans were underfunded by $1.17 billion and our other postretirement benefit plans were underfunded by $517 million. the 2014 funding levels generally declined due to decreased discount rates and a change in the mortality tables.
pension and other postretirement costs and pension cash funding requirements may increase in future years without typical returns in the financial markets. we made contributions to our qualified pension plans of $188 million in 2014 and $277 million in 2013. at the discretion of management, consistent with the pension protection act of 2006, and depending upon financial market conditions, we anticipate making contributions to our qualified pension plans of up to $180 million in 2015 and up to $875 million over the next five years. we made other postretirement benefit plan contributions of $24 million in 2014 and $264 million in 2013. we are required by orders issued by the mpsc to make other postretirement benefit contributions at least equal to the amounts included in our utilities' base rates. as a result, we anticipate making up to a $200 million contribution to our other postretirement plans in 2015 and, subject to mpsc funding requirements, up to $250 million over the next five years. the planned contributions will be made in cash or a combination of cash and dte energy common stock.
see note 18 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report, "retirement benefits and trusteed assets".
legal reserves we are involved in various legal proceedings, claims and litigation arising in the ordinary course of business. we regularly assess our liabilities and contingencies in connection with asserted or potential matters, and establish reserves when appropriate. legal reserves are based upon management's assessment of pending and threatened legal proceedings and claims against us.
insured and uninsured risks our comprehensive insurance program provides coverage for various types of risks. our insurance policies cover risk of loss including property damage, general liability, workers' compensation, auto liability, and directors' and officers' liability. under our risk management policy, we self-insure portions of certain risks up to specified limits, depending on the type of exposure. the maximum self-insured retention for various risks is $10 million for property damage, $7 million for general liability, $9 million for workers' compensation and $7 million for auto liability. we have an actuarially determined estimate of our incurred but not reported (ibnr) liability prepared annually and we adjust our reserves for self-insured risks as appropriate. as of december 31, 2014, this ibnr liability was approximately $32 million.
accounting for tax obligations we are required to make judgments regarding the potential tax effects of various financial transactions and results of operations in order to estimate our obligations to taxing authorities. we account for uncertain income tax positions using a benefit recognition model with a two-step approach, a more-likely-than-not recognition criterion and a measurement attribute that measures the position as the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. if the benefit does not meet the more likely than not criteria for being sustained on its technical merits, no benefit will be recorded. uncertain tax positions that relate only to timing of when an item is included on a tax return are considered to have met the recognition threshold. we also have non-income tax obligations related to property, sales and use and employment-related taxes and ongoing appeals related to these tax matters.
accounting for tax obligations requires judgments, including assessing whether tax benefits are more likely than not to be sustained, and estimating reserves for potential adverse outcomes regarding tax positions that have been taken. we also assess our ability to utilize tax attributes, including those in the form of carry-forwards, for which the benefits have already been reflected in the financial statements. we believe the resulting tax reserve balances as of december 31, 2014 and 2013 are appropriate. the ultimate outcome of such matters could result in favorable or unfavorable adjustments to our consolidated financial statements and such adjustments could be material.

fair value derivatives are generally recorded at fair value and shown as derivative assets or liabilities. contracts we typically classify as derivative instruments include power, natural gas, oil and certain coal forwards, futures, options and swaps, and foreign currency exchange contracts. items we do not generally account for as derivatives include natural gas inventory, pipeline transportation contracts, renewable energy credits and storage assets. see notes 11 and 12 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report, "fair value" and "financial and other derivative instruments".
the tables below do not include the expected earnings impact of non-derivative natural gas storage, transportation, certain power contracts and renewable energy credits which are subject to accrual accounting. consequently, gains and losses from these positions may not match with the related physical and financial hedging instruments in some reporting periods, resulting in volatility in dte energy's reported period-by-period earnings; however, the financial impact of the timing differences will reverse at the time of physical delivery and/or settlement.
the company manages its mtm risk on a portfolio basis based upon the delivery period of its contracts and the individual components of the risks within each contract. accordingly, the company records and manages the energy purchase and sale obligations under its contracts in separate components based on the commodity (e.g. electricity or natural gas), the product (e.g. electricity for delivery during peak or off-peak hours), the delivery location (e.g. by region), the risk profile (e.g. forward or option), and the delivery period (e.g. by month and year).
the company has established a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value in three broad levels. the fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (level 1) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (level 3). for further discussion of the fair value hierarchy, see note 11 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report, "fair value".
the following tables provide details on changes in our mtm net asset (or liability) position during 2014:
changes in fair value recorded to income                            79
changes in fair value recorded in regulatory liabilities             8
change in collateral held by (for) others                           28

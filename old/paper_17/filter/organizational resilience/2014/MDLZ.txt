we manufacture and source products and materials on a global scale. we have a complex network of suppliers, owned manufacturing locations, co-manufacturing locations, distribution networks and information systems that support our ability to provide our products to our customers consistently. factors that are hard to predict or beyond our control, like weather, natural disasters, fire, explosions, terrorism, political unrest, generalized labor unrest or health pandemics could damage or disrupt our operations or our suppliers or co-manufacturers operations. if we do not effectively respond to disruptions in our operations, for example, by finding alternative suppliers or replacing capacity at key manufacturing or distribution locations, or cannot quickly repair damage to our information, production or supply systems, we may be late in delivering or unable to deliver products to our customers. if that occurs, we may lose our customers confidence, and long-term consumer demand for our products could decline. in addition, we might not have the functions, processes or organizational capability necessary to achieve on our anticipated timeframes our strategic ambition to reconfigure our supply chain and drive efficiencies to fuel growth. further, changes to regulatory restrictions within the markets in which we operate may impact our ability to supply multiple markets with a streamlined manufacturing footprint. these events could materially and adversely affect our product sales, financial condition and results of operations.
on january 1, 2014, an organizational change occurred within our north america region from a country and product category structure to a regional product category structure. as a result, our north america region now has two instead of four reporting units. for any reporting units that were reorganized, the goodwill was allocated to the new reporting unit structure based on relative fair values of the related business units.

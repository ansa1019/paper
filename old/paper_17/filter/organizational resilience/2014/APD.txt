2014 charge on 18 september 2014, we announced plans to reorganize the company, including realignment of our businesses into new reporting segments and organizational changes, effective as of 1 october 2014. as a result of this initiative, we will incur ongoing severance and other charges. during the fourth quarter of 2014, an expense of $12.7 ($8.2 after-tax, or $.04 per share) was incurred relating to the elimination of approximately 50 positions. in 2015 and beyond, we expect the actions taken to date will provide approximately $10 in annual savings. additional charges will be recorded in future periods as the company commits to specific actions. these actions could materially impact future operating profit for the period in which the charges are recorded.

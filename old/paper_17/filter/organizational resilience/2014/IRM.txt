item 1a. risk factors.
we face many risks. if any of the events or circumstances described below actually occur, we and our businesses, financial condition or results of operations could suffer, and the trading price of our debt or equity securities could decline. our current and potential investors should consider the following risks and the information contained under the heading "cautionary note regarding forward-looking statements" before deciding to invest in our securities.
risks related to operating as a reit if we fail to remain qualified as a reit, we will be subject to tax at corporate income tax rates and will not be able to deduct distributions to stockholders when computing our taxable income.
we began operating as a reit for federal income tax purposes effective for the taxable year beginning january 1, 2014; however, we can provide no assurance that we will remain qualified as a reit. if we fail to remain qualified as a reit, we will be taxed at corporate income tax rates unless certain relief provisions apply.
reit qualification involves the application of highly technical and complex provisions of the internal revenue code of 1986, as amended (the "code"), which provisions may change from time to time, to our operations as well as various factual determinations concerning matters and circumstances not entirely within our control. there are limited judicial or administrative interpretations of these provisions.
if, in any taxable year, we fail to remain qualified for taxation as a reit and are not entitled to relief under the code:
any such corporate tax liability could be substantial and would reduce the amount of cash available for other purposes.
we expect to continue paying regular quarterly distributions, and, to achieve maximum tax efficiency and retain cash to allow us to make selective discretionary investments, we currently anticipate our typical regular quarterly distributions will be based on a payment of approximately 100% of our reit taxable income; however, the amount, timing and form of our regular quarterly distributions will be determined, and will be subject to adjustment, by our board of directors. to remain qualified and be taxed as a reit, we are generally required to distribute at least 90% of our reit taxable income (determined without regard to the dividends paid deduction and excluding net capital gain) each year to our stockholders. generally, we expect to distribute all or substantially all of our reit taxable income. if our cash available for distribution falls short of our estimates, we may be unable to maintain distributions that approximate our reit taxable income and may fail to remain qualified for taxation as a reit. in addition, our cash flows from operations may be insufficient to
fund required distributions as a result of differences in timing between the actual receipt of income and the recognition of income for federal income tax purposes, or the effect of nondeductible expenditures, such as capital expenditures, payments of compensation for which section 162(m) of the code denies a deduction, the creation of reserves or required debt service or amortization payments.
to the extent that we satisfy the 90% distribution requirement but distribute less than 100% of our reit taxable income, we will be subject to federal corporate income tax on our undistributed taxable income. in addition, we will be subject to a 4% nondeductible excise tax if the actual amount that we distribute to our stockholders for a calendar year is less than the minimum amount specified under the code.
we may be required to borrow funds, sell assets or raise equity to satisfy reit distribution requirements, to comply with asset ownership tests or to fund capital expenditures, future growth and expansion initiatives.
in order to meet the reit distribution requirements and maintain our qualification and taxation as a reit, or to fund capital expenditures, future growth and expansion initiatives, we may need to borrow funds, sell assets or raise equity, even if the then-prevailing market conditions are not favorable for these borrowings, sales or offerings. any insufficiency of our cash flows to cover our reit distribution requirements could adversely impact our ability to raise short- and long-term debt, to sell assets, or to offer equity securities in order to fund distributions required to maintain our qualification and taxation as a reit. furthermore, the reit distribution requirements may increase the financing we need to fund capital expenditures, future growth and expansion initiatives. this would increase our indebtedness. an increase in our outstanding debt could lead to a downgrade of our credit rating. a downgrade of our credit rating could negatively impact our ability to access credit markets. further, certain of our current debt instruments limit the amount of indebtedness we and our subsidiaries may incur. additional financing, therefore, may be unavailable, more expensive or restricted by the terms of our outstanding indebtedness. for a discussion of risks related to our substantial level of indebtedness, see "risks relating to our indebtedness."
whether we issue equity, at what price and the amount and other terms of any such issuances will depend on many factors, including alternative sources of capital, our then-existing leverage, our need for additional capital, market conditions and other factors beyond our control. if we raise additional funds through the issuance of equity securities or debt convertible into equity securities, the percentage of stock ownership by our existing stockholders may be reduced. in addition, new equity securities or convertible debt securities could have rights, preferences and privileges senior to those of our current stockholders, which could substantially decrease the value of our securities owned by them. depending on the share price we are able to obtain, we may have to sell a significant number of shares in order to raise the capital we deem necessary to execute our long-term strategy, and our stockholders may experience dilution in the value of their shares as a result.
in addition, if we fail to comply with specified asset ownership tests applicable to reits as measured at the end of any calendar quarter, we must correct such failure within 30 days after the end of the applicable calendar quarter or qualify for statutory relief provisions to avoid losing our reit qualification. as a result, we may be required to liquidate otherwise attractive investments. these actions may reduce our income and amounts available for distribution to our stockholders.
at any time, the federal income tax laws governing reits or the administrative interpretations of those laws may be amended. federal and state tax laws are constantly under review by persons involved in the legislative process, the irs, the united states department of the treasury and state taxing authorities. changes to the tax laws, regulations and administrative interpretations, which may have retroactive application, could adversely affect us. in addition, some of these changes could have a more
significant impact on us as compared to other reits due to the nature of our business and our substantial use of taxable reit subsidiaries ("trss"). we cannot predict with certainty whether, when, in what forms, or with what effective dates, the tax laws, regulations and administrative interpretations applicable to us may be changed.
complying with reit requirements may limit our flexibility or cause us to forgo otherwise attractive opportunities.
to remain qualified as a reit for federal income tax purposes, we must continually satisfy tests concerning, among other things, the sources of our income, the nature and diversification of our assets and the amounts we distribute to our stockholders. thus, compliance with these tests may require us to refrain from certain activities and may hinder our ability to make certain attractive investments, including the purchase of non-reit qualifying operations or assets, the expansion of non-real estate activities, and investments in the businesses to be conducted by our trss, and to that extent limit our opportunities and our flexibility to change our business strategy. furthermore, acquisition opportunities in domestic and international markets may be adversely affected if we need or require the target company to comply with some reit requirements prior to closing.
we conduct a significant portion of our business activities, including our information management services businesses and several of our international operations, through domestic and foreign trss. under the code, no more than 25% of the value of the assets of a reit may be represented by securities of one or more trss and other nonqualifying assets. this limitation may affect our ability to make additional investments in non-reit qualifying operations or assets or in international operations through trss.
our ability to receive distributions from our trss is limited by the rules with which we must comply to maintain our status as a reit. in particular, at least 75% of our gross income for each taxable year as a reit must be derived from real estate, which principally includes gross income from providing customers with secure storage space. consequently, no more than 25% of our gross income may consist of dividend income from our trss and other nonqualifying types of income. thus, our ability to receive distributions from our trss may be limited, and may impact our ability to fund distributions to our stockholders using cash flows from our trss. specifically, if our trss become highly profitable, we might become limited in our ability to receive net income from our trss in an amount required to fund distributions to our stockholders commensurate with that profitability.
in addition, a significant amount of our income and cash flows from our trss is generated from our international operations. in many cases, there are local withholding taxes and currency controls that may impact our ability or willingness to repatriate funds to the united states to help satisfy reit distribution requirements.
our extensive use of trss, including for certain of our international operations, may cause us to fail to remain qualified as a reit.
the net income of our trss is not required to be distributed to us, and income that is not distributed to us generally is not subject to the reit income distribution requirement. however, there may be limitations on our ability to accumulate earnings in our trss and the accumulation or reinvestment of significant earnings in our trss could result in adverse tax treatment. in particular, if the accumulation of cash in our trss causes the fair market value of our securities in our trss and other nonqualifying assets to exceed 25% of the fair market value of our assets, we will fail to remain qualified as a reit.
a reit generally is required to distribute at least 90% of its reit taxable income to its stockholders.
our board of directors, in its sole discretion, will determine on a quarterly basis the amount of cash to be distributed to our stockholders based on a number of factors including, but not limited to, our results of operations, cash flow and capital requirements, economic conditions, tax considerations, borrowing capacity and other factors, including debt covenant restrictions that may impose limitations on cash payments, future acquisitions and divestitures, any stock repurchase program and general market demand for our space and services. consequently, our distribution levels may fluctuate.
even if we remain qualified as a reit, some of our business activities are subject to corporate level income tax and foreign taxes, which will reduce our cash flows, and we will have potential deferred and contingent tax liabilities.
even if we remain qualified for taxation as a reit, we may be subject to some federal, state, local and foreign taxes on our income and assets, including alternative minimum taxes, taxes on any undistributed income, and state, local or foreign income, franchise, property and transfer taxes. in addition, we could in certain circumstances be required to pay an excise or penalty tax, which could be significant in amount, in order to utilize one or more relief provisions under the code to maintain qualification for taxation as a reit.
our information management services businesses are conducted through wholly owned trss because these activities could generate nonqualifying reit income as currently structured and operated. the income of our domestic trss will continue to be subject to federal and state corporate income taxes. in addition, our international assets and operations will continue to be subject to taxation in the foreign jurisdictions where those assets are held or those operations are conducted. any of these taxes would decrease our earnings and our available cash.
we will also be subject to a federal corporate level tax at the highest regular corporate tax rate (currently 35%) on gain recognized from a sale of assets occurring within a specified period (generally ten years) after the effective date of our reit election, that is, january 1, 2014, to the extent of the built-in-gain based on the fair market value of those assets on the effective date of the reit election in excess of our then tax basis. in addition, depreciation recapture income that we recognized in our 2014 taxable year and will recognize in subsequent taxable years, as a result of accounting method changes that were effective prior to january 1, 2014, has been and will be fully subject to this 35% tax.
in addition, the irs and any state or local tax authority may successfully assert liabilities against us for corporate income taxes for our pre-reit period, in which case we will owe these taxes plus applicable interest and penalties, if any. moreover, any increase in taxable income for these pre-reit periods will likely result in an increase in pre-reit accumulated earnings and profits, which could cause us to pay an additional taxable distribution to our stockholders after the relevant determination.
complying with reit requirements may limit our ability to hedge effectively and increase the cost of our hedging and may cause us to incur tax liabilities.
the reit provisions of the code limit our ability to hedge liabilities. generally, income from hedging transactions that we enter into to manage risk of interest rate changes with respect to borrowings made or to be made to acquire or carry real estate assets and income from certain currency hedging transactions related to our non-u.s. operations do not constitute "gross income" for purposes of the reit gross income tests. to the extent that we enter into other types of hedging transactions, the income from those transactions is likely to be treated as nonqualifying income for purposes of the reit gross income tests. as a result of these rules, we may need to limit our use of advantageous
hedging techniques or implement those hedges through our trss. this could increase the cost of our hedging activities because our trss would be subject to tax on income or gains resulting from hedges entered into by them or expose us to greater risks associated with changes in interest rates or exchange rates than we would otherwise want to bear. in addition, hedging losses in any of our trss generally will not provide any tax benefit, except for being carried forward for possible use against future taxable income in the trss.
we have limited experience operating as a reit, which may adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow, per share trading price of our common stock, ability to forecast dividends and ability to satisfy debt service obligations.
we began operating as a reit on january 1, 2014 and, as such, have limited operating history as a reit. in addition, prior to january 1, 2014 our senior management team had no prior experience operating a reit. we can provide no assurance that our past experience has sufficiently prepared us to operate successfully as a reit. our inability to operate successfully as a reit, including the failure to maintain reit status, could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
qualifying distributions payable by corporations to individuals, trusts and estates that are united states stockholders are currently eligible for federal income tax at preferential rates. distributions payable by reits, in contrast, generally are not eligible for the preferential rates. the preferential rates applicable to regular corporate distributions could cause investors who are individuals, trusts and estates to perceive investments in reits to be relatively less attractive than investments in the stock of non-reit corporations that pay distributions, which could adversely affect the value of the stock of reits, including our common stock.
the ownership and transfer restrictions contained in our certificate of incorporation may not protect our status as a reit, could have unintended antitakeover effects and may prevent our stockholders from receiving a takeover premium.
in order for us to remain qualified as a reit, no more than 50% of the value of outstanding shares of our capital stock may be owned, beneficially or constructively, by five or fewer individuals at any time during the last half of each taxable year other than the first year for which we elect to be taxed as a reit. in addition, rents from "affiliated tenants" will not qualify as qualifying reit income if we own 10% or more by vote or value of the customer, whether directly or after application of attribution rules under the code. subject to certain exceptions, our certificate of incorporation prohibits any stockholder from owning, beneficially or constructively, more than (i) 9.8% in value of the outstanding shares of all classes or series of our capital stock or (ii) 9.8% in value or number, whichever is more restrictive, of the outstanding shares of any class or series of our capital stock. we refer to these restrictions collectively as the "ownership limits" and we included them in our certificate of incorporation to facilitate our compliance with reit tax rules. the constructive ownership rules under the code are complex and may cause the outstanding stock owned by a group of related individuals or entities to be deemed to be constructively owned by one individual or entity. as a result, the acquisition of less than 9.8% of our outstanding common stock (or the outstanding shares of any class or series of our capital stock) by an individual or entity could cause that individual or entity or another individual or entity to own constructively in excess of the relevant ownership limits. any attempt to own or transfer shares of our common stock or of any of our other capital stock in violation of these restrictions may result in the shares being automatically transferred to a charitable trust or may be void. even though our certificate of incorporation contains the ownership limits, there can be no assurance that these provisions will be effective to prevent our reit status from being jeopardized, including under the affiliated tenant rule. furthermore, there can be no assurance that we will be able
to monitor and enforce the ownership limits. if the restrictions in our certificate of incorporation are not effective and as a result we fail to satisfy the reit tax rules described above, then absent an applicable relief provision, we will fail to remain qualified as a reit.
in addition, the ownership and transfer restrictions could delay, defer or prevent a transaction or a change in control that might involve a premium price for our stock or otherwise be in the best interest of our stockholders. as a result, the overall effect of the ownership and transfer restrictions may be to render more difficult or discourage any attempt to acquire us, even if such acquisition may be favorable to the interests of our stockholders.
the ability of our board of directors to change our major policies without the consent of stockholders may not be in the interest of our stockholders.
our board of directors determines our major policies, including policies and guidelines relating to our investments, acquisitions, leverage, financing, growth, operations and distributions to our stockholders. our board of directors may amend or revise these and other policies and guidelines from time to time without the vote or consent of our stockholders. accordingly, our stockholders will have limited control over changes in our policies, and any such changes could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, the market price of our common stock and our ability to make distributions to our stockholders.
operational risks our customers may shift from paper and tape storage to alternative technologies that require less physical space.
we derive most of our revenues from rental fees for the storage of paper documents and computer backup tapes and from storage related services. alternative storage technologies exist, many of which require significantly less space than paper documents and tapes, and as alternative technologies are adopted, storage related services may decline as the physical records or tapes we store become less active and more archived. we can provide no assurance that our customers will continue to store most or a portion of their records as paper documents or in tape format. the adoption of alternative technologies may also result in decreased demand for services related to the paper documents and tapes we store. a significant shift by our customers to storage of data through non-paper or tape-based technologies, whether now existing or developed in the future, could adversely affect our businesses.
as stored records become less active our service revenue growth and profitability may decline.
our records management service revenue growth is being negatively impacted by declining activity rates as stored records are becoming less active. the amount of information available to customers through the internet or their own information systems has been steadily increasing in recent years. as a result, while we continue to experience growth in storage rental, our customers are less likely than they have been in the past to retrieve records, thereby reducing their service activity levels. at the same time many of our costs related to records related services remain fixed. in addition, our reputation for providing secure information storage is critical to our success, and actions to manage cost structure, such as outsourcing certain transportation, security or other functions, could negatively impact our reputation and adversely affect our business. ultimately, if we are unable to appropriately align our cost structure with decreased levels of service revenue, our operating results could be adversely affected.
changes in customer behavior with respect to document destruction and pricing could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
we have experienced pricing pressure in recent years as some customers have become more cost conscious with respect to their information management expenditures. some customers have taken actions designed to reduce costs associated with the retention of documents, including reducing the volume of documents they store and adopting more aggressive destruction practices. if we are unable to increase pricing over time, or if rates of destruction of documents stored with us increase substantially, particularly in our developed and slower growing markets, our financial condition and results of operations would be adversely affected.
governmental and customer focus on data security could increase our costs of operations. we may not be able to fully offset these costs through increases in our rates. incidents in which we fail to protect our customers' information against security breaches could result in monetary damages against us and could otherwise damage our reputation, harm our businesses and adversely impact our results of operations. in addition, if we fail to protect our own information, including information about our employees, we could experience significant costs and expenses as well as damage to our reputation.
in reaction to publicized incidents in which electronically stored information has been lost, illegally accessed or stolen, almost all states in the united states have adopted breach of data security statutes or regulations that require notification to consumers if the security of their personal information is breached. in addition, certain federal laws and regulations affecting financial institutions, health care providers and plans and others impose requirements regarding the privacy and security of information maintained by those institutions as well as notification to persons whose personal information is accessed by an unauthorized third party. some of these laws and regulations provide for civil fines in certain circumstances and require the adoption and maintenance of privacy and information security programs; our failure to be in compliance with any such programs may adversely affect our business. some states in the united states have adopted regulations requiring every company that maintains or stores personal information to adopt a comprehensive written information security program. the european commission has proposed a regulation and directive that will, if adopted, supersede directive 95/46/ec, which has governed the processing of personal data since 1995. it is anticipated that the proposed regulation and directive will significantly alter the security and privacy obligations of entities, such as iron mountain, that process data of residents of members of the european union and substantially increase penalties for violations. if adopted, we would be directly subject to some of these laws, and our customers, pursuant to agreements, would require us to comply with others.
continued governmental focus on data security may lead to additional legislative action in the united states. for example, the recently completed 113th congress considered legislation that would expand the federal data breach notification requirement beyond the financial and medical fields, and it is anticipated that the 114th congress will also consider such issues. also, an increasing number of countries have introduced and/or increased enforcement of comprehensive privacy laws, or are expected to do so. the continued emphasis on information security as well as increasing concerns about government surveillance may lead customers to request that we take additional measures to enhance security and assume higher liability under our contracts. while we have experienced incidents in which customers' backup tapes or other records have been lost, and we have been informed by customers that some of the incidents involved the loss of personal information, resulting in monetary costs to those customers for which we have provided reimbursement. as a result of legislative initiatives and client demands, we may have to modify our operations with the goal of further improving data security. any such modifications may result in increased expenses and operating complexity, and we may be unable to increase the rates we charge for our services sufficiently to offset any increased expenses.
in addition to increases in the costs of operations or potential liability that may result from a heightened focus on data security or losses of information, our reputation may be damaged by any
compromise of security, accidental loss or theft of our own records, or information that we maintain with respect to our employees, as well as customer data in our possession. we believe that establishing and maintaining a good reputation is critical to attracting and retaining customers. if our reputation is damaged, we may become less competitive, which could negatively impact our businesses, financial condition or results of operations.
as of december 31, 2014, we operated 977 records management and off-site data protection facilities worldwide, including 561 in the united states. many of these facilities were built and outfitted by third parties and added to our real estate portfolio as part of acquisitions. some of these facilities contain fire suppression and safety features that are different from our current specifications and current standards for new facilities although we believe all of our facilities were constructed, in all material respects, in compliance with laws and regulations in effect at the time of their construction or outfitting. in some instances local authorities having jurisdiction may take the position that our fire suppression and safety features in a particular facility are insufficient and require additional measures that may involve considerable expense to us. in addition, where we determine that the fire suppression and safety features of a facility require improvement, we will develop and implement a plan to remediate the issue, although implementation may require an extended period to complete. if additional fire safety and suppression measures beyond our current operating plan were required at a large number of our facilities, the expense required for compliance could negatively impact our business, financial condition or results of operations.
our customer contracts may not always limit our liability and may sometimes contain terms that could lead to disputes in contract interpretation.
our customer contracts typically contain provisions limiting our liability with respect to loss or destruction of, or damage to, records or information stored with us. our liability under physical storage contracts is often limited to a nominal fixed amount per item or unit of storage, such as per cubic foot and our liability under our dms and other service contracts is often limited to a percentage of annual revenue under the contract; however, some of our contracts with large volume accounts and some of the contracts assumed in our acquisitions contain no such limits or contain higher limits. we cannot provide assurance that where we have limitation of liability provisions they will be enforceable in all instances or, if enforceable, that they would otherwise protect us from liability. in addition to provisions limiting our liability, our standard storage rental and service contracts include a schedule setting forth the majority of the customer-specific terms, including storage rental and service pricing and service delivery terms. our customers may dispute the interpretation of various provisions in their contracts. in the past, we have had relatively few disputes with our customers with regard to the terms of their customer contracts, and most disputes to date have not been material, but we can provide no assurance that we will not have material disputes in the future. although we maintain a comprehensive insurance program, we can provide no assurance that we will be able to maintain insurance policies on acceptable terms in order to cover losses to us in connection with customer contract disputes.
failure to comply with certain regulatory and contractual requirements under our united states government contracts could adversely affect our revenues, operating results and financial position.
selling our services to the united states government subjects us to certain regulatory and contractual requirements. failure to comply with these requirements could subject us to investigations, price reductions, up to treble damages, and civil penalties. noncompliance with certain regulatory and contractual requirements could also result in us being suspended or barred from future united states government contracting. we may also face private derivative securities claims as a result of adverse
government actions. any of these outcomes could have a material adverse effect on our revenues, operating results, financial position and reputation.
international operations may pose unique risks.
as of december 31, 2014, we provided services in 35 countries outside the united states. as part of our growth strategy, we expect to continue to acquire or invest in storage and information management services businesses in select foreign markets, including countries where we do not currently operate. international operations are subject to numerous risks, including:
 the impact of foreign government regulations and united states regulations that apply to us wherever we operate; in particular, iron mountain is subject to united states and foreign anticorruption laws, such as the foreign corrupt practices act and the united kingdom bribery act, and, although we have implemented internal controls, policies and procedures and training to deter prohibited practices, our employees, partners, contractors or agents may violate or circumvent such policies and the law;
 the volatility of certain foreign economies in which we operate;
 unforeseen liabilities, particularly within acquired businesses;
 costs and difficulties associated with managing international operations of varying sizes and scale;
 the risk that business partners upon whom we depend for technical assistance or management and acquisition expertise in some markets outside of the united states will not perform as expected;
 difficulties attracting and retaining local management and key employees to operate our business in certain countries;
 cultural differences and differences in business practices and operating standards; and
in particular, our net income can be significantly affected by fluctuations in currencies associated with certain intercompany balances of our foreign subsidiaries owed to us and between our foreign subsidiaries.
we have operations in multiple foreign countries and, as a result, are subject to foreign exchange translation risk, which could have an adverse effect on our financial results.
we conduct business operations in several foreign countries through our foreign subsidiaries or affiliates, which operate in their respective local currencies. those local currencies are translated into united states dollars at the applicable exchange rates for inclusion in our consolidated financial statements. the results of operations of, and certain of our intercompany balances associated with, our international storage and information management services businesses are exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations, and as we have expanded our international operations, our exposure to exchange rate fluctuations has increased. upon translation, operating results may differ materially from expectations, and significant shifts in foreign currencies can impact our short-term results, as well as our long-term forecasts and targets. in addition, because we intend to distribute 100% of our reit taxable income to our stockholders, and any exchange rate fluctuations may negatively impact our reit taxable income, our distribution amounts may fluctuate as a result of exchange rate fluctuations.
we may be subject to certain costs and potential liabilities associated with the real estate required for our business.
because our business is heavily dependent on real estate, we face special risks attributable to the real estate we own or lease. such risks include:
 acquisition and occupancy costs that make it difficult to meet anticipated margins and difficulty locating suitable facilities due to a relatively small number of available buildings having the desired characteristics in some real estate markets;
 inability to use our real estate holdings effectively and costs associated with vacating or consolidating facilities if the demand for physical storage were to diminish because our customers choose other storage technologies or because competitors attract our customers; and
 liability under environmental laws for the costs of investigation and cleanup of contaminated real estate owned or leased by us, whether or not (i) we know of, or were responsible for, the contamination, or (ii) the contamination occurred while we owned or leased the property.
some of our current and formerly owned or leased properties were previously used by entities other than us for industrial or other purposes, or were affected by waste generated from nearby properties, that involved the use, storage, generation and/or disposal of hazardous substances and wastes, including petroleum products. in some instances this prior use involved the operation of underground storage tanks or the presence of asbestos-containing materials. where we are aware of environmental conditions that require remediation, we undertake appropriate activity, in accordance with all legal requirements. although we have from time to time conducted limited environmental investigations and remedial activities at some of our former and current facilities, we have not undertaken an in-depth environmental review of all of our properties. we therefore may be potentially liable for environmental costs like those discussed above and may be unable to sell, rent, mortgage or use contaminated real estate owned or leased by us. environmental conditions for which we might be liable may also exist at properties that we may acquire in the future. in addition, future regulatory action and environmental laws may impose costs for environmental compliance that do not exist today.
unexpected events could disrupt our operations and adversely affect our reputation and results of operations.
unexpected events, including fires or explosions at our facilities, natural disasters such as hurricanes and earthquakes, war or terrorist activities, unplanned power outages, supply disruptions and failure of equipment or systems, could adversely affect our reputation and results of operations. our customers rely on us to securely store and timely retrieve their critical information, and these events could result in customer service disruption, physical damage to one or more key operating facilities and the information stored in those facilities, the temporary closure of one or more key operating facilities or the temporary disruption of information systems, each of which could negatively impact our reputation and results of operations. during the past several years we have seen an increase in severe storms and hurricanes and our key facilities in florida and other coastal areas in particular are subject to this inherent risk.
damage to our reputation could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
our reputation for providing highly secure information storage to customers is critical to the success of our business. our reputation or brand, and specifically, the trust our customers place in us, could be negatively impacted in the event of perceived or actual failures by us to store information securely. for example, events such as fires, natural disasters, attacks on our information technology
systems or security breaches involving iron mountain could negatively impact our reputation, particularly if such incidents result in adverse publicity, governmental investigations or litigation. damage to our reputation could make us less competitive, which could negatively impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.
fluctuations in commodity prices may affect our operating revenues and results of operations.
our operating revenues and results of operations are impacted by significant changes in commodity prices. in particular, our secure shredding operations generate revenue from the sale of shredded paper to recyclers. we generate additional revenue through a customer surcharge when the price of diesel fuel rises above certain predetermined rates. as a result, significant declines in paper and diesel fuel prices may negatively impact our revenues and results of operations, and increases in other commodity prices, including steel, may negatively impact our results of operations.
attacks on our internal information technology systems could damage our reputation, harm our businesses and adversely impact our results of operations.
our reputation for providing secure information storage to customers is critical to the success of our business. we have previously faced attempts by unauthorized users to gain access to our information technology systems and expect to continue to face such attempts. although we seek to prevent, detect and investigate these security incidents and have taken steps to prevent such security breaches, our information technology and network infrastructure may be vulnerable to attacks by hackers or breaches due to employee error, malfeasance or other disruptions. a successful breach of the security of our information technology systems could lead to theft or misuse of our customers' proprietary or confidential information and result in third party claims against us and reputational harm. if our reputation is damaged, we may become less competitive, which could negatively impact our businesses, financial condition or results of operations.
we may be subject to claims that our technology violates the intellectual property rights of a third party.
third parties may have legal rights (including ownership of patents, trade secrets, trademarks and copyrights) to ideas, materials, processes, names or original works that are the same or similar to those we use. third parties have in the past, and may in the future, bring claims, or threaten to bring claims, against us that allege that their intellectual property rights are being infringed or violated by our use of intellectual property. litigation or threatened litigation could be costly and distract our senior management from operating our business. further, if we cannot establish our right or obtain the right to use the intellectual property on reasonable terms, we may be required to develop alternative intellectual property at our expense to mitigate potential harm.
we face competition for customers.
we compete with multiple storage and information management services providers in all geographic areas where we operate; our current or potential customers may choose to use those competitors instead of us. we also compete, in some of our business lines, with our current and potential customers' internal storage and information management services capabilities. these organizations may not begin or continue to use us for their future storage and information management service needs.
risks related to our indebtedness our substantial indebtedness could adversely affect our financial health and prevent us from fulfilling our obligations under our various debt instruments.
we have a significant amount of indebtedness. as of december 31, 2014, our total long-term debt was approximately $4.66 billion. our substantial indebtedness could have important consequences to our current and potential investors. these risks include:
 inability to adjust to adverse economic conditions;
 inability to fund future working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and other general corporate requirements, including possible required repurchases of our various indebtedness;
 limits on our distributions to stockholders; in this regard if these limits prevented us from satisfying our reit distribution requirements, we could fail to remain qualified for taxation as a reit or, if these limits do not jeopardize our qualification for taxation as a reit but do nevertheless prevent us from distributing
100% of our reit taxable income, we will be subject to federal corporate income tax, and potentially a nondeductible excise tax, on the retained amounts;
 limits on our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the information management services industry;
 limits on future borrowings under our existing or future credit arrangements, which could affect our ability to pay our indebtedness or to fund our other liquidity needs;
 loss of customers and reduced effectiveness in attracting new customers due to concerns over the levels of our debt or concern over financial ratios that are negatively impacted by our requirement to make large distributions as a reit and the impact of these on our operations;
restrictive debt covenants may limit our ability to pursue our growth strategy.
these restrictions may adversely affect our ability to pursue our acquisition and other growth strategies.
we may not have the ability to raise the funds necessary to finance the repurchase of outstanding senior or senior subordinated notes upon a change of control event as required by our indentures.
upon the occurrence of a "change of control", we will be required to offer to repurchase all outstanding senior or senior subordinated notes. however, it is possible that we will not have sufficient
funds at the time of the change of control to make the required repurchase of the notes or that restrictions in our revolving credit facility will not allow such repurchases. certain important corporate events, however, such as leveraged recapitalizations that would increase the level of our indebtedness, would not constitute a "change of control" under our indentures.
iron mountain is a holding company, and, therefore, our ability to make payments on our various debt obligations depends in part on the operations of our subsidiaries.
iron mountain is a holding company; substantially all of our assets consist of the stock of our subsidiaries, and substantially all of our operations are conducted by our direct and indirect wholly owned subsidiaries. as a result, our ability to make payments on our various debt obligations will be dependent upon the receipt of sufficient funds from our subsidiaries. however, our various debt obligations are guaranteed, on a joint and several and full and unconditional basis, by most, but not all, of our direct and indirect wholly owned united states subsidiaries.
acquisition and expansion risks elements of our strategic growth plan involve inherent risks.
as part of our strategic growth plan, we expect to invest in new business strategies, products, services, technologies and geographies and we may selectively divest certain businesses. these initiatives may involve significant risks and uncertainties, including distraction of management from current operations, insufficient revenues to offset expenses and liabilities associated with new investments, inadequate return of capital on these investments and the inability to attract, develop and retain skilled employees to lead and support new initiatives. for example, in 2013 we expanded our entry into the data center market by leasing wholesale and retail colocation space in our underground facility in pennsylvania, and in 2014 we opened our first regional data center in massachusetts, each of which required a significant capital commitment. many of these new ventures are inherently risky and we can provide no assurance that such strategies and offerings will be successful in achieving the desired returns within a reasonable timeframe, if at all, and that they will not adversely affect our business, reputation, financial condition, and operating results.
failure to manage our growth may impact operating results.
if we succeed in expanding our existing businesses, or in moving into new areas of business, that expansion may place increased demands on our management, operating systems, internal controls and financial and physical resources. if not managed effectively, these increased demands may adversely affect the services we provide to customers. in addition, our personnel, systems, procedures and controls may be inadequate to support future operations, particularly with respect to operations in countries outside of the united states or in new lines of business. consequently, in order to manage growth effectively, we may be required to increase expenditures to increase our physical resources, expand, train and manage our employee base, improve management, financial and information systems and controls, or make other capital expenditures. our results of operations and financial condition could be harmed if we encounter difficulties in effectively managing the budgeting, forecasting and other process control issues presented by future growth.
failure to successfully integrate acquired operations could negatively impact our balance sheet and results of operations.
strategic acquisitions are an important element of our growth strategy and the success of any acquisition we make depends in part on our ability to integrate the acquired company and realize anticipated synergies. the process of integrating acquired businesses, particularly in new markets, may involve unforeseen difficulties and may require a disproportionate amount of our management's
attention and our financial and other resources. we can give no assurance that we will ultimately be able to effectively integrate and manage the operations of any acquired business or realize anticipated synergies. the failure to successfully integrate the cultures, operating systems, procedures and information technologies of an acquired business could have a material adverse effect on our balance sheet and results of operations.
an important part of our growth strategy involves expanding operations in international markets, including in markets where we currently do not operate, and we expect to continue this expansion. europe, latin america and australia have been our primary areas of focus for international expansion, and we have expanded into the asia pacific region to a lesser extent. we have entered into joint ventures and have acquired all or a majority of the equity in storage and information management services businesses operating in these areas and may acquire other storage and information management services businesses in the future, including in new countries/markets where we currently do not operate.
this growth strategy involves risks. we may be unable to pursue this strategy in the future at the desired pace or at all. for example, we may be unable to:
 complete acquisitions on satisfactory terms;
 successfully expand our infrastructure and sales force to support growth;
 achieve satisfactory returns on acquired companies, particularly in countries where we do not currently operate;
 incur additional debt necessary to acquire suitable companies if we are unable to pay the purchase price out of working capital, common stock or other equity securities; or
 enter into successful business arrangements for technical assistance or management expertise outside of the united states.
we also compete with other storage and information management services providers for companies to acquire. some of our competitors may possess substantial financial and other resources. if any such competitor were to devote additional resources to pursue such acquisition candidates or focus its strategy on our international markets, the purchase price for potential acquisitions or investments could rise, competition in international markets could increase and our results of operations could be adversely affected.
item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations.
the following discussion should be read in conjunction with "item 6. selected financial data" and the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto and the other financial and operating information included elsewhere in this annual report.
this discussion contains "forward-looking statements" as that term is defined in the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 and in other securities laws. see "cautionary note regarding forward-looking statements" on page iii of this annual report and "item 1a. risk factors" beginning on page 13 of this annual report.
overview reit conversion we previously disclosed that, as part of our plan to convert to a reit for federal income tax purposes and elect reit status effective january 1, 2014 (the "conversion plan"), we sought plrs from the irs relating to numerous technical tax issues, including classification of our steel racking structures as qualified real estate assets. we submitted the plr requests in the third quarter of 2012, and on june 25, 2014, we announced that we received the favorable plrs from the irs necessary for our conversion to a reit. after receipt of the plrs, our board of directors unanimously approved our conversion to a reit for our taxable year beginning january 1, 2014.
in connection with the conversion plan, and, in particular, to impose ownership limitations customary for reits, on january 20, 2015, we completed the merger with our predecessor and all outstanding shares of our predecessor's common stock were converted into a right to receive an equal number of shares of our common stock.
total operating and capital expenditures associated with the conversion plan through the end of 2014 were approximately $180.7 million. of these amounts, approximately $47.0 million was incurred in 2012, including approximately $12.5 million of capital expenditures. additionally, approximately $106.3 million was incurred in 2013, including approximately $23.4 million of capital expenditures. also, we incurred approximately $27.4 million in 2014, including approximately $5.1 million of capital expenditures.
discontinued operations on april 27, 2012, we sold our records management operations in italy. the financial position, operating results and cash flows of our italian operations, including the loss on the sale of our italian operations, for all periods presented, have been reported as discontinued operations for financial reporting purposes. see note 14 to notes to consolidated financial statements included in this annual report.
in december 2014, we divested our secure shredding operations in australia, ireland and the united kingdom (the "international shredding operations") in a stock transaction for approximately $26.2 million of cash at closing, including $1.5 million being held in escrow. the assets sold primarily consisted of customer contracts and certain long-lived assets. we have concluded that this divestiture is not a discontinued operation and, therefore, have recorded a pretax gain on sale in other (income) expense, net of approximately $6.9 million ($10.2 million, inclusive of a tax benefit) in our consolidated statement of operations for the year ended december 31, 2014. revenues from our international shredding operations in 2014 represent less than 1% of our consolidated revenues. the international shredding operations were previously included in our international business segment.
restructuring in the third quarter of 2013, we implemented a plan that called for certain organizational realignments to advance our growth strategy and reduce operating costs, which was completed in 2014. as a result, we recorded restructuring costs of approximately $23.4 million and $3.5 million for the years ended december 31, 2013 and 2014, respectively, primarily related to employee severance and associated benefits. of the total restructuring costs incurred in 2013, $12.6 million, $2.1 million, $3.7 million and $5.0 million are reflected in the north american records and information management business, north american data management business, international business and corporate and other segments, respectively. of the total restructuring costs incurred in 2014, $1.6 million, $0.3 million and $1.5 million are reflected in the north american records and information management business, north american data management business and corporate and
other segments, respectively. in our consolidated statements of operations for the year ended december 31, 2013, $20.0 million and $3.4 million of these restructuring costs are recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses and cost of sales, respectively. in our consolidated statements of operations for the year ended december 31, 2014, $2.2 million and $1.2 million of these restructuring costs are recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses and cost of sales, respectively.
general as a result of certain organizational realignments effective january 1, 2014, we evaluated changes to our internal financial reporting to better align our internal reporting to how we will manage our business going forward. this evaluation resulted in changes to our reportable segments effective january 1, 2014 and, as a result, we have restated previously reported segment information. as a result of the changes to our reportable segments, the former north american business segment was separated into two unique reportable segments, which we refer to as (1) north american records and information management business segment and (2) north american data management business segment. in addition, the emerging businesses segment, which was previously reported as a component of the former north american business segment, is now reported as a component of the corporate and other segment.
our revenues consist of storage rental revenues as well as service revenues and are reflected net of sales and value added taxes. storage rental revenues, which are considered a key driver of financial performance for the storage and information management services industry, consist primarily of recurring periodic rental charges related to the storage of materials or data (generally on a per unit basis) that are typically retained by customers for many years. service revenues include charges for related service activities, which include: (1) the handling of records, including the addition of new records, temporary removal of records from storage, refiling of removed records and the destruction of records; (2) courier operations, consisting primarily of the pickup and delivery of records upon customer request; (3) secure shredding of sensitive documents and the related sale of recycled paper, the price of which can fluctuate from period to period; (4) other services, including dms, which relate to physical and digital records, and project revenues; (5) customer termination and permanent withdrawal fees; (6) data restoration projects; (7) special project work; (8) fulfillment services; (9) consulting services; and (10) technology escrow services that protect and manage source code ("intellectual property management") and other technology services and product sales (including specially designed storage containers and related supplies). our service revenue growth has been negatively impacted by declining activity rates as stored records are becoming less active. while customers continue to store their records with us, they are less likely than they have been in the past to retrieve records for research purposes, thereby reducing service activity levels.
cost of sales (excluding depreciation and amortization) consists primarily of wages and benefits for field personnel, facility occupancy costs (including rent and utilities), transportation expenses (including vehicle leases and fuel), other product cost of sales and other equipment costs and supplies. of these, wages and benefits and facility occupancy costs are the most significant. selling, general and administrative expenses consist primarily of wages and benefits for management, administrative, information technology, sales, account management and marketing personnel, as well as expenses related to communications and data processing, travel, professional fees, bad debts, training, office equipment and supplies. trends in facility occupancy costs are impacted by the total number of facilities we occupy, the mix of properties we own versus properties we occupy under operating leases, fluctuations in per square foot occupancy costs, and the levels of utilization of these properties. trends in total wages and benefits in dollars and as a percentage of total consolidated revenue are influenced by changes in headcount and compensation levels, achievement of incentive compensation targets, workforce productivity and variability in costs associated with medical insurance and workers' compensation.
the expansion of our international businesses has impacted the major cost of sales components and selling, general and administrative expenses. our international operations are more labor intensive than our operations in north america and, therefore, labor costs are a higher percentage of segment revenue. in addition, the overhead structure of our expanding international operations has not achieved the same level of overhead leverage as our north american segments, which may result in an increase in selling, general and administrative expenses, as a percentage of consolidated revenue, as our international operations become a more meaningful percentage of our consolidated results.
our depreciation and amortization charges result primarily from the capital-intensive nature of our business. the principal components of depreciation relate to storage systems, which include racking structures, building and leasehold improvements, computer systems hardware and software and buildings. amortization relates primarily to customer relationship acquisition costs and is impacted by the nature and timing of acquisitions.
our consolidated revenues and expenses are subject to variations caused by the net effect of foreign currency translation on revenues and expenses incurred by our entities outside the united states. it is difficult to predict the future fluctuations of foreign currency exchange rates and how those fluctuations will impact our consolidated statements of operations. due to the expansion of our international operations, some of these fluctuations have become material on individual balances. however, because both the revenues and expenses are denominated in the local currency of the country in which they are derived or incurred, the impact of currency fluctuations on our operating income and operating margin is partially mitigated. in order to provide a framework for assessing how our underlying businesses performed excluding the effect of foreign currency fluctuations, we compare the percentage change in the results from one period to another period in this report using constant currency presentation. the constant currency growth rates are calculated by translating the 2012 results at the 2013 average exchange rates and the 2013 results at the 2014 average exchange rates.
the following table is a comparison of underlying average exchange rates of the foreign currencies that had the most significant impact on our united states dollar-reported revenues and expenses:
non-gaap measures adjusted operating income before depreciation, amortization, intangible impairments, (gain) loss on disposal/write-down of property, plant and equipment (excluding real estate), net and reit costs ("adjusted oibda")
adjusted oibda is defined as operating income before depreciation, amortization, intangible impairments, (gain) loss on disposal/write-down of property, plant and equipment (excluding real estate), net and reit costs (as defined below). adjusted oibda margin is calculated by dividing adjusted oibda by total revenues. we use multiples of current or projected adjusted oibda in conjunction with our discounted cash flow models to determine our overall enterprise valuation and to evaluate acquisition targets. we believe adjusted oibda and adjusted oibda margin provide our current and potential investors with relevant and useful information regarding our ability to generate cash flow to support business investment. these measures are an integral part of the internal reporting system we use to assess and evaluate the operating performance of our business. adjusted oibda does not include certain items that we believe are not indicative of our core operating results, specifically: (1) (gain) loss on disposal/write-down of property, plant and equipment (excluding real estate), net; (2) (gain) loss on sale of real estate, net of tax; (3) intangible impairments; (4) reit costs; (5) other expense (income), net; (6) income (loss) from discontinued operations, net of tax; (7) gain (loss) on sale of discontinued operations, net of tax; and (8) net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests.
adjusted oibda also does not include interest expense, net and the provision (benefit) for income taxes. these expenses are associated with our capitalization and tax structures, which we do not consider when evaluating the operating profitability of our core operations. finally, adjusted oibda does not include depreciation and amortization expenses, in order to eliminate the impact of capital investments, which we evaluate by comparing capital expenditures to incremental revenue generated and as a percentage of total revenues. adjusted oibda and adjusted oibda margin should be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for, other measures of financial performance reported in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america ("gaap"), such as operating or net income (loss) or cash flows from operating activities from continuing operations (as determined in accordance with gaap).

adjusted eps is defined as reported earnings per share from continuing operations excluding: (1) (gain) loss on disposal/write-down of property, plant and equipment (excluding real estate), net; (2) (gain) loss on sale of real estate, net of tax; (3) intangible impairments; (4) reit costs; (5) other expense (income), net; and (6) the tax impact of reconciling items and discrete tax items. we do not believe these excluded items to be indicative of our ongoing operating results, and they are not considered when we are forecasting our future results. we believe adjusted eps is of value to our current and potential investors when comparing our results from past, present and future periods.

the adjusted eps for the years ended december 31, 2010, 2011, 2012 and 2013 have been restated to reflect an estimated annual effective tax rate of approximately 15.0%. the adjusted eps for the year ended december 31, 2014 reflects an estimated annual effective tax rate of approximately 14.4%.
critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with gaap. the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and for the period then ended. on an ongoing basis, we evaluate the estimates used. we base our estimates on historical experience, actuarial estimates, current conditions and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. these estimates form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities and are not readily apparent from other sources. actual results may differ from these estimates. our critical accounting policies include the following, which are listed in no particular order:
revenue recognition our revenues consist of storage rental revenues as well as service revenues and are reflected net of sales and value added taxes. storage rental revenues, which are considered a key driver of financial performance for the storage and information management services industry, consist primarily of recurring periodic rental charges related to the storage of materials or data (generally on a per unit
basis). service revenues include charges for related service activities, which include: (1) the handling of records, including the addition of new records, temporary removal of records from storage, refiling of removed records and the destruction of records; (2) courier operations, consisting primarily of the pickup and delivery of records upon customer request; (3) secure shredding of sensitive documents and the related sale of recycled paper, the price of which can fluctuate from period to period; (4) other services, including dms, which relate to physical and digital records, and project revenues; (5) customer termination and permanent withdrawal fees; (6) data restoration projects; (7) special project work; (8) fulfillment services; (9) consulting services; and (10) intellectual property management and other technology services and product sales (including specially designed storage containers and related supplies).
we recognize revenue when the following criteria are met: persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, services have been rendered, the sales price is fixed or determinable and collectability of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured. storage rental and service revenues are recognized in the month the respective storage rental or service is provided, and customers are generally billed on a monthly basis on contractually agreed-upon terms. amounts related to future storage rental or prepaid service contracts for customers where storage rental fees or services are billed in advance are accounted for as deferred revenue and recognized ratably over the period the applicable storage rental or service is provided or performed. revenues from the sales of products, which are included as a component of service revenues, are recognized when products are shipped and title has passed to the customer. revenues from the sales of products have historically not been significant.
accounting for acquisitions part of our growth strategy has included the acquisition by us of numerous businesses. the purchase price of each acquisition has been determined after due diligence of the target business, market research, strategic planning and the forecasting of expected future results and synergies. estimated future results and expected synergies are subject to revisions as we integrate each acquisition and attempt to leverage resources.
each acquisition has been accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting as defined under the applicable accounting standards at the date of each acquisition. accounting for these acquisitions has resulted in the capitalization of the cost in excess of fair value of the net assets acquired in each of these acquisitions as goodwill. we estimated the fair values of the assets acquired in each acquisition as of the date of acquisition and these estimates are subject to adjustment based on the final assessments of the fair value of intangible assets (primarily customer relationship intangible assets), property, plant and equipment (primarily racking structures), operating leases, contingencies and income taxes (primarily deferred income taxes). we complete these assessments within one year of the date of acquisition. see note 6 to notes to consolidated financial statements included in this annual report for a description of recent acquisitions.
determining the fair values of the net assets acquired requires management's judgment and often involves the use of assumptions with respect to future cash inflows and outflows, discount rates and market data, among other items. due to the inherent uncertainty of future events, actual values of net assets acquired could be different from our estimated fair values and could have a material impact on our financial statements.
of the net assets acquired in our acquisitions, the fair value of owned buildings, customer relationship intangible assets, racking structures and operating leases are generally the most common and most significant. for significant acquisitions or acquisitions involving new markets or new products, we generally use third party appraisals of the fair value of owned buildings, customer relationship intangible assets and market rental rates for acquired operating leases. for acquisitions that are not significant or do not involve new markets or new products, we generally use third party appraisals of
fair value for acquired owned buildings and market rental rates for acquired operating leases. when not using third party appraisals of the fair value of acquired net assets, the fair value of acquired customer relationship intangible assets and acquired racking structures is determined internally. the fair value of acquired racking structures is determined internally by taking current replacement cost at the date of acquisition for the quantity of racking structures acquired, discounted to take into account the quality (e.g. age, material and type) of the racking structures. additionally, we use discounted cash flow models to determine the fair value of customer relationship intangible assets, which requires a significant amount of judgment by management, including estimating expected lives of the relationships, expected future cash flows and discount rates.
of the key assumptions that impact the estimated fair values of customer relationship intangible assets, the expected future cash flows and discount rate are among the most sensitive and are considered to be critical assumptions. to illustrate the sensitivity of changes in key assumptions used in determining the fair value of customer relationship intangible assets acquired in our most significant acquisitions in fiscal year 2014 (keepers brasil ltda and securit records management), a hypothetical increase of 10% in the expected annual future cash flows attributable to these two acquisitions, with all other assumptions unchanged, would have increased the calculated fair value of the acquired customer relationship intangible assets in the aggregate for both of these acquisitions combined by $2.6 million, with an offsetting decrease to goodwill. a hypothetical decrease of 100 basis points in the discount rate, with all other assumptions unchanged, would have increased the fair value of the acquired customer relationship intangible assets in the aggregate for both of these acquisitions combined by $1.7 million, with an offsetting decrease to goodwill.
our estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable at that time but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable. assumptions may be incomplete or inaccurate, and unanticipated events and circumstances may occur, which may affect the accuracy of such assumptions.
impairment of tangible and intangible assets assets subject to depreciation or amortization: we review long-lived assets and all amortizable intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable. examples of events or circumstances that may be indicative of impairment include, but are not limited to:
 a significant decrease in the market price of an asset;
 a significant change in the extent or manner in which a long-lived asset is being used or in its physical condition;
 a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate that could affect the value of the asset;
 an accumulation of costs significantly greater than the amount originally expected for the acquisition or construction of an asset;
 a current expectation that, more likely than not, an asset will be sold or otherwise disposed of significantly before the end of its previously estimated useful life.
recoverability of these assets is determined by comparing the forecasted undiscounted net cash flows of the operation to which the assets relate to their carrying amount. the operations are generally distinguished by the business segment and geographic region in which they operate. if the operation is determined to be unable to recover the carrying amount of its assets, the long-lived assets are written down, on a pro rata basis, to fair value. fair value is determined based on discounted cash flows or appraised values, depending upon the nature of the assets.
goodwill and intangible assets not subject to amortization: goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized but are reviewed annually for impairment or more frequently if impairment indicators arise. other than goodwill, we currently have no intangible assets that have indefinite lives and which are not amortized.
we have selected october 1 as our annual goodwill impairment review date. we performed our annual goodwill impairment review as of october 1, 2012, 2013 and 2014 and concluded that goodwill was not impaired as of those dates. based on our goodwill impairment assessment, all of our reporting units with goodwill had estimated fair values as of october 1, 2014 that exceeded their carrying values by greater than 15%. as of december 31, 2014, no factors were identified that would alter our october 1, 2014 goodwill assessment. in making this assessment, we relied on a number of factors including operating results, business plans, anticipated future cash flows, transactions and marketplace data. there are inherent uncertainties related to these factors and our judgment in applying them to the analysis of goodwill impairment. when changes occur in the composition of one or more reporting units, the goodwill is reassigned to the reporting units affected based on their relative fair values.
our reporting units at which level we performed our goodwill impairment analysis as of october 1, 2013 were as follows: (1) north america; (2) united kingdom, ireland, norway, belgium, france, germany, luxembourg, netherlands and spain ("western europe"); (3) the remaining countries in europe in which we operate, excluding russia and ukraine ("emerging markets"); (4) latin america; (5) australia, china, hong kong and singapore ("asia pacific"); and (6) india, russia and ukraine ("emerging market joint ventures"). the carrying value of goodwill, net for each of these reporting units as of december 31, 2013 is as follows (in thousands):
emerging markets                             88,599
emerging market joint ventures               
beginning january 1, 2014, as a result of the changes in our reportable segments associated with our reorganization (see note 9 to notes to consolidated financial statements included in this annual report for a description of our reportable operating segments), we now have 12 reporting units. our north american records and information management business segment includes the following three reporting units: (1) north american records and information management; (2) intellectual property management; and (3) fulfillment services. the north american data management business segment is a separate reporting unit. the emerging businesses reporting unit (which primarily relates to our data center business in the united states and which is a component of corporate and other) is also a reporting unit. additionally, the international business segment consists of the following seven reporting units: (1) united kingdom, ireland, norway, austria, belgium, france, germany, luxembourg, netherlands, spain and switzerland ("new western europe"); (2) the remaining countries in europe in which we operate, excluding russia, ukraine and denmark ("new emerging markets"); (3) latin america; (4) australia and singapore; (5) china and hong kong ("greater china"); (6) india; and (7) russia, ukraine and denmark. we have reassigned goodwill associated with the reporting units impacted by the reorganization among the new reporting units on a relative fair value basis. the fair value of each of our new reporting units was determined based on the application of a combined weighted average approach of fair value multiples of revenue and earnings and discounted cash flow techniques.
as a result of the change in the composition of our reporting units noted above, we concluded that we had an interim triggering event, and, therefore, we performed an interim goodwill impairment test as of january 1, 2014 on the basis of these new reporting units during the first quarter of 2014. we concluded that the goodwill for each of our new reporting units was not impaired as of such date. the carrying value of goodwill, net for each of these reporting units as of december 31, 2014 is as follows (in thousands):
north american records and information management       $1,397,484

reporting unit valuations have been determined using a combined approach based on the present value of future cash flows and market multiples of revenues and earnings. the income approach incorporates many assumptions including future growth rates, discount factors, expected capital expenditures and income tax cash flows. changes in economic and operating conditions impacting these assumptions could result in goodwill impairments in future periods. in conjunction with our annual goodwill impairment reviews, we reconcile the sum of the valuations of all of our reporting units to our market capitalization as of such dates.
although we believe we have sufficient historical and projected information available to us to test for impairment, it is possible that actual results could differ from the estimates used in our impairment tests. of the key assumptions that impact the goodwill impairment test, the expected future cash flows and discount rate are among the most sensitive and are considered to be critical assumptions, as changes to these estimates could have an effect on the estimated fair value of each of our reporting units. as a measure of sensitivity, we have grouped each of our reporting units according to the amount by which each reporting unit's fair value exceeded its carrying value in the goodwill impairment test. a hypothetical decrease of 10% in the expected annual future cash flows, with all other assumptions unchanged, would have decreased the fair value of our reporting units as of october 1, 2014 by a range of approximately 9.1% to 10.4% but would not, however, have resulted in the carrying value of any of our reporting units with goodwill exceeding their fair value. a hypothetical increase of 100 basis points in the discount rate, with all other assumptions unchanged, would have decreased the fair value of our reporting units as of october 1, 2014 by a range of approximately 3.9% to 11.6% but would not, however, have resulted in the carrying value of any of our reporting units with goodwill exceeding their fair value.
income taxes as a reit, we are generally permitted to deduct from our federal taxable income the dividends we pay to our stockholders. the income represented by such dividends is not subject to federal taxation at the entity level but is taxed, if at all, at the stockholder level. the income of our domestic trss,
which hold our domestic operations that may not be reit-compliant as currently operated and structured, is subject, as applicable, to federal and state corporate income tax. in addition, we and our subsidiaries continue to be subject to foreign income taxes in jurisdictions in which they hold assets or conduct operations, regardless of whether held or conducted through subsidiaries disregarded for federal tax purposes or trss. we will also be subject to a separate corporate income tax on any gains recognized during a specified period (generally ten years) following the reit conversion that are attributable to "built-in" gains with respect to the assets that we owned on january 1, 2014; this built-in gains tax will also be imposed on our depreciation recapture recognized into income in 2014 and subsequent taxable years as a result of accounting method changes commenced in our pre-reit period. if we fail to remain qualified for taxation as a reit, we will be subject to federal income tax at regular corporate tax rates. even if we remain qualified for taxation as a reit, we may be subject to some federal, state, local and foreign taxes on our income and property in addition to taxes owed with respect to our trs operations. in particular, while state income tax regimes often parallel the federal income tax regime for reits, many states do not completely follow federal rules and some do not follow them at all.
accounting for income taxes requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the tax and financial reporting bases of assets and liabilities and for loss and credit carryforwards. valuation allowances are provided when recovery of deferred tax assets does not meet the more likely than not standards as defined in gaap.
we have federal net operating loss carryforwards, which expire in 2021 through 2033, of $88.1 million ($0, tax effected) at december 31, 2014 to reduce future federal taxable income, on which no federal tax benefit is expected to be realized. we have state net operating loss carryforwards, which expire in 2015 through 2033, of $74.4 million ($0.1 million, tax effected) at december 31, 2014 to reduce future state taxable income, on which an insignificant state tax benefit is expected to be realized. we have assets for foreign net operating losses of $64.6 million, with various expiration dates (and in some cases no expiration date), subject to a valuation allowance of approximately 62%. if actual results differ unfavorably from certain of our estimates used, we may not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred income tax assets, and additional valuation allowances may be required. although we believe our estimates are reasonable, no assurance can be given that our estimates reflected in the tax provisions and accruals will equal our actual results. these differences could have a material impact on our income tax provision and operating results in the period in which such determination is made.
the evaluation of an uncertain tax position is a two-step process. the first step is a recognition process whereby we determine whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon examination, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes, based on the technical merits of the position. the second step is a measurement process whereby a tax position that meets the more likely than not recognition threshold is calculated to determine the amount of benefit to recognize in the financial statements. the tax position is measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement.
we are subject to income taxes in the united states and numerous foreign jurisdictions. we are subject to examination by various tax authorities in jurisdictions in which we have business operations or a taxable presence. we regularly assess the likelihood of additional assessments by tax authorities and provide for these matters as appropriate. as of december 31, 2013 and 2014, we had approximately $51.1 million and $56.0 million, respectively, of reserves related to uncertain tax positions. the reversal of these reserves will be recorded as a reduction of our income tax provision if sustained. although we believe our tax estimates are appropriate, the final determination of tax audits and any related litigation could result in changes in our estimates.
we had not previously provided incremental federal and certain state income taxes on net tax over book outside basis differences related to the earnings of our foreign subsidiaries because our intent, prior to our conversion to a reit, was to reinvest our current and future undistributed earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries indefinitely outside the united states. as a result of our conversion to a reit, it is no longer our intent to indefinitely reinvest our current and future undistributed foreign earnings outside the united states, and, therefore, during 2014, we recognized an increase in our tax provision from continuing operations in the amount of $46.4 million, representing incremental federal and state income taxes and foreign withholding taxes on such foreign earnings. as a reit, future repatriation of incremental undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries will not be subject to federal or state income tax, with the exception of foreign withholding taxes in limited instances; however, such future repatriations will require distribution in accordance with reit distribution rules, and any such distribution may then be taxable, as appropriate, at the stockholder level.
recent accounting pronouncements in april 2014, the financial accounting standards board ("fasb") issued accounting standards update ("asu") no. 2014-08,  presentation of financial statements (topic 205) and property, plant, and equipment (topic 360) ("asu 2014-08"). asu 2014-08 changes the criteria for a disposal to qualify as a discontinued operation and requires additional disclosures of both discontinued operations and certain other disposals that do not meet the definition of a discontinued operation. asu 2014-08 is effective for annual periods beginning on or after december 15, 2014. under this guidance, we expect fewer dispositions to qualify as discontinued operations. early adoption is permitted, but only for disposals that have not been reported in the financial statements previously issued. we adopted asu 2014-08 effective april 1, 2014.
in may 2014, the fasb issued asu no. 2014-09, revenue from contracts with customers (topic 606) ("asu 2014-09"). asu 2014-09 provides additional guidance for management to reassess revenue recognition as it relates to: (1) transfer of control, (2) variable consideration, (3) allocation of transaction price based on relative standalone selling price, (3) licenses, (4) time value of money and (5) contract costs. further disclosures will be required to provide a better understanding of revenue that has been recognized and revenue that is expected to be recognized in the future from existing contracts. asu 2014-09 is effective for us on january 1, 2017, with no early adoption permitted. we are currently evaluating the impact asu 2014-09 will have on our consolidated financial statements.
in august 2014, the fasb issued asu no. 2014-15, presentation of financial statements going concern (subtopic 205-40) ("asu 2014-15"). asu 2014-15 requires management to assess an entity's ability to continue as a going concern by incorporating and expanding upon certain principles of current united states auditing standards. specifically, the amendments (1) provide a definition of the term "substantial doubt", (2) require an evaluation every reporting period, including interim periods, (3) provide principles for considering the mitigating effect of management's plans, (4) require certain disclosures when substantial doubt is alleviated as a result of consideration of management's plans, (5) require an express statement and other disclosures when substantial doubt is still present, and (6) require an assessment for a period of one year after the date that the financial statements are issued (or available to be issued). asu 2014-15 is effective for us on january 1, 2017, with early adoption permitted. we do not believe that this pronouncement will have an impact on our consolidated financial statements.
in february 2015, the fasb issued asu no. 2015-02, consolidation (topic 810): amendments to the consolidation analysis ("asu 2015-02"). asu 2015-02 affects reporting entities that are required to evaluate whether they should consolidate certain legal entities. asu 2015-02 is effective for us on january 1, 2016, with early adoption permitted. we do not believe that this pronouncement will have an impact on our consolidated financial statements.

constant currency growth rates are calculated by translating the 2013 results at the 2014 average exchange rates and the 2012 results at the 2013 average exchange rates.
our internal revenue growth rate represents the weighted average year-over-year growth rate of our revenues after removing the effects of acquisitions, divestitures and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. we calculate internal revenue growth in local currency for our international operations.
consolidated storage rental revenues increased $75.5 million, or 4.2%, to $1,860.2 million for the year ended december 31, 2014 and $51.6 million, or 3.0%, to $1,784.7 million for the year ended december 31, 2013, in comparison to the years ended december 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively. the growth rate for the year ended december 31, 2014 consists primarily of internal revenue growth of 2.2%. net acquisitions/divestitures contributed 3.2% of the increase in reported storage rental revenues in 2014 over 2013. foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations decreased our reported storage rental revenue growth rate for the year ended december 31, 2014 by approximately 1.2%. our consolidated storage rental revenue growth in 2014 was driven by sustained storage rental internal growth of 0.3%, 2.3% and 6.3% in our north american records and information management business, north american data management business and international business segments, respectively. global records management net volumes in 2014 increased by 3.6% over the ending volume at december 31, 2013, supported by 12.3% volume increases in our international business segment, which was driven by growth from both emerging and developed markets as well as recent acquisitions. the growth rate for the year ended december 31, 2013 consists primarily of internal revenue growth of 2.1%. net acquisitions/divestitures contributed 1.5% of the increase in reported storage rental revenues in 2013 over 2012. foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations decreased our reported storage rental revenue growth rate for the year ended december 31, 2013 by approximately 0.6%. our consolidated storage rental revenue growth in 2013 was driven by sustained storage rental internal growth of 0.4%, 1.5% and 6.2% in our north american records and information management business, north american data management business and international business segments, respectively.
consolidated service revenues increased $17.5 million, or 1.4%, to $1,257.5 million for the year ended december 31, 2014 from $1,239.9 million for the year ended december 31, 2013. service revenue internal growth was negative 0.7% for the year ended december 31, 2014. the negative service revenue internal growth for 2014 reflects a trend toward reduced retrieval/re-file activity and a related decrease in transportation revenues within our north american records and information management business segment, as well as continued declines in service revenue activity levels in our north american
data management business segment as the storage business becomes more archival in nature. foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations decreased our reported total service revenues by 1.4% in 2014 over 2013. net acquisitions/divestitures contributed 3.5% of the increase of reported service revenues in 2014. consolidated service revenues decreased $30.9 million, or 2.4%, to $1,239.9 million for the year ended december 31, 2013 from $1,270.8 million for the year ended december 31, 2012. service revenue internal growth was negative 3.4% for the year ended december 31, 2013. the negative service revenue internal growth for 2013 reflects a trend toward reduced retrieval/re-file activity and a related decrease in transportation revenues within our north american records and information management business segment, as well as continued declines in service revenue activity levels in our north american data management business segment as the storage business becomes more archival in nature. foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations decreased reported service revenues by 0.8% in 2013 over 2012. net acquisitions/divestitures partially offset the decrease in reported consolidated service revenues and contributed an increase of 1.8% of reported service revenues in 2013.
for the reasons stated above, our consolidated revenues increased $93.1 million, or 3.1%, to $3,117.7 million for the year ended december 31, 2014 from $3,024.6 million for the year ended december 31, 2013. internal revenue growth was 1.0% for 2014. for the year ended december 31, 2014, foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations decreased our reported consolidated revenues by 1.2% primarily due to the weakening of the australian dollar, brazilian real and canadian dollar against the united states dollar, partially offset by a strengthening of the british pound sterling and the euro against the united states dollar, based on an analysis of weighted average rates for the comparable periods. net acquisitions/divestitures contributed an increase of 3.3% of total reported revenues in 2014 over the same period in 2013. our consolidated revenues increased $20.7 million, or 0.7%, to $3,024.6 million for the year ended december 31, 2013 from $3,004.0 million for the year ended december 31, 2012. internal revenue growth was negative 0.2% for 2013. for the year ended december 31, 2013, foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations decreased our consolidated revenues by 0.7% primarily due to the weakening of the australian dollar, brazilian real, british pound sterling and canadian dollar, offset by an increase of the euro against the united states dollar, based on an analysis of weighted average rates for the comparable periods. net acquisitions/divestitures partially offset the decrease in reported consolidated revenues and contributed an increase of 1.6% of total reported revenues in 2013 over the same period in 2012.

we expect our consolidated internal revenue growth rate for 2015 to be approximately 0% to 2%. during the past eight quarters our storage rental revenue internal growth rate has ranged between 1.3% and 3.5%. storage rental revenue internal growth rates have been relatively stable over the past eight quarters, averaging between 2.1% and 2.2% for full-year 2013 and 2014. at various points in the economic cycle, storage rental internal growth may be influenced by changes in pricing and volume. recently, we initiated sales force programs focused on increasing volume through new sales and improved customer retention. in addition, we are working on enhancing our pricing strategy through implementing a statistically based approach, which enables customized pricing based on customer profiles and needs. within our international business segment, the developed markets are generating consistent low-to-mid single-digit storage rental revenue growth, and the emerging markets are producing strong double-digit storage rental revenue growth by capturing the first-time outsourcing
trends for physical records storage and management in those markets. the internal revenue growth rate for service revenue is inherently more volatile than the storage rental revenue internal growth rate due to the more discretionary nature of certain services we offer, such as large special projects, and, as a commodity, the volatility of pricing for recycled paper. these revenues, which are often event-driven and impacted to a greater extent by economic downturns as customers defer or cancel the purchase of certain services as a way to reduce their short-term costs, may be difficult to replicate in future periods. the internal growth rate for total service revenues reflects the following: (1) consistent pressures on activity-based service revenues related to the handling and transportation of items in storage in the north american records and information management business and the north american data management business segments and secure shredding revenues; and (2) softness in some of our other service lines, such as fulfillment services.
operating expenses cost of sales consolidated cost of sales (excluding depreciation and amortization) consists of the following expenses (in thousands):
product cost of sales and other           113,621           111,543         (2,078   )       (1.8   )%        0.0   %        3.8   %       3.6   %       (0.2   )%

labor labor expense increased to 21.6% of consolidated revenues for the year ended december 31, 2014 compared to 21.1% for the year ended december 31, 2013. labor expense for the year ended december 31, 2014 increased by 7.7% on a constant dollar basis compared to the year ended december 31, 2013 primarily due to incremental labor costs associated with acquisitions completed during fiscal year 2014 and the fourth quarter of 2013, as well as merit increases, partially offset by a $2.2 million decrease in restructuring costs. labor costs were favorably impacted by 2.0 percentage points due to currency rate changes during the year ended december 31, 2014.
labor expense increased to 21.1% of consolidated revenues for the year ended december 31, 2013 compared to 20.8% for the year ended december 31, 2012. labor expense for the year ended december 31, 2013 increased by 3.1% on a constant dollar basis compared to the year ended december 31, 2012 primarily due to $10.7 million of incremental labor costs associated with fiscal year 2013 acquisitions, as well as $3.4 million of restructuring costs that were incurred in 2013. labor costs were favorably impacted by 1.1 percentage points due to currency rate changes during the year ended december 31, 2013.
facilities facilities costs increased to 14.1% of consolidated revenues for the year ended december 31, 2014, compared to 13.7% for the year ended december 31, 2013. rent expense, which, on a constant dollar basis, increased by $10.9 million for the year ended december 31, 2014 compared to the year ended december 31, 2013, primarily due to the impact of acquisitions completed during fiscal year 2014 and the fourth quarter of 2013. other facilities costs increased by $19.9 million on a constant dollar basis for the year ended december 31, 2014 compared to the year ended december 31, 2013, primarily due to higher utilities of $4.0 million and building maintenance costs of $6.5 million, as well as higher insurance costs of $3.5 million associated with a fire at one of our facilities in buenos aires, argentina on february 5, 2014 (described at note 10.g. to notes to consolidated financial statements included in this annual report). facilities costs were favorably impacted by 1.0 percentage points due to currency rate changes during the year ended december 31, 2014.
facilities costs decreased to 13.7% of consolidated revenues for the year ended december 31, 2013, compared to 14.0% for the year ended december 31, 2012. the largest component of our facilities cost is rent expense, which, on a constant dollar basis, decreased by $6.0 million for the year ended december 31, 2013 compared to the year ended december 31, 2012 as a result of our ongoing facility consolidation efforts. this decrease was partially offset by $4.8 million of costs associated with 2013 acquisitions. facilities costs were favorably impacted by 0.9 percentage points due to currency rate changes during the year ended december 31, 2013.
transportation transportation expenses decreased by $3.2 million on a constant dollar basis during the year ended december 31, 2014 compared to the year ended december 31, 2013 primarily as a result of decreased fuel and maintenance costs of $1.3 million and $0.9 million, respectively. transportation expenses were favorably impacted by 1.6 percentage points due to currency rate changes during the year ended december 31, 2014.
transportation expenses decreased by $1.4 million on a constant dollar basis during the year ended december 31, 2013 compared to the year ended december 31, 2012 as a result of a decrease in vehicle lease expense, primarily associated with our united kingdom operations, due to the capitalization of leased vehicles upon renewal. although the aggregate lease cost has not changed, the categorization of charges did change, resulting in the cost being allocated to depreciation and interest. transportation expenses were favorably impacted by 1.2 percentage points due to currency rate changes during the year ended december 31, 2013.
product cost of sales and other product cost of sales and other, which includes cartons, media and other service, storage and supply costs, is highly correlated to service revenue streams, particularly project revenues. for the year ended december 31, 2014, product cost of sales and other decreased by $2.1 million compared to the year ended december 31, 2013 on an actual basis, primarily due to a reduction in costs associated with
special projects. these costs were favorably impacted by 1.8 percentage points due to currency rate changes during the year ended december 31, 2014.
for the year ended december 31, 2013, product cost of sales and other increased by $9.6 million compared to the year ended december 31, 2012 on an actual basis, primarily as a result of higher move costs associated with facility consolidations, as well as $1.5 million of incremental costs incurred associated with 2013 acquisitions. these costs were favorably impacted by 1.0 percentage points due to currency rate changes during the year ended december 31, 2013.

amortization expense increased $9.4 million and $3.4 million for the years ended december 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively, compared to the years ended december 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively, primarily due to the increased amortization of customer relationship intangible assets acquired through business combinations.

net foreign currency transaction losses of $58.3 million, based on period-end exchange rates, were recorded in the year ended december 31, 2014. losses resulted primarily from changes in the exchange rate of each of the argentine peso, brazilian real, british pound sterling, euro, russian ruble and ukrainian hryvnia against the united states dollar compared to december 31, 2013, as these currencies relate to our intercompany balances with and between our latin american and european subsidiaries, as well as euro forward contracts. these losses were partially offset by gains primarily from british pound sterling borrowings on our revolving credit facility, australian dollar and british pound sterling forward contracts, and euro denominated bonds issued by imi.
net foreign currency transaction losses of $36.2 million, based on period-end exchange rates, were recorded in the year ended december 31, 2013. losses resulted primarily from changes in the exchange rate of each of the australian dollar, brazilian real, russian ruble and euro against the united states dollar compared to december 31, 2012, as these currencies relate to our intercompany balances with and between our european, australian and brazilian subsidiaries as well as british pound sterling debt and forward currency contracts, which were partially offset by gains as a result of an australian forward currency contract, as well as changes in the exchange rate of the british pound sterling against the united states dollar compared to december 31, 2012 as it relates to our intercompany balances with and between our united kingdom subsidiaries.
net foreign currency transaction losses of $10.2 million, based on period-end exchange rates, were recorded in the year ended december 31, 2012. losses were primarily a result of changes in the exchange rate of the brazilian real, as this currency relates to our intercompany balances with and between our brazilian subsidiaries, as well as additional losses associated with our british pound sterling and euro denominated debt and forward foreign currency swap contracts denominated in british pounds sterling and australian dollars. these losses were partially offset by gains resulting primarily from the change in the exchange rate of the british pound sterling, euro and australian dollar against the united states dollar compared to december 31, 2011, as it relates to our intercompany balances with and between our european and australian subsidiaries.
in december 2014, we recorded a debt extinguishment charge of $16.5 million related to the early redemption of $306.0 million in aggregate principal of the 83/8% notes at 104.188% of par. this charge consists of call premiums, original issue discounts and deferred financing costs related to the 83/8% notes. during the year ended december 31, 2013, we recorded a charge of $43.7 million related to the amendment of our former credit agreement in the third quarter of 2013, representing a write-off of deferred financing costs, and the early extinguishment of the 71/2% notes, the 8% notes, the 8% notes due 2020 and a portion of the 83/8% notes. this charge consists of call premiums, original issue discounts and deferred financing costs related to this debt. during the year ended december 31, 2012, we recorded a charge of approximately $10.6 million related to the early extinguishment of $320.0 million of the 65/8% notes and $200.0 million of the 83/4% notes in the third quarter of 2012. this charge consists of the call premium associated with the 83/4% notes and original issue discounts and deferred financing costs related to the 65/8% notes and 83/4% notes.
other, net in the year ended december 31, 2014 included income of $9.6 million. in december 2014, we divested our secure shredding operations in australia, ireland and the united kingdom in a stock transaction and recorded a pretax gain of approximately $6.9 million (see note 16 to notes to consolidated financial statements included in this annual report). also included in other, net in the year ended december 31, 2014 was approximately $0.9 million of royalty income and $1.1 million of gains associated with a deferred compensation plan we sponsor. other, net in the year ended december 31, 2013 consists primarily of $3.7 million of royalty income. other, net in the year ended december 31, 2012 consists primarily of $2.7 million of royalty income, $1.5 million of gains associated with our acquisition of equity interests that we previously held associated with our turkish and swiss joint ventures and $1.3 million of gains associated with a deferred compensation plan we sponsor.
provision for income taxes our effective tax rates for the years ended december 31, 2012, 2013 and 2014 were 38.5%, 38.9% and (43.5)%, respectively. the primary reconciling items between the federal statutory rate of 35% and our overall effective tax rate for the year ended december 31, 2012 were differences in the rates of tax at which our foreign earnings are subject, including foreign exchange gains and losses in different jurisdictions with different tax rates and state income taxes (net of federal tax benefit). during the year ended december 31, 2012, foreign currency gains were recorded in lower tax jurisdictions associated with our marking-to-market of intercompany loan positions while foreign currency losses were recorded in higher tax jurisdictions associated with our marking-to-market of debt and derivative instruments, which lowered our 2012 effective tax rate by 2.2%. the primary reconciling items between the federal statutory rate of 35% and our overall effective tax rate for the year ended december 31, 2013 were the impact from the repatriation discussed below, which increased our 2013 effective tax rate by 13.1%, and state income taxes (net of federal tax benefit). these expenses were partially offset by a favorable impact provided by the recognition of certain previously unrecognized tax benefits due to expirations of statute of limitation periods and settlements with tax authorities in various jurisdictions and differences in the rates of tax at which our foreign earnings are subject, including foreign exchange gains and losses in different jurisdictions with different tax rates.
during 2013, we completed a plan to utilize both current and carryforward foreign tax credits by repatriating approximately $252.7 million (approximately $65.2 million of which was previously subject to united states taxes) from our foreign earnings. due to uncertainty in our ability to fully utilize foreign tax credit carryforwards, we previously did not recognize a full benefit for such foreign tax credit carryforwards in our tax provision. as a result, we recorded an increase in our tax provision from continuing operations in the amount of $63.5 million in 2013. this increase was offset by decreases of $18.8 million from current year foreign tax credits and $23.3 million reversal of valuation allowances related to foreign tax credit carryforwards, resulting in a net increase of $21.5 million in our tax provision from continuing operations.
as a result of our reit conversion, we recorded a net tax benefit of $212.2 million during the year ended december 31, 2014 for the revaluation of certain deferred tax assets and liabilities associated with the reit conversion. in 2014, we recorded an increase to the tax provision of $29.3 million associated with tax accounting method changes consistent with our reit conversion, primarily affected through the filing of amended tax returns. the primary other reconciling items between the federal statutory rate of 35% and our overall effective tax rate during the year ended december 31, 2014 was an increase of $46.4 million in our tax provision from the repatriation discussed below and other net tax adjustments related to the reit conversion, including a tax benefit of $63.3 million primarily related to the dividends paid deduction. as a reit, we are entitled to a deduction for dividends paid, resulting in a substantial reduction of federal income tax expense. as a reit, substantially all of our income tax expense will be incurred based on the earnings generated by our foreign subsidiaries and our domestic trss.
we had not previously provided incremental federal and certain state income taxes on net tax over book outside basis differences related to the earnings of our foreign subsidiaries because our intent, prior to our conversion to a reit, was to reinvest our current and future undistributed earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries indefinitely outside the united states. as a result of our conversion to a reit, it is no longer our intent to indefinitely reinvest our current and future undistributed foreign earnings outside the united states, and, therefore, during 2014, we recognized an increase in our tax provision from continuing operations in the amount of $46.4 million, representing incremental federal and state income taxes and foreign withholding taxes on such foreign earnings. as a reit, future repatriation of incremental undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries will not be subject to federal or state income tax, with the exception of foreign withholding taxes in limited instances;
however, such future repatriations will require distribution in accordance with reit distribution rules, and any such distribution may then be taxable, as appropriate, at the stockholder level.
our effective tax rate is subject to variability in the future due to, among other items: (1) changes in the mix of income between our qualified reit subsidiaries and our trss; (2) tax law changes; (3) volatility in foreign exchange gains (losses); (4) the timing of the establishment and reversal of tax reserves; and (5) our ability to utilize foreign tax credits and net operating losses that we generate. we are subject to income taxes in the united states and numerous foreign jurisdictions. we are subject to examination by various tax authorities in jurisdictions in which we have business operations or a taxable presence. we regularly assess the likelihood of additional assessments by tax authorities and provide for these matters as appropriate. although we believe our tax estimates are appropriate, the final determination of tax audits and any related litigation could result in changes in our estimates.
gain on sale of real estate, net of tax consolidated gain on sale of real estate for the year ended december 31, 2014 was $8.3 million, net of tax of $2.2 million associated with the sale of two buildings in the united kingdom and a building in canada. consolidated gain on sale of real estate for the year ended december 31, 2013 was $1.4 million, net of tax of $0.4 million associated with the sale of a building in the united kingdom. consolidated gain on sale of real estate for the year ended december 31, 2012 was $0.2 million, net of tax of $0.1 million associated with the sale of a building in the united kingdom.
income from continuing operations as a result of the foregoing factors, consolidated income from continuing operations for the year ended december 31, 2014 increased $229.8 million, or 231.7%, to $329.0 million (10.6% of consolidated revenues) from income from continuing operations of $99.2 million (3.3% of consolidated revenues) for the year ended december 31, 2013. the increase in income from continuing operations is primarily due to a $159.4 million decrease in our provision for income taxes as a result of our reit conversion and a $60.6 million decrease in reit costs in 2014 compared to 2013.
as a result of the foregoing factors, consolidated income from continuing operations for the year ended december 31, 2013 decreased $83.5 million, or 45.7%, to $99.2 million (3.3% of consolidated revenues) from income from continuing operations of $182.7 million (6.1% of consolidated revenues) for the year ended december 31, 2012. the decrease in income from continuing operations is primarily due to a $48.4 million increase in reit costs year over year, restructuring costs of $23.4 million and a $59.1 million increase in other expenses primarily associated with debt extinguishment costs and foreign exchange losses, partially offset by a lower income tax provision in 2013 compared to 2012.
income (loss) from discontinued operations and gain (loss) on sale of discontinued operations, net of tax loss from discontinued operations, net of tax was $0.2 million for the year ended december 31, 2014, primarily related to legal reserves, offset by the recovery of insurance proceeds in excess of carrying value. income from discontinued operations, net of tax was $0.8 million for the year ended december 31, 2013, which primarily represents the recovery of insurance proceeds in excess of carrying value. loss from discontinued operations, net of tax was $6.8 million for the year ended december 31, 2012, primarily due to losses related to our italian operations which we sold on april 27, 2012.
we recorded a loss on sale of discontinued operations in the amount of $1.9 million ($1.9 million, net of tax) during the year ended december 31, 2012 as a result of the sale of our italian operations.
noncontrolling interests net income attributable to noncontrolling interests resulted in a decrease in net income attributable to iron mountain incorporated of $2.6 million, $3.5 million and $3.1 million for the years ended december 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. these amounts represent our noncontrolling partners' share of earnings/losses in our majority-owned international subsidiaries that are consolidated in our operating results.
as a result of certain organizational realignments effective january 1, 2014, we evaluated changes to our internal financial reporting to better align our internal reporting to how we will manage our business going forward. this evaluation resulted in changes to our reportable segments effective january 1, 2014. as a result of the changes to our reportable segments, the former north american business segment was separated into two unique reportable segments, which we refer to as (1) north american records and information management business segment and (2) north american data management business segment. in addition, the emerging businesses segment, which was previously reported as a component of the former north american business segment, is now reported as a component of the corporate and other segment. as a result, we have restated previously reported segment information.
our reportable operating segments are north american records and information management business, north american data management business, international business and corporate and other. see note 9 to notes to consolidated financial statements included in this annual report. our north american records and information management business segment offers storage and information management services throughout the united states and canada, including records management; destruction; dms; fulfillment services; and intellectual property management. our north american data management business segment offers storage and rotation of backup computer media as part of corporate disaster recovery plans throughout the united states and canada, including data protection & recovery, server and computer backup services, digital content repository systems to house, distribute, and archive key media assets, and storage, safeguarding and electronic or physical delivery of physical media of all types, primarily for entertainment and media industry clients. our international business segment offers storage and information management services throughout europe, latin america and asia pacific, including records management, data protection & recovery and dms. our european operations provide records management, data protection & recovery and dms throughout europe. our latin america operations provide records management, data protection & recovery and dms throughout argentina, brazil, chile, colombia, mexico and peru. our asia pacific operations provide records management, data protection & recovery and dms throughout australia, with records management and data protection & recovery also provided in certain cities in india, singapore, hong kong-sar and china. prior to december 2014, our international business segment offered destruction in the united kingdom, ireland and australia. see note 16 to notes to consolidated financial statements included in this annual report for further disclosure related to the divestiture of these secure shredding operations in december 2014. corporate and other consists of our data center business in the united states, the primary product offering of our emerging businesses segment, as well as costs related to executive and staff functions, including finance, human resources and information technology, which benefit the enterprise as a whole. these costs are primarily related to the general management of these functions on a corporate level and the design and development of programs, policies and procedures that are then implemented in the individual segments, with each segment bearing its own cost of implementation. our corporate and other segment also includes stock-based employee compensation expense associated with all stock options, restricted stock, restricted stock units, performance units and shares of stock issued under our employee stock purchase plan.

during the year ended december 31, 2014, reported revenue in our north american records and information management business segment increased 1.5% compared to the year ended december 31, 2013. this increase is primarily attributable to the impact of acquisitions of 2.3% in the year ended december 31, 2014 compared to the year ended december 31, 2013. flat total internal growth was primarily the result of negative service internal growth of 0.5%, resulting from a trend toward reduced retrieval/re-file activity and a related decrease in transportation revenues, partially offset by storage rental revenue internal growth of 0.3% in the year ended december 31, 2014, primarily related to net price increases. for the year ended december 31, 2014, foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations decreased our reported revenues for the north american records and information management business segment by 0.8% compared to the year ended december 31, 2013 due to the weakening of the canadian dollar against the united states dollar. adjusted oibda as a percentage of segment revenue increased 200 basis points in the year ended december 31, 2014 compared to 2013, primarily due to decreases in restructuring charges and compensation expense as a result of the organizational restructuring initiated in the fourth quarter of 2013.
during the year ended december 31, 2013, reported revenue in our north american records and information management business segment decreased 0.6% compared to the year ended december 31, 2012, primarily due to negative internal growth of 1.4%. for the year ended december 31, 2013, the negative internal growth was primarily driven by negative consolidated service internal growth of 3.9%, which was the result of a trend toward reduced retrieval/re-file activity and a related decrease in transportation revenues, partially offset by storage rental revenue internal growth of 0.4% in the year
ended december 31, 2013 primarily related to net price increases. adjusted oibda as a percentage of segment revenue declined 90 basis points in the year ended december 31, 2013 compared to the year ended december 31, 2012, primarily due to restructuring charges, partially offset by a decrease in compensation expense as a result of restructuring in sales, marketing and account management during the fourth quarter of 2012.

during the year ended december 31, 2014, reported revenue in our north american data management business segment decreased 1.6% compared to the year ended december 31, 2013, primarily due to negative internal growth of 1.5%. the negative internal growth was primarily attributable to negative service internal growth of 7.5%, which was due to declines in service revenue activity levels as the storage business becomes more archival in nature, partially offset by storage rental revenue internal growth of 2.3% in the year ended december 31, 2014, primarily related to net price increases. for the year ended december 31, 2014, foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations decreased our reported revenues for the north american data management business segment by 0.5% compared to the year ended december 31, 2013 due to the weakening of the canadian dollar against the united states dollar. adjusted oibda as a percentage of segment revenue declined 180 basis points in the year ended december 31, 2014 compared to the year ended december 31, 2013, primarily due to the aforementioned negative internal growth, as well as costs not decreasing in proportion to the decline in revenue.
during the year ended december 31, 2013, reported revenue in our north american data management business segment decreased 1.9% compared to the year ended december 31, 2012, primarily due to negative internal growth of 2.0%. for the year ended december 31, 2013, the negative internal growth was primarily attributable to negative consolidated service internal growth of 7.0%, which was due to declines in service revenue activity levels as the storage business becomes more archival in nature, partially offset by storage rental revenue internal growth of 1.5% in the year ended december 31, 2013 primarily related to net price increases. adjusted oibda as a percentage of segment revenue declined 90 basis points in the year ended december 31, 2013 compared to the year ended december 31, 2012, primarily due to restructuring charges, partially offset by a decrease in compensation expense as a result of restructuring in sales, marketing and account management in the fourth quarter of 2012.

reported revenues in our international business segment increased 8.6% during the year ended december 31, 2014 compared to the year ended december 31, 2013. internal growth for the year ended december 31, 2014 was 4.5%, supported by 6.3% storage rental internal growth. net acquisitions/divestitures contributed 6.8% of the increase in total reported revenue growth in the year ended december 31, 2014. foreign currency fluctuations in 2014 resulted in decreased revenue in the year ended december 31, 2014, as measured in united states dollars, of approximately 2.7% as compared to the year ended december 31, 2013, primarily due to the weakening of the australian dollar and brazilian real against the united states dollar, partially offset by a strengthening of the british pound sterling and the euro against the united states dollar. adjusted oibda as a percentage
of segment revenue decreased on a portfolio basis in the year ended december 31, 2014 compared to the year ended december 31, 2013 primarily due to the impact associated with a fire at one of our facilities in buenos aires, argentina on february 5, 2014 (described at note 10.g. to notes to consolidated financial statements included in this annual report), as well as integration costs associated with recent international acquisitions.
reported revenues in our international business segment increased 4.8% during the year ended december 31, 2013 compared to the year ended december 31, 2012. internal growth for the year ended december 31, 2013 was 3.2%, supported by 6.2% storage rental internal growth, partially offset by negative total service internal growth of 0.5% as a result of lower shredding revenues. acquisitions contributed 3.6% to total reported revenue growth in the year ended december 31, 2013. foreign currency fluctuations in 2013, primarily in europe, resulted in decreased revenue in the year ended december 31, 2013, as measured in united states dollars, of approximately 2.0% as compared to the year ended december 31, 2012. adjusted oibda as a percentage of segment revenue increased in the year ended december 31, 2013 compared to the year ended december 31, 2012 primarily due to increased operating income from productivity gains, pricing actions and disciplined cost management.

during the year ended december 31, 2014, adjusted oibda in the corporate and other segment as a percentage of consolidated revenue decreased by 20 basis points compared to the year ended
december 31, 2013, primarily due to increased insurance costs of $3.5 million associated with a fire at one of our facilities in buenos aires, argentina on february 5, 2014 (described at note 10.g. to notes to consolidated financial statements included in this annual report), higher professional fees of $2.6 million, restructuring costs of $1.5 million and reit compliance costs.
during the year ended december 31, 2013, adjusted oibda in the corporate and other segment as a percentage of consolidated revenue decreased by 70 basis points compared to the year ended december 31, 2012, primarily due to an $11.7 million increase in compensation costs, primarily associated with employee compensation and restructuring costs, an $8.7 million increase in professional fees and legal reserves, and the costs associated with the decision to discontinue work on a data archiving solution recorded in 2013.
liquidity and capital resources the following is a summary of our cash balances and cash flows (in thousands) as of and for the years ended december 31,
cash flows from operating activitiescontinuing operations          $443,652              $506,593              $472,948
cash and cash equivalents at the end of year                         243,415               120,526               125,933
net cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations was $472.9 million for the year ended december 31, 2014 compared to $506.6 million for the year ended december 31, 2013. the 6.6% year-over-year decrease resulted primarily from an increase in cash used in working capital of $74.7 million primarily related to the timing and payments of certain accrued expenses and deferred revenue liabilities, offset by an increase in net income, including non-cash charges and realized foreign exchange losses, of $41.1 million.
our business requires capital expenditures to support our expected revenue growth and ongoing operations as well as new products and services and increased profitability. these expenditures are included in the cash flows from investing activities from continuing operations. the nature of our capital expenditures has evolved over time along with the nature of our business. we make capital expenditures to support a number of different objectives. the majority of our capital goes to support business-line growth and our ongoing operations, but we also expend capital to support the development and improvement of products and services and projects designed to increase our profitability. these expenditures are generally small and discretionary in nature. cash paid for our capital expenditures, cash paid for acquisitions (net of cash acquired) and additions to customer acquisition costs during the year ended december 31, 2014 amounted to $361.9 million, $128.1 million and $34.4 million, respectively. for the year ended december 31, 2014, these expenditures were funded with cash flows provided by operating activities from continuing operations, cash equivalents on hand, borrowings under the credit agreement, proceeds from the sale of property, plant and equipment and the divestiture of our international shredding operations. excluding potential future acquisitions and additional real estate purchases above our plan, we expect our capital expenditures to be approximately $330.0 million to $360.0 million in the year ending december 31, 2015 (inclusive of approximately $25.0 million in planned real estate purchases).
net cash provided by financing activities from continuing operations was $19.9 million for the year ended december 31, 2014. during 2014, we received $642.4 million in net proceeds from the issuance of the gbp notes, net receipts of $460.5 million of other debt (primarily associated with our credit agreement, defined below) and $44.3 million from proceeds from the exercise of stock options and the employee stock purchase plan. we used the proceeds from these transactions for the retirement of $247.3 million of the 71/4% notes, the early redemption of $306.0 million of our 83/8% notes for approximately $319.1 million (inclusive of call premium payment), for payment of dividends in the amount of $542.3 million on our common stock and net payments of $14.8 million associated with our noncontrolling interest holders.
dividends see "item 5. market for registrant's common equity, related stockholder matters and issuer purchases of equity securities" of this annual report for information on dividends.
financial instruments and debt financial instruments that potentially subject us to credit risk consist principally of cash and cash equivalents (including money market funds and time deposits), restricted cash (primarily united states treasuries) and accounts receivable. the only significant concentrations of liquid investments as of december 31, 2014 relate to cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash held on deposit with three global banks and two "triple a" rated money market funds, all of which we consider to be large, highly-rated investment-grade institutions. as per our risk management investment policy, we limit exposure to concentration of credit risk by limiting the amount invested in any one mutual fund to a maximum of $50.0 million or in any one financial institution to a maximum of $75.0 million. as of december 31, 2014, our cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash balance was $159.8 million, including money market funds and time deposits amounting to $53.0 million. the money market funds are invested substantially in united states treasuries.
our consolidated debt as of december 31, 2014 comprised the following (in thousands):
real estate mortgages, capital leases and other(5)                                   320,702
long-term debt, net of current portion                                     $4,611,436
the capital stock or other equity interests of most of our united states subsidiaries, and up to 66% of the capital stock or other equity interests of our first-tier foreign subsidiaries, are pledged to secure these debt instruments, together with all intercompany obligations (including promissory notes) of subsidiaries owed to us or to one of our united states subsidiary guarantors. in addition, canada company has pledged 66% of the capital stock of its subsidiaries, and all intercompany
(including promissory notes) owed to or held by it, to secure the canadian dollar subfacility under the revolving credit facility.
collectively, the "parent notes." imi is the direct obligor on the parent notes, which are fully and unconditionally guaranteed, on a senior or senior subordinated basis, as the case may be, by substantially all of its direct and indirect 100% owned united states subsidiaries (the "guarantors"). these guarantees are joint and several obligations of the guarantors. canada company, ime and the remainder of our subsidiaries do not guarantee the parent notes.
canada company is the direct obligor on the cad notes, which are fully and unconditionally guaranteed, on a senior basis, by imi and the guarantors. these guarantees are joint and several obligations of imi and the guarantors. see note 5 to notes to consolidated financial statements included in this annual report.
ime is the direct obligor on the gbp notes, which are fully and unconditionally guaranteed, on a senior basis, by imi and the guarantors. these guarantees are joint and several obligations of imi and the guarantors. see note 5 to notes to consolidated financial statements included in this annual report.
includes (a) real estate mortgages of $5.1 million, (b) capital lease obligations of $241.9 million, and (c) other various notes and other obligations, which were assumed by us as a result of certain acquisitions, of $73.7 million.
on august 7, 2013, we amended our existing credit agreement. the revolving credit facilities (the "revolving credit facility") under our credit agreement, as amended (the "credit agreement"), allow imi and certain of its united states and foreign subsidiaries to borrow in united states dollars and (subject to sublimits) a variety of other currencies (including canadian dollars, british pounds sterling, euros, brazilian reais and australian dollars, among other currencies) in an aggregate outstanding amount not to exceed $1.5 billion. additionally, the credit agreement included an option to allow us to request additional commitments of up to $500.0 million, in the form of term loans or through increased commitments under the revolving credit facility. on september 24, 2014, we borrowed an additional $250.0 million in the form of a term loan under the credit agreement (the "term loan"). commencing on december 31, 2014, the term loan will begin amortizing in quarterly installments in an amount equal to $0.6 million per quarter, with the remaining balance due on june 27, 2016. the term loan may be prepaid without penalty or premium, in whole or in part, at any time. the credit agreement continues to include an option to allow us to request additional commitments of up to $250.0 million, in the form of term loans or through increased commitments under the revolving credit facility.
the credit agreement terminates on june 27, 2016, at which point all obligations become due. imi and the guarantors guarantee all obligations under the credit agreement, and have pledged the capital stock or other equity interests of most of their united states subsidiaries, up to 66% of the capital stock or other equity interests of their first-tier foreign subsidiaries, and all intercompany obligations (including promissory notes) owed to or held by them to secure the credit agreement. in addition, canada company has pledged 66% of the capital stock of its subsidiaries, and all intercompany obligations (including promissory notes) owed to or held by it to secure the canadian dollar subfacility under the revolving credit facility. the interest rate on borrowings under the credit agreement varies depending on our choice of interest rate and currency options, plus an applicable margin, which varies based on our consolidated leverage ratio. additionally, the credit agreement requires the payment of a commitment fee on the unused portion of the revolving credit facility, which fee ranges from between 0.3% to 0.5% based on certain financial ratios and fees associated with outstanding letters of credit. as of december 31, 2014, we had $883.4 million and $249.4 million of outstanding borrowings under the revolving credit facility and the term loan, respectively. of the $883.4 million of outstanding borrowings under the revolving credit facility, $680.2 million was
denominated in united states dollars, 77.2 million was denominated in canadian dollars, 64.3 million was denominated in euros and 71.6 million was denominated in australian dollars. in addition, we also had various outstanding letters of credit totaling $10.4 million. the remaining amount available for borrowing under the revolving credit facility as of december 31, 2014, based on imi's leverage ratio, the last 12 months' earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization and rent expense ("ebitdar"), other adjustments as defined in the credit agreement and current external debt, was $606.2 million (which amount represents the maximum availability as of such date). the average interest rate in effect under the credit agreement was 2.7% as of december 31, 2014. the average interest rate in effect under the revolving credit facility was 2.8% and ranged from 2.3% to 5.1% as of december 31, 2014 and the interest rate in effect under the term loan as of december 31, 2014 was 2.4%. for the years ended december 31, 2012, 2013 and 2014, we recorded commitment fees and letters of credit fees of $2.3 million, $3.2 million and $3.3 million, respectively, based on the unused balances under our revolving credit facilities and outstanding letters of credit. we recorded a charge of $5.5 million to other expense (income), net in the third quarter of 2013 related to an amendment of our revolving credit and term loan facilities, representing a write-off of deferred financing costs.
the credit agreement, our indentures and other agreements governing our indebtedness contain certain restrictive financial and operating covenants, including covenants that restrict our ability to complete acquisitions, pay cash dividends, incur indebtedness, make investments, sell assets and take certain other corporate actions. the covenants do not contain a rating trigger. therefore, a change in our debt rating would not trigger a default under the credit agreement, our indentures or other agreements governing our indebtedness. the credit agreement uses ebitdar-based calculations as the primary measures of financial performance, including leverage and fixed charge coverage ratios. imi's credit agreement net total lease adjusted leverage ratio was 5.0 and 5.4 as of december 31, 2013 and 2014, respectively, compared to a maximum allowable ratio of 6.5, and its net secured debt lease adjusted leverage ratio was 2.2 and 2.6 as of december 31, 2013 and 2014, respectively, compared to a maximum allowable ratio of 4.0. imi's bond leverage ratio (which is not lease adjusted), per the indentures, was 5.1 and 5.7 as of december 31, 2013 and 2014, respectively, compared to a maximum allowable ratio of 6.5. imi's credit agreement fixed charge coverage ratio was 2.5 at both december 31, 2013 and 2014 compared to a minimum allowable ratio of 1.5 under the credit agreement. noncompliance with these leverage and fixed charge coverage ratios would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and liquidity.
in august 2013, imi completed an underwritten public offering of $600.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 6% notes, and canada company completed an underwritten public offering of 200.0 million cad in aggregate principal amount of cad notes, both of which were issued at 100% of par. the net proceeds to imi and canada company of $782.3 million, after paying the underwriters' discounts and commissions, were used to redeem (1) all of the outstanding 71/2% notes, (2) all of the outstanding 8% notes due 2018, (3) all of the outstanding 8% notes due 2020, and (4) $137.5 million in principal amount of the 83/8% notes. the remaining net proceeds were used to repay indebtedness under our revolving credit facility. we recorded a charge to other expense (income), net of $38.1 million in the third quarter of 2013 related to the early extinguishment of this debt. this charge consists of call and tender premiums, original issue discounts and deferred financing costs related to this debt.
in january 2014, we redeemed the 150.0 million british pounds sterling (approximately $248.0 million) in aggregate principal amount of the 71/4% notes at 100% of par, plus accrued and unpaid interest, utilizing borrowings under our revolving credit facility and cash on-hand.
in september 2014, ime completed a private offering of 400.0 million british pounds sterling in aggregate principal amount of the gbp notes, which were issued at 100% of par. the net proceeds to ime of 394.0 million british pounds sterling (approximately $642.0 million based on an exchange rate
of 1.63), after paying the initial purchasers' commissions and expenses, were used to repay amounts outstanding under our revolving credit facility and for general corporate purposes.
in december 2014, we redeemed $306.0 million aggregate principal outstanding of our 83/8% notes at 104.188% of par, plus accrued and unpaid interest, utilizing borrowings under our revolving credit facility. we recorded a charge to other expense (income), net of $16.5 million related to the early extinguishment of this debt in the fourth quarter of 2014 representing the call premium associated with the early redemption, as well as a write-off of original issue discounts and deferred financing costs related to this debt.
our ability to pay interest on or to refinance our indebtedness depends on our future performance, working capital levels and capital structure, which are subject to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other factors which may be beyond our control. there can be no assurance that we will generate sufficient cash flow from our operations or that future financings will be available on acceptable terms or in amounts sufficient to enable us to service or refinance our indebtedness or to make necessary capital expenditures.

contractual obligations the following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of december 31, 2014 and the anticipated effect of these obligations on our liquidity in future years (in thousands):
capital lease obligations                                              $241,866                $38,761              $70,155                 $42,828               $90,122
long-term debt obligations (excluding capital lease obligations)               4,422,903              13,334                1,180,746               720,798               2,508,025
operating lease obligations(2)                                                 2,229,941              227,771                 419,419               367,544               1,215,207
amounts include variable rate interest payments, which are calculated utilizing the applicable interest rates as of december 31, 2014; see note 4 to notes to consolidated financial statements included in this annual report. amounts also include interest on capital leases.
amounts are offset by sublease income of $16.7 million in total (including $5.7 million, $7.9 million, $2.1 million and $1.0 million, in less than 1 year, 1-3 years, 3-5 years and more than 5 years, respectively).
the table above excludes $56.0 million in uncertain tax positions as we are unable to make reliable estimates of the period of cash settlement, if any, with the respective taxing authorities.
we expect to meet our cash flow requirements for the next twelve months from cash generated from operations, existing cash, cash equivalents, borrowings under the credit agreement and other financings, which may include senior or senior subordinated notes, secured credit facilities, securitizations and mortgage or capital lease financings, and the issuance of equity. we expect to meet our long-term cash flow requirements using the same means described above. we are highly leveraged. while we expect to continue to be highly leveraged for the foreseeable future, as a reit we expect our long-term capital allocation strategy will naturally shift toward increased use of equity to support lower leverage, though our leverage has increased, in the short-term, to fund the costs of the conversion plan.
off-balance sheet arrangements we have no off-balance sheet arrangements as defined in regulation s-k item 303(a)(4)(ii).
net operating losses we have federal net operating loss carryforwards, which expire in 2021 through 2033, of $88.1 million ($0, tax effected) at december 31, 2014 to reduce future federal taxable income, on which no federal tax benefit is expected to be realized. we have state net operating loss carryforwards, which expire in 2015 through 2033, of $74.4 million ($0.1 million, tax effected) at december 31, 2014 to reduce future state taxable income, on which an insignificant state tax benefit is expected to be realized. we have assets for foreign net operating losses of $64.6 million, with various expiration dates (and in some cases no expiration date), subject to a valuation allowance of approximately 62%.
inflation certain of our expenses, such as wages and benefits, insurance, occupancy costs and equipment repair and replacement, are subject to normal inflationary pressures. although to date we have been able to offset inflationary cost increases through increased operating efficiencies, the negotiation of favorable long-term real estate leases and customer contracts which contain provisions for inflationary price escalators, we can give no assurance that we will be able to offset any future inflationary cost increases through similar efficiencies, leases or increased storage rental or service charges.
item 7a. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk.
credit risk financial instruments that potentially subject us to credit risk consist principally of cash and cash equivalents (including money market funds and time deposits), restricted cash (primarily united states treasuries) and accounts receivable. the only significant concentrations of liquid investments as of december 31, 2014 relate to cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash held on deposit with three global banks and two "triple a" rated money market funds, all of which we consider to be large, highly-rated investment-grade institutions. as per our risk management investment policy, we limit exposure to concentration of credit risk by limiting the amount invested in any one mutual fund to a maximum of $50.0 million or in any one financial institution to a maximum of $75.0 million. as of december 31, 2014, our cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash balance was $159.8 million, including money market funds and time deposits amounting to $53.0 million. the money market funds are invested substantially in united states treasuries.
interest rate risk given the recurring nature of our revenues and the long-term nature of our asset base, we have the ability and the preference to use long-term, fixed interest rate debt to finance our business at attractive rates, thereby helping to preserve our long-term returns on invested capital. we target approximately 75% of our debt portfolio to be fixed with respect to interest rates. occasionally, we will use interest rate swaps as a tool to maintain our targeted level of fixed rate debt. see notes 3 and 4 to notes to consolidated financial statements included in this annual report.
as of december 31, 2014, we had $1,134.6 million of variable rate debt outstanding with a weighted average variable interest rate of approximately 2.7%, and $3,528.9 million of fixed rate debt outstanding. as of december 31, 2014, approximately 76% of our total debt outstanding was fixed. if the weighted average variable interest rate on our variable rate debt had increased by 1%, our net income for the year ended december 31, 2014 would have been reduced by approximately $3.7 million. see note 4 to notes to consolidated financial statements included in this annual report for a discussion of our long-term indebtedness, including the fair values of such indebtedness as of december 31, 2014.
currency risk our investments in ime, canada company, iron mountain mexico, sa de rl de cv, iron mountain south america, ltd., iron mountain australia pty ltd., iron mountain cis and our other international investments may be subject to risks and uncertainties related to fluctuations in currency valuation. our reporting currency is the united states dollar. however, our international revenues and expenses are generated in the currencies of the countries in which we operate, primarily the british pound sterling, euro, canadian dollar, brazilian real, australian dollar and the russian ruble. declines in the value of the local currencies in which we are paid relative to the united states dollar will cause revenues in united states dollar terms to decrease and dollar-denominated liabilities to increase in local currency.
the impact of currency fluctuations on our earnings is mitigated significantly by the fact that most operating and other expenses are also incurred and paid in the local currency. we also have several intercompany obligations between our foreign subsidiaries and imi and our united states-based subsidiaries. in addition, our treasury centers in switzerland, our foreign subsidiaries and ime also have intercompany obligations between them. these intercompany obligations are primarily denominated in the local currency of the foreign subsidiary.
we have adopted and implemented a number of strategies to mitigate the risks associated with fluctuations in currency valuations. one strategy is to finance certain of our international subsidiaries with debt that is denominated in local currencies, thereby providing a natural hedge. in determining the amount of any such financing, we take into account local tax considerations, among other factors. another strategy we utilize is for imi or iron mountain information management, llc, a wholly-owned subsidiary of imi, to borrow in foreign currencies to hedge our intercompany financing activities. in addition, on occasion, we enter into currency swaps to temporarily or permanently hedge an overseas investment, such as a major acquisition, to lock in certain transaction economics. we have implemented these strategies for our foreign investments in the united kingdom, canada and continental europe. ime has financed its capital needs through direct borrowings in british pounds sterling under the gbp notes. similarly, canada company has financed its capital needs through direct borrowings in canadian dollars under the credit agreement and the cad notes. this creates a tax efficient natural currency hedge. specifically, through our 255.0 million 63/4% notes, we effectively hedge our outstanding intercompany loans denominated in euros. we designated a portion of our 63/4% notes issued by imi as a hedge of net investment of certain of our euro denominated subsidiaries. as a result, we recorded $6.4 million ($6.3 million, net of tax) of foreign exchange gains related to the "marking-to-market" of such debt to currency translation adjustments which is a component of accumulated other comprehensive items, net included in stockholders' equity for the year ended december 31, 2014. as of december 31, 2014, cumulative net gains of $13.8 million, net of tax are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive items, net associated with this net investment hedge.
we have also entered into a number of separate forward contracts to hedge our exposures in euros, british pounds sterling and australian dollars. as of december 31, 2014, we had outstanding forward contracts to purchase 206.0 million euros and sell $252.7 million united states dollars to hedge our intercompany exposures with our european operations. at the maturity of the forward contracts, we may enter into new forward contracts to hedge movements in the underlying currencies. at the time of settlement, we either pay or receive the net settlement amount from the forward contract and recognize this amount in other expense (income), net in the accompanying statements of operations as a realized foreign exchange gain or loss. at the end of each month, we mark the outstanding forward contracts to market and record an unrealized foreign exchange gain or loss for the mark-to-market valuation. we have not designated forward contracts as hedges. during the year ended december 31, 2014, there was $21.1 million in net cash payments included in cash from operating activities from continuing operations related to settlements associated with foreign currency forward contracts. we recorded net losses in connection with forward contracts of $18.0 million, including an unrealized foreign exchange loss of $2.4 million related to the euro forward contracts in other expense (income), net in the accompanying statement of operations as of december 31, 2014. as of december 31, 2014, except as noted above, our currency exposures to intercompany balances are not hedged.
the impact of devaluation or depreciating currency on an entity depends on the residual effect on the local economy and the ability of an entity to raise prices and/or reduce expenses. due to our constantly changing currency exposure and the potential substantial volatility of currency exchange rates, we cannot predict the effect of exchange fluctuations on our business. the effect of a change in foreign exchange rates on our net investment in foreign subsidiaries is reflected in the "accumulated other comprehensive items, net" component of equity. a 10% depreciation in year-end 2014
functional currencies, relative to the united states dollar, would result in a reduction in our equity of approximately $70.4 million.

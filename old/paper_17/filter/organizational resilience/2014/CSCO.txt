item 1a.   risk factors set forth below and elsewhere in this report and in other documents we file with the sec are descriptions of the risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from the results contemplated by the forward-looking statements contained in this report.
our operating results may fluctuate in future periods, which may adversely affect our stock price our operating results have been in the past, and will continue to be, subject to quarterly and annual fluctuations as a result of numerous factors, some of which may contribute to more pronounced fluctuations in an uncertain global economic environment. these factors include:
•   fluctuations in demand for our products and services, especially with respect to telecommunications service providers and internet businesses, in part due to changes in the global economic environment
•   changes in sales and implementation cycles for our products and reduced visibility into our customers' spending plans and associated revenue
•   our ability to maintain appropriate inventory levels and purchase commitments
•   price and product competition in the communications and networking industries, which can change rapidly due to technological innovation and different business models from various geographic regions
•   the overall movement toward industry consolidation among both our competitors and our customers
•   the introduction and market acceptance of new technologies and products and our success in new and evolving markets, including in our newer product categories such as data center and collaboration and in emerging technologies, as well as the adoption of new standards
•   new business models for our offerings, such as other-as-a-service (xaas), where costs are borne up front while revenue is recognized over time
•   variations in sales channels, product costs, or mix of products sold
•   the timing, size, and mix of orders from customers
•   manufacturing and customer lead times
•   fluctuations in our gross margins, and the factors that contribute to such fluctuations, as described below
•   the ability of our customers, channel partners, contract manufacturers and suppliers to obtain financing or to fund capital expenditures, especially during a period of global credit market disruption or in the event of customer, channel partner, contract manufacturer or supplier financial problems
•   actual events, circumstances, outcomes, and amounts differing from judgments, assumptions, and estimates used in determining the values of certain assets (including the amounts of related valuation allowances), liabilities, and other items reflected in our consolidated financial statements
•   how well we execute on our strategy and operating plans and the impact of changes in our business model that could result in significant restructuring charges
•   benefits anticipated from our investments in engineering, sales and manufacturing activities
•   changes in tax laws or accounting rules, or interpretations thereof
as a consequence, operating results for a particular future period are difficult to predict, and, therefore, prior results are not necessarily indicative of results to be expected in future periods. any of the foregoing factors, or any other factors discussed elsewhere herein, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition that could adversely affect our stock price.
our operating results may be adversely affected by unfavorable economic and market conditions and the uncertain geopolitical environment challenging economic conditions worldwide have from time to time contributed, and may continue to contribute, to slowdowns in the communications and networking industries at large, as well as in specific segments and markets in which we operate, resulting in:
•   reduced demand for our products as a result of continued constraints on it-related capital spending by our customers, particularly service providers, and other customer markets as well
•   increased price competition for our products, not only from our competitors but also as a consequence of customers disposing of unutilized products
•   risk of excess and obsolete inventories
•   risk of supply constraints
•   risk of excess facilities and manufacturing capacity
•   higher overhead costs as a percentage of revenue and higher interest expense the global macroeconomic environment and recovery from the downturn has been challenging and inconsistent. instability in the global credit markets, the impact of uncertainty regarding the u.s. federal budget including the effect of the sequestration beginning in 2013, global central bank monetary policy, the instability in the geopolitical environment in many parts of the world and other disruptions may continue to put pressure on global economic conditions. if global economic and market conditions, or economic conditions in key markets, remain uncertain or deteriorate further, we may experience material impacts on our business, operating results, and financial condition.
our operating results in one or more segments may also be affected by uncertain or changing economic conditions particularly germane to that segment or to particular customer markets within that segment. for example, sales in several of our emerging countries decreased in recent periods, including fiscal 2014, and we expect that this weakness will continue for at least several quarters.
in addition, reports of certain intelligence gathering methods of the u.s. government could affect customers' perception of the products of it companies which design and manufacture products in the united states. trust and confidence in us as an it supplier is critical to the development and growth of our markets. impairment of that trust, or foreign regulatory actions taken in response to reports of certain intelligence gathering methods of the u.s. government, could affect the demand for our products from customers outside of the united states and could have an adverse effect on our operating results.
we have been investing and expect to continue to invest in key growth areas as well as maintaining leadership in routing, switching and services, and if the return on these investments is lower or develops more slowly than we expect, our operating results may be harmed we expect to realign and dedicate resources into key growth areas, such as data center virtualization, software, security, and cloud, while also focusing on maintaining leadership in routing, switching and services. however, the return on our investments may be lower, or may develop more slowly, than we expect. if we do not achieve the benefits anticipated from these investments (including if our selection of areas for investment does not play out as we expect), or if the achievement of these benefits is delayed, our operating results may be adversely affected.
our revenue for a particular period is difficult to predict, and a shortfall in revenue may harm our operating results as a result of a variety of factors discussed in this report, our revenue for a particular quarter is difficult to predict, especially in light of a challenging and inconsistent global macroeconomic environment and related market uncertainty.
our revenue may grow at a slower rate than in past periods, or decline as it did in fiscal 2014 on a year-over-year basis. our ability to meet financial expectations could also be adversely affected if the nonlinear sales pattern seen in some of our past quarters
recurs in future periods. we have experienced periods of time during which shipments have exceeded net bookings or manufacturing issues have delayed shipments, leading to nonlinearity in shipping patterns. in addition to making it difficult to predict revenue for a particular period, nonlinearity in shipping can increase costs, because irregular shipment patterns result in periods of underutilized capacity and periods in which overtime expenses may be incurred, as well as in potential additional inventory management-related costs. in addition, to the extent that manufacturing issues and any related component shortages result in delayed shipments in the future, and particularly in periods in which our contract manufacturers are operating at higher levels of capacity, it is possible that revenue for a quarter could be adversely affected if such matters occur and are not remediated within the same quarter.
the timing of large orders can also have a significant effect on our business and operating results from quarter to quarter, primarily in the united states and in emerging countries. from time to time, we receive large orders that have a significant effect on our operating results in the period in which the order is recognized as revenue. the timing of such orders is difficult to predict, and the timing of revenue recognition from such orders may affect period to period changes in revenue. as a result, our operating results could vary materially from quarter to quarter based on the receipt of such orders and their ultimate recognition as revenue.
inventory management remains an area of focus. we have experienced longer than normal manufacturing lead times in the past which have caused some customers to place the same order multiple times within our various sales channels and to cancel the duplicative orders upon receipt of the product, or to place orders with other vendors with shorter manufacturing lead times. such multiple ordering (along with other factors) or risk of order cancellation may cause difficulty in predicting our revenue and, as a result, could impair our ability to manage parts inventory effectively. in addition, our efforts to improve manufacturing lead-time performance may result in corresponding reductions in order backlog. a decline in backlog levels could result in more variability and less predictability in our quarter-to-quarter revenue and operating results. in addition, when facing component supply-related challenges, we have increased our efforts in procuring components in order to meet customer expectations which in turn contribute to an increase in purchase commitments. increases in our purchase commitments to shorten lead times could also lead to excess and obsolete inventory charges if the demand for our products is less than our expectations.
we plan our operating expense levels based primarily on forecasted revenue levels. these expenses and the impact of long-term commitments are relatively fixed in the short term. a shortfall in revenue could lead to operating results being below expectations because we may not be able to quickly reduce these fixed expenses in response to short-term business changes.
any of the above factors could have a material adverse impact on our operations and financial results.
we expect gross margin to vary over time, and our level of product gross margin may not be sustainable our level of product gross margins declined in prior periods, including fiscal 2014, and may continue to decline and be adversely affected by numerous factors, including:
•   changes in customer, geographic, or product mix, including mix of configurations within each product group
•   introduction of new products, including products with price-performance advantages, and new business models for our offerings such as xaas
•   entry into new markets or growth in lower margin markets, including markets with different pricing and cost structures, through acquisitions or internal development
•   increases in material, labor or other manufacturing-related costs, which could be significant especially during periods of supply constraints
•   changes in shipment volume
•   the timing of revenue recognition and revenue deferrals
•   increased cost, loss of cost savings or dilution of savings due to changes in component pricing or charges incurred due to inventory holding periods if parts ordering does not correctly anticipate product demand or if the financial health of either contract manufacturers or suppliers deteriorates
•   lower than expected benefits from value engineering
•   changes in distribution channels
•   increased amortization of purchased intangible assets, especially from acquisitions
•   how well we execute on our strategy and operating plans changes in service gross margin may result from various factors such as changes in the mix between technical support services and advanced services, as well as the timing of technical support service contract initiations and renewals and the addition of personnel and other resources to support higher levels of service business in future periods.
sales to the service provider market are especially volatile, and weakness in sales orders from this industry may harm our operating results and financial condition sales to the service provider market have been characterized by large and sporadic purchases, especially relating to our router sales and sales of certain products in our newer product categories such as data center, collaboration, and service provider video, in addition to longer sales cycles. at various times in the past including fiscal 2014, we experienced significant weakness in sales to service providers, sometimes lasting over extended periods of time as market conditions have fluctuated. we expect that the weakness we experienced in fiscal 2014 will continue for at least several quarters. sales activity in this industry depends upon the stage of completion of expanding network infrastructures; the availability of funding; and the extent to which service providers are affected by regulatory, economic, and business conditions in the country of operations. weakness in orders from this industry, including as a result of any slowdown in capital expenditures by service providers (which may be more prevalent during a global economic downturn or periods of economic uncertainty), could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, and financial condition. such slowdowns may continue or recur in future periods. orders from this industry could decline for many reasons other than the competitiveness of our products and services within their respective markets. for example, in the past, many of our service provider customers have been materially and adversely affected by slowdowns in the general economy, by overcapacity, by changes in the service provider market, by regulatory developments, and by constraints on capital availability, resulting in business failures and substantial reductions in spending and expansion plans. these conditions have materially harmed our business and operating results in the past, and some of these or other conditions in the service provider market could affect our business and operating results in any future period. finally, service provider customers typically have longer implementation cycles; require a broader range of services, including design services; demand that vendors take on a larger share of risks; often require acceptance provisions, which can lead to a delay in revenue recognition; and expect financing from vendors. all these factors can add further risk to business conducted with service providers.
disruption of or changes in our distribution model could harm our sales and margins if we fail to manage distribution of our products and services properly, or if our distributors' financial condition or operations weaken, our revenue and gross margins could be adversely affected.
a substantial portion of our products and services is sold through our channel partners, and the remainder is sold through direct sales. our channel partners include systems integrators, service providers, other resellers, and distributors. systems integrators and service providers typically sell directly to end users and often provide system installation, technical support, professional services, and other support services in addition to network equipment sales. systems integrators also typically integrate our products into an overall solution, and a number of service providers are also systems integrators. distributors stock inventory and typically sell to systems integrators, service providers, and other resellers. we refer to sales through distributors as our two-tier system of sales to the end customer. revenue from distributors is generally recognized based on a sell-through method using information provided by them. these distributors are generally given business terms that allow them to return a portion of inventory, receive credits for changes in selling prices, and participate in various cooperative marketing programs. if sales through indirect channels increase, this may lead to greater difficulty in forecasting the mix of our products and, to a degree, the timing of orders from our customers.
historically, we have seen fluctuations in our gross margins based on changes in the balance of our distribution channels. although variability to date has not been significant, there can be no assurance that changes in the balance of our distribution model in future periods would not have an adverse effect on our gross margins and profitability.
some factors could result in disruption of or changes in our distribution model, which could harm our sales and margins, including the following:
•   we compete with some of our channel partners, including through our direct sales, which may lead these channel partners to use other suppliers that do not directly sell their own products or otherwise compete with them
•   some of our channel partners may demand that we absorb a greater share of the risks that their customers may ask them to bear
•   some of our channel partners may have insufficient financial resources and may not be able to withstand changes and challenges in business conditions
•   revenue from indirect sales could suffer if our distributors' financial condition or operations weaken in addition, we depend on our channel partners globally to comply with applicable regulatory requirements. to the extent that they fail to do so, that could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, and financial condition. further, sales of our products outside of agreed territories can result in disruption to our distribution channels.
the markets in which we compete are intensely competitive, which could adversely affect our achievement of revenue growth the markets in which we compete are characterized by rapid change, converging technologies, and a migration to networking and communications solutions that offer relative advantages. these market factors represent a competitive threat to us. we compete with numerous vendors in each product category. the overall number of our competitors providing niche product solutions may increase. also, the identity and composition of competitors may change as we increase our activity in newer product categories such as data center and collaboration and in key growth areas. for example, as products related to network programmability, such as software-defined-networking products, become more prevalent, we expect to face increased competition from companies who develop networking products based on commoditized hardware, referred to as "white box" hardware, to the extent customers decide to purchase those product offerings instead of ours. in addition, the growth in demand for technology delivered as a service enables new competitors to enter the market.
as we continue to expand globally, we may see new competition in different geographic regions. in particular, we have experienced price-focused competition from competitors in asia, especially from china, and we anticipate this will continue. for information regarding our competitors, see the section entitled "competition" contained in item 1. business of this report.
some of our competitors compete across many of our product lines, while others are primarily focused in a specific product area. barriers to entry are relatively low, and new ventures to create products that do or could compete with our products are regularly formed. in addition, some of our competitors may have greater resources, including technical and engineering resources, than we do. as we expand into new markets, we will face competition not only from our existing competitors but also from other competitors, including existing companies with strong technological, marketing, and sales positions in those markets. we also sometimes face competition from resellers and distributors of our products. companies with whom we have strategic alliances in some areas may be competitors in other areas, and in our view this trend may increase.
for example, the enterprise data center is undergoing a fundamental transformation arising from the convergence of technologies, including computing, networking, storage, and software, that previously were segregated. due to several factors, including the availability of highly scalable and general purpose microprocessors, application-specific integrated circuits offering advanced services, standards based protocols, cloud computing and virtualization, the convergence of technologies within the enterprise data center is spanning multiple, previously independent, technology segments. also, some of our current and potential competitors for enterprise data center business have made acquisitions, or announced new strategic alliances, designed to position them to provide end-to-end technology solutions for the enterprise data center. as a result of all of these developments, we face greater competition in the development and sale of enterprise data center technologies, including competition from entities that are among our long-term strategic alliance partners. companies that are strategic alliance partners in some areas of our business may acquire or form alliances with our competitors, thereby reducing their business with us.
the principal competitive factors in the markets in which we presently compete and may compete in the future include:
•   the ability to provide a broad range of networking and communications products and services
•   product performance
•   the ability to introduce new products, including products with price-performance advantages
•   the ability to provide value-added features such as security, reliability, and investment protection
•   market presence
•   disruptive technology shifts and new business models we also face competition from customers to which we license or supply technology and suppliers from which we transfer technology. the inherent nature of networking requires interoperability. as such, we must cooperate and at the same time compete with many companies. any inability to effectively manage these complicated relationships with customers, suppliers, and strategic alliance partners could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, and financial condition and accordingly affect our chances of success.
our inventory management relating to our sales to our two-tier distribution channel is complex, and excess inventory may harm our gross margins we must manage our inventory relating to sales to our distributors effectively, because inventory held by them could affect our results of operations. our distributors may increase orders during periods of product shortages, cancel orders if their inventory is too high, or delay orders in anticipation of new products. they also may adjust their orders in response to the supply of our products and the products of our competitors that are available to them, and in response to seasonal fluctuations in end-user demand. revenue to our distributors generally is recognized based on a sell-through method using information provided by them, and they are generally given business terms that allow them to return a portion of inventory, receive credits for changes in selling price, and participate in various cooperative marketing programs. inventory management remains an area of focus as we balance the need to maintain strategic inventory levels to ensure competitive lead times against the risk of inventory obsolescence because of rapidly changing technology and customer requirements. when facing component supply-related challenges, we have increased our efforts in procuring components in order to meet customer expectations. if we ultimately determine that we have excess inventory, we may have to reduce our prices and write down inventory, which in turn could result in lower gross margins.
supply chain issues, including financial problems of contract manufacturers or component suppliers, or a shortage of adequate component supply or manufacturing capacity that increased our costs or caused a delay in our ability to fulfill orders, could have an adverse impact on our business and operating results, and our failure to estimate customer demand properly may result in excess or obsolete component supply, which could adversely affect our gross margins the fact that we do not own or operate the bulk of our manufacturing facilities and that we are reliant on our extended supply chain could have an adverse impact on the supply of our products and on our business and operating results:
•   any financial problems of either contract manufacturers or component suppliers could either limit supply or increase costs
•   reservation of manufacturing capacity at our contract manufacturers by other companies, inside or outside of our industry, could either limit supply or increase costs a reduction or interruption in supply; a significant increase in the price of one or more components; a failure to adequately authorize procurement of inventory by our contract manufacturers; a failure to appropriately cancel, reschedule, or adjust our requirements based on our business needs; or a decrease in demand for our products could materially adversely affect our business, operating results, and financial condition and could materially damage customer relationships. furthermore, as a result of binding price or purchase commitments with suppliers, we may be obligated to purchase components at prices that are higher than those available
in the current market. in the event that we become committed to purchase components at prices in excess of the current market price when the components are actually used, our gross margins could decrease. we have experienced longer than normal lead times in the past. although we have generally secured additional supply or taken other mitigation actions when significant disruptions have occurred, if similar situations occur in the future, they could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition. see the risk factor above entitled "our revenue for a particular period is difficult to predict, and a shortfall in revenue may harm our operating results."
our growth and ability to meet customer demands depend in part on our ability to obtain timely deliveries of parts from our suppliers and contract manufacturers. we have experienced component shortages in the past, including shortages caused by manufacturing process issues, that have affected our operations. we may in the future experience a shortage of certain component parts as a result of our own manufacturing issues, manufacturing issues at our suppliers or contract manufacturers, capacity problems experienced by our suppliers or contract manufacturers, or strong demand in the industry for those parts. growth in the economy is likely to create greater pressures on us and our suppliers to accurately project overall component demand and component demands within specific product categories and to establish optimal component levels and manufacturing capacity, especially for labor-intensive components, components for which we purchase a substantial portion of the supply, or the re-ramping of manufacturing capacity for highly complex products. during periods of shortages or delays the price of components may increase, or the components may not be available at all, and we may also encounter shortages if we do not accurately anticipate our needs. we may not be able to secure enough components at reasonable prices or of acceptable quality to build new products in a timely manner in the quantities or configurations needed. accordingly, our revenue and gross margins could suffer until other sources can be developed. our operating results would also be adversely affected if, anticipating greater demand than actually develops, we commit to the purchase of more components than we need, which is more likely to occur in a period of demand uncertainties such as we are currently experiencing. there can be no assurance that we will not encounter these problems in the future. although in many cases we use standard parts and components for our products, certain components are presently available only from a single source or limited sources, and a global economic downturn and related market uncertainty could negatively impact the availability of components from one or more of these sources, especially during times such as we have recently seen when there are supplier constraints based on labor and other actions taken during economic downturns. we may not be able to diversify sources in a timely manner, which could harm our ability to deliver products to customers and seriously impact present and future sales.
we believe that we may be faced with the following challenges in the future:
•   new markets in which we participate may grow quickly, which may make it difficult to quickly obtain significant component capacity
•   we face competition for certain components that are supply-constrained, from existing competitors, and companies in other markets manufacturing capacity and component supply constraints could continue to be significant issues for us. we purchase components from a variety of suppliers and use several contract manufacturers to provide manufacturing services for our products. during the normal course of business, in order to improve manufacturing lead-time performance and to help ensure adequate component supply, we enter into agreements with contract manufacturers and suppliers that either allow them to procure inventory based upon criteria as defined by us or that establish the parameters defining our requirements. in certain instances, these agreements allow us the option to cancel, reschedule, and adjust our requirements based on our business needs prior to firm orders being placed. when facing component supply-related challenges, we have increased our efforts in procuring components in order to meet customer expectations which in turn contributes to an increase in purchase commitments. increases in our purchase commitments to shorten lead times could also lead to excess and obsolete inventory charges if the demand for our products is less than our expectations. if we fail to anticipate customer demand properly, an oversupply of parts could result in excess or obsolete components that could adversely affect our gross margins. for additional information regarding our purchase commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers, see note 12 to the consolidated financial statements.
we depend upon the development of new products and enhancements to existing products, and if we fail to predict and respond to emerging technological trends and customers' changing needs, our operating results and market share may suffer the markets for our products are characterized by rapidly changing technology, evolving industry standards, new product introductions, and evolving methods of building and operating networks. our operating results depend on our ability to develop and introduce new products into existing and emerging markets and to reduce the production costs of existing products. many of our strategic initiatives and investments are aimed at meeting the requirements that a network capable of multiple-party, collaborative interaction would demand, and the investments we have made and our architectural approach are designed to enable the increased
use of the network as the platform for all forms of communications and it. for example, in fiscal 2009 we launched our cisco unified computing system (ucs), our next-generation enterprise data center platform architected to unite computing, network, storage access and virtualization resources in a single system, which is designed to address the fundamental transformation occurring in the enterprise data center. while our cisco ucs offering remains a significant focus area for us, several market transitions are also shaping our strategies and investments.
one such market transition we are focusing on is the move towards more programmable, flexible and virtual networks. in our view, this evolution is in its very early stages, and we believe the successful products and solutions in this market will combine asics, hardware and software elements together. other examples include our focus on the ioe market transition, a potentially significant transition in the it industry, and a transition in cloud where we have announced plans to architect the cisco intercloud solution.
the process of developing new technology, including technology related to more programmable, flexible and virtual networks and technology related to other market transitions, including ioe and cloud, is complex and uncertain, and if we fail to accurately predict customers' changing needs and emerging technological trends our business could be harmed. we must commit significant resources, including the investments we have been making in our priorities to developing new products before knowing whether our investments will result in products the market will accept. in particular, if our model of the evolution of networking does not emerge as we believe it will, or if the industry does not evolve as we believe it will, or if our strategy for addressing this evolution is not successful, many of our strategic initiatives and investments may be of no or limited value. for example, if we do not introduce products related to network programmability, such as software-defined-networking products, in a timely fashion, or if product offerings in this market that ultimately succeed are based on technology, or an approach to technology, that differs from ours, such as, for example, networking products based on "white box" hardware, our business could be harmed. similarly, our business could be harmed if we fail to develop, or fail to develop in a timely fashion, offerings to address other transitions, or if the offerings addressing these other transitions that ultimately succeed are based on technology, or an approach to technology, different from ours.
furthermore, we may not execute successfully on our vision or strategy because of challenges with regard to product planning and timing, technical hurdles that we fail to overcome in a timely fashion, or a lack of appropriate resources. this could result in competitors, some of which may also be our strategic alliance partners, providing those solutions before we do and loss of market share, revenue, and earnings. in addition, the growth in demand for technology delivered as a service enables new competitors to enter the market. the success of new products depends on several factors, including proper new product definition, component costs, timely completion and introduction of these products, differentiation of new products from those of our competitors, and market acceptance of these products. there can be no assurance that we will successfully identify new product opportunities, develop and bring new products to market in a timely manner, or achieve market acceptance of our products or that products and technologies developed by others will not render our products or technologies obsolete or noncompetitive. the products and technologies in our other product categories and key growth areas may not prove to have the market success we anticipate, and we may not successfully identify and invest in other emerging or new products.
changes in industry structure and market conditions could lead to charges related to discontinuances of certain of our products or businesses, asset impairments and workforce reductions or restructurings in response to changes in industry and market conditions, we may be required to strategically realign our resources and to consider restructuring, disposing of, or otherwise exiting businesses. any resource realignment, or decision to limit investment in or dispose of or otherwise exit businesses, may result in the recording of special charges, such as inventory and technology-related write-offs, workforce reduction or restructuring costs, charges relating to consolidation of excess facilities, or claims from third parties who were resellers or users of discontinued products. our estimates with respect to the useful life or ultimate recoverability of our carrying basis of assets, including purchased intangible assets, could change as a result of such assessments and decisions. although in certain instances our supply agreements allow us the option to cancel, reschedule, and adjust our requirements based on our business needs prior to firm orders being placed, our loss contingencies may include liabilities for contracts that we cannot cancel with contract manufacturers and suppliers. further, our estimates relating to the liabilities for excess facilities are affected by changes in real estate market conditions. additionally, we are required to perform goodwill impairment tests on an annual basis and between annual tests in certain circumstances, and future goodwill impairment tests may result in a charge to earnings.
in august 2014, as part of our strategy of continuing to invest in growth, innovation and talent, while also managing costs and driving efficiencies, we announced a restructuring plan that will impact up to 6,000 employees, representing approximately 8 percent of our global workforce. we expect to take action under this plan beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2015. the implementation of this restructuring plan may be disruptive to our business, and following completion of the restructuring plan our business may not be more efficient or effective than prior to implementation of the plan. our restructuring activities, including any related charges and the impact of the related headcount restructurings, could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, and financial condition.
over the long term we intend to invest in engineering, sales, service and marketing activities, and these investments may achieve delayed, or lower than expected, benefits which could harm our operating results while we intend to focus on managing our costs and expenses, over the long term, we also intend to invest in personnel and other resources related to our engineering, sales, service and marketing functions as we realign and dedicate resources on key growth areas, such as data center virtualization, software, security, and cloud, and we also intend to focus on maintaining leadership in routing, switching and services. we are likely to recognize the costs associated with these investments earlier than some of the anticipated benefits, and the return on these investments may be lower, or may develop more slowly, than we expect. if we do not achieve the benefits anticipated from these investments, or if the achievement of these benefits is delayed, our operating results may be adversely affected.
our business substantially depends upon the continued growth of the internet and internet-based systems a substantial portion of our business and revenue depends on growth and evolution of the internet, including the continued development of the internet and the anticipated transition to ioe, and on the deployment of our products by customers who depend on such continued growth and evolution. to the extent that an economic slowdown or uncertainty and related reduction in capital spending adversely affect spending on internet infrastructure, including spending or investment related to ioe, we could experience material harm to our business, operating results, and financial condition.
because of the rapid introduction of new products and changing customer requirements related to matters such as cost-effectiveness and security, we believe that there could be performance problems with internet communications in the future, which could receive a high degree of publicity and visibility. because we are a large supplier of networking products, our business, operating results, and financial condition may be materially adversely affected, regardless of whether or not these problems are due to the performance of our own products. such an event could also result in a material adverse effect on the market price of our common stock independent of direct effects on our business.
we have made and expect to continue to make acquisitions that could disrupt our operations and harm our operating results our growth depends upon market growth, our ability to enhance our existing products, and our ability to introduce new products on a timely basis. we intend to continue to address the need to develop new products and enhance existing products through acquisitions of other companies, product lines, technologies, and personnel. acquisitions involve numerous risks, including the following:
•   difficulties in integrating the operations, systems, technologies, products, and personnel of the acquired companies, particularly companies with large and widespread operations and/or complex products, such as scientific-atlanta, webex, starent, tandberg and nds group limited
•   diversion of management's attention from normal daily operations of the business and the challenges of managing larger and more widespread operations resulting from acquisitions
•   potential difficulties in completing projects associated with in-process research and development intangibles
•   difficulties in entering markets in which we have no or limited direct prior experience and where competitors in such markets have stronger market positions
•   insufficient revenue to offset increased expenses associated with acquisitions
•   the potential loss of key employees, customers, distributors, vendors and other business partners of the companies we acquire following and continuing after announcement of acquisition plans acquisitions may also cause us to:
•   use a substantial portion of our cash resources, or incur debt, as we did in fiscal 2006 when we issued and sold $6.5 billion in senior unsecured notes to fund our acquisition of scientific-atlanta
•   significantly increase our interest expense, leverage and debt service requirements if we incur additional debt to pay for an acquisition
•   record goodwill and intangible assets that are subject to impairment testing on a regular basis and potential periodic impairment charges
•   incur tax expenses related to the effect of acquisitions on our intercompany research and development ("r&amp;d") cost sharing arrangement and legal structure
•   incur large and immediate write-offs and restructuring and other related expenses
•   become subject to intellectual property or other litigation mergers and acquisitions of high-technology companies are inherently risky and subject to many factors outside of our control, and no assurance can be given that our previous or future acquisitions will be successful and will not materially adversely affect our business, operating results, or financial condition. failure to manage and successfully integrate acquisitions could materially harm our business and operating results. prior acquisitions have resulted in a wide range of outcomes, from successful introduction of new products and technologies to a failure to do so. even when an acquired company has already developed and marketed products, there can be no assurance that product enhancements will be made in a timely fashion or that pre-acquisition due diligence will have identified all possible issues that might arise with respect to such products.
from time to time, we have made acquisitions that resulted in charges in an individual quarter. these charges may occur in any particular quarter, resulting in variability in our quarterly earnings. in addition, our effective tax rate for future periods is uncertain and could be impacted by mergers and acquisitions. risks related to new product development also apply to acquisitions. please see the risk factors above, including the risk factor entitled "we depend upon the development of new products and enhancements to existing products, and if we fail to predict and respond to emerging technological trends and customers' changing needs, our operating results and market share may suffer" for additional information.
entrance into new or developing markets exposes us to additional competition and will likely increase demands on our service and support operations as we focus on new market opportunities and key growth areas, we will increasingly compete with large telecommunications equipment suppliers as well as startup companies. several of our competitors may have greater resources, including technical and engineering resources, than we do. additionally, as customers in these markets complete infrastructure deployments, they may require greater levels of service, support, and financing than we have provided in the past, especially in emerging countries. demand for these types of service, support, or financing contracts may increase in the future. there can be no assurance that we can provide products, service, support, and financing to effectively compete for these market opportunities.
further, provision of greater levels of services, support and financing by us may result in a delay in the timing of revenue recognition. in addition, entry into other markets has subjected and will subject us to additional risks, particularly to those markets, including the effects of general market conditions and reduced consumer confidence. for example, as we add direct selling capabilities globally to meet changing customer demands, we will face increased legal and regulatory requirements.
industry consolidation may lead to increased competition and may harm our operating results there has been a trend toward industry consolidation in our markets for several years. we expect this trend to continue as companies attempt to strengthen or hold their market positions in an evolving industry and as companies are acquired or are unable to continue operations. for example, some of our current and potential competitors for enterprise data center business have made acquisitions, or announced new strategic alliances, designed to position them with the ability to provide end-to-end technology solutions for the enterprise data center. companies that are strategic alliance partners in some areas of our business may acquire or form alliances with our competitors, thereby reducing their business with us. we believe that industry consolidation may result in stronger competitors that are better able to compete as sole-source vendors for customers. this could lead to more variability in our operating results and could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, and financial condition. furthermore, particularly in the service provider market, rapid consolidation will lead to fewer customers, with the effect that loss of a major customer could have a material impact on results not anticipated in a customer marketplace composed of more numerous participants.
product quality problems could lead to reduced revenue, gross margins, and net income we produce highly complex products that incorporate leading-edge technology, including both hardware and software. software typically contains bugs that can unexpectedly interfere with expected operations. there can be no assurance that our pre-shipment testing programs will be adequate to detect all defects, either ones in individual products or ones that could affect numerous shipments, which might interfere with customer satisfaction, reduce sales opportunities, or affect gross margins. from time to time, we have had to replace certain components and provide remediation in response to the discovery of defects or bugs in products that we had shipped. there can be no assurance that such remediation, depending on the product involved, would not have a material impact. an inability to cure a product defect could result in the failure of a product line, temporary or permanent withdrawal from a product or market, damage to our reputation, inventory costs, or product reengineering expenses, any of which could have a material impact on our revenue, margins, and net income. for example, in the second quarter of fiscal 2014, we recorded a pre-tax charge of $655 million related to the expected remediation costs for certain products sold in prior fiscal years containing memory components manufactured by a single supplier between 2005 and 2010.
due to the global nature of our operations, political or economic changes or other factors in a specific country or region could harm our operating results and financial condition we conduct significant sales and customer support operations in countries around the world. as such, our growth depends in part on our increasing sales into emerging countries. we also depend on non-u.s. operations of our contract manufacturers, component suppliers and distribution partners. although sales in several of our emerging countries decreased in recent periods, including in fiscal 2014, several of our emerging countries generally have been relatively fast growing, and we have announced plans to expand our commitments and expectations in certain of those countries. we expect that the weakness we experienced in recent periods in several emerging countries will continue for at least several quarters. our future results could be materially adversely affected by a variety of political, economic or other factors relating to our operations inside and outside the united states, including impacts from the u.s. federal budget including the effect of the sequestration beginning in 2013; global central bank monetary policy; issues related to the political relationship between the united states and other countries which can affect the willingness of customers in those countries to purchase products from companies headquartered in the united states; and the challenging and inconsistent global macroeconomic environment, any or all of which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition, including, among others, the following:
•   foreign currency exchange rates
•   political or social unrest
•   economic instability or weakness or natural disasters in a specific country or region; environmental and trade protection measures and other legal and regulatory requirements, some of which may affect our ability to import our products, to export our products from, or sell our products in various countries
•   political considerations that affect service provider and government spending patterns
•   health or similar issues, such as a pandemic or epidemic
•   adverse tax consequences, including imposition of withholding or other taxes on our global operations we are exposed to the credit risk of some of our customers and to credit exposures in weakened markets, which could result in material losses most of our sales are on an open credit basis, with typical payment terms of 30 days in the united states and, because of local customs or conditions, longer in some markets outside the united states. we monitor individual customer payment capability in granting such open credit arrangements, seek to limit such open credit to amounts we believe the customers can pay, and maintain reserves we believe are adequate to cover exposure for doubtful accounts. beyond our open credit arrangements, we have also experienced demands for customer financing and facilitation of leasing arrangements. we expect demand for customer financing to continue, and recently we have been experiencing an increase in this demand as the credit markets have been impacted by the challenging and inconsistent global macroeconomic environment, including increased demand from customers in certain emerging countries.
we believe customer financing is a competitive factor in obtaining business, particularly in serving customers involved in significant infrastructure projects. our loan financing arrangements may include not only financing the acquisition of our products and services but also providing additional funds for other costs associated with network installation and integration of our products and services.
our exposure to the credit risks relating to our financing activities described above may increase if our customers are adversely affected by a global economic downturn or periods of economic uncertainty. although we have programs in place that are designed to monitor and mitigate the associated risk, including monitoring of particular risks in certain geographic areas, there can be no assurance that such programs will be effective in reducing our credit risks.
in the past, there have been significant bankruptcies among customers both on open credit and with loan or lease financing arrangements, particularly among internet businesses and service providers, causing us to incur economic or financial losses. there can be no assurance that additional losses will not be incurred. although these losses have not been material to date, future losses, if incurred, could harm our business and have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition. a portion of our sales is derived through our distributors. these distributors are generally given business terms that allow them to return a portion of inventory, receive credits for changes in selling prices, and participate in various cooperative marketing programs. we maintain estimated accruals and allowances for such business terms. however, distributors tend to have more limited financial resources than other resellers and end-user customers and therefore represent potential sources of increased credit risk, because they may be more likely to lack the reserve resources to meet payment obligations. additionally, to the degree that turmoil in the credit markets makes it more difficult for some customers to obtain financing, those customers' ability to pay could be adversely impacted, which in turn could have a material adverse impact on our business, operating results, and financial condition.
we are exposed to fluctuations in the market values of our portfolio investments and in interest rates; impairment of our investments could harm our earnings we maintain an investment portfolio of various holdings, types, and maturities. these securities are generally classified as available-for-sale and, consequently, are recorded on our consolidated balance sheets at fair value with unrealized gains or losses reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income, net of tax. our portfolio includes fixed income securities and equity investments in publicly traded companies, the values of which are subject to market price volatility to the extent unhedged. if such investments suffer market price declines, as we experienced with some of our investments in the past, we may recognize in earnings the decline in the fair value of our investments below their cost basis when the decline is judged to be other than temporary. for information regarding the sensitivity of and risks associated with the market value of portfolio investments and interest rates, refer to the section titled "quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk." our investments in private companies are subject to risk of loss of investment capital. these investments are inherently risky because the markets for the technologies or products they have under development are typically in the early stages and may never materialize. we could lose our entire investment in these companies.
we are exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates that could negatively impact our financial results and cash flows because a significant portion of our business is conducted outside the united states, we face exposure to adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates. these exposures may change over time as business practices evolve, and they could have a material adverse impact on our financial results and cash flows. historically, our primary exposures have related to nondollar-denominated sales in japan, canada, and australia and certain nondollar-denominated operating expenses and service cost of sales in europe, latin america, and asia, where we sell primarily in u.s. dollars. additionally, we have exposures to emerging market currencies, which can have extreme currency volatility. an increase in the value of the dollar could increase the real cost to our customers of our products in those markets outside the united states where we sell in dollars, and a weakened dollar could increase the cost of local operating expenses and procurement of raw materials to the extent that we must purchase components in foreign currencies.
currently, we enter into foreign exchange forward contracts and options to reduce the short-term impact of foreign currency fluctuations on certain foreign currency receivables, investments, and payables. in addition, we periodically hedge anticipated foreign currency cash flows. our attempts to hedge against these risks may result in an adverse impact on our net income.
our proprietary rights may prove difficult to enforce we generally rely on patents, copyrights, trademarks, and trade secret laws to establish and maintain proprietary rights in our technology and products. although we have been issued numerous patents and other patent applications are currently pending, there can be no assurance that any of these patents or other proprietary rights will not be challenged, invalidated, or circumvented or that our rights will, in fact, provide competitive advantages to us. furthermore, many key aspects of networking technology are governed by industrywide standards, which are usable by all market entrants. in addition, there can be no assurance that patents will be issued from pending applications or that claims allowed on any patents will be sufficiently broad to protect our technology. in addition, the laws of some foreign countries may not protect our proprietary rights to the same extent as do the laws of the
united states. the outcome of any actions taken in these foreign countries may be different than if such actions were determined under the laws of the united states. although we are not dependent on any individual patents or group of patents for particular segments of the business for which we compete, if we are unable to protect our proprietary rights to the totality of the features (including aspects of products protected other than by patent rights) in a market, we may find ourselves at a competitive disadvantage to others who need not incur the substantial expense, time, and effort required to create innovative products that have enabled us to be successful.
we may be found to infringe on intellectual property rights of others third parties, including customers, have in the past and may in the future assert claims or initiate litigation related to exclusive patent, copyright, trademark, and other intellectual property rights to technologies and related standards that are relevant to us. these assertions have increased over time as a result of our growth and the general increase in the pace of patent claims assertions, particularly in the united states. because of the existence of a large number of patents in the networking field, the secrecy of some pending patents, and the rapid rate of issuance of new patents, it is not economically practical or even possible to determine in advance whether a product or any of its components infringes or will infringe on the patent rights of others. the asserted claims and/or initiated litigation can include claims against us or our manufacturers, suppliers, or customers, alleging infringement of their proprietary rights with respect to our existing or future products or components of those products. regardless of the merit of these claims, they can be time-consuming, result in costly litigation and diversion of technical and management personnel, or require us to develop a non-infringing technology or enter into license agreements. where claims are made by customers, resistance even to unmeritorious claims could damage customer relationships. there can be no assurance that licenses will be available on acceptable terms and conditions, if at all, or that our indemnification by our suppliers will be adequate to cover our costs if a claim were brought directly against us or our customers. furthermore, because of the potential for high court awards that are not necessarily predictable, it is not unusual to find even arguably unmeritorious claims settled for significant amounts. if any infringement or other intellectual property claim made against us by any third party is successful, if we are required to indemnify a customer with respect to a claim against the customer, or if we fail to develop non-infringing technology or license the proprietary rights on commercially reasonable terms and conditions, our business, operating results, and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected. for additional information regarding our indemnification obligations, see note 12(g) to the consolidated financial statements contained in this report.
our exposure to risks associated with the use of intellectual property may be increased as a result of acquisitions, as we have a lower level of visibility into the development process with respect to such technology or the care taken to safeguard against infringement risks. further, in the past, third parties have made infringement and similar claims after we have acquired technology that had not been asserted prior to our acquisition.
we rely on the availability of third-party licenses many of our products are designed to include software or other intellectual property licensed from third parties. it may be necessary in the future to seek or renew licenses relating to various aspects of these products. there can be no assurance that the necessary licenses would be available on acceptable terms, if at all. the inability to obtain certain licenses or other rights or to obtain such licenses or rights on favorable terms, or the need to engage in litigation regarding these matters, could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, and financial condition. moreover, the inclusion in our products of software or other intellectual property licensed from third parties on a nonexclusive basis could limit our ability to protect our proprietary rights in our products.
our operating results may be adversely affected and damage to our reputation may occur due to production and sale of counterfeit versions of our products as is the case with leading products around the world, our products are subject to efforts by third parties to produce counterfeit versions of our products. while we work diligently with law enforcement authorities in various countries to block the manufacture of counterfeit goods and to interdict their sale, and to detect counterfeit products in customer networks, and have succeeded in prosecuting counterfeiters and their distributors, resulting in fines, imprisonment and restitution to us, there can be no guarantee that such efforts will succeed. while counterfeiters often aim their sales at customers who might not have otherwise purchased our products due to lack of verifiability of origin and service, such counterfeit sales, to the extent they replace otherwise legitimate sales, could adversely affect our operating results.
our operating results and future prospects could be materially harmed by uncertainties of regulation of the internet currently, few laws or regulations apply directly to access or commerce on the internet. we could be materially adversely affected by regulation of the internet and internet commerce in any country where we operate. such regulations could include matters such as voice over the internet or using ip, encryption technology, sales or other taxes on internet product or service sales, and access charges for internet service providers. the adoption of regulation of the internet and internet commerce could decrease demand
for our products and, at the same time, increase the cost of selling our products, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, and financial condition.
changes in telecommunications regulation and tariffs could harm our prospects and future sales changes in telecommunications requirements, or regulatory requirements in other industries in which we operate, in the united states or other countries could affect the sales of our products. in particular, we believe that there may be future changes in u.s. telecommunications regulations that could slow the expansion of the service providers' network infrastructures and materially adversely affect our business, operating results, and financial condition.
future changes in tariffs by regulatory agencies or application of tariff requirements to currently untariffed services could affect the sales of our products for certain classes of customers. additionally, in the united states, our products must comply with various requirements and regulations of the federal communications commission and other regulatory authorities. in countries outside of the united states, our products must meet various requirements of local telecommunications and other industry authorities. changes in tariffs or failure by us to obtain timely approval of products could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, and financial condition.
failure to retain and recruit key personnel would harm our ability to meet key objectives our success has always depended in large part on our ability to attract and retain highly skilled technical, managerial, sales, and marketing personnel. competition for these personnel is intense, especially in the silicon valley area of northern california. stock incentive plans are designed to reward employees for their long-term contributions and provide incentives for them to remain with us. volatility or lack of positive performance in our stock price or equity incentive awards, or changes to our overall compensation program, including our stock incentive program, resulting from the management of share dilution and share-based compensation expense or otherwise, may also adversely affect our ability to retain key employees. as a result of one or more of these factors, we may increase our hiring in geographic areas outside the united states, which could subject us to additional geopolitical and exchange rate risk. the loss of services of any of our key personnel; the inability to retain and attract qualified personnel in the future; or delays in hiring required personnel, particularly engineering and sales personnel, could make it difficult to meet key objectives, such as timely and effective product introductions. in addition, companies in our industry whose employees accept positions with competitors frequently claim that competitors have engaged in improper hiring practices. we have received these claims in the past and may receive additional claims to this effect in the future.
adverse resolution of litigation or governmental investigations may harm our operating results or financial condition we are a party to lawsuits in the normal course of our business. litigation can be expensive, lengthy, and disruptive to normal business operations. moreover, the results of complex legal proceedings are difficult to predict. for example, brazilian authorities have investigated our brazilian subsidiary and certain of its current and former employees, as well as a brazilian importer of our products, and its affiliates and employees, relating to alleged evasion of import taxes and alleged improper transactions involving the subsidiary and the importer. brazilian tax authorities have assessed claims against our brazilian subsidiary based on a theory of joint liability with the brazilian importer for import taxes, interest, and penalties. in the first quarter of fiscal 2013, the brazilian federal tax authorities asserted an additional claim against our brazilian subsidiary based on a theory of joint liability with respect to an alleged underpayment of income taxes, social taxes, interest, and penalties by a brazilian distributor. the asserted claims by brazilian federal tax authorities are for calendar years 2003 through 2008 and the related asserted claims by the tax authorities from the state of sao paulo are for calendar years 2005 through 2007. the total asserted claims by brazilian state and federal tax authorities aggregate to approximately $389 million for the alleged evasion of import and other taxes, approximately $1.3 billion for interest, and approximately $1.7 billion for various penalties, all determined using an exchange rate as of july 26, 2014. we have completed a thorough review of the matters and believe the asserted claims against our brazilian subsidiary are without merit, and we are defending the claims vigorously. while we believe there is no legal basis for the alleged liability, due to the complexities and uncertainty surrounding the judicial process in brazil and the nature of the claims asserting joint liability with the importer, we are unable to determine the likelihood of an unfavorable outcome against our brazilian subsidiary and are unable to reasonably estimate a range of loss, if any. we do not expect a final judicial determination for several years. an unfavorable resolution of lawsuits or governmental investigations could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, or financial condition. for additional information regarding certain of the matters in which we are involved, see item 3, "legal proceedings," contained in part i of this report.
changes in our provision for income taxes or adverse outcomes resulting from examination of our income tax returns could adversely affect our results our provision for income taxes is subject to volatility and could be adversely affected by earnings being lower than anticipated in countries that have lower tax rates and higher than anticipated in countries that have higher tax rates; by changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities; by expiration of or lapses in the r&d tax credit or domestic manufacturing deduction laws; by expiration of or lapses in tax incentives; by transfer pricing adjustments, including the effect of acquisitions on our intercompany r&d cost sharing arrangement and legal structure; by tax effects of nondeductible compensation; by tax costs related to intercompany realignments; by changes in accounting principles; or by changes in tax laws and regulations, treaties, or interpretations thereof, including possible changes to the taxation of earnings of our foreign subsidiaries, the deductibility of expenses attributable to foreign income, or the foreign tax credit rules. significant judgment is required to determine the recognition and measurement attribute prescribed in the accounting guidance for uncertainty in income taxes. the organisation for economic co-operation and development (oecd), an international association of 34 countries including the united states, is contemplating changes to numerous long-standing tax principles. these contemplated changes, if finalized and adopted by countries, will increase tax uncertainty and may adversely affect our provision for income taxes. further, as a result of certain of our ongoing employment and capital investment actions and commitments, our income in certain countries is subject to reduced tax rates and in some cases is wholly exempt from tax. our failure to meet these commitments could adversely impact our provision for income taxes. in addition, we are subject to the continuous examination of our income tax returns by the internal revenue service and other tax authorities. we regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes. there can be no assurance that the outcomes from these continuous examinations will not have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition.
our business and operations are especially subject to the risks of earthquakes, floods, and other natural catastrophic events our corporate headquarters, including certain of our research and development operations are located in the silicon valley area of northern california, a region known for seismic activity. additionally, a certain number of our facilities are located near rivers that have experienced flooding in the past. also certain of our suppliers and logistics centers are located in regions that have or may be affected by earthquake, tsunami and flooding activity which in the past has disrupted, and in the future could disrupt, the flow of components and delivery of products. a significant natural disaster, such as an earthquake, a hurricane, volcano, or a flood, could have a material adverse impact on our business, operating results, and financial condition.
man-made problems such as computer viruses or terrorism may disrupt our operations and harm our operating results despite our implementation of network security measures our servers are vulnerable to computer viruses, break-ins, and similar disruptions from unauthorized tampering with our computer systems. any such event could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, and financial condition. efforts to limit the ability of malicious third parties to disrupt the operations of the internet or undermine our own security efforts may meet with resistance. in addition, the continued threat of terrorism and heightened security and military action in response to this threat, or any future acts of terrorism, may cause further disruptions to the economies of the united states and other countries and create further uncertainties or otherwise materially harm our business, operating results, and financial condition. likewise, events such as widespread blackouts could have similar negative impacts. to the extent that such disruptions or uncertainties result in delays or cancellations of customer orders or the manufacture or shipment of our products, our business, operating results, and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected.
if we do not successfully manage our strategic alliances, we may not realize the expected benefits from such alliances and we may experience increased competition or delays in product development we have several strategic alliances with large and complex organizations and other companies with which we work to offer complementary products and services and have established a joint venture to market services associated with our cisco unified computing system products. these arrangements are generally limited to specific projects, the goal of which is generally to facilitate product compatibility and adoption of industry standards. there can be no assurance we will realize the expected benefits from these strategic alliances or from the joint venture. if successful, these relationships may be mutually beneficial and result in industry growth. however, alliances carry an element of risk because, in most cases, we must compete in some business areas with a company with which we have a strategic alliance and, at the same time, cooperate with that company in other business areas. also, if these companies fail to perform or if these relationships fail to materialize as expected, we could suffer delays in product development or other operational difficulties. joint ventures can be difficult to manage, given the potentially different interests of joint venture partners.
our stock price may be volatile historically, our common stock has experienced substantial price volatility, particularly as a result of variations between our actual financial results and the published expectations of analysts and as a result of announcements by our competitors and us. furthermore, speculation in the press or investment community about our strategic position, financial condition, results of operations, business, security of our products, or significant transactions can cause changes in our stock price. in addition, the stock market has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have affected the market price of many technology companies, in particular, and that have often been unrelated to the operating performance of these companies. these factors, as well as general economic and political conditions and the announcement of proposed and completed acquisitions or other significant transactions, or any difficulties associated with such transactions, by us or our current or potential competitors, may materially adversely affect the market price of our common stock in the future. additionally, volatility, lack of positive performance in our stock price or changes to our overall compensation program, including our stock incentive program, may adversely affect our ability to retain key employees, virtually all of whom are compensated, in part, based on the performance of our stock price.
there can be no assurance that our operating results and financial condition will not be adversely affected by our incurrence of debt we have senior unsecured notes outstanding in an aggregate principal amount of $20.8 billion that mature at specific dates from calendar year 2014 through 2040. we have also established a commercial paper program under which we may issue short-term, unsecured commercial paper notes on a private placement basis up to a maximum aggregate amount outstanding at any time of $3.0 billion, and we had no commercial paper notes outstanding under this program as of july 26, 2014.  the outstanding senior unsecured notes bear fixed-rate interest payable semiannually, except $2.35 billion of the notes which bears interest at a floating rate payable quarterly. the fair value of the long-term debt is subject to market interest rate volatility. the instruments governing the senior unsecured notes contain certain covenants applicable to us and our wholly-owned subsidiaries that may adversely affect our ability to incur certain liens or engage in certain types of sale and leaseback transactions. in addition, we will be required to have available in the united states sufficient cash to service the interest on our debt and repay all of our notes on maturity. there can be no assurance that our incurrence of this debt or any future debt will be a better means of providing liquidity to us than would our use of our existing cash resources, including cash currently held offshore. further, we cannot be assured that our maintenance of this indebtedness or incurrence of future indebtedness will not adversely affect our operating results or financial condition. in addition, changes by any rating agency to our credit rating can negatively impact the value and liquidity of both our debt and equity securities, as well as the terms upon which we may borrow under our commercial paper program or future debt issuances.
item 7.   management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations forward-looking statements this annual report on form 10-k, including this management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations, contains forward-looking statements regarding future events and our future results that are subject to the safe harbors created under the securities act of 1933 (the "securities act") and the securities exchange act of 1934 (the "exchange act"). all statements other than statements of historical facts are statements that could be deemed forward-looking statements. these statements are based on current expectations, estimates, forecasts, and projections about the industries in which we operate and the beliefs and assumptions of our management. words such as "expects," "anticipates," "targets," "goals," "projects," "intends," "plans," "believes," "seeks," "estimates," "continues," "endeavors," "strives," "may," variations of such words, and similar expressions are intended to identify such forward-looking statements. in addition, any statements that refer to projections of our future financial performance, our anticipated growth and trends in our businesses, and other characterizations of future events or circumstances are forward-looking statements. readers are cautioned that these forward-looking statements are only predictions and are subject to risks, uncertainties, and assumptions that are difficult to predict, including those under "part i, item 1a. risk factors," and elsewhere herein. therefore, actual results may differ materially and adversely from those expressed in any forward-looking statements. we undertake no obligation to revise or update any forward-looking statements for any reason.
overview we design, manufacture, and sell internet protocol (ip) based networking products and services related to the communications and information technology (it) industry. our customers include businesses of all sizes, public institutions, telecommunications companies, other service providers and individuals. we connect people, process, data and things with products that transport data, voice, and video within buildings, across campuses, and around the world. we are a key strategic partner to companies that helps them as they seek to make the most of the internet of everything (ioe) and connect the unconnected.

fiscal 2014 compared with fiscal 2013-financial performance total revenue decreased by 3% as compared with fiscal 2013. within the total revenue change, product revenue decreased 5% and service revenue increased 4%. total gross margin decreased by 1.7 percentage points, driven by unfavorable impacts from pricing and mix partially offset by productivity improvements and also due to the $655 million charge to product cost of sales recorded in fiscal 2014 related to the expected cost of remediation of issues with memory components in certain products sold in prior fiscal years. despite a slight year-over-year decline in absolute dollars, research and development, sales and marketing, and general and administrative expenses, collectively, increased by 1.1 percentage points as a percentage of revenue due to the decline in revenue. operating income as a percentage of revenue decreased by 3.2 percentage points. diluted earnings per share decreased by 20% from the prior year, driven by a 21% decrease in net income. the decrease in net income in fiscal 2014 compared with fiscal 2013 was also attributable to net tax benefits in fiscal 2013 related to a settlement with the irs and reinstatement of the u.s. federal r&d tax credit.
fiscal 2014 compared with fiscal 2013-business summary in fiscal 2014, revenue decreased by $1.5 billion as compared with fiscal 2013. revenue from the americas decreased by $0.9 billion, driven by lower product revenue in most countries in this segment including the united states. while we experienced relative stability across europe, emea revenue decreased $0.2 billion, led by product revenue declines in russia as well as various other countries in this segment. revenue in our apjc segment decreased $0.4 billion, led by product revenue declines in japan and india. the weakness we encountered in emerging countries throughout the world in the later part of fiscal 2013 continued during fiscal 2014. the emerging countries of brazil, russia, india, china, and mexico ("bricm"), in the aggregate, experienced an 11% product revenue decline, with declines across all of our customer markets. we believe that the product revenue declines in many of these emerging countries were driven by the impact of economic and geopolitical challenges in these countries. while we saw some improvement in our business momentum in emerging countries in the second and third quarters of fiscal 2014, we experienced a decline in our business momentum in these countries during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014.
in fiscal 2014, product revenue declined across all customer markets, with the most significant decline in the service provider market. within the service provider market, the largest impacts came from the continued product revenue decline in our service provider video category and the ongoing decline of product revenue in the emerging countries.
from a product category perspective, the product revenue decrease of 5% year-over-year was driven in large part by the lower product revenue within our core routing and switching product categories. while we saw improvement in business momentum with respect to high-end routers during the second half of fiscal 2014, there was only a limited revenue contribution related to some of our recently introduced products, as product transitions in this area are still in their early stages. the effects of these product transitions, combined with other challenges, led to a decrease in ngn routing revenue of 7%. we also experienced a 5% decrease in revenue from our switching products. the other major product categories experienced revenue changes ranging from an 18% decrease in service provider video to a 27% increase in data center. the decrease in revenue from our service provider video products was driven largely by a decrease in revenue from sales of set-top boxes. partially offsetting the decline in product revenue was an increase in service revenue. service revenue increased by 4%, reflecting continued slower growth compared with prior years, which we believe was attributable to the impact of the declines in product revenue in recent periods.
as we continue to focus on investing in growth, innovation, and talent, while managing costs and driving efficiencies, we announced a restructuring plan that will impact up to 6,000 employees, representing approximately 8% of our global workforce. we expect to reinvest substantially all of the cost savings from the restructuring actions in our key growth areas such as data center, software, security, and cloud.
in summary, while we saw some improved business momentum in the second half of fiscal 2014, we experienced many challenges during fiscal 2014 including reduced spending by our service provider customers, weakness in emerging countries, the impact of product transitions, and a conservative approach to it-related capital spending by customers. we expect that the challenges in the emerging countries, the service provider customer market, and product transitions in switching and ngn routing may continue for at least the next several quarters.
fourth quarter snapshot for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014, as compared with the corresponding period in fiscal 2013, total revenue was flat. within the total revenue change, product revenue declined by 2% and service revenue increased by 5%. with regard to our geographic segment performance, on a year-over-year basis, revenue in the americas and in emea both decreased by 1% while we experienced a slight increase by 1% in our apjc segment. total gross margin increased by 0.7 percentage points, primarily due to the tivo patent litigation settlement in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013. as a percentage of revenue, research and development, sales and marketing, and general and administrative expenses collectively increased by 1.0 percentage points. operating income as a percentage of revenue decreased by 1.0 percentage points, primarily as a result of higher restructuring and other charges, and also the impact of our revenue decrease. diluted earnings per share increased by 2% from the prior year, primarily as a result of a decrease in our diluted share count.
strategy and focus areas our strategy is to deliver the integrated architectures, solutions, and outcomes to help our customers grow, manage costs, and mitigate risk. we see our customers, in almost every industry, becoming increasingly reliant on technology-and specifically the network-to meet their business objectives and compete successfully in the market.
our focus continues to be on capitalizing on market transitions to maintain leadership in our core markets and to enter new markets where the network is foundational. we believe this focus best positions us to become a more relevant and trusted partner to our customers and to expand our share of our customers' it spending. we are focused on driving the innovation, speed, agility, and efficiencies in our company required to deliver leading technology solutions for our customers and shareholder value for our investors.
over the last few years, we have been working to transform our business to move from selling individual products and services to selling products and services integrated into architectures and solutions, as well as to meet customers' business outcomes. as a part of this transformation, we are making changes to how we are organized and how we deliver our technology. we believe these changes enable us to better meet our customers' requirements and help them stay ahead of market transitions.

other key financial measures the following is a summary of our other key financial measures for fiscal 2014 compared with fiscal 2013 (in millions, except days sales outstanding in accounts receivable (dso) and annualized inventory turns):
cash provided by operating activities                           $12,332            $12,894
repurchases of common stock-stock repurchase program             $9,539             $2,773
our product backlog at the end of fiscal 2014 was $5.4 billion, or 12% of fiscal 2014 total revenue, compared with $4.9 billion at the end of fiscal 2013, or 10% of fiscal 2013 total revenue.
critical accounting estimates the preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires us to make judgments, assumptions, and estimates that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. note 2 to the consolidated financial statements describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements. the accounting policies described below are significantly affected by critical accounting estimates. such accounting policies require significant judgments, assumptions, and estimates used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements, and actual results could differ materially from the amounts reported based on these policies.
revenue recognition revenue is recognized when all of the following criteria have been met:
•   persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists. contracts, internet commerce agreements, and customer purchase orders are generally used to determine the existence of an arrangement.
•   delivery has occurred. shipping documents and customer acceptance, when applicable, are used to verify delivery.
•   the fee is fixed or determinable. we assess whether the fee is fixed or determinable based on the payment terms associated with the transaction and whether the sales price is subject to refund or adjustment.
•   collectibility is reasonably assured. we assess collectibility based primarily on the creditworthiness of the customer as determined by credit checks and analysis, as well as the customer's payment history.
in instances where final acceptance of the product, system, or solution is specified by the customer, revenue is deferred until all acceptance criteria have been met. when a sale involves multiple deliverables, such as sales of products that include services, the multiple deliverables are evaluated to determine the unit of accounting, and the entire fee from the arrangement is allocated to each unit of accounting based on the relative selling price. revenue is recognized when the revenue recognition criteria for each unit of accounting are met. for hosting arrangements, we recognize subscription revenue ratably over the subscription period, while usage revenue is recognized based on utilization. software subscription revenue is deferred and recognized ratably over the subscription term upon delivery of the first product and commencement of the term.
the amount of product and service revenue recognized in a given period is affected by our judgment as to whether an arrangement includes multiple deliverables and, if so, our valuation of the units of accounting for multiple deliverables. according to the accounting guidance prescribed in accounting standards codification (asc) 605, revenue recognition, we use vendor-specific objective evidence of selling price (vsoe) for each of those units, when available. we determine vsoe based on our normal pricing and discounting practices for the specific product or service when sold separately. in determining vsoe, we require that a substantial majority of the historical standalone transactions have the selling prices for a product or service fall within a reasonably narrow pricing range, generally evidenced by approximately 80% of such historical standalone transactions falling within plus or minus 15% of the median rates. when vsoe does not exist, we apply the selling price hierarchy to applicable multiple-deliverable arrangements. under the selling price hierarchy, third-party evidence of selling price (tpe) will be considered if vsoe does not exist, and estimated selling price (esp) will be used if neither vsoe nor tpe is available. generally, we are not able to determine tpe because our go-to-market strategy differs from that of others in our markets, and the extent of our proprietary technology varies among comparable products or services from those of our peers. in determining esp, we apply significant judgment as we weigh a variety of factors, based on the facts and circumstances of the arrangement. we typically arrive at an esp for a product or service that is not sold separately by considering company-specific factors such as geographies, competitive landscape, internal costs, profitability objectives, pricing practices used to establish bundled pricing, and existing portfolio pricing and discounting.
some of our sales arrangements have multiple deliverables containing software and related software support components. such sales arrangements are subject to the accounting guidance in asc 985-605, software-revenue recognition.
as our business and offerings evolve over time, our pricing practices may be required to be modified accordingly, which could result in changes in selling prices, including both vsoe and esp, in subsequent periods. there were no material impacts during fiscal 2014, nor do we currently expect a material impact in the next 12 months on our revenue recognition due to any changes in our vsoe, tpe, or esp.
revenue deferrals relate to the timing of revenue recognition for specific transactions based on financing arrangements, service, support, and other factors. financing arrangements may include sales-type, direct-financing, and operating leases, loans, and guarantees of third-party financing. our deferred revenue for products was $4.5 billion and $4.0 billion as of july 26, 2014 and july 27, 2013, respectively. technical support services revenue is deferred and recognized ratably over the period during which the services are to be performed, which typically is from one to three years. advanced services revenue is recognized upon delivery or completion of performance. our deferred revenue for services was $9.6 billion and $9.4 billion as of july 26, 2014 and july 27, 2013, respectively.
we make sales to distributors which we refer to as two-tier systems of sales to the end customer. revenue from distributors is recognized based on a sell-through method using information provided by them. our distributors participate in various cooperative marketing and other programs, and we maintain estimated accruals and allowances for these programs. if actual credits received by our distributors under these programs were to deviate significantly from our estimates, which are based on historical experience, our revenue could be adversely affected.
percentage of gross accounts receivable                       4.9   %                   4.0   %
percentage of gross lease receivables                         6.2   %                   6.3   %
percentage of gross loan receivables                          5.8   %                   5.2   %
the allowance for doubtful accounts is based on our assessment of the collectibility of customer accounts. we regularly review the adequacy of these allowances by considering internal factors such as historical experience, credit quality and age of the receivable balances as well as external factors such as economic conditions that may affect a customer's ability to pay and expected default frequency rates, which are published by major third-party credit-rating agencies and are generally updated on a quarterly basis. we also consider the concentration of receivables outstanding with a particular customer in assessing the adequacy of our allowances for doubtful accounts. if a major customer's creditworthiness deteriorates, if actual defaults are higher than our historical experience, or if other circumstances arise, our estimates of the recoverability of amounts due to us could be overstated, and additional allowances could be required, which could have an adverse impact on our operating results.
the allowance for credit loss on financing receivables is also based on the assessment of collectibility of customer accounts. we regularly review the adequacy of the credit allowances determined either on an individual or a collective basis. when evaluating the financing receivables on an individual basis, we consider historical experience, credit quality and age of receivable balances, and economic conditions that may affect a customer's ability to pay. when evaluating financing receivables on a collective basis, we use expected default frequency rates published by a major third-party credit-rating agency as well as our own historical loss rate in the event of default, while also systematically giving effect to economic conditions, concentration of risk and correlation. determining expected default frequency rates and loss factors associated with internal credit risk ratings, as well as assessing factors such as economic conditions, concentration of risk, and correlation, are complex and subjective. our ongoing consideration of all these factors could result in an increase in our allowance for credit loss in the future, which could adversely affect our operating results. both accounts receivable and financing receivables are charged off at the point when they are considered uncollectible.
a reserve for future sales returns is established based on historical trends in product return rates. the reserve for future sales returns as of july 26, 2014 and july 27, 2013 was $135 million and $119 million, respectively, and was recorded as a reduction of our accounts receivable. if the actual future returns were to deviate from the historical data on which the reserve had been established, our revenue could be adversely affected.
inventory valuation and liability for purchase commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers our inventory balance was $1.6 billion and $1.5 billion as of july 26, 2014 and july 27, 2013, respectively. inventory is written down based on excess and obsolete inventories, determined primarily by future demand forecasts. inventory write-downs are measured as the difference between the cost of the inventory and market, based upon assumptions about future demand, and are charged to the provision for inventory, which is a component of our cost of sales. at the point of the loss recognition, a new, lower cost basis for that inventory is established, and subsequent changes in facts and circumstances do not result in the restoration or increase in that newly established cost basis.
we record a liability for firm, noncancelable, and unconditional purchase commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers for quantities in excess of our future demand forecasts consistent with the valuation of our excess and obsolete inventory. as of july 26, 2014, the liability for these purchase commitments was $162 million, compared with $172 million as of july 27, 2013, and was included in other current liabilities.
our provision for inventory was $67 million, $114 million, and $115 million for fiscal 2014, 2013, and 2012, respectively. the provision for the liability related to purchase commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers was $124 million, $106 million, and $151 million in fiscal 2014, 2013, and 2012, respectively. if there were to be a sudden and significant decrease in demand for our products, or if there were a higher incidence of inventory obsolescence because of rapidly changing technology and customer requirements, we could be required to increase our inventory write-downs, and our liability for purchase commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers, and accordingly our profitability, could be adversely affected. we regularly evaluate our exposure for inventory write-downs and the adequacy of our liability for purchase commitments. inventory and supply chain management remain areas of focus as we balance the need to maintain supply chain flexibility to help ensure competitive lead times with the risk of inventory obsolescence, particularly in light of current macroeconomic uncertainties and conditions and the resulting potential for changes in future demand forecast.
loss contingencies and product warranties we are subject to the possibility of various losses arising in the ordinary course of business. we consider the likelihood of impairment of an asset or the incurrence of a liability, as well as our ability to reasonably estimate the amount of loss, in determining loss contingencies. an estimated loss contingency is accrued when it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. we regularly evaluate information available to us to determine whether such accruals should be made or adjusted and whether new accruals are required.
third parties, including customers, have in the past and may in the future assert claims or initiate litigation related to exclusive patent, copyright, trademark, and other intellectual property rights to technologies and related standards that are relevant to us. these assertions have increased over time as a result of our growth and the general increase in the pace of patent claims assertions, particularly in the united states. if any infringement or other intellectual property claim made against us by any third party is successful, or if we fail to develop non-infringing technology or license the proprietary rights on commercially reasonable terms and conditions, our business, operating results, and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected.
we have recorded a liability for the expected remediation cost for certain products sold in prior fiscal years containing memory components manufactured by a single supplier between 2005 and 2010. in february 2014, on the basis of the growing number of failures as described in note 12 (f) to the consolidated financial statements, we decided to expand our approach, which resulted in an additional charge to product cost of sales of $655 million being recorded for the second quarter of fiscal 2014. estimating this liability is complex and subjective, and if we experience changes in a number of underlying assumptions and estimates such as a change in claims compared with our expectations, or if the cost of servicing these claims is different than expected, our estimated liability may be impacted.
our liability for product warranties, included in other current liabilities, was $446 million as of july 26, 2014, compared with $402 million as of july 27, 2013. our products are generally covered by a warranty for periods ranging from 90 days to five years, and for some products we provide a limited lifetime warranty. we accrue for warranty costs as part of our cost of sales based on associated material costs, technical support labor costs, and associated overhead. material cost is estimated based primarily upon historical trends in the volume of product returns within the warranty period and the cost to repair or replace the equipment. technical support labor cost is estimated based primarily upon historical trends in the rate of customer cases and the cost to support the customer cases within the warranty period. overhead cost is applied based on estimated time to support warranty activities.
the provision for product warranties during fiscal 2014, 2013, and 2012 was $704 million, $649 million, and $617 million, respectively. if we experience an increase in warranty claims compared with our historical experience, or if the cost of servicing warranty claims is greater than expected, our profitability could be adversely affected.
fair value measurements our fixed income and publicly traded equity securities, collectively, are reflected in the consolidated balance sheets at a fair value of $45.3 billion as of july 26, 2014, compared with $42.7 billion as of july 27, 2013. our fixed income investment portfolio, as of july 26, 2014, consisted primarily of high quality investment-grade securities. see note 8 to the consolidated financial statements.
as described more fully in note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, a valuation hierarchy is based on the level of independent, objective evidence available regarding the value of the investments. it encompasses three classes of investments: level 1 consists of securities for which there are quoted prices in active markets for identical securities; level 2 consists of securities for which observable inputs other than level 1 inputs are used, such as quoted prices for similar securities in active markets or quoted prices for identical securities in less active markets and model-derived valuations for which the variables are derived from, or corroborated by, observable market data; and level 3 consists of securities for which there are unobservable inputs to the valuation methodology that are significant to the measurement of the fair value.
our level 2 securities are valued using quoted market prices for similar instruments or nonbinding market prices that are corroborated by observable market data. we use inputs such as actual trade data, benchmark yields, broker/dealer quotes, and other similar data, which are obtained from independent pricing vendors, quoted market prices, or other sources to determine the ultimate fair value of our assets and liabilities. we use such pricing data as the primary input, to which we have not made any material adjustments during fiscal 2014 and 2013, to make our assessments and determinations as to the ultimate valuation of our investment portfolio. we are ultimately responsible for the financial statements and underlying estimates.
the inputs and fair value are reviewed for reasonableness, may be further validated by comparison to publicly available information, and could be adjusted based on market indices or other information that management deems material to its estimate of fair value. the assessment of fair value can be difficult and subjective. however, given the relative reliability of the inputs we use to value our investment portfolio, and because substantially all of our valuation inputs are obtained using quoted market prices for similar or identical assets, we do not believe that the nature of estimates and assumptions affected by levels of subjectivity and judgment was material to the valuation of the investment portfolio as of july 26, 2014. level 3 assets do not represent a significant portion of our total assets measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of july 26, 2014.
other-than-temporary impairments we recognize an impairment charge when the declines in the fair values of our fixed income or publicly traded equity securities below their cost basis are judged to be other than temporary. the ultimate value realized on these securities, to the extent unhedged, is subject to market price volatility until they are sold.
if the fair value of a debt security is less than its amortized cost, we assess whether the impairment is other than temporary. an impairment is considered other than temporary if (i) we have the intent to sell the security, (ii) it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before recovery of its entire amortized cost basis, or (iii) we do not expect to recover the entire amortized cost of the security. if an impairment is considered other than temporary based on (i) or (ii) described in the prior sentence, the entire difference between the amortized cost and the fair value of the security is recognized in earnings. if an impairment is considered other than temporary based on condition (iii), the amount representing credit loss, defined as the difference between the present value of the cash flows expected to be collected and the amortized cost basis of the debt security, will be recognized in earnings, and the amount relating to all other factors will be recognized in other comprehensive income (oci). in estimating the amount and timing of cash flows expected to be collected, we consider all available information, including past events, current conditions, the remaining payment terms of the security, the financial condition of the issuer, expected defaults, and the value of underlying collateral.
for publicly traded equity securities, we consider various factors in determining whether we should recognize an impairment charge, including the length of time and extent to which the fair value has been less than our cost basis, the financial condition and near-term prospects of the issuer, and our intent and ability to hold the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in market value.
for fiscal 2014, impairment charges of $11 million on our investments in publicly traded equity securities were recognized in earnings, while there were no such impairment charges in fiscal 2013 and 2012. our ongoing consideration of all the factors described previously could result in additional impairment charges in the future, which could adversely affect our net income.
we also have investments in privately held companies, some of which are in the startup or development stages. as of july 26, 2014, our investments in privately held companies were $899 million, compared with $833 million as of july 27, 2013, and were included in other assets. we monitor these investments for events or circumstances indicative of potential impairment, and we make appropriate reductions in carrying values if we determine that an impairment charge is required, based primarily on the financial condition and near-term prospects of these companies. these investments are inherently risky because the markets for the technologies or products these companies are developing are typically in the early stages and may never materialize. our impairment charges on investments in privately held companies were $23 million, $33 million, and $23 million in fiscal 2014, 2013, and 2012, respectively.
goodwill and purchased intangible asset impairments our methodology for allocating the purchase price relating to purchase acquisitions is determined through established valuation techniques. goodwill represents a residual value as of the acquisition date, which in most cases results in measuring goodwill as an excess of the purchase consideration transferred plus the fair value of any noncontrolling interest in the acquired company over the fair value of net assets acquired, including contingent consideration. we perform goodwill impairment tests on an annual basis in the fourth fiscal quarter and between annual tests in certain circumstances for each reporting unit. the assessment of fair value for goodwill and purchased intangible assets is based on factors that market participants would use in an orderly transaction in accordance with the new accounting guidance for the fair value measurement of nonfinancial assets.
the goodwill recorded in the consolidated balance sheets as of july 26, 2014 and july 27, 2013 was $24.2 billion and $21.9 billion, respectively. the increase in goodwill for fiscal 2014 was due in large part to our acquisition of sourcefire, inc. in response to changes in industry and market conditions, we could be required to strategically realign our resources and consider restructuring, disposing of, or otherwise exiting businesses, which could result in an impairment of goodwill. there was no impairment of goodwill resulting from our annual impairment testing in fiscal 2014, 2013, and 2012. for the annual impairment testing in fiscal 2014, the excess of the fair value over the carrying value for each of our reporting units was $32.0 billion for the americas, $22.0 billion for emea, and $16.2 billion for apjc. during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014, we performed a sensitivity analysis for goodwill impairment with respect to each of our respective reporting units and determined that a hypothetical 10% decline in the fair value of each reporting unit would not result in an impairment of goodwill for any reporting unit.
we make judgments about the recoverability of purchased intangible assets with finite lives whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that an impairment may exist. recoverability of purchased intangible assets with finite lives is measured by comparing the carrying amount of the asset to the future undiscounted cash flows the asset is expected to generate. we review indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired. if the asset is considered to be impaired, the amount of any impairment is measured as the difference between the carrying value and the fair value of the impaired asset. assumptions and estimates about future values and remaining useful lives of our purchased intangible assets are complex and subjective. they can be affected by a variety of factors, including external factors such as industry and economic trends, and internal factors such as changes in our business strategy and our internal forecasts. there were no impairment charges related to purchased intangible assets during fiscal 2014 and fiscal 2013. our impairment charges related to purchased intangible assets were $12 million during fiscal 2012. our ongoing consideration of all the factors described previously could result in additional impairment charges in the future, which could adversely affect our net income.
income taxes we are subject to income taxes in the united states and numerous foreign jurisdictions. our effective tax rates differ from the statutory rate, primarily due to the tax impact of state taxes, foreign operations, r&d tax credits, domestic manufacturing deductions, tax audit settlements, nondeductible compensation, international realignments, and transfer pricing adjustments. our effective tax rate was 19.2%, 11.1%, and 20.8% in fiscal 2014, 2013, and 2012, respectively.
significant judgment is required in evaluating our uncertain tax positions and determining our provision for income taxes. although we believe our reserves are reasonable, no assurance can be given that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be different from that which is reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals. we adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the closing of a tax audit or the refinement of an estimate. to the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters is different than the amounts recorded, such differences will impact the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made. the provision for income taxes includes the impact of reserve provisions and changes to reserves that are considered appropriate, as well as the related net interest and penalties.
significant judgment is also required in determining any valuation allowance recorded against deferred tax assets. in assessing the need for a valuation allowance, we consider all available evidence, including past operating results, estimates of future taxable income, and the feasibility of tax planning strategies. in the event that we change our determination as to the amount of deferred tax assets that can be realized, we will adjust our valuation allowance with a corresponding impact to the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made.
our provision for income taxes is subject to volatility and could be adversely impacted by earnings being lower than anticipated in countries that have lower tax rates and higher than anticipated in countries that have higher tax rates; by changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities; by expiration of or lapses in the r&d tax credit or domestic manufacturing deduction laws; by expiration of or lapses in tax incentives; by transfer pricing adjustments, including the effect of acquisitions on our intercompany r&d cost-sharing arrangement and legal structure; by tax effects of nondeductible compensation; by tax costs related to intercompany realignments; by changes in accounting principles; or by changes in tax laws and regulations, treaties, or interpretations thereof, including possible changes to the taxation of earnings of our foreign subsidiaries, the deductibility of expenses attributable to foreign income, or the foreign tax credit rules. significant judgment is required to determine the recognition and measurement attributes prescribed in the accounting guidance for uncertainty in income taxes. the organisation for economic co-operation and development (oecd), an international association comprised of 34 countries, including the united states, is contemplating changes to numerous long-standing tax principles. these contemplated changes, if finalized and adopted by countries, will increase tax uncertainty and may adversely affect our provision for income taxes. as a result of certain of our ongoing employment and capital investment actions and commitments, our income in certain countries is subject to reduced tax rates and in some cases is wholly exempt from tax. our failure to meet these commitments could adversely impact our provision for income taxes. in addition, we are subject to the continuous examination of our income tax returns by the irs and other tax authorities. we regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes. there can be no assurance that the outcomes from these continuous examinations will not have an adverse impact on our operating results and financial condition.

we manage our business primarily on a geographic basis, organized into three geographic segments. our revenue, which includes product and service for each segment, is summarized in the following table (in millions, except percentages):
percentage of revenue              58.9      %              58.9      %                                                                 58.9      %              57.5      %

percentage of revenue              15.6      %              16.0      %                                                                 16.0      %              16.3      %
for fiscal 2014, as compared with fiscal 2013, total revenue decreased by 3%. product revenue decreased by 5%, while service revenue increased by 4%. the decrease in product revenue reflected declines across all geographic segments as well as across all customer markets. service revenues experienced slower growth in our americas and apjc geographic segments while we experienced slightly faster growth in the emea segment.
across our geographic segments, product revenue for most of our emerging countries experienced a decline. the emerging countries of bricm, in the aggregate, experienced an 11% product revenue decline, with declines across all of our customer markets.
we conduct business globally in numerous currencies. the direct effect of foreign currency fluctuations on revenue has not been material because our revenue is primarily denominated in u.s. dollars. however, if the u.s. dollar strengthens relative to other currencies, such strengthening could have an indirect effect on our revenue to the extent it raises the cost of our products to non-u.s. customers and thereby reduces demand. a weaker u.s. dollar could have the opposite effect. however, the precise indirect effect of currency fluctuations is difficult to measure or predict because our revenue is influenced by many factors in addition to the impact of such currency fluctuations. our revenue in fiscal 2014 may have been adversely affected by the depreciation of the local currency relative to the u.s. dollar in certain emerging countries, although such indirect effects are difficult to measure, as noted.
in addition to the impact of macroeconomic factors, including a reduced it spending environment and budget-driven reductions in spending by government entities, revenue by segment in a particular period may be significantly impacted by several factors related to revenue recognition, including the complexity of transactions such as multiple-element arrangements; the mix of financing arrangements provided to our channel partners and customers; and final acceptance of the product, system, or solution, among other factors. in addition, certain customers tend to make large and sporadic purchases, and the revenue related to these transactions may also be affected by the timing of revenue recognition, which in turn would impact the revenue of the relevant segment. as has been the case in certain of our emerging countries from time to time, customers require greater levels of financing arrangements, service, and support, and these activities may occur in future periods, which may also impact the timing of the recognition of revenue.
for fiscal 2013, as compared with fiscal 2012, total revenue increased by 6%. within total revenue growth, product revenue increased by 5%, while service revenue increased by 9%. our product and service revenue totals reflected revenue growth across each of our geographic segments. the revenue increase was primarily due to the following: the solid performance of our service offerings, our acquisition of nds at the beginning of fiscal 2013, and increased demand for our data center and wireless products.
product revenue by segment the following table presents the breakdown of product revenue by segment (in millions, except percentages):
percentage of product revenue              57.0      %              57.0      %                                                                 57.0      %              55.5      %

percentage of product revenue              16.3      %              16.6      %                                                                 16.6      %              16.9      %
product revenue in the americas segment decreased by 5%, led by a significant decline in the service provider market and, to a lesser extent, declines in the public sector and commercial markets. product revenue declined in the u.s. public sector market, led by lower sales to the u.s. federal government. from a country perspective, product revenue decreased by 5% in the united states, 10% in canada, and 13% in brazil, partially offset by an increase of 2% in mexico.
for fiscal 2013, as compared with fiscal 2012, product revenue in the americas segment increased by 7%. the increase in product revenue was across most of our customer markets in the americas segment, led by solid growth in the service provider and commercial markets and, to a lesser degree, growth in the enterprise market. the growth in product revenue in the service provider market was due in large part to our acquisition of nds at the beginning of fiscal 2013. within the americas segment, we experienced a product revenue decline in the public sector market, driven by lower sales to the public sector in the united states. from a country perspective, product revenue increased by 9% in the united states, 13% in brazil, and 7% in mexico. during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013, we experienced some weakness in our business momentum in certain countries within latin america.
product revenue in the emea segment decreased by 4%, led by a decline in the service provider market and, to a lesser extent, declines in the enterprise and public sector markets. product revenue from emerging countries within emea decreased by 11%, led by a 24% decrease in russia. product revenue for the remainder of emea, which is primarily composed of countries in western europe, declined by 2%.
in fiscal 2013, we experienced a continuation of many of the macroeconomic challenges we faced in emea in fiscal 2012. while we did see some improvements in most of the european economy as the fiscal year progressed, we continued to see weakness in southern europe throughout fiscal 2013. for fiscal 2013, as compared with fiscal 2012, product revenue in the emea segment was flat, as growth in the commercial, service provider and public sector markets was offset by a decline in the enterprise market. the growth in product revenue in the service provider market was due to our acquisition of nds at the beginning of fiscal 2013. from a country perspective, product revenue increased by 1% in the united kingdom, 11% in russia, 4% in switzerland, and 3% in spain. these increases were offset by product revenue declines of 3% in each of germany and france and 13% in the netherlands. product revenue for italy was flat year over year.
product revenue in the apjc segment decreased by 7%, led by declines in the service provider and enterprise markets and, to a lesser extent, a decline in the commercial market. we continued to experience declines in many of the emerging countries within this segment, most notably in india which experienced a year-over-year product revenue decline of 15%. other countries that contributed to the weakness in this segment included japan, australia, and china, which experienced year-over-year product revenue declines of 11%, 7%, and 6%, respectively.
for fiscal 2013, as compared with fiscal 2012, product revenue in the apjc segment increased by 3%. we experienced solid product revenue growth in the commercial and service provider markets and, to a lesser degree, in the public sector market. the growth in product revenue in the service provider market was due primarily to our acquisition of nds at the beginning of fiscal 2013. from a country perspective, product revenue increased by 3% in australia, 34% in india, and 10% in south korea. these increases were partially offset by product revenue declines of 5% in china and 7% in japan, reflecting certain challenges that we faced in these countries during portions of fiscal 2013, most notably in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013.
product revenue by groups of similar products in addition to the primary view on a geographic basis, we also prepare financial information related to groups of similar products and customer markets for various purposes. our product categories consist of the following categories (with subcategories in parentheses): switching (fixed switching, modular switching, and storage); ngn routing (high-end routers, mid-range and low-end routers, and other ngn routing products); service provider video (infrastructure, video software and solutions); collaboration (unified communications, cisco telepresence, and conferencing); data center; wireless; security; and other products. the other products category consists primarily of emerging technology products and other networking products.

revenue in our switching product category decreased by 5%, or $711 million, driven by a 12%, or $656 million, decrease in revenue from our modular switches. revenue from our modular switches decreased due to lower sales of cisco catalyst 6000 series switches. we also experienced a 3% decrease in sales of storage products within this category. revenue from our lan fixed-configuration switches was relatively flat year over year, as lower sales of most of our fixed-configuration cisco catalyst series switches and fixed-configuration cisco nexus series switches were offset by the continued adoption of cisco catalyst 3850 series switches and cisco nexus 6000 series switches.
product revenue in our switching category increased by 1%, or $133 million as higher sales of lan fixed-configuration switches were partially offset by lower sales of modular switches and storage products. sales of lan fixed-configuration switches increased by 4%, or $347 million, while sales of modular switches decreased by 1%, or approximately $76 million. the increase in sales of lan fixed-configuration switches was primarily due to higher sales of cisco nexus series switches, partially offset by sales declines in certain of our cisco catalyst product families. sales of modular switches decreased due to lower sales of cisco catalyst 6000 series switches, partially offset by higher sales in cisco nexus 7000 series switches. product revenue in the switching category was also negatively impacted by a 24% decrease in sales of storage products.
the decrease in revenue in our ngn routing product category of 7%, or $581 million, was driven by a 6%, or $278 million, decrease in revenue from high-end router products; a 9%, or $249 million, decrease in revenue from our midrange and low-end router products; and an 8%, or $54 million, decrease in revenue from other ngn routing products. revenue from our high-end products decreased due to lower sales of cisco crs-3 carrier routing system products and our legacy high-end router products, partially offset by increased sales of our cisco aggregation services routers (asr) edge products. the decrease in revenue from our midrange and low-end router products was driven by lower sales of our cisco integrated services routers (isr) products. revenue from other ngn routing products decreased due to lower sales of certain optical networking products.
sales in our ngn routing product category decreased by 2%, or $152 million, driven by a 3%, or $141 million, decrease in sales of high-end router products and an 8%, or $58 million, decrease in sales of other ngn routing products. these decreases were partially offset by a 2%, or $47 million, increase in sales of our midrange and low-end router products. within the high-end router product category, we experienced lower sales of our cisco crs-1 and crs-3 carrier routing system products and our legacy high-end router products, partially offset by continued adoption of our cisco asr products. higher sales in our midrange and low-end router products were driven by the continued adoption of our cisco isr platform. the decline in sales of other ngn routing products was due to decreased sales of certain other routing and optical networking products.
service provider video fiscal 2014 compared with fiscal 2013
revenue in our service provider video product category decreased by 18%, or $886 million, with the largest driver of the decline being a 21%, or $812 million, decrease in sales of our service provider video infrastructure products. the revenue decline in service provider video infrastructure products, which includes connected devices products, was due primarily to lower sales of set-top boxes.
our service provider video products category grew by 25%, or $986 million, due primarily to the acquisition of nds at the beginning of fiscal 2013. higher revenue from our service provider video infrastructure products also contributed to the increase. the increase in sales of our service provider video infrastructure products was primarily due to increased sales of set-top boxes.
collaboration fiscal 2014 compared with fiscal 2013
we continue to increase the proportion of recurring revenue in our collaboration product category. overall, revenue in our collaboration product category decreased by 6%, or $222 million, primarily due to decreased revenue from our cisco telepresence and unified communications products, driven by weakness in endpoint products such as phones. these decreases were partially offset by higher revenue from our conferencing products.
sales of collaboration products decreased by 6%, or $238 million, primarily due to a decline in sales of cisco telepresence systems and, to a lesser degree, a decline in sales of unified communications products. lower public sector spending in the united states, as well as demand weakness in europe, were significant drivers of the decline in sales of cisco telepresence systems. we also experienced a decline in sales of unified communications products, which was due primarily to lower sales of unified communications infrastructure products as a result of our sales emphasis on shifting towards products with recurring revenue streams.
we continue to experience solid growth in our data center product category, which grew by 27%, or $566 million, with sales growth of our cisco unified computing system products across all geographic segments and customer markets. the increase was due in large part to the continued momentum we are experiencing in both data center and cloud environments, as current customers increase their data center build-outs, and as new customers deploy these offerings.
to the extent our data center business grows and further penetrates the market, we expect that, in comparison to what we experienced during the initial rapid growth of this business, the growth rates for our data center product sales will experience more normal seasonality consistent with the overall server market.
we experienced strong growth in our data center product category, which grew by 60%, or $776 million, with strong sales growth of our cisco unified computing system products across all geographic segments and customer markets. the increase was due in large part to the continued momentum we are experiencing with our products for both data center and cloud environments, as current customers increase their data center build-outs and as new customers deploy these offerings.
we continue to increase the proportion of recurring revenue in our wireless product category. revenue in our wireless product category increased by 2%, or $37 million, due to an increase in sales of meraki products, which we acquired in the second quarter of fiscal 2013, partially offset by lower sales of other wireless products.
sales of wireless products increased by 31%, or $531 million. this increase reflects the continued customer adoption of and migration to the unified access architecture of the cisco unified wireless network, and also reflects increased sales of new products in this category as well as sales of products related to our acquisition of meraki.
we continue to increase the proportion of recurring revenue in our security product category. revenue in our security product category was up 16%, or $218 million, driven primarily by sales of sourcefire products, which company we acquired in the first quarter of fiscal 2014 and, to a lesser degree, by both higher sales of our high-end firewall products within our network security product portfolio and slightly higher sales of our content security products.
sales of security products were flat as higher sales in high-end firewall products within our network security product portfolio were offset by lower sales of our content security products.
other products we experienced a year-over-year decrease in revenue in our other products category for both fiscal 2014 and 2013, due in large part to the sale of our linksys product line in the third quarter of fiscal 2013.

service revenue continued to experience slower growth than in prior fiscal years, with varying levels of growth across our geographic segments. worldwide technical support services revenue increased by 4% while worldwide advanced services revenue experienced 3% growth. technical support service revenue experienced growth across all geographic segments. renewals and technical support service contract initiations associated with product sales provided an installed base of equipment being serviced which, in concert with new service offerings, were the primary factors driving the revenue increases. advanced services revenue, which relates to consulting support services for specific customer network needs, slightly declined in the americas segment but had solid growth in the emea and apjc segments due to growth in subscription revenues.
service revenue experienced solid growth across all of our geographic segments. worldwide technical support services revenue increased by 6%, and worldwide advanced services experienced 16% revenue growth. technical support service experienced growth across all of our geographic segments, led by growth in our americas segment. renewals and technical support service contract initiations associated with product sales provided an installed base of equipment being serviced which, in concert with new service offerings, were the primary factors driving these increases. we experienced revenue growth in advanced services across all geographic segments, led by growth in the americas segment. advanced services revenue growth was driven by solid growth in both transaction and subscription revenues.

the following table summarizes the key factors that contributed to the change in product gross margin percentage from fiscal 2013 to fiscal 2014:
mix of products sold                                                       (0.5                )%

the decrease in product gross margin was driven by unfavorable impacts from product pricing, which were driven by typical market factors and impacted each of our geographic segments and customer markets. the decrease was also due, in part, to the charge of $655 million to product cost of sales recorded in fiscal 2014 related to the expected cost of remediation of issues with memory components in certain products sold in prior fiscal years. in addition, the shift in the mix of products sold decreased our product gross margin, primarily as a result of a revenue increase in our relatively lower margin cisco unified computing system products and decreased revenue from our higher margin core products, partially offset by decreased revenue from our relatively lower margin service provider video products. our product gross margin for fiscal 2014 was also negatively impacted by higher amortization expense of purchased intangible assets. for further explanation of the increase in amortization of purchased intangible assets, see "amortization of purchased intangible assets" below.
these amounts were partially offset by productivity benefits and the absence of charges related to the tivo patent litigation settlement which we incurred in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013. the productivity benefits we experienced in fiscal 2014 were driven by value engineering efforts; favorable component pricing; and continued operational efficiency in manufacturing operations. value engineering is the process by which production costs are reduced through component redesign, board configuration, test processes, and transformation processes.
our future gross margins could be impacted by our product mix and could be adversely affected by further growth in sales of products that have lower gross margins, such as cisco unified computing system products. our gross margins may also be impacted by the geographic mix of our revenue and, as was the case in fiscal 2014, fiscal 2013 and fiscal 2012, may be adversely affected by product pricing attributable to competitive factors. additionally, our manufacturing-related costs may be negatively impacted by constraints in our supply chain, which in turn could negatively affect gross margin. if any of the preceding factors that in the past have negatively impacted our gross margins arise in future periods, our gross margins could continue to decline.
the following table summarizes the key factors that contributed to the change in product gross margin percentage from fiscal 2012 to fiscal 2013:
mix of products sold                                                       (0.7                )%
productivity                                                                3.7                 %
amortization of purchased intangible assets                                (0.5                )%
acquisition fair value adjustment to inventory and other                   (0.1                )%
product gross margin decreased by 1.0 percentage points compared with fiscal 2012. unfavorable impacts from product pricing contributed to our decreased product gross margin percentage in fiscal 2013. these factors impacted most of our customer markets and all of our geographic segments. additionally, our product gross margin for fiscal 2013 was negatively impacted by the shift in the mix of products sold, primarily as a result of revenue increases for our relatively lower margin cisco unified computing system products. these impacts were offset by continued productivity improvements. the productivity improvements were in large part due to increased benefits from cost savings, particularly in certain of our switching and ngn routing categories in which product transitions have been taking place, and were driven by value engineering efforts, favorable component pricing, and continued operational efficiency in manufacturing operations. because the preceding factors largely offset each other, the decline in our product gross margin percentage was largely driven by our acquisition of nds, which resulted in higher amortization expense from purchased intangible assets along with costs resulting from a fair value adjustment to inventory acquired as part of that acquisition. in addition, during fiscal 2013 we incurred charges related to the tivo patent litigation settlement in the fourth quarter that were included as part of cost of sales. the combined effect of these items was a negative impact to our product gross margin of 1.1 percentage points for fiscal 2013.
service gross margin fiscal 2014 compared with fiscal 2013
our service gross margin percentage increased slightly by 0.3 percentage points for fiscal 2014, as compared with fiscal 2013. the increase was primarily due to higher sales volume in both advanced services and technical support services. the benefits to gross margin of increased sales volume were partially offset by increased cost impacts such as outside service costs, partner delivery costs, and headcount-related costs.
our service gross margin normally experiences some fluctuations due to various factors such as the timing of contract initiations in our renewals, our strategic investments in headcount, and the resources we deploy to support the overall service business. other factors include the mix of service offerings, as the gross margin from our advanced services is typically lower than the gross margin from technical support services.
our service gross margin percentage increased slightly by 0.1 percentage points for fiscal 2013, as compared with fiscal 2012. although we experienced higher sales volume from growth in both advanced services and in technical support services, the resulting benefit to gross margin was offset by increased cost impacts such as headcount-related costs, partner delivery costs, and unfavorable mix. the mix impacts were due to our lower gross margin advanced services business contributing a higher proportion of service revenue for fiscal 2013, as compared with fiscal 2012.
(1) the unallocated corporate items for the years presented include the effects of amortization and impairments of acquisition-related intangible assets, share-based compensation expense, significant litigation and other contingencies, impacts to cost of sales from purchase accounting adjustments to inventory, charges related to asset impairments and restructurings, and certain other charges. we do not allocate these items to the gross margin for each segment because management does not include such information in measuring the performance of the operating segments.
the americas segment experienced a slight gross margin percentage increase due to the impact of productivity improvements in this geographic segment. partially offsetting this favorable impact to gross margin were negative impacts from pricing and an unfavorable mix. the unfavorable mix impact was driven by revenue increases in our relatively lower margin cisco unified computing system products and lower sales of our higher margin core products, partially offset by decreased revenue from our relatively lower margin service provider video products.
the gross margin percentage decrease in our emea segment was due primarily to the unfavorable impacts from pricing, as well as an unfavorable mix impact, partially offset by productivity improvements in this geographic segment. the unfavorable mix impact was driven by an increase in revenue from our lower margin cisco unified computing system products.
our apjc segment gross margin percentage decreased primarily as a result of unfavorable impacts from pricing, and also as a result of an unfavorable mix. the unfavorable mix impact was driven by an increase in revenue from our lower margin cisco unified computing system products. partially offsetting these factors were impacts from productivity improvements and higher service gross margin in this geographic segment.
the gross margin percentage for a particular segment may fluctuate, and period-to-period changes in such percentages may or may not be indicative of a trend for that segment. our product and service gross margins may be impacted by economic downturns or uncertain economic conditions as well as our movement into new market opportunities, and could decline if any of the factors that impact our gross margins are adversely affected in future periods.
we experienced a gross margin percentage decrease in our americas and apjc segments, while our emea segment experienced a gross margin percentage increase.
the americas segment experienced a slight gross margin percentage decline due to the unfavorable impacts from pricing, and also due to unfavorable mix impacts, partially offset by productivity improvements.
the gross margin percentage increase in our emea segment was primarily the result of productivity improvements from lower overall manufacturing costs and, to a lesser degree, favorable mix impacts and higher service gross margin. partially offsetting these favorable impacts to gross margin were negative impacts from pricing.
the apjc segment gross margin percentage declined due primarily to the unfavorable impacts from pricing, lower service gross margin, and unfavorable mix impacts. partially offsetting these factors were productivity improvements, driven in large part by lower overall manufacturing costs and higher volume.
factors that may impact revenue and gross margin product revenue may continue to be affected by factors, including global economic downturns and related market uncertainty, that have resulted in reduced it-related capital spending in certain segments within our enterprise, service provider, public sector, and commercial markets; changes in the geopolitical environment and global economic conditions; competition, including price-focused competitors from asia, especially from china; new product introductions; sales cycles and product implementation cycles; changes in the mix of our customers between service provider and enterprise markets; changes in the mix of direct sales and indirect sales; variations in sales channels; and final acceptance criteria of the product, system, or solution as specified by the customer. sales to the service provider market have been and may be in the future characterized by large and sporadic purchases, especially relating to our router sales and sales of certain products within our collaboration, data center, and service provider video product categories. in addition, service provider customers typically have longer implementation cycles; require a broader range of services, including network design services; and often have acceptance provisions that can lead to a delay in revenue recognition. certain of our customers in certain emerging countries also tend to make large and sporadic purchases, and the revenue related to these transactions may similarly be affected by the timing of revenue recognition. as we focus on new market opportunities, customers may require greater levels of financing arrangements, service, and support, especially in certain emerging countries, which in turn may result in a delay in the timing of revenue recognition. to improve customer satisfaction, we continue to focus on managing our manufacturing lead-time performance, which may result in corresponding reductions in order backlog. a decline in backlog levels could result in more variability and less predictability in our quarter-to-quarter revenue and operating results.
product revenue may also be adversely affected by fluctuations in demand for our products, especially with respect to telecommunications service providers and internet businesses, whether or not driven by any slowdown in capital expenditures in the service provider market; price and product competition in the communications and information technology industry; introduction and market acceptance of new technologies and products; adoption of new networking standards; and financial difficulties experienced by our customers. we may, from time to time, experience manufacturing issues that create a delay in our suppliers' ability to provide specific components, resulting in delayed shipments. to the extent that manufacturing issues and any related component shortages result in delayed shipments in the future, and particularly in periods when we and our suppliers are operating at higher levels of capacity, it is possible that revenue for a quarter could be adversely affected if such matters are not remediated within the same quarter. for additional factors that may impact product revenue, see "part i, item 1a. risk factors."
our distributors participate in various cooperative marketing and other programs. increased sales to our distributors generally result in greater difficulty in forecasting the mix of our products and, to a certain degree, the timing of orders from our customers. we recognize revenue for sales to our distributors generally based on a sell-through method using information provided by them, and we maintain estimated accruals and allowances for all cooperative marketing and other programs.
product gross margin may be adversely affected in the future by changes in the mix of products sold, including periods of increased growth of some of our lower margin products; introduction of new products, including products with price-performance advantages and new business models for our offerings such as xaas; our ability to reduce production costs; entry into new markets, including markets with different pricing structures and cost structures, as a result of internal development or through acquisitions; changes in distribution channels; price competition, including competitors from asia, especially those from china; changes in geographic mix of our product revenue; the timing of revenue recognition and revenue deferrals; sales discounts; increases in material or labor costs, including share-based compensation expense; excess inventory and obsolescence charges; warranty costs; changes in shipment volume; loss of cost savings due to changes in component pricing; effects of value engineering; inventory holding charges; and the extent to which we successfully execute on our strategy and operating plans. additionally, our manufacturing-related costs may be negatively impacted by constraints in our supply chain. service gross margin may be impacted by various factors such as the change in mix between technical support services and advanced services; the timing of technical support service contract initiations and renewals; share-based compensation expense; and the timing of our strategic investments in headcount and resources to support this business.

r&d expenses increased for fiscal 2014, as compared with fiscal 2013, primarily due to compensation expense recorded in fiscal 2014 in connection with our acquisition of the remaining interest in insieme networks, inc. ("insieme"). see note 12 to the consolidated financial statements. higher share-based compensation expense and higher contracted services also contributed to the increase. these increases were partially offset by reduced variable compensation expense as a result of our financial performance and efficiencies related to our workforce reduction plan announced in august 2013.
we continue to invest in r&d in order to bring a broad range of products to market in a timely fashion. if we believe that we are unable to enter a particular market in a timely manner with internally developed products, we may purchase or license technology from other businesses, or we may partner with or acquire businesses as an alternative to internal r&d.
the increase in r&d expenses for fiscal 2013, as compared with fiscal 2012, was primarily due to higher headcount-related expenses attributable in large part to our acquisitions. partially offsetting these costs was lower share-based compensation expense.
sales and marketing expenses fiscal 2014 compared with fiscal 2013
sales and marketing expenses for fiscal 2014, as compared with fiscal 2013, decreased slightly due to lower advertising expenses, reductions in other discretionary spending, and lower expenses in other areas such as depreciation expense. these decreases were substantially offset by higher share based compensation expense and higher acquisition- related costs.
for fiscal 2013, as compared with fiscal 2012, sales and marketing expenses decreased by $109 million, primarily due to lower share-based compensation expense and, to a lesser degree, lower discretionary spending and contracted services. these items were partially offset by higher headcount-related expense resulting largely from our acquisitions.
g&a expenses decreased in fiscal 2014, as compared with fiscal 2013, due to lower contracted services, lower corporate-level expenses, and lower headcount-related expenses. the lower headcount-related expenses were due to efficiencies related to our workforce reduction plan announced in august 2013, and also due to reduced variable compensation expense as a result of our lower financial performance.
g&a expenses decreased in fiscal 2013, as compared with fiscal 2012, primarily due to the absence in fiscal 2013 of $202 million of impairment charges on real estate held for sale recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012. lower share-based compensation expense in fiscal 2013 and a recovery in the market value of property held for sale recorded during fiscal 2013 also contributed to the decrease. these decreases were partially offset by higher headcount-related expenses resulting in part from our acquisitions and also by higher corporate-level expenses. corporate-level expenses, which tend to vary from period to period, included operational infrastructure activities such as it project implementations, which included investments in our global data center infrastructure, and investments related to operational and financial systems.
effect of foreign currency in fiscal 2014, foreign currency fluctuations, net of hedging, decreased the combined r&d, sales and marketing, and g&a expenses by $153 million, or approximately 0.9%, compared with fiscal 2013. in fiscal 2013, foreign currency fluctuations, net of hedging, decreased the combined r&d, sales and marketing, and g&a expenses by $227 million, or approximately 1.3%, compared with fiscal 2012.
our headcount decreased by approximately 1,000 employees in fiscal 2014.  the decrease was due to headcount reductions from attrition and from our workforce reduction plan announced in august 2013. these headcount reductions were partially offset by the increase in headcount from targeted hiring in engineering, services, sales, and also by increased headcount from our recent acquisitions.
in august 2014, we announced a restructuring plan that will impact up to 6,000 employees, representing approximately 8% of our global workforce. we expect to reinvest substantially all of the cost savings from the restructuring actions in our key growth areas such as data center, software, security, and cloud.
our headcount increased by 8,410 employees in fiscal 2013. the increase was attributable to the headcount from acquisitions, the largest of which was nds, as well as targeted hiring in engineering and services.

the decrease in share-based compensation expense for fiscal 2013, as compared with fiscal 2012, was due primarily to a decrease in the aggregate value of share-based awards granted in recent periods, higher forfeiture credits in fiscal 2013, and the effect of stock options awards from prior years becoming fully amortized and replaced with restricted stock units with a lower aggregate value.
amortization of purchased intangible assets the following table presents the amortization of purchased intangible assets (in millions):
amortization of purchased intangible assets:
cost of sales                                             $742                     $606                     $424
operating expenses                             275                      395                      383
amortization of purchased intangible assets increased in both fiscal 2014 and fiscal 2013 as compared with the respective prior fiscal years. the increases were primarily due to amortization of purchased intangible assets from our recent acquisitions partially offset by certain purchased intangible assets having become fully amortized.
the fair value of acquired technology and patents, as well as acquired technology under development, is determined at acquisition date primarily using the income approach, which discounts expected future cash flows to present value. the discount rates used in the present value calculations are typically derived from a weighted-average cost of capital analysis and then adjusted to reflect risks inherent in the development lifecycle as appropriate. we consider the pricing model for products related to these acquisitions to be standard within the high-technology communications industry, and the applicable discount rates represent the rates that market participants would use for valuation of such intangible assets.
restructuring and other charges fiscal 2014 plan and fiscal 2011 plans in august 2013, we announced a workforce reduction plan that would impact up to 4,000 employees, or 5%, of our global workforce. in connection with this fiscal 2014 plan, during fiscal 2014 we incurred within operating expenses restructuring and other charges of approximately $418 million which were related primarily to employee severance charges for employees impacted by our workforce reduction plan under the fiscal 2014 plan. we have completed the fiscal 2014 plan and we do not expect any remaining charges related to this action. in fiscal 2013 and fiscal 2012, we incurred within operating expenses net restructuring and other charges of $105 million and $304 million, respectively, which were related primarily to employee severance charges for employees impacted by our workforce reduction under fiscal 2011 plans.
fiscal 2015 plan in august 2014, we announced a restructuring plan that will impact up to 6,000 employees, representing approximately 8% of our global workforce. we expect to take action under this plan beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2015. we currently estimate that we will recognize pre-tax charges in an amount not expected to exceed $700 million consisting of severance and other one-time termination benefits, and other associated costs.
operating income the following table presents our operating income and our operating income as a percentage of revenue (in millions, except percentages):
operating income                                       $9,345                  $11,196                  $10,065
operating income as a percentage of revenue   19.8                 %              23.0      %              21.9      %
for fiscal 2014, as compared with fiscal 2013, operating income decreased by 17%, and as a percentage of revenue operating income decreased by 3.2 percentage points. the decrease resulted from the following: a decrease in revenue; a gross margin percentage decline, driven in part by the $655 million supplier component remediation charge (or 1.4 percentage points); the $416 million compensation expense recorded in fiscal 2014 in connection with our acquisition of the remaining interest in insieme; and an increase in restructuring and other charges related to the workforce reduction under the fiscal 2014 plan.
in fiscal 2013 our results reflected solid execution on delivering profitable growth, as we grew operating income faster than revenue. in fiscal 2013, as compared with fiscal 2012, operating income increased by 11%, and as a percentage of revenue operating income increased by 1.1 percentage points. the increases resulted from the following: revenue growth of 6%; continuing focus on expense management, which resulted in lower sales and marketing and g&a expenses as a percentage of revenue; and lower restructuring and other charges.
interest income increased in fiscal 2014 as compared with fiscal 2013 due to the increase in our portfolio of cash, cash equivalents, and fixed income investments. the decrease in interest expense in fiscal 2014 as compared with the prior fiscal year was primarily attributable to the favorable impact of incremental interest rate swaps entered into during fiscal 2014 and the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013. this decrease was partially offset by additional interest expense due to the increase in long-term debt in fiscal 2014.
interest income increased slightly in fiscal 2013 as compared with prior fiscal year due primarily to increased interest income earned on financing receivables, partially offset by lower interest income from our portfolio of cash, cash equivalents, and fixed income investments as a result of lower average interest rates. the decrease in interest expense in fiscal 2013 as compared with fiscal 2012 was attributable to the favorable impact of interest rate swaps and lower expense on our floating-rate notes as the benchmark london interbank offered rate (libor) decreased.
other income (loss), net  the components of other income (loss), net, are summarized as follows (in millions):
the increase in total net gains on available-for-sale investments in fiscal 2014 compared with fiscal 2013 was primarily attributable to higher gains on publicly traded equity securities in the current period as a result of market conditions and the timing of sales of these securities.
the change in net losses on investments in privately held companies for the fiscal 2014 as compared with fiscal 2013 was primarily due to an increase of $40 million in our proportional share of losses from our vce joint venture, partially offset by higher realized gains from various investments in privately held companies.
the change in other gains (losses), net in fiscal 2014 as compared with fiscal 2013 was primarily due to higher gains on equity derivative instruments and lower donation expenses, partially offset by unfavorable foreign exchange impacts in fiscal 2014.
the decrease in net gains on available-for-sale investments in fiscal 2013 compared with fiscal 2012 was attributable to lower gains on fixed income and publicly traded equity securities in fiscal 2013 as a result of market conditions and the timing of sales of these securities. for fiscal 2013 as compared with fiscal 2012, the change in net losses on investments in privately held companies was primarily due to higher realized gains from various private investments, partially offset by an increase of $23 million in our proportional share of losses from our vce joint venture. the change in other gains (losses), net for fiscal 2013 as compared with fiscal 2012, was primarily due to an increase in donations and less favorable foreign exchange impacts in fiscal 2013.
provision for income taxes our provision for income taxes is subject to volatility and could be adversely impacted by earnings being lower than anticipated in countries that have lower tax rates, higher than anticipated in countries that have higher tax rates, and expiration of or lapses in tax incentives. our provision for income taxes does not include provisions for u.s. income taxes and foreign withholding taxes associated with the repatriation of undistributed earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries that we intend to reinvest indefinitely in our foreign subsidiaries. if these earnings were distributed from the foreign subsidiaries to the united states in the form of dividends or otherwise, or if the shares of the relevant foreign subsidiaries were sold or otherwise transferred, we would be subject to additional u.s. income taxes (subject to an adjustment for foreign tax credits) and foreign withholding taxes. further, as a result of certain of our ongoing employment and capital investment actions and commitments, our income in certain countries is subject to reduced tax rates and in some cases is wholly exempt from tax. our failure to meet these commitments could adversely impact our provision for income taxes.
the provision for income taxes resulted in an effective tax rate of 19.2% for fiscal 2014, compared with 11.1% for fiscal 2013. the net 8.1 percentage point increase in the effective tax rate between fiscal years was primarily attributable to a non-recurring net tax benefit of $794 million, or 7.1 percentage points, due to a tax settlement with the irs in fiscal 2013.
for a full reconciliation of our effective tax rate to the u.s. federal statutory rate of 35% and for further explanation of our provision for income taxes, see note 16 to the consolidated financial statements.
the provision for income taxes resulted in an effective tax rate of 11.1% for fiscal 2013, compared with 20.8% for fiscal 2012. the net 9.7 percentage point decrease in the effective tax rate between fiscal years was primarily attributable to a net tax benefit of $794 million, or 7.1 percentage points, due to a tax settlement with the irs and an increase in tax benefits of $144 million, or 1.2 percentage points, due to the retroactive reinstatement of the u.s. federal r&d tax credit in fiscal 2013.
liquidity and capital resources the following sections discuss the effects of changes in our balance sheet, our capital allocation strategy including stock repurchase program and dividends, our contractual obligations, and certain other commitments and activities on our liquidity and capital resources.
the net increase in cash and cash equivalents and investments from fiscal 2013 to fiscal 2014 was primarily the result of cash provided by operating activities of $12.3 billion, a net increase in debt of $4.7 billion and the issuance of common stock of $1.9 billion pursuant to employee stock incentive and purchase plans. these sources of cash were partially offset by the repurchase of common stock of $9.4 billion under the stock repurchase program, cash dividends paid of $3.8 billion, net cash paid for acquisitions of $3.0 billion, and capital expenditures of $1.3 billion.
our total in cash and cash equivalents and investments held by various foreign subsidiaries was $47.4 billion and $40.4 billion as of july 26, 2014 and july 27, 2013, respectively. under current tax laws and regulations, if these assets were to be distributed from the foreign subsidiaries to the united states in the form of dividends or otherwise, we would be subject to additional u.s. income taxes (subject to an adjustment for foreign tax credits) and foreign withholding taxes. the balance of cash and cash equivalents and investments available in the united states as of july 26, 2014 and july 27, 2013 was $4.7 billion and $10.2 billion, respectively.
we maintain an investment portfolio of various holdings, types, and maturities. we classify our investments as short-term investments based on their nature and their availability for use in current operations. we believe the overall credit quality of our portfolio is strong, with our cash equivalents and our fixed income investment portfolio consisting primarily of high quality investment-grade securities. we believe that our strong cash and cash equivalents and investments position allows us to use our cash resources for strategic investments to gain access to new technologies, for acquisitions, for customer financing activities, for working capital needs, and for the repurchase of shares of common stock and payment of dividends as discussed below.
free cash flow and capital allocation  as part of our capital allocation strategy, we intend to return a minimum of 50% of our free cash flow annually to our shareholders through cash dividends and repurchases of common stock.
we define free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities less cash used to acquire property and equipment. the following table reconciles our net cash provided by operating activities to free cash flow (in millions):
net cash provided by operating activities       $12,332              $12,894              $11,491
acquisition of property and equipment            (1,275      )        (1,160      )        (1,126      )
we expect that cash provided by operating activities may fluctuate in future periods as a result of a number of factors, including fluctuations in our operating results, the rate at which products are shipped during the quarter (which we refer to as shipment linearity), the timing and collection of accounts receivable and financing receivables, inventory and supply chain management, deferred revenue, excess tax benefits resulting from share-based compensation, and the timing and amount of tax and other payments. for additional discussion, see "part i, item 1a. risk factors" in this report.
we consider free cash flow to be a liquidity measure that provides useful information to management and investors because of our intent to return a stated percentage of free cash flow to shareholders in the form of dividends and stock repurchases. we further regard free cash flow as a useful measure because it reflects cash that can be used to, among other things, invest in our business, make strategic acquisitions, repurchase common stock, and pay dividends on our common stock, after deducting capital investments. a limitation of the utility of free cash flow as a measure of financial performance and liquidity is that the free cash flow does not represent the total increase or decrease in our cash balance for the period.  in addition, we have other
required uses of cash, including repaying the principal of our outstanding indebtedness. free cash flow is not a measure calculated in accordance with u.s. generally accepted accounting principles and should not be regarded in isolation or as an alternative for net income provided by operating activities or any other measure calculated in accordance with such principles, and other companies may calculate free cash flow in a different manner than we do.
on august 26, 2014, our board of directors declared a quarterly dividend of $0.19 per common share to be paid on october 22, 2014 to all shareholders of record as of the close of business on october 2, 2014. any future dividends will be subject to the approval of our board of directors.
our accounts receivable net, as of july 26, 2014 decreased by approximately 6% compared with the end of fiscal 2013. our dso as of july 26, 2014 was lower by 2 days compared with the end of fiscal 2013, primarily due to an improvement in the linearity of shipments.
inventory as of july 26, 2014 increased by 8% from our inventory balance at the end of fiscal 2013, and for the same period purchase commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers increased by approximately 3%. on a combined basis, inventories and purchase commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers increased by 5% compared with the end of fiscal 2013. we believe our inventory and purchase commitments levels are in line with our current demand forecasts.
our finished goods consist of distributor inventory and deferred cost of sales and manufactured finished goods. distributor inventory and deferred cost of sales are related to unrecognized revenue on shipments to distributors and retail partners as well as shipments to customers. manufactured finished goods consist primarily of build-to-order and build-to-stock products.
we purchase components from a variety of suppliers and use several contract manufacturers to provide manufacturing services for our products. during the normal course of business, in order to manage manufacturing lead times and help ensure adequate component supply, we enter into agreements with contract manufacturers and suppliers that allow them to procure inventory based upon criteria as defined by us or that establish the parameters defining our requirements and our commitment to securing manufacturing capacity. a significant portion of our reported purchase commitments arising from these agreements are firm, noncancelable, and unconditional commitments. in certain instances, these agreements allow us the option to cancel, reschedule, and adjust our requirements based on our business needs prior to firm orders being placed. our purchase commitments are for short-term product manufacturing requirements as well as for commitments to suppliers to secure manufacturing capacity.
inventory and supply chain management remain areas of focus as we balance the need to maintain supply chain flexibility to help ensure competitive lead times with the risk of inventory obsolescence because of rapidly changing technology and customer requirements. we believe the amount of our inventory and purchase commitments is appropriate for our revenue levels.
financing receivables and guarantees we measure our net balance sheet exposure position related to our financing receivables and financing guarantees by reducing the total of gross financing receivables and financing guarantees by the associated allowances for credit loss and deferred revenue. as of july 26, 2014, our net balance sheet exposure position related to financing receivables and financing guarantees was as follows (in millions):
financing receivables   financing guarantees july 26, 2014                                     leasereceivables             loanreceivables           financed servicecontracts and other               total   channel partner             end-user customers             total                 total financing receivables less unearned income          $3,527                      $1,683                                  $3,210                        $8,420       $263                        $202                           $465             $8,885
financing receivables financing receivables less unearned income increased by 2% compared with the end of fiscal 2013. the change was primarily due to a 2% increase in both loan receivables and financed service contracts and other, and also due to 1% increase in lease receivables. we provide financing to certain end-user customers and channel partners to enable sales of our products, services, and networking solutions. these financing arrangements include leases, financed service contracts, and loans. arrangements related to leases are generally collateralized by a security interest in the underlying assets. lease receivables include sales-type and direct-financing leases. we also provide certain qualified customers financing for long-term service contracts, which primarily relate to technical support services and advanced services. our loan financing arrangements may include not only financing the acquisition of our products and services but also providing additional funds for other costs associated with network installation and integration of our products and services. we expect to continue to expand the use of our financing programs in the near term.
financing guarantees in the normal course of business, third parties may provide financing arrangements to our customers and channel partners under financing programs. the financing arrangements to customers provided by third parties are related to leases and loans and typically have terms of up to three years. in some cases, we provide guarantees to third parties for these lease and loan arrangements. the financing arrangements to channel partners consist of revolving short-term financing provided by third parties, generally with payment terms ranging from 60 to 90 days. in certain instances, these financing arrangements result in a transfer of our receivables to the third party. the receivables are derecognized upon transfer, as these transfers qualify as true sales, and we receive payments for the receivables from the third party based on our standard payment terms. these financing arrangements facilitate the working capital requirements of the channel partners, and in some cases, we guarantee a portion of these arrangements. we could be called upon to make payments under these guarantees in the event of nonpayment by the channel partners or end-user customers. historically, our payments under these arrangements have been immaterial. where we provide a guarantee, we defer the revenue associated with the channel partner and end-user financing arrangement in accordance with revenue recognition policies, or we record a liability for the fair value of the guarantees. in either case, the deferred revenue is recognized as revenue when the guarantee is removed.
deferred revenue related to financing receivables and guarantees the majority of the deferred revenue in the preceding table is related to financed service contracts. the majority of the revenue related to financed service contracts, which primarily relates to technical support services, is deferred as the revenue related to financed service contracts is recognized ratably over the period during which the related services are to be performed. a portion of the revenue related to lease and loan receivables is also deferred and included in deferred product revenue based on revenue recognition criteria not currently having been met.
borrowings senior notes the following table summarizes the principal amount of our senior notes (in millions):
(1) in march 2014, we issued senior notes with an aggregate principal amount of $8.0 billion.
we repaid senior floating-rate and fixed-rate notes upon their maturity in the third quarter of fiscal 2014 for an aggregate principal amount of $3.3 billion.
interest is payable semiannually on each class of the senior fixed-rate notes, each of which is redeemable by us at any time, subject to a make-whole premium. interest is payable quarterly on the floating-rate notes. we were in compliance with all debt covenants as of july 26, 2014.
other debt other debt as of july 26, 2014 and july 27, 2013 includes secured borrowings associated with customer financing arrangements. as of july 27, 2013, we also had outstanding notes related to our investment in insieme. the amount of borrowings outstanding under these arrangements was $12 million and $31 million as of july 26, 2014 and july 27, 2013, respectively.
commercial paper in fiscal 2011, we established a short-term debt financing program of up to $3.0 billion through the issuance of commercial paper notes. we use the proceeds from the issuance of commercial paper notes for general corporate purposes. in fiscal 2014, we issued and repaid $1.0 billion of indebtedness under commercial paper and had no commercial paper notes outstanding as of each of july 26, 2014 and july 27, 2013.
credit facility on february 17, 2012, we entered into a credit agreement with certain institutional lenders that provides for a $3.0 billion unsecured revolving credit facility that is scheduled to expire on february 17, 2017. any advances under the credit agreement will accrue interest at rates that are equal to, based on certain conditions, either (i) the higher of the federal funds rate plus 0.50%, bank of america's "prime rate" as announced from time to time, or one-month libor plus 1.00% or (ii) libor plus a margin that is based on our senior debt credit ratings as published by standard & poor's financial services, llc and moody's investors service, inc. the credit agreement requires that we comply with certain covenants, including that we maintain an interest coverage ratio as defined in the agreement. as of july 26, 2014, we were in compliance with the required interest coverage ratio and the other covenants, and we had not borrowed any funds under the credit facility.
we may also, upon the agreement of either the existing lenders or additional lenders not currently parties to the agreement, increase the commitments under the credit facility by up to an additional $2.0 billion and/or extend the expiration date of the credit facility by up to two additional years, or up to february 17, 2019.
deferred revenue the following table presents the breakdown of deferred revenue (in millions):
service             $9,640               $9,403                         $237
the increase in deferred service revenue in fiscal 2014 reflects the impact of new contract initiations and renewals, partially offset by an increase in customers paying technical support service contracts over time and the impact of ongoing amortization of deferred service revenue. the increase in deferred product revenue was primarily due to increased deferrals related to subscription revenue arrangements and to a lesser extent, due to an increase in shipments not having met revenue recognition criteria as of july 26, 2014.
contractual obligations the impact of contractual obligations on our liquidity and capital resources in future periods should be analyzed in conjunction with the factors that impact our cash flows from operations discussed previously. in addition, we plan for and measure our liquidity and capital resources through an annual budgeting process. the following table summarizes our contractual obligations at july 26, 2014 (in millions):
payments due by period july 26, 2014                                                                        total            less than 1 year             1 to 3 years             3 to 5 years           more than 5 years operating leases                                                                $1,239                    $399                      $457                     $196                       $187
other long-term liabilities (uncertainty in the timing of future payments)       2,220
operating leases for more information on our operating leases, see note 12 to the consolidated financial statements.
purchase commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers we purchase components from a variety of suppliers and use several contract manufacturers to provide manufacturing services for our products. a significant portion of our reported estimated purchase commitments arising from these agreements are firm, noncancelable, and unconditional commitments. we record a liability for firm, noncancelable, and unconditional purchase commitments for quantities in excess of our future demand forecasts consistent with the valuation of our excess and obsolete inventory. see further discussion in "inventory supply chain." as of july 26, 2014, the liability for these purchase commitments was $162 million and is recorded in other current liabilities and is not included in the preceding table.
other purchase obligations other purchase obligations represent an estimate of all contractual obligations in the ordinary course of business, other than operating leases and commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers, for which we have not received the goods or services. purchase orders are not included in the preceding table as they typically represent our authorization to purchase rather than binding contractual purchase obligations.
long-term debt the amount of long-term debt in the preceding table represents the principal amount of the respective debt instruments. see note 10 to the consolidated financial statements.
other long-term liabilities other long-term liabilities primarily include noncurrent income taxes payable, accrued liabilities for deferred compensation, noncurrent deferred tax liabilities, and certain other long-term liabilities. due to the uncertainty in the timing of future payments, our noncurrent income taxes payable of approximately $1,851 million and noncurrent deferred tax liabilities of $369 million were presented as one aggregated amount in the total column on a separate line in the preceding table. noncurrent income taxes payable include uncertain tax positions (see note 16 to the consolidated financial statements).
other commitments in connection with our business combinations and asset purchases, we have agreed to pay certain additional amounts contingent upon the achievement of certain agreed-upon technology, development, product, or other milestones or the continued employment with us of certain employees of the acquired entities. see note 12 to the consolidated financial statements.
insieme networks, inc. in the third quarter of fiscal 2012, we made an investment in insieme, an early stage company focused on research and development in the data center market. as set forth in the agreement between cisco and insieme, this investment included $100 million of funding and a license to certain of our technology. immediately prior to the call option exercise and acquisition described below, we owned approximately 83% of insieme as a result of these investments and have consolidated the results of insieme in our consolidated financial statements. in connection with this investment, we entered into a put/call option agreement that provided us with the right to purchase the remaining interests in insieme. in addition, the noncontrolling interest holders could require us to purchase their shares upon the occurrence of certain events.
during the first quarter of fiscal 2014, we exercised our call option and entered into an agreement to purchase the remaining interests in insieme. the acquisition closed in the second quarter of fiscal 2014, at which time the former noncontrolling interest holders became eligible to receive up to two milestone payments, which will be determined using agreed-upon formulas based primarily on revenue for certain of insieme's products. during fiscal 2014, we recorded compensation expense of $416 million, related to the fair value of the vested portion of amounts that are expected to be earned by the former noncontrolling interest holders. continued vesting and changes to the fair value of the amounts probable of being earned will result in adjustments to the recorded compensation expense in future periods. based on the terms of the agreement, we have determined that the maximum amount that could be recorded as compensation expense by us is approximately $855 million, net of forfeitures and including the $416 million that has been expensed during fiscal 2014. the milestone payments, if earned, are expected to be paid primarily during fiscal 2016 and fiscal 2017.
other funding commitments we also have certain funding commitments primarily related to our investments in privately held companies and venture funds, some of which are based on the achievement of certain agreed-upon milestones, and some of which are required to be funded on demand. the funding commitments were $255 million as of july 26, 2014, compared with $263 million as of july 27, 2013.
off-balance sheet arrangements we consider our investments in unconsolidated variable interest entities to be off-balance sheet arrangements. in the ordinary course of business, we have investments in privately held companies and provide financing to certain customers. these privately held companies and customers may be considered to be variable interest entities. we evaluate on an ongoing basis our investments in these privately held companies and customer financings, and we have determined that as of july 26, 2014 there were no material unconsolidated variable interest entities.
vce is a joint venture that we formed in fiscal 2010 with emc corporation ("emc"), with investments from vmware, inc. ("vmware") and intel corporation. vce helps organizations leverage best-in-class technologies and disciplines from cisco, emc, and vmware to enable the transformation to cloud computing. as of july 26, 2014, our cumulative gross investment in vce was approximately $716 million, inclusive of accrued interest, and our ownership percentage was approximately 35%. during fiscal 2014, we invested approximately $185 million in vce. we account for our investment in vce under the equity method, and our portion of vce's net loss is recognized in other income (loss), net. as of july 26, 2014, we have recorded cumulative losses from vce of $644 million since inception. our carrying value in vce as of july 26, 2014 was $72 million. over the next 12 months, as vce scales its operations, we may make additional investments in vce and may incur additional losses proportionate with our share ownership.
from time to time, emc and cisco may enter into guarantee agreements on behalf of vce to indemnify third parties, such as customers, for monetary damages. such guarantees were not material as of july 26, 2014.
on an ongoing basis, we reassess our investments in privately held companies and customer financings to determine if they are variable interest entities and if we would be regarded as the primary beneficiary pursuant to the applicable accounting guidance. as a result of this ongoing assessment, we may be required to make additional disclosures or consolidate these entities. because we may not control these entities, we may not have the ability to influence these events.
we provide financing guarantees, which are generally for various third-party financing arrangements extended to our channel partners and end-user customers. we could be called upon to make payments under these guarantees in the event of nonpayment by the channel partners or end-user customers. see the previous discussion of these financing guarantees under "financing receivables and guarantees."
securities lending we periodically engage in securities lending activities with certain of our available-for-sale investments. these transactions are accounted for as a secured lending of the securities, and the securities are typically loaned only on an overnight basis. the average daily balance of securities lending for fiscal 2014 and 2013 was $1.5 billion and $0.7 billion, respectively. we require collateral equal to at least 102% of the fair market value of the loaned security and that the collateral be in the form of cash or liquid, high-quality assets. we engage in these secured lending transactions only with highly creditworthy counterparties, and the associated portfolio custodian has agreed to indemnify us against collateral losses. as of july 26, 2014 and july 27, 2013, we had no outstanding securities lending transactions. we believe these arrangements do not present a material risk or impact to our liquidity requirements.
liquidity and capital resource requirements based on past performance and current expectations, we believe our cash and cash equivalents, investments, cash generated from operations, and ability to access capital markets and committed credit lines will satisfy, through at least the next 12 months, our liquidity requirements, both in total and domestically, including the following: working capital needs, capital expenditures, investment requirements, stock repurchases, cash dividends, contractual obligations, commitments, principal and interest payments on debt, future customer financings, and other liquidity requirements associated with our operations. there are no other transactions, arrangements, or relationships with unconsolidated entities or other persons that are reasonably likely to materially affect the liquidity and the availability of, as well as our requirements for, capital resources.

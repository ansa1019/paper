item 1a.  risk factors as previously discussed, our actual results could differ materially from our forward-looking statements. factors that might cause or contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to, those discussed below. these and many other factors described in this report could adversely affect our operations, performance and financial condition.
if we cannot continue to develop, market and offer new products and services or enhancements to existing products and services that meet customer requirements, our operating results could suffer.
the process of developing new high technology products and services and enhancing existing products and services is complex, costly and uncertain. if we fail to anticipate customers' changing needs and emerging technological trends, our market share and results of operations could suffer. we must make long-term investments, develop or obtain appropriate intellectual property and commit significant resources before knowing whether our predictions will accurately reflect customer demand for our products and services. if we are unable to extend our core technologies into new applications and new platforms and to anticipate or respond to technological changes, the market's acceptance of our products and services could decline and our results would suffer. additionally, any delay in the development, production, marketing or offering of a new product or service or enhancement to an existing product or service could result in customer attrition or impede our ability to attract new customers, causing a decline in our revenues, earnings or stock price and weakening our competitive position. we maintain strategic relationships with third parties to market certain of our products and support certain product functionality. if we are unsuccessful in establishing or maintaining our strategic relationships with these third parties, our ability to compete in the marketplace, to reach new customers and geographies or to grow our revenues would be impaired and our operating results would suffer.
we offer our products on a variety of pc, tablet and mobile devices. recent trends have shown a technological shift from personal computers to tablet and mobile devices. if we cannot continue to adapt our products to tablet and mobile devices our business could be harmed. to the extent that consumer purchases of these devices slow down, or to the extent that significant demand arises for our products or competitive products on other platforms before we offer our products on those platforms, our business could be harmed. releases of new devices or operating systems may make it more difficult for our products to perform or may require significant costs in order for us to adapt our solutions to such devices or operating systems. these potential costs and delays could harm our business.
introduction of new products, services and business models by existing and new competitors could harm our competitive position and results of operations.
the markets for our products and services are characterized by intense competition, evolving industry standards, emerging business and distribution models, disruptive technology developments, short product and service life cycles, price sensitivity on the part of customers, and frequent new product introductions, including alternatives with limited functionality available at lower costs or free of charge. any of these factors could create downward pressure on pricing and gross margins and could adversely affect our renewal and upgrade rates, as well as our ability to attract new customers. our future success will depend on our ability to enhance our existing products and services, introduce new products and services on a timely and cost-effective basis, meet changing customer needs, extend our core technology into new applications, and anticipate and respond to emerging standards, business models, software delivery methods and other technological developments, such as the evolution and emergence of digital application marketplaces as a direct sales and software delivery environment. these digital application marketplaces often have
exclusive distribution for certain platforms, which may make it more difficult for us to compete in these markets. if any competing products, services or operating systems (that don't support our solutions) achieve widespread acceptance, our operating results could suffer. in addition, consolidation has occurred among some of the competitors in the markets in which we compete. further consolidations in these markets may subject us to increased competitive pressures and may therefore harm our results of operations.
for additional information regarding our competition and the risks arising out of the competitive environment in which we operate, see the section entitled "competition" contained in item 1 of this report.
if we fail to successfully manage transitions to new business models and markets, our results of operations could suffer.
we often release new offerings and employ new software and services delivery methods in connection with our diversification into new business models and markets. it is uncertain whether these strategies will prove successful or whether we will be able to develop the necessary infrastructure and business models more quickly than our competitors. market acceptance of new product and service offerings will be dependent on our ability (1) to include functionality and usability that address certain customer requirements where our operating history is less extensive, and (2) to optimally price our products in light of marketplace conditions, our costs and customer demand. new product and service offerings could subject us to increased risk of liability related to the provision of services as well as cause us to incur significant technical, legal or other costs. for example, with our cloud-based services and subscription-based licensing models, such as creative cloud, we have entered markets that may not be fully accustomed to cloud-based subscription offerings. market acceptance of such services is affected by a variety of factors, including information security, reliability, performance, social/community engagement, local government regulations regarding online services and user-generated content, the sufficiency of technological infrastructure to support our products in certain geographies, customer concerns with entrusting a third party to store and manage their data, public concerns regarding data privacy and the enactment of laws or regulations that restrict our ability to provide such services to customers in the u.s. or internationally. if we are unable to respond to these threats, our business could be harmed.
from time to time we open-source certain of our technology initiatives, provide broader open access to our technology, license certain of our technology on a royalty-free basis, and release selected technology for industry standardization. additionally, customer requirements for open standards or open-source products could impact adoption or use of some of our products or services. to the extent we incorrectly predict customer requirements for such products or services, or if there is a delay in market acceptance of such products or services, our business could be harmed.
we also devote significant resources to the development of technologies and service offerings in markets where our operating history is less extensive. these new offerings and markets may require a considerable investment of technical, financial, compliance and sales resources, and a scalable organization. some of our competitors may have advantages over us due to their larger presence, larger developer network, deeper market experience and larger sales, consulting and marketing resources. if we are unable to successfully establish new offerings in light of the competitive environment, our results of operations could suffer.
the increased emphasis on a cloud strategy may give rise to risks that could harm our business.
over the past several years, our business has shifted away from pre-packaged creative software to focus on a subscription model that prices and delivers our products in a way that differs from the historical pricing and delivery methods of our creative tools. these changes reflect a significant shift from perpetual license sales and distribution of our software in favor of providing our customers the right to access certain of our software in a hosted environment or use downloaded software for a specified subscription period. this cloud strategy requires continued investment in product development and cloud operations, and may give rise to a number of risks, including the following:
•   if customers desire only perpetual licenses or to purchase or renew only point product subscriptions rather than acquire the entire creative cloud offering, our subscription sales may lag behind our expectations;
•   our cloud strategy may raise concerns among our customer base, including concerns regarding changes to pricing over time, service availability, information security of a cloud solution and access to files while offline or once a subscription has expired;
•   small businesses and hobbyists may turn to competitive or open-source offerings;
•   we may be unsuccessful in maintaining our target pricing, new seat adoption and projected renewal rates; we may select a target price that is not optimal and could negatively affect our sales or earnings; or we may have to rely heavily on promotional rates to achieve target seat adoption, which could reduce average revenue per user;
•   the removal of general availability of creative suite 6 on a perpetual licensing basis from legacy shrinkwrap and volume licensing channels, which we announced during our second quarter of fiscal 2014, could further reduce our revenues in the short term as our business shifts to subscription revenue that is recognized ratably; and
subscription offerings and etlas create risks related to the timing of revenue recognition.
although the subscription model is designed to increase the number of customers who purchase our products and services and create a recurring revenue stream that is more predictable, it creates certain risks related to the timing of revenue recognition and potential reductions in cash flows.
a portion of the subscription-based revenue we report each quarter results from the recognition of deferred revenue relating to subscription agreements entered into during previous quarters. a decline in new or renewed subscriptions in any period may not be immediately reflected in our reported financial results for that period, but may result in a decline in our revenue in future quarters. if we were to experience significant downturns in subscription sales and renewal rates, our reported financial results might not reflect such downturns until future periods. our subscription model could also make it difficult for us to rapidly increase our revenues from subscription-based or hosted services through additional sales in any period, as revenue from new customers will be recognized over the applicable subscription term. further, any increases in sales under our subscription sales model could result in decreased revenues over the short term if they are offset by a decline in sales from perpetual license customers.
additionally, in connection with our sales efforts to enterprise customers and our use of etlas, a number of factors could affect our revenues, including longer than expected sales and implementation cycles, potential deferral of revenue due to multiple-element revenue arrangements and alternate licensing arrangements. if any of our assumptions about revenue from our new businesses or our addition of a subscription-based model prove incorrect, our actual results may vary materially from those anticipated, estimated or projected.
we may be unable to predict subscription renewal rates and the impact these rates may have on our future revenue and operating results.
the hosted business model we utilize in our adobe marketing cloud offerings typically involves selling services on a subscription basis pursuant to service agreements that are generally one to three years in length. our individual creative cloud subscription agreements are generally month-to-month or one year in length, etlas for our digital media products and services are generally three years in length, and subscription agreements for other products and services may provide for shorter or longer terms. although many of our service and subscription agreements contain automatic renewal terms, our customers have no obligation to renew their subscriptions for our services after the expiration of their initial subscription period, and some customers elect not to renew. we cannot provide assurance that these subscriptions will be renewed at the same or higher level of service, for the same number of seats/licenses or for the same duration of time, if at all. moreover, under certain circumstances, some of our customers have the right to cancel their service agreements prior to the expiration of the terms of their agreements. we cannot be assured that we will be able to accurately predict future customer renewal rates. our customers' renewal rates may decline or fluctuate as a result of a number of factors, including their level of satisfaction with our services, the reliability (including uptime) of our subscription services, the prices of our services, the perceived information security of our systems and services, the prices of services offered by our competitors, mergers and acquisitions affecting our customer base, reductions in our customers' spending levels, or declines in customer activity as a result of economic downturns or uncertainty in financial markets. if our customers do not renew their subscriptions for our services or if they renew on less favorable terms to us, our revenues may decline.
our future growth is also affected by our ability to sell additional features and services to our current customers, which depends on a number of factors, including customers' satisfaction with our products and services, the prices of our offerings and general economic conditions. if our efforts to cross-sell and upsell to our customers are unsuccessful, the rate at which our business grows might decline.
security vulnerabilities in our products and systems could lead to reduced revenues or to liability claims.
maintaining the security of our products, computers and networks is a critical issue for us and our customers. security researchers, criminal hackers and other third parties regularly develop new techniques to penetrate computer and network security measures and, as we have previously disclosed, certain parties have in the past managed to breach certain of our data-security systems and misused certain of our systems and software in order to access our end users' authentication and payment information. in addition, cyber-attackers also develop and deploy viruses, worms and other malicious software programs, some of which may be specifically designed to attack our products, systems, computers or networks. sophisticated hardware and operating system applications that we produce or procure from third parties may contain defects in design or manufacture, including bugs and other problems that could unexpectedly compromise the security of the system. the costs to eliminate or alleviate cyber or other security
problems, bugs, viruses, worms, malicious software programs and security vulnerabilities are significant, and our efforts to address these problems may not be successful and could result in interruptions, delays, cessation of service and loss of existing or potential customers that may impede our sales, manufacturing, distribution or other critical functions, as well as potential liability to the company.
outside parties have in the past and may in the future attempt to fraudulently induce our employees or users of our services to disclose sensitive information via illegal electronic spamming, phishing or other tactics. unauthorized parties may also attempt to gain physical access to one of our facilities in order to infiltrate our information systems. these actual and potential breaches of our security measures and the accidental loss, inadvertent disclosure or unauthorized dissemination of proprietary information or sensitive, personal or confidential data about us, our employees or our customers, including the potential loss or disclosure of such information or data as a result of hacking, fraud, trickery or other forms of deception, could expose us, our employees, our customers or the individuals affected to a risk of loss or misuse of this information. this may result in litigation and potential liability or fines for us, or governmental inquiry and oversight, any of which could damage our brand and reputation, possibly impeding our present and future success in retaining and attracting new customers and thereby requiring time and resources to repair our brand image.
these problems affect our products and services in particular because cyber-attackers tend to focus their efforts on the most popular offerings (such as those with large bases of users), and we expect them to continue to do so. critical vulnerabilities may be identified in certain of our applications. these vulnerabilities could cause such applications to crash and could allow an attacker to take control of the affected system, which could result in liability to us or limit our ability to conduct our business and deliver our products and services to customers. we devote significant resources to address security vulnerabilities through engineering more secure products, enhancing security and reliability features in our products and systems, code hardening, conducting rigorous penetration tests, deploying security updates to address security vulnerabilities and improving our incident response time, but these security vulnerabilities cannot be totally eliminated. the cost of these steps could reduce our operating margins, and we may be unable to implement these measures quickly enough to prevent cyber-attackers from gaining unauthorized access into our systems and products. despite our preventative efforts, actual or perceived security vulnerabilities in our products and systems may harm our reputation or lead to claims against us (and have in the past lead to such claims), and could lead some customers to seek to return products, to stop using certain services, to reduce or delay future purchases of products or services, or to use competing products or services. if we do not make the appropriate level of investment in our technology systems or if our systems become out-of-date or obsolete and we are not able to deliver the quality of data security customers require, our business could be adversely affected. customers may also increase their expenditures on security measures designed to protect their existing computer systems from attack, which could delay adoption of new technologies. further, if we or our customers are subject to a future attack, or our technology is utilized in a third-party attack, it may be necessary for us to take additional extraordinary measures and make additional expenditures to take appropriate responsive and preventative steps. any of these events could adversely affect our revenues or margins. moreover, delayed sales, lower margins or lost customers resulting from the disruptions of cyber-attacks or preventative measures could adversely affect our financial results, stock price and reputation.
some of our lines of business rely on us or our third-party service providers to host and deliver services and data, and any interruptions or delays in these hosted services, security or privacy breaches, or failures in data collection could expose us to liability and harm our business and reputation.
some of our lines of business and services, including our online store at adobe.com, creative cloud, other hosted digital media offerings and our adobe marketing cloud solutions, rely on hardware and services hosted and controlled directly by us or by our third-party service providers. we do not have redundancy for all of our systems, many of our critical applications reside in only one of our data centers, and our disaster recovery planning may not account for all eventualities. if our business relationship with a third-party provider of hosting or content delivery services is negatively affected, or if one of our content delivery suppliers were to terminate their agreement with us, we might not be able to deliver the corresponding hosted offerings to our customers, which could subject us to reputational harm and cause us to lose customers and future business, reducing our revenues.
we hold large amounts of customer data, some of which is hosted in third-party facilities. a security incident at those facilities or ours may compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of customer data. unauthorized access to customer data stored on our computers or networks may be obtained through break-ins, breach of our secure network by an unauthorized party, employee theft or misuse, or other misconduct. it is also possible that unauthorized access to customer data may be obtained through inadequate use of security controls by customers. while our products and services provide and support strong password controls, ip restriction and account controls, their use is controlled by the customer. accounts created with weak passwords could allow cyber-attackers to gain access to customer data. additionally, failure by customers to remove accounts of their own employees, or granting of accounts by the customer in an uncontrolled manner, may allow for access by former or unauthorized customer representatives. if there were an inadvertent disclosure of personal information, or if a third party were to gain unauthorized access to the personal information we possess on behalf of our customers, our operations could be disrupted, our reputation could be damaged and we could be subject to claims or other liabilities. in addition, such perceived or actual unauthorized disclosure of
the information we collect or breach of our security could damage our reputation, result in the loss of customers and harm our business.
because of the large amount of data that we collect and manage on behalf of our customers, it is possible that hardware or software failures or errors in our systems (or those of our third-party service providers) could result in data loss or corruption or cause the information that we collect to be incomplete or contain inaccuracies that our customers regard as significant. furthermore, our ability to collect and report data may be delayed or interrupted by a number of factors, including access to the internet, the failure of our network or software systems, security breaches or significant variability in visitor traffic on customer websites. in addition, computer viruses may harm our systems causing us to lose data, and the transmission of computer viruses could expose us to litigation. we may also find, on occasion, that we cannot deliver data and reports to our customers in near real time because of a number of factors, including significant spikes in customer activity on their websites or failures of our network or software. if we supply inaccurate information or experience interruptions in our ability to capture, store and supply information in near real time or at all, our reputation could be harmed and we could lose customers, or we could be found liable for damages or incur other losses.
uncertainty about current and future economic conditions and other adverse changes in general political conditions in any of the major countries in which we do business could adversely affect our operating results.
as our business has grown, we have become increasingly subject to the risks arising from adverse changes in economic and political conditions, both domestically and globally. uncertainty about current and future economic and political conditions on us, our customers, suppliers and partners, makes it difficult for us to forecast operating results and to make decisions about future investments. if economic growth in countries where we do business slows, customers may delay or reduce technology purchases, advertising spending or marketing spending. this could result in reductions in sales of our products and services, longer sales cycles, slower adoption of new technologies and increased price competition. our customers include government entities, including the u.s. federal government, and if spending cuts impede the government's ability to purchase our products and solutions, our revenues could decline. deterioration in economic conditions in any of the countries in which we do business could also cause slower or impaired collections on accounts receivable, which may adversely impact our liquidity and financial condition.
there could be a number of effects from a financial institution credit crisis on our business, which could include impaired credit availability and financial stability of our customers, including our distribution partners and channels. a disruption in the financial markets may also have an effect on our derivative counterparties and could also impair our banking partners on which we rely for operating cash management. any of these events would likely harm our business, results of operations and financial condition.
political instability in or around any of the major countries in which we do business would also likely harm our business, results of operations and financial condition.
we may not realize the anticipated benefits of past or future acquisitions, and integration of these acquisitions may disrupt our business and management.
we may not realize the anticipated benefits of an acquisition of a company, division, product or technology, each of which involves numerous risks. these risks include:
•   difficulty in integrating the operations and personnel of the acquired company;
•   difficulty in effectively integrating the acquired technologies, products or services with our current technologies, products or services;
•   entry into markets in which we have minimal prior experience and where competitors in such markets have stronger market positions;
•   disruption of our ongoing business and distraction of our management and other employees from other opportunities and challenges;
•   inability to retain personnel of the acquired business;
•   inability to retain key customers, distributors, vendors and other business partners of the acquired business;
•   inability to achieve the financial and strategic goals for the acquired and combined businesses;
•   inability to take advantage of anticipated tax benefits as a result of unforeseen difficulties in our integration activities;
•   incurring acquisition-related costs or amortization costs for acquired intangible assets that could impact our operating results;
•   potential additional exposure to fluctuations in currency exchange rates;
•   potential additional costs of bringing acquired companies into compliance with laws and regulations applicable to us as a multi-national corporation;
•   potential impairment of our relationships with employees, customers, partners, distributors or third-party providers of our technologies, products or services;
•   potential failure of the due diligence processes to identify significant problems, liabilities or other challenges of an acquired company or technology, including but not limited to, issues with the acquired company's intellectual property, product quality or product architecture, data back-up and security (including security from cyber-attacks), privacy practices, revenue recognition or other accounting practices, employee, customer or partner issues or legal and financial contingencies;
•   exposure to litigation or other claims in connection with, or inheritance of claims or litigation risk as a result of, an acquisition, including but not limited to claims from terminated employees, customers, former stockholders or other third parties;
•   incurring significant exit charges if products or services acquired in business combinations are unsuccessful;
•   potential inability to assert that internal controls over financial reporting are effective;
•   potential inability to obtain, or obtain in a timely manner, approvals from governmental authorities, which could delay or prevent such acquisitions;
•   potential delay in customer and distributor purchasing decisions due to uncertainty about the direction of our product and service offerings; and
•   potential incompatibility of business cultures.
mergers and acquisitions of high technology companies are inherently risky. if we do not complete an announced acquisition transaction or integrate an acquired business successfully and in a timely manner, we may not realize the benefits of the acquisition to the extent anticipated, and in certain circumstances an acquisition could harm our financial position.
we may incur substantial costs enforcing or acquiring intellectual property rights and defending against third-party claims as a result of litigation or other proceedings.
in connection with the enforcement of our own intellectual property rights, the acquisition of third-party intellectual property rights, or disputes relating to the validity or alleged infringement of third-party intellectual property rights, including patent rights, we have been, are currently and may in the future be subject to claims, negotiations or complex, protracted litigation. intellectual property disputes and litigation are typically costly and can be disruptive to our business operations by diverting the attention and energies of management and key technical personnel. although we have successfully defended or resolved many past lawsuits and other disputes, we may not prevail in the future. third-party intellectual property disputes, including those initiated by patent assertion entities, could subject us to significant liabilities, require us to enter into royalty and licensing arrangements on unfavorable terms, prevent us from licensing certain of our products or offering certain of our services, subject us to injunctions restricting our sale of products or services, cause severe disruptions to our operations or the markets in which we compete, or require us to satisfy indemnification commitments with our customers, including contractual provisions under various license arrangements and service agreements. in addition, we may incur significant costs in acquiring the necessary third-party intellectual property rights for use in our products, in some cases to fulfill contractual obligations with our customers. any of these occurrences could significantly harm our business.
although we vigorously defend our intellectual property rights and attempt to combat unlicensed copying, access and use of software and intellectual property through a variety of techniques, preventing unauthorized use or infringement of our rights is inherently difficult. we actively combat software piracy as we enforce our intellectual property rights, but we nonetheless lose significant revenue due to illegal use of our software. if piracy activities continue at historical levels or increase, they may further harm our business.
additionally, we take significant measures to protect the secrecy of our confidential information and trade secrets, including our source code. despite these measures, as we have previously disclosed, hackers have managed to access certain of our source code and may obtain access in the future. if unauthorized disclosure of our source code occurs through security breach, cyber-attack or otherwise, we could potentially lose future trade secret protection for that source code. the loss of future trade secret protection could make it easier for third parties to compete with our products by copying functionality, which could cause us to lose customers and could adversely affect our revenue and operating margins. we also seek to protect our confidential information and trade secrets through the use of non-disclosure agreements with our customers, contractors, vendors and partners. however, there is a risk that our confidential information and trade secrets may be disclosed or published without our authorization, and in these situations enforcing our rights may be difficult or costly.
increasing regulatory focus on privacy issues and expanding laws and regulations could impact our new business models and expose us to increased liability.
our industry is highly regulated, including for privacy and data security. we are also expanding our business in countries that have more stringent data protection laws than those in the u.s. privacy laws globally are changing and evolving. governments, privacy advocates and class action attorneys are increasingly scrutinizing how companies collect, process, use, store, share or transmit personal data. new laws and industry self-regulatory codes have been enacted and more are being considered that may affect our ability to reach current and prospective customers, to understand how our products and services are being used, to respond to customer requests allowed under the laws, and to implement our new business models effectively. these new laws and regulations would similarly affect our competitors as well as our customers. any perception of our practices or products as an invasion of privacy, whether or not consistent with current regulations and industry practices, may subject us to public criticism, class action lawsuits, reputational harm or claims by regulators, industry groups or other third parties, all of which could disrupt our business and expose us to increased liability. additionally, both laws regulating privacy, as well as third-party products addressing perceived privacy concerns, could affect the functionality of and demand for our products, thereby harming our revenues.
on behalf of certain customers, we collect and store anonymous and personal information derived from the activities of end users with various channels, including traditional websites, mobile websites and applications, email interactions, direct mail, point of sale, text messaging and call centers (collectively, "channels"). this enables us to provide such customers with reports on aggregated anonymous or personal information from and about end-user interactions with various channels in the manner specifically directed by each such individual customer. federal, state and foreign governments and agencies have adopted or are considering adopting laws regarding the collection, use and disclosure of this information. our compliance with privacy laws and regulations and our reputation among the public body of end users depend in part on such customers' adherence to privacy laws and regulations and their use of our services in ways consistent with such end users' expectations. we also rely on representations made to us by customers that their own use of our services and the information they provide to us via our services do not violate any applicable privacy laws, rules and regulations or their own privacy policies. we ask customers to represent to us that they provide their end users the opportunity to "opt-out" of the information collection associated with our services, as applicable. we do not formally audit such customers to confirm compliance with these representations. if these representations are false or if such customers do not otherwise comply with applicable privacy laws, we could face adverse publicity and possible legal or other regulatory action. in addition, some countries are considering enacting laws that would expand the scope of privacy-related obligations required of service providers, such as adobe, that would require additional compliance expense and increased liability.
we process a significant volume of transactions on a daily basis in both our digital marketing and digital media businesses. due to the size and volume of transactions that we handle, effective processing systems and controls are essential; but even the most sophisticated systems and processes may not be effective in preventing all errors. the systems supporting our business are comprised of multiple technology platforms that may be difficult to scale. if we are unable to effectively manage these systems and processes, we may be unable to process customer data in an accurate, reliable and timely manner, which may harm our customer relationships or results of operations.
failure to manage our sales and distribution channels and third-party customer service and technical support providers effectively could result in a loss of revenue and harm to our business.
we contract with a number of software distributors, none of which is individually responsible for a material amount of our total net revenue for any recent period. if any single agreement with one of our distributors were terminated, we believe we could make arrangements with new or existing distributors to distribute our products without a substantial disruption to our business; however, any prolonged delay in securing a replacement distributor could have a negative short-term impact on our results of operations.
successfully managing our indirect channel efforts to reach various customer segments for our products and services is a complex process across the broad range of geographies where we do business or plan to do business. our distributors and other channel partners are independent businesses that we do not control. notwithstanding the independence of our channel partners, we face potential legal risk and reputational harm from the activities of these third parties including, but not limited to, export control violations, workplace conditions, corruption and anti-competitive behavior. although we have undertaken efforts to reduce these third-party risks, they remain present. we cannot be certain that our distribution channel will continue to market or sell our products effectively. if our distribution channel is not successful, we may lose sales opportunities, customers and revenues.
our distributors also sell our competitors' products, and if they favor our competitors' products for any reason, they may fail to market our products as effectively or to devote resources necessary to provide effective sales, which would cause our results to suffer. we also distribute some products through our oem channel, and if our oems decide not to bundle our applications on their devices, our results could suffer.
in addition, the financial health of our distributors and our continuing relationships with them are important to our success. some of these distributors may be adversely impacted by changes to our business model or unable to withstand adverse changes in current economic conditions, which could result in insolvency and/or the inability of such distributors to obtain credit to finance purchases of our products. in addition, weakness in the end-user market could negatively affect the cash flows of our distributors who could, in turn, delay paying their obligations to us, which would increase our credit risk exposure. our business could be harmed if the financial condition of some of these distributors substantially weakened and we were unable to timely secure replacement distributors.
we also sell certain of our products and services through our direct sales force. risks associated with this sales channel include longer sales and collection cycles associated with direct sales efforts, challenges related to hiring, retaining and motivating our direct sales force, and substantial amounts of training for sales representatives, including regular updates to cover new and upgraded systems, products and services. moreover, recent hires may not become as productive as we would like, as in most cases it takes a significant period of time before they achieve full productivity. our business could be seriously harmed if these expansion efforts do not generate a corresponding significant increase in revenues and we are unable to achieve the efficiencies we anticipate. in addition, the loss of key sales employees could impact our customer relationships and future ability to sell to certain accounts covered by such employees.
we also provide products and services, directly and indirectly, to a variety of governmental entities, both domestically and internationally. risks associated with licensing and selling products and services to governmental entities include longer sales cycles, varying governmental budgeting processes and adherence to complex procurement regulations and other government-specific contractual requirements. ineffectively managing these risks could result in various civil and criminal penalties and administrative sanctions, including termination of contracts, payment of fines, and suspension or debarment from future government business, as well as harm to our reputation.
we outsource a substantial portion of our customer service and technical support activities to third-party service providers. we rely heavily on these third-party customer service and technical support representatives working on our behalf, and we expect to continue to rely heavily on third parties in the future. this strategy provides us with lower operating costs and greater flexibility, but also presents risks to our business due to the fact that we may not be able to influence the quality of support as directly as we would be able to do if our own employees performed these activities. our customers may react negatively to providing information to, and receiving support from, third-party organizations, especially if based overseas. if we encounter problems with our third-party customer service and technical support providers, our reputation may be harmed and we could lose customers and associated revenues.
certain of our enterprise offerings have long and complex sales cycles.
sales cycles for some of our enterprise offerings, including our adobe marketing cloud solutions and etlas in our digital media business, are long and complex. the complexity in these sales cycles is due to a number of factors, including:
•   the need for our sales representatives to educate customers about the use and benefit of our large-scale deployments of our products and services, including technical capabilities, security features, potential cost savings and return on investment;
•   the desire of large and medium size organizations to undertake significant evaluation processes to determine their technology requirements prior to making information technology expenditures;
•   the need for our representatives to spend a significant amount of time assisting potential customers in their testing and evaluation of our products and services;
•   the negotiation of large, complex, enterprise-wide contracts, as often required by our and our customers' business and legal representatives;
•   the need for our customers to obtain requisition approvals from various decision makers within their organizations; and
•   customer budget constraints, economic conditions and unplanned administrative delays.
we spend substantial time and expense on our sales efforts without any assurance that potential customers will ultimately purchase our solutions.  as we target our sales efforts at larger enterprise customers, these trends are expected to continue.  additionally, our enterprise sales pattern has historically been uneven, where a higher percentage of a quarter's total sales occur during the final weeks of each quarter, which is common in our industry.  our long sales cycle for these products makes it difficult to predict when a given sales cycle will close.
catastrophic events may disrupt our business.
we are a highly automated business and rely on our network infrastructure and enterprise applications, internal technology systems and our website for our development, marketing, operational, support, hosted services and sales activities. in addition, some of our businesses rely on third-party hosted services, and we do not control the operation of third-party data center facilities serving our customers from around the world, which increases our vulnerability. a disruption, infiltration or failure of these systems or third-party hosted services in the event of a major earthquake, fire, flood, power loss, telecommunications failure, software or hardware malfunctions, cyber-attack, war, terrorist attack or other catastrophic event could cause system interruptions, reputational harm, loss of intellectual property, delays in our product development, lengthy interruptions in our services, breaches of data security and loss of critical data. any of these events could prevent us from fulfilling our customers' orders. our corporate headquarters, a significant portion of our research and development activities, certain of our data centers and certain other critical business operations are located in the san francisco bay area, and additional facilities where we conduct significant operations are located in the salt lake valley area, both of which are near major earthquake faults. we have developed certain disaster recovery plans and backup systems to reduce the potentially adverse effect of such events, but a catastrophic event that results in the destruction or disruption of any of our data centers or our critical business or information technology systems could severely affect our ability to conduct normal business operations and, as a result, our future operating results could be adversely affected.
net revenue, margin or earnings shortfalls or the volatility of the market generally may cause the market price of our stock to decline.
the market price for our common stock has in the past experienced significant fluctuations and may fluctuate significantly in the future. a number of factors may affect the market price for our common stock, including:
•   shortfalls in our revenue, margins, earnings, the number of paid creative cloud subscribers, arr, bookings within our adobe marketing cloud business or other key performance metrics;
•   changes in estimates or recommendations by securities analysts;
•   the announcement of new products, product enhancements or service introductions by us or our competitors;
•   the loss of a large customer or our inability to increase sales to existing customers or attract new customers;
•   variations in our or our competitors' results of operations, changes in the competitive landscape generally and developments in our industry; and
•   unusual events such as significant acquisitions, divestitures, litigation, general socio-economic, regulatory, political or market conditions and other factors, including factors unrelated to our operating performance.
we are subject to risks associated with compliance with laws and regulations globally which may harm our business.
we are a global company subject to varied and complex laws, regulations and customs domestically and internationally. these laws and regulations relate to a number of aspects of our business, including trade protection, import and export control, data and transaction processing security, payment card industry data security standards, records management, user-generated content hosted on websites we operate, privacy practices, corporate governance, employee and third-party complaints, gift policies, conflicts of interest, employment and labor relations laws, securities regulations and other regulatory requirements affecting trade and investment. the application of these laws and regulations to our business is often unclear and may at times conflict. compliance with these laws and regulations may involve significant costs or require changes in our business practices that result in reduced revenue and profitability. non-compliance could also result in fines, damages, criminal sanctions against us, our officers or our
employees, prohibitions on the conduct of our business, and damage to our reputation. we incur additional legal compliance costs associated with our global operations and could become subject to legal penalties if we fail to comply with local laws and regulations in u.s. jurisdictions or in foreign countries, which laws and regulations may be substantially different from those in the u.s. in many foreign countries, particularly in those with developing economies, it is common to engage in business practices that are prohibited by u.s. regulations applicable to us, including the foreign corrupt practices act. although we implement policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with these laws, there can be no assurance that all of our employees, contractors and agents, as well as those companies to which we outsource certain of our business operations, including those based in or from countries where practices that violate such u.s. laws may be customary, will not take actions in violation of our internal policies. any such violation, even if prohibited by our internal policies, could have an adverse effect on our business.
as a global business that generates approximately 44% of our total revenue from sales to customers outside of the americas, we are subject to a number of risks, including:
•   changes in government preferences for software procurement;
•   international economic, political and labor conditions;
•   increased financial accounting and reporting burdens and complexities;
•   unexpected changes in, or impositions of, legislative or regulatory requirements;
•   changes in laws governing the free flow of data across international borders;
•   failure of laws to protect our intellectual property rights adequately;
•   the imposition of governmental economic sanctions on countries in which we do business or where we plan to expand our business;
•   operating in locations with a higher incidence of corruption and fraudulent business practices; and
•   other factors beyond our control, including terrorism, war, natural disasters and pandemics.
if sales to any of our customers outside of the americas are delayed or canceled because of any of the above factors, our revenues may decline.
in addition, approximately 52% of our employees are located outside the u.s. accordingly, we are exposed to changes in laws governing our employee relationships in various u.s. and foreign jurisdictions, including laws and regulations regarding wage and hour requirements, fair labor standards, employee data privacy, unemployment tax rates, workers' compensation rates, citizenship requirements and payroll and other taxes, which likely would have a direct impact on our operating costs. we may continue to expand our international operations and international sales and marketing activities. expansion in international markets has required, and will continue to require, significant management attention and resources. we may be unable to scale our infrastructure effectively or as quickly as our competitors in these markets, and our revenues may not increase to offset these expected increases in costs and operating expenses, which would cause our results to suffer.
our operating results are subject to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. we attempt to mitigate a portion of these risks through foreign currency hedging, based on our judgment of the appropriate trade-offs among risk, opportunity and expense. we have established a hedging program to partially hedge our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations for various currencies. we regularly review our hedging program and make adjustments as necessary based on the factors discussed above. our hedging activities may not offset more than a portion of the adverse financial impact resulting from unfavorable movement in foreign currency exchange rates, which could adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations.
we have issued $1.5 billion of notes in a debt offering and may incur other debt in the future, which may adversely affect our financial condition and future financial results.
we have $1.5 billion in senior unsecured notes outstanding. we also have a $1.0 billion revolving credit facility, which is currently undrawn. this debt may adversely affect our financial condition and future financial results by, among other things:
•   requiring the dedication of a portion of our expected cash from operations to service our indebtedness, thereby reducing the amount of expected cash flow available for other purposes, including capital expenditures and acquisitions; and
•   limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and our industry.
our senior unsecured notes and revolving credit facility impose restrictions on us and require us to maintain compliance with specified covenants. our ability to comply with these covenants may be affected by events beyond our control. if we breach any of the covenants and do not obtain a waiver from the lenders or noteholders, then, subject to applicable cure periods, any outstanding indebtedness may be declared immediately due and payable.
in addition, changes by any rating agency to our credit rating may negatively impact the value and liquidity of both our debt and equity securities, as well as the potential costs associated with a refinancing of our debt. under certain circumstances, if our credit ratings are downgraded or other negative action is taken, the interest rate payable by us under our revolving credit facility could increase. downgrades in our credit ratings could also restrict our ability to obtain additional financing in the future and could affect the terms of any such financing.
changes in, or interpretations of, accounting principles could have a significant impact on our financial position and results of operations.
we prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america ("gaap"). these principles are subject to interpretation by the sec and various bodies formed to interpret and create appropriate accounting principles. a change in these principles can have a significant effect on our reported results and may even retroactively affect previously reported transactions. additionally, the adoption of new or revised accounting principles may require that we make significant changes to our systems, processes and controls.
for example, the u.s.-based financial accounting standards board ("fasb") is currently working together with the international accounting standards board ("iasb") on several projects to further align accounting principles and facilitate more comparable financial reporting between companies who are required to follow gaap under sec regulations and those who are required to follow international financial reporting standards outside of the u.s. these efforts by the fasb and iasb may result in different accounting principles under gaap that may result in materially different financial results for us in areas including, but not limited to, principles for recognizing revenue and lease accounting. additionally, significant changes to gaap resulting from the fasb's and iasb's efforts may require that we change how we process, analyze and report financial information and that we change financial reporting controls.
under gaap, we review our goodwill and amortizable intangible assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. gaap requires us to test for goodwill impairment at least annually. factors that may be considered a change in circumstances indicating that the carrying value of our goodwill or amortizable intangible assets may not be recoverable include declines in stock price, market capitalization or cash flows and slower growth rates in our industry. we could be required to record a significant charge to earnings in our financial statements during the period in which any impairment of our goodwill or amortizable intangible assets were determined, negatively impacting our results of operations.
changes in, or interpretations of, tax rules and regulations may adversely affect our effective tax rates.
we are a united states-based multinational company subject to tax in multiple u.s. and foreign tax jurisdictions. a significant portion of our foreign earnings for the current fiscal year were earned by our irish subsidiaries. in addition to providing for u.s. income taxes on earnings from the united states, we provide for u.s. income taxes on the earnings of foreign subsidiaries unless the subsidiaries' earnings are considered permanently reinvested outside the united states. while we do not anticipate changing our intention regarding permanently reinvested earnings, if certain foreign earnings previously treated as permanently reinvested are repatriated, the related u.s. tax liability may be reduced by any foreign income taxes paid on these earnings.
our income tax expense has differed from the tax computed at the u.s. federal statutory income tax rate due primarily to discrete items and to earnings considered as permanently reinvested in foreign operations. unanticipated changes in our tax rates could affect our future results of operations. our future effective tax rates could be unfavorably affected by changes in the tax rates
in jurisdictions where our income is earned, by changes in, or our interpretation of, tax rules and regulations in the jurisdictions in which we do business, by unanticipated decreases in the amount of earnings in countries with low statutory tax rates, by lapses of the availability of the u.s. research and development tax credit, or by changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities. the united states, countries in the european union and other countries where we do business have been considering changes in relevant tax, accounting and other laws, regulations and interpretations, including changes to tax laws applicable to corporate multinationals such as adobe. these potential changes could adversely affect our effective tax rates or result in other costs to us.
in addition, we are subject to the continual examination of our income tax returns by the u.s. internal revenue service ("irs") and other domestic and foreign tax authorities, including a current examination by the irs of our fiscal 2010, 2011 and 2012 tax returns. these tax examinations are expected to focus on our intercompany transfer pricing practices as well as other matters. we regularly assess the likelihood of outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes and have reserved for potential adjustments that may result from the current examinations. there can be no assurance that the final determination of any of these examinations will not have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial position.
if we are unable to recruit and retain key personnel our business may be harmed.
much of our future success depends on the continued service and availability of our senior management. these individuals have acquired specialized knowledge and skills with respect to adobe. the loss of any of these individuals could harm our business, especially in the event that we have not been successful in developing adequate succession plans. our business is also dependent on our ability to retain, hire and motivate talented, highly skilled personnel across all levels of our organization. experienced personnel in the information technology industry are in high demand and competition for their talents is intense in many areas where our employees are located. if we are unable to continue to successfully attract and retain key personnel, our business may be harmed. effective succession planning is also a key factor for our long-term success. our failure to enable the effective transfer of knowledge and facilitate smooth transitions of our key employees could adversely affect our long-term strategic planning and execution.
we believe that a critical contributor to our success to date has been our corporate culture, which we have built to foster innovation, teamwork and employee satisfaction. as we grow, including from the integration of employees and businesses acquired in connection with previous or future acquisitions, we may find it difficult to maintain important aspects of our corporate culture, which could negatively affect our ability to retain and recruit personnel who are essential to our future success.
our investment portfolio may become impaired by deterioration of the capital markets.
our cash equivalent and short-term investment portfolio as of november 28, 2014 consisted of corporate bonds and commercial paper, u.s. agency securities and u.s. treasury securities, money market mutual funds, municipal securities, time deposits and foreign government securities. we follow an established investment policy and set of guidelines to monitor and help mitigate our exposure to interest rate and credit risk. the policy sets forth credit quality standards and limits our exposure to any one issuer, as well as our maximum exposure to various asset classes.
should financial market conditions worsen in the future, investments in some financial instruments may pose risks arising from market liquidity and credit concerns. in addition, any deterioration of the capital markets could cause our other income and expense to vary from expectations. as of november 28, 2014, we had no material impairment charges associated with our short-term investment portfolio, and although we believe our current investment portfolio has little risk of material impairment, we cannot predict future market conditions or market liquidity, or credit availability, and can provide no assurance that our investment portfolio will remain materially unimpaired.
item 7.  management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto.
acquisitions during fiscal 2014, we completed a business acquisition which was not material to our consolidated financial statements.
during fiscal 2013, we completed our acquisitions of privately held neolane, a leader in cross-channel campaign management technology for $616.7 million and privately held behance, an online social media platform to showcase and discover creative work for $111.1 million. during fiscal 2013, we integrated neolane and behance into our digital marketing and digital media reportable segments, respectively. the impact of these acquisitions was not material to our consolidated financial statements.
during fiscal 2012, we completed the acquisition of privately held efficient frontier, a multi-channel digital ad buying and optimization company for $374.7 million. during fiscal 2012, we began integrating efficient frontier into our digital marketing segment.
see note 2 of our notes to consolidated financial statements for further information regarding these acquisitions.
critical accounting policies and estimates in preparing our consolidated financial statements in accordance with gaap and pursuant to the rules and regulations of the sec, we make assumptions, judgments and estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. we base our assumptions, judgments and estimates on historical experience and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. actual results could differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. on a regular basis, we evaluate our assumptions, judgments and estimates. we also discuss our critical accounting policies and estimates with the audit committee of the board of directors.
we believe that the assumptions, judgments and estimates involved in the accounting for revenue recognition, business combinations, goodwill impairment and income taxes have the greatest potential impact on our consolidated financial statements. these areas are key components of our results of operations and are based on complex rules requiring us to make judgments and estimates, so we consider these to be our critical accounting policies. historically, our assumptions, judgments and estimates relative to our critical accounting policies have not differed materially from actual results.
revenue recognition our revenue is derived from the licensing of perpetual, time-based and subscription software products, associated software maintenance and support plans, non-software related hosted services, consulting services, training and technical support.
we recognize revenue when all four revenue recognition criteria have been met: persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, we have delivered the product or performed the service, the fee is fixed or determinable and collection is probable. determining whether and when some of these criteria have been satisfied often involves assumptions and judgments that can have a significant impact on the timing and amount of revenue we report.
we enter into multiple element revenue arrangements in which a customer may purchase a combination of software, upgrades, maintenance and support, hosted services and consulting.
for our software and software-related multiple element arrangements, we must: (1) determine whether and when each element has been delivered; (2) determine whether undelivered products or services are essential to the functionality of the delivered products and services; (3) determine the fair value of each undelivered element using vendor-specific objective evidence ("vsoe"), and (4) allocate the total price among the various elements. vsoe of fair value is used to allocate a portion of the price to the undelivered elements and the residual method is used to allocate the remaining portion to the delivered elements. absent vsoe, revenue is deferred until the earlier of the point at which vsoe of fair value exists for any undelivered element or until all elements of the arrangement have been delivered. however, if the only undelivered element is maintenance and support, the entire arrangement fee is recognized ratably over the performance period. changes in assumptions or judgments or changes to the elements in a software arrangement could cause a material increase or decrease in the amount of revenue that we report in a particular period.
we determine vsoe for each element based on historical stand-alone sales to third parties or from the stated renewal rate for the elements contained in the initial arrangement. in determining vsoe, we require that a substantial majority of the selling prices for a product or service fall within a reasonably narrow pricing range.
we have established vsoe for our software maintenance and support services, custom software development services, consulting services and training, when such services are sold optionally with software licenses.
for multiple-element arrangements containing our non-software services, we must: (1) determine whether and when each element has been delivered; (2) determine the fair value of each element using the selling price hierarchy of vsoe of selling price, third-party evidence ("tpe") of selling price or best-estimated selling price ("besp"), as applicable; and (3) allocate the total price among the various elements based on the relative selling price method.
for multiple-element arrangements that contain both software and non-software elements, we allocate revenue to software or software-related elements as a group and any non-software elements separately based on the selling price hierarchy. we determine the selling price for each deliverable using vsoe of selling price, if it exists, or tpe of selling price. if neither vsoe nor tpe of selling price exist for a deliverable, we use besp. once revenue is allocated to software or software-related elements as a group, we recognize revenue in conformance with software revenue accounting guidance. revenue is recognized when revenue recognition criteria are met for each element.
we are generally unable to establish vsoe or tpe for non-software elements and as such, we use besp. besp is generally used for offerings that are not typically sold on a stand-alone basis or for new or highly customized offerings. we determine besp for a product or service by considering multiple factors including, but not limited to, major product groupings, geographies, market conditions, competitive landscape, internal costs, gross margin objectives and pricing practices. pricing practices taken into consideration include historic contractually stated prices, volume discounts where applicable and our price lists. we must estimate certain royalty revenue amounts due to the timing of securing information from our customers. while we believe we can make reliable estimates regarding these matters, these estimates are inherently subjective. accordingly, our assumptions and judgments regarding future products and services as well as our estimates of royalty revenue could differ from actual events, thus materially impacting our financial position and results of operations.
product revenue is recognized when the above criteria are met. we reduce the revenue recognized for estimated future returns, price protection and rebates at the time the related revenue is recorded. in determining our estimate for returns and in accordance with our internal policy regarding global channel inventory which is used to determine the level of product held by our distributors on which we have recognized revenue, we rely upon historical data, the estimated amount of product inventory in our distribution channel, the rate at which our product sells through to the end user, product plans and other factors. our estimated provisions for returns can vary from what actually occurs. product returns may be more or less than what was estimated. the amount of inventory in the channel could be different than what is estimated. our estimate of the rate of sell-through for product in the channel could be different than what actually occurs. there could be a delay in the release of our products. these factors and unanticipated changes in the economic and industry environment could make our return estimates differ from actual returns, thus impacting our financial position and results of operations.
in the future, actual returns and price protection may exceed our estimates as unsold products in the distribution channels are exposed to rapid changes in consumer preferences, market conditions or technological obsolescence due to new platforms, product updates or competing products. while we believe we can make reliable estimates regarding these matters, these estimates are inherently subjective. accordingly, if our estimates change, our returns and price protection reserves would change, which would impact the total net revenue we report.
we recognize revenues for hosted services that are based on a committed number of transactions ratably beginning on the date the customer commences use of our services and continuing through the end of the customer term. over-usage fees, and fees billed based on the actual number of transactions from which we capture data, are billed in accordance with contract terms as these fees are incurred. we record amounts that have been invoiced in accounts receivable and in deferred revenue or revenue, depending on whether the revenue recognition criteria have been met.
our consulting revenue is recognized on a time and materials basis and is measured monthly based on input measures, such as on hours incurred to date compared to total estimated hours to complete, with consideration given to output measures, such as contract milestones, when applicable.
business combinations we allocate the purchase price of acquired companies to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed, assumed equity awards, as well as to in-process research and development based upon their estimated fair values at the acquisition
date. the purchase price allocation process requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions, especially at the acquisition date with respect to intangible assets, deferred revenue obligations and equity assumed.
although we believe the assumptions and estimates we have made are reasonable, they are based in part on historical experience and information obtained from the management of the acquired companies and are inherently uncertain. examples of critical estimates in valuing certain of the intangible assets we have acquired or may acquire in the future include but are not limited to:
•   future expected cash flows from software license sales, subscriptions, support agreements, consulting contracts and acquired developed technologies and patents;
•   expected costs to develop the in-process research and development into commercially viable products and estimated cash flows from the projects when completed;
•   the acquired company's trade name and trademarks as well as assumptions about the period of time the acquired trade name and trademarks will continue to be used in the combined company's product portfolio; and
in connection with the purchase price allocations for our acquisitions, we estimate the fair value of the deferred revenue obligations assumed. the estimated fair value of the support obligations is determined utilizing a cost build-up approach. the cost build-up approach determines fair value by estimating the costs related to fulfilling the obligations plus a normal profit margin. the estimated costs to fulfill the obligations are based on the historical costs related to fulfilling the obligations.
in connection with the purchase price allocations for our acquisitions, we estimate the fair value of the equity awards assumed. the estimated fair value is determined utilizing a modified binomial option pricing model which assumes employees exercise their stock options when the share price exceeds the strike price by a certain dollar threshold. if the acquired company has significant historical data on their employee's exercise behavior, then this threshold is determined based upon the acquired company's history. otherwise, our historical exercise experience is used to determine the exercise threshold. zero coupon yields implied by u.s. treasury issuances, implied volatility for our common stock and our historical forfeiture rate are other inputs to the binomial model.
unanticipated events and circumstances may occur which may affect the accuracy or validity of such assumptions, estimates or actual results.
goodwill impairment we complete our goodwill impairment test on an annual basis, during the second quarter of our fiscal year, or more frequently, if changes in facts and circumstances indicate that an impairment in the value of goodwill recorded on our balance sheet may exist. in order to estimate the fair value of goodwill, we typically estimate future revenue, consider market factors and estimate our future cash flows. based on these key assumptions, judgments and estimates, we determine whether we need to record an impairment charge to reduce the value of the asset carried on our balance sheet to its estimated fair value. assumptions, judgments and estimates about future values are complex and often subjective. they can be affected by a variety of factors, including external factors such as industry and economic trends, and internal factors such as changes in our business strategy or our internal forecasts. although we believe the assumptions, judgments and estimates we have made in the past have been reasonable and appropriate, different assumptions, judgments and estimates could materially affect our reported financial results.
we completed our annual impairment test in the second quarter of fiscal 2014 and determined there was no impairment. the results of our annual impairment test indicate there is no significant risk of future material goodwill impairment in any of our reporting units.
accounting for income taxes we use the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes. under this method, income tax expense is recognized for the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year. in addition, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities, and for operating losses and tax credit carryforwards. management must make assumptions, judgments and estimates to determine our current provision for income taxes and also our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance to be recorded against a deferred tax asset.
our assumptions, judgments and estimates relative to the current provision for income taxes take into account current tax laws, our interpretation of current tax laws and possible outcomes of current and future audits conducted by foreign and domestic
tax authorities. we have established reserves for income taxes to address potential exposures involving tax positions that could be challenged by tax authorities. in addition, we are subject to the continual examination of our income tax returns by the irs and other domestic and foreign tax authorities, including a current examination by the irs of our fiscal 2010, 2011 and 2012 tax returns. we expect future examinations to focus on our intercompany transfer pricing practices as well as other matters. we regularly assess the likelihood of outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes and have reserved for potential adjustments that may result from the current examinations. we believe such estimates to be reasonable; however, the final determination of any of these examinations could significantly impact the amounts provided for income taxes in our consolidated financial statements.
our assumptions, judgments and estimates relative to the value of a deferred tax asset take into account predictions of the amount and category of future taxable income, such as income from operations or capital gains income. actual operating results and the underlying amount and category of income in future years could render our current assumptions, judgments and estimates of recoverable net deferred taxes inaccurate. any of the assumptions, judgments and estimates mentioned above could cause our actual income tax obligations to differ from our estimates, thus materially impacting our financial position and results of operations.
we are a united states-based multinational company subject to tax in multiple u.s. and foreign tax jurisdictions. a significant portion of our foreign earnings for the current fiscal year were earned by our irish subsidiaries. in addition to providing for u.s. income taxes on earnings from the u.s., we provide for u.s. income taxes on the earnings of foreign subsidiaries unless the subsidiaries' earnings are considered permanently reinvested outside the u.s. while we do not anticipate changing our intention regarding permanently reinvested earnings, if certain foreign earnings previously treated as permanently reinvested are repatriated, the related u.s. tax liability may be reduced by any foreign income taxes paid on these earnings.
our income tax expense has differed from the tax computed at the u.s. federal statutory income tax rate due primarily to discrete items and to earnings considered as permanently reinvested in foreign operations. unanticipated changes in our tax rates could affect our future results of operations. our future effective tax rates could be unfavorably affected by changes in the tax rates in jurisdictions where our income is earned, by changes in, or our interpretation of, tax rules and regulations in the jurisdictions in which we do business, by unanticipated decreases in the amount of earnings in countries with low statutory tax rates, by lapses of the availability of the u.s. research and development tax credit, or by changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities. the united states, countries in the european union and other countries where we do business have been considering changes in relevant tax, accounting and other laws, regulations and interpretations, including changes to tax laws applicable to corporate multinationals such as adobe. these potential changes could adversely affect our effective tax rates or result in other costs to us.
recent accounting pronouncements not yet effective on may 28, 2014, the fasb issued asu no. 2014-09, revenue from contracts with customers, requiring an entity to recognize the amount of revenue to which it expects to be entitled for the transfer of promised goods or services to customers. the updated standard will replace most existing revenue recognition guidance in u.s. gaap when it becomes effective and permits the use of either the retrospective or cumulative effect transition method. early adoption is not permitted. the updated standard becomes effective for us in the first quarter of fiscal 2018. we have not yet selected a transition method and we are currently evaluating the effect that the updated standard will have on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.
with the exception of the new revenue standard discussed above, there have been no new accounting pronouncements not yet effective that have significance, or potential significance, to our consolidated financial statements.
results of operations overview of 2014
for fiscal 2014, we reported financial results consistent with the continued execution of our long-term plans for our two strategic growth areas, digital media and digital marketing, while continuing to market and license a broad portfolio of products and solutions.
in our digital media segment, we are a market leader with creative cloud, our subscription-based offering for creating and publishing content and applications. creative cloud, first delivered in may 2012, is our next-generation offering that supersedes our historical model of licensing our creative products with perpetual licenses. creative cloud delivers value through more frequent product updates, storage and access to user files stored in the cloud with syncing of files across users' machines, community-based features and services through our acquisition of behance in december 2012, app creation capabilities and lower entry point pricing for cost-sensitive customers.
we offer creative cloud for individuals and for teams, and we enable larger enterprise customers to acquire creative cloud capabilities through enterprise term license agreements ("etlas"). the three creative cloud offerings address the multiple
routes to market we use to license our creative software to targeted customers. adoption of creative cloud has transformed our business model and we continue to expect this to drive higher long-term revenue growth through an expansion of our customer base by acquiring new users through a lower cost of entry and delivery of additional features and value, as well as keeping existing customers current on our latest release. this model drives our revenue to be more recurring and predictable as revenue is recognized ratably.
we continue to implement strategies that will accelerate awareness, consideration and purchase of subscriptions to our creative cloud offering. these strategies include increasing the value creative cloud users receive, as well as targeted promotions and offers that attract past customers and potential users to try out and ultimately subscribe to creative cloud. additionally, in may 2013 we announced we would exclusively deliver new creative product innovations and features to creative cloud subscribers, and that adobe creative suite 6 ("cs6"), which was released in may 2012, would be the last major update we provide for perpetual licensees. in the first half of fiscal 2014, we announced the removal of general availability of cs6 on a perpetual licensing basis from legacy shrinkwrap and volume licensing channels. we still offer cs6 through our adobe.com website and in certain markets.
because of the shift towards creative cloud subscriptions and etlas, perpetual revenue for cs6 has declined, and by the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014 revenue from perpetual licensing of our creative professional products was immaterial.
during fiscal 2014, we continued to experience strong adoption of our creative cloud subscription offerings which has caused our creative cloud subscription revenue to increase as compared to the year-ago period.
to assist with an understanding of this transition, we are using certain performance metrics to assess the health and trajectory of our overall digital media segment. these metrics include the total number of current paid subscriptions and annualized recurring revenue ("arr"). arr should be viewed independently of revenue, deferred revenue and unbilled deferred revenue as arr is a performance metric and is not intended to be combined with any of these items. we plan to adjust our reported arr on an annual basis to reflect any material exchange rates changes.
for our creative business, we define creative arr as the sum of:
•   the number of current subscriptions, multiplied by the average subscription price paid per user per month, multiplied by twelve months; plus,
•   twelve months of contract value of etlas where the revenue is ratably recognized over the life of the contract; plus
•   twelve months of adobe digital publishing suite contract value where the revenue is ratably recognized.
we exited fiscal 2014 with 3.454 million paid creative cloud subscriptions, up 140% from 1.439 million at the end of fiscal 2013. total creative arr exiting fiscal 2014 was $1.68 billion, up from $801 million at the end of fiscal 2013.
our digital media segment also includes our document services products and solutions, including acrobat, acrobat cloud services and echosign e-signing solution. in fiscal 2014 we continued to drive solid adoption of our acrobat family of products primarily through license agreements with enterprise customers. we also drove strong adoption of subscription-based services including our acrobat cloud services. combined, adoption of acrobat through etlas and our document services subscription offerings helped grow document services arr to $271 million exiting fiscal 2014, up from $143 million at the end of fiscal 2013.
total digital media arr, which we define as the sum of creative arr and document services arr, grew to $1.95 billion at the end of fiscal 2014, up from $944 million at the end of fiscal 2013, demonstrating the progress we have made with the transformation of our business to a more recurring, ratable and predictable revenue model. our reported arr results in fiscal 2014 are based on currency rates set at the start of the fiscal year and held constant throughout the year. revaluing our ending arr for fiscal 2014 using currency rates at the beginning of fiscal 2015, our digital media arr at the end of fiscal 2014 would be $1.88 billion or approximately $72 million lower than arr reported above.
we are a market leader in the fast-growing category addressed by our digital marketing segment. our adobe marketing cloud includes six solutions addressing the expanding needs of marketers, the newest of which is adobe campaign-a cross-channel campaign management tool that we added to our portfolio with the acquisition of neolane during the third quarter of fiscal 2013.
revenue from adobe marketing cloud increased 15% during fiscal 2014 compared to the year-ago period. helping to drive this performance was strong adoption across our portfolio of adobe marketing cloud solutions including solid growth of our adobe experience manager ("aem") and adobe campaign offerings.
aem and adobe campaign have historically been licensed by our customers as on premise offerings where license revenue has been recognized at the time of the transactions. during fiscal 2014, we saw increased customer adoption of term-based licensing
of our aem and adobe campaign solutions where revenue is booked and recognized ratably. we believe this is resulting in larger customer engagements, more predictable revenue as well as higher long-term revenue growth.
in evaluating our adobe marketing cloud revenue performance, we believe it is important to understand this licensing and revenue mix shift that is occurring with aem and adobe campaign. in fiscal 2013, approximately 45% of our aem and adobe campaign contracts were term-based. entering fiscal 2014, based on our goal of migrating more of these solutions to be term-based, we expected a mix of approximately 60% term-based contracts for aem and adobe campaign this fiscal year. due to strong execution and customer demand, we saw an acceleration of term-based adoption of aem and adobe campaign in fiscal 2014 and these solutions achieved approximately 75% term-based contracts this year.
financial performance summary for fiscal 2014
•   consistent with our strategy, during fiscal 2014, our subscription revenue as a percentage of total revenue increased to 50% from 28% and 15% compared with fiscal 2013 and 2012, respectively, as we have transitioned more of our business to a subscription-based model.
•   we exited fiscal 2014 with 3.454 million paid creative cloud subscriptions, up 140% from 1.439 million at the end of fiscal 2013.
•   total digital media arr of approximately $1.95 billion as of november 28, 2014 increased by $1.00 billion, or 106%, from $944 million as of november 29, 2013. the change in our digital media arr was primarily due to increases in the number of paid creative cloud individual and team subscriptions and adoption of our enterprise creative cloud offering through our etlas.
•   adobe marketing cloud revenue of $1.17 billion increased by $154.3 million, or 15%, during fiscal 2014, from $1.02 billion in fiscal 2013, and $212.3 million, or 26%, during fiscal 2013 from $803.7 million in fiscal 2012. the increases were primarily due to strong adoption of our aem offering and the addition of neolane which we acquired in the third quarter of fiscal 2013.
•   our total deferred revenue of $1.16 billion as of november 28, 2014 increased by $326.5 million, or 39% from $828.8 million as of november 29, 2013, primarily due to increases in creative cloud subscriptions and etlas. to a lesser extent, new contracts and existing contract renewals for our adobe marketing cloud services contributed to this increase as our retention rates for adobe marketing cloud services have been improving slightly over time.
•   cost of revenue of $622.1 million increased by $35.5 million, or 6%, during fiscal 2014, from $586.6 million in fiscal 2013, and $102.8 million, or 21%, during fiscal 2013 from $483.8 million in fiscal 2012. these increases were primarily due to increased hosting and server costs associated with our subscription and saas offerings, costs associated with compensation and related benefits driven by additional headcount and royalty costs.
•   operating expenses of $3.11 billion increased by $66.3 million, or 2%, during fiscal 2014, from $3.05 billion in fiscal 2013, and $306.3 million, or 11%, in fiscal 2013 from $2.74 billion in fiscal 2012. these increases were primarily due to increased costs associated with compensation and related benefits.
•   net income of $268.4 million decreased by $21.6 million, or 7%, during fiscal 2014 from $290.0 million in fiscal 2013, and $542.8 million, or 65%, during fiscal 2013 from $832.8 million in fiscal 2012.
•   net cash flow from operations of $1.29 billion during fiscal 2014 increased by $135.8 million, or 12%, from $1.15 billion during fiscal 2013 primarily due to cash inflows associated with the increases in deferred revenue and taxes payable, offset in part by lower net income. net cash flow from operations during fiscal 2013 decreased by $347.9 million, or 23%, from $1.50 billion during fiscal 2012 primarily due to lower net income.

fiscal 2014 revenue compared to fiscal 2013 revenue digital media revenue from digital media decreased slightly during fiscal 2014 as compared to fiscal 2013. the slight decrease was primarily driven by declines in revenue associated with distribution of third-party software downloads and hobbyist products launched in fiscal 2013. with respect to the hobbyist product revenue decline, we are actively migrating customers to our creative cloud photography plan for which revenue is recognized ratably. largely offsetting these decreases were increases in creative cloud and document services revenue.
revenue related to our creative professional products, which includes our creative cloud, creative suite editions and cs point products, increased during fiscal 2014 as compared to fiscal 2013 due to increases in revenue from subscriptions and etlas, partially offset by the decrease in revenue from cs point products and creative suite editions as we discontinued the general availability of our perpetually licensed cs6 products in the second quarter of 2014.
revenue associated with our other creative products decreased during fiscal 2014 as compared to fiscal 2013 primarily due to decreases associated with distribution of third-party software downloads and hobbyist products launched in fiscal 2013. additionally, actively migrating customers to our creative cloud photography plan is also contributing to the year-over-year decline in revenue. these decreases were offset in part by increases in revenue associated with our digital publishing suite.
for our creative offerings, the total number of perpetual units licensed decreased while the number of subscription units licensed increased during fiscal 2014 as compared to fiscal 2013. unit average selling prices for our perpetual units licensed decreased during fiscal 2014 as compared to fiscal 2013.
document services revenue, which includes our acrobat product family, increased during fiscal 2014 as compared with the year-ago period primarily due to increases in our acrobat cloud services revenue. the increases were slightly offset by decreases due to our continued shift to etlas.
within document services, excluding large enterprise license agreements, the number of units licensed decreased while the unit average selling prices remained stable during fiscal 2014, as compared with the year-ago period.
digital marketing revenue from digital marketing increased $126.3 million during fiscal 2014 as compared to fiscal 2013 due to continued revenue growth associated with our adobe marketing cloud, which increased 15% during fiscal 2014 as compared with the year-ago period. contributing to this increase was adobe campaign and the strong adoption of aem.
fiscal 2013 revenue compared to fiscal 2012 revenue digital media revenue from digital media decreased $476.0 million during fiscal 2013 as compared to fiscal 2012, primarily due to continued strong adoption of creative cloud and etlas as we continued to transition more of our business to a subscription-based model.
revenue related to our creative professional products, which include our creative suite editions and cs point products as well as creative cloud, decreased during fiscal 2013 as compared to fiscal 2012 due to continued customer adoption of creative cloud subscription offerings, released in may 2012, for which revenue is recognized over time.
revenue associated with our other creative products increased during fiscal 2013 as compared to fiscal 2012, primarily due to increases associated with distribution of third-party software downloads and our digital publishing suite. these increases were partially offset by decreases in revenue associated with our hobbyist products.
for our creative offerings, the total number of perpetual units licensed decreased while the number of subscription units licensed increased during fiscal 2013 as compared to fiscal 2012. unit average selling prices for our perpetual units licensed decreased during the year ended fiscal 2013 as compared to fiscal 2012.
document services revenue, which includes our acrobat product family, decreased slightly during fiscal 2013 as compared to fiscal 2012, primarily due to the continued shift to etlas offset by increased acrobat cloud services revenue including revenue generated from our echosign e-signing service.
within document services, excluding large enterprise license agreements, the number of units licensed decreased while the unit average selling prices increased during fiscal 2013 as compared to fiscal 2012.
digital marketing revenue from digital marketing increased $143.8 million during fiscal 2013 as compared to fiscal 2012. the increase was primarily due to continued revenue growth associated with our adobe marketing cloud, which increased 26% during fiscal 2013, as compared to the year ago period and includes adobe campaign revenue from our acquisition of neolane in the third quarter of fiscal 2013. the increase noted above was partially offset by expected declines in revenue associated with our legacy products during fiscal 2013.

fiscal 2014 revenue by geography compared to fiscal 2013 revenue by geography overall revenue during fiscal 2014 as compared to fiscal 2013 increased in the americas and emea. revenue in the americas increased during fiscal 2014 as compared to the year-ago period due to increases in digital media and digital marketing revenue. revenue in emea increased during fiscal 2014 as compared to the year-ago period primarily due to increases in digital marketing revenue. digital media and print and publishing revenue in emea remained relatively stable during fiscal 2014 compared to the year-ago period. despite the strengthening of the u.s. dollar against the euro and the british pound during the latter part of 2014, the overall weakening of the u.s. dollar against these currencies during fiscal 2014 also caused revenue in emea to increase as compared to the year-ago period. within the americas and emea, the fluctuations in revenue by reportable segment were attributable to the factors noted in the segment information above.
revenue in apac decreased during fiscal 2014 as compared to the year-ago period primarily as a result of decreases in digital media revenue due to slower adoption of creative cloud in japan compared to other countries and the strengthening of the u.s. dollar against the japanese yen and other asian currencies during fiscal 2014 as compared to the year-ago period. digital marketing and print and publishing revenue in apac remained relatively stable in fiscal 2014 compared to the year-ago period.
fiscal 2013 revenue by geography compared to fiscal 2012 revenue by geography revenue declined across all geographies during fiscal 2013 as compared to fiscal 2012. revenue in the americas and apac decreased during fiscal 2013 due to decreases in digital media and print and publishing revenue, offset in part by increases in digital marketing revenue. revenue in emea decreased during fiscal 2013 due to decreases in digital media revenue, offset in part by increases in digital marketing and print and publishing revenue. within each geographical region, the fluctuations in revenue by reportable segment were attributable to the factors noted in the segment information above.
included in the overall change in revenue for fiscal 2014 and fiscal 2013 were impacts associated with foreign currency as shown below. our currency hedging program is used to mitigate a portion of the foreign currency impact to revenue.
revenue impact:                       increase/(decrease)
total revenue impact      (9.6    )            (63.4    )
hedging impact:
total hedging impact      18.7                  36.0
total impact              $9.1                $(27.4    )
during fiscal 2014, the u.s. dollar strengthened against the japanese yen and other asian currencies causing revenue in apac measured in u.s. dollar equivalents to decrease compared with the year-ago period. this decrease was offset by the favorable impact to revenue measured in emea currencies as the u.s. dollar weakened against the euro and the british pound for the majority of fiscal 2014. our emea and yen currency hedging programs resulted in hedging gains during fiscal 2014.
during fiscal 2013, the u.s. dollar strengthened against the japanese yen and other asian currencies causing revenue in apac measured in u.s. dollar equivalents to decrease compared with the year-ago period. this decrease was partially offset by the favorable impact to revenue measured in emea currencies as the u.s. dollar generally weakened against these currencies. our emea and yen currency hedging programs resulted in hedging gains during fiscal 2013.
see note 18 of our notes to consolidated financial statements for further geographic information.
product backlog the actual amount of product backlog at any particular time may not be a meaningful indicator of future business prospects. shippable backlog is comprised of unfulfilled orders, excluding those associated with new product releases, those pending credit review and those not shipped due to the application of our global inventory policy. we had minimal shippable backlog at the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014 and fiscal 2013. we expect that our shippable backlog will continue to be insignificant in future periods.
the deferred revenue balance on our consolidated balance sheet does not represent the total contract value of annual or multi-year, non-cancellable subscription agreements. unbilled deferred revenue represents expected future billings which are contractually committed under our existing subscription, saas and managed services agreements that have not been invoiced and are not recorded in deferred revenue within our financial statements. our presentation of unbilled deferred revenue backlog may differ from that of other companies in the industry. as of november 28, 2014, we had unbilled deferred revenue backlog of approximately $1.7 billion of which approximately 60% to 65% is not reasonably expected to be billed during fiscal 2015. as of november 29, 2013, we had unbilled deferred revenue backlog of approximately $1.0 billion.
we expect that the amount of unbilled deferred revenue backlog will change from period to period due to certain factors, including the timing and duration of large customer subscription, saas and managed service agreements, varying billing cycles of these agreements, the timing of customer renewals, the timing of when unbilled deferred revenue backlog is to be billed, changes in customer financial circumstances and foreign currency fluctuations. additionally, the unbilled deferred revenue backlog for multi-year subscription agreements that are billed annually is typically higher at the beginning of the contract period, lower prior to renewal and typically increases when the agreement is renewed. accordingly, fluctuations in unbilled deferred revenue backlog may not be a reliable indicator of future business prospects and the related revenue associated with these contractual commitments.

cost of product revenue decreased during fiscal 2014 as compared to fiscal 2013 primarily due to decreases in amortization of purchased intangibles and technology license arrangements, cost of sales and royalty costs, slightly offset by an increase in excess and obsolete inventory. amortization of purchased intangibles and technology license arrangements decreased as compared with the year-ago period as we entered into certain technology licensing arrangements for which payments of $26.5 million related to historical use of certain technology licensing arrangements were expensed as cost of product revenue during fiscal 2013. cost of sales decreased as compared with the year-ago period due to decreases in the number of perpetual units sold and associated packaging costs as we continue to focus our development and sales efforts on creative cloud. royalty cost decreased as compared to the year-ago period primarily due to decreases in revenue from our perpetual offerings. excess and obsolete inventory increased as compared to the year-ago period as a result of changes in reserve requirements for cs6 shrink boxes as we have discontinued the general availability of cs6 on a perpetual licensing basis.
cost of product revenue increased during fiscal 2013 as compared to fiscal 2012 primarily due to an increase in amortization of purchased intangibles and technology license arrangements offset by decreases in cost of sales and excess and obsolete inventory. amortization of purchased intangibles and technology license arrangements increased as we entered into certain technology licensing arrangements totaling $51.8 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2013. of this cost, an estimated $25.3 million was related to future licensing rights and was capitalized and is being amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives ranging from five to ten years. the remaining cost of approximately $26.5 million was related to historical use of licensing rights and was expensed as cost of product revenue in fiscal 2013. in connection with certain of these licensing arrangements, we have the ability to acquire additional rights to use technology in the future. cost of sales primarily decreased due to a decline in the number of perpetual units sold and packaging costs associated with our cs6 products as we focus our creative development efforts on our creative cloud offering. excess and obsolete inventory decreased due to decreased reserve requirements for cs6 as we continue to transition to more of a subscription-based model.
subscription cost of subscription revenue consists of third-party royalties and expenses related to operating our network infrastructure, including depreciation expenses and operating lease payments associated with computer equipment, data center costs, salaries and related expenses of network operations, implementation, account management and technical support personnel, amortization of intangible assets and allocated overhead. we enter into contracts with third-parties for the use of their data center facilities and our data center costs largely consist of the amounts we pay to these third parties for rack space, power and similar items.
cost of subscription revenue increased due to the following:

cost of subscription revenue increased during fiscal 2014 as compared to fiscal 2013 primarily due to data center costs, compensation cost and related benefits, deprecation expense, and royalty cost. data center costs increased as compared with the year-ago period primarily due to higher transaction volumes in our adobe marketing cloud and creative cloud services. compensation cost and related benefits increased as compared to the year-ago period primarily due to additional headcount in fiscal 2014, including from our acquisition of neolane in the third quarter of fiscal 2013. depreciation expense increased as compared to the year-ago period primarily due to higher capital expenditures in recent periods as we continue to invest in our network and data center infrastructure to support the growth of our business. royalty cost increased primarily due to increases in subscriptions and downloads of our saas offerings.
cost of subscription revenue increased during fiscal 2013 as compared to fiscal 2012 primarily due to increased hosted server costs and amortization of purchased intangibles. hosted server costs increased primarily due to increases in data center costs related to higher transaction volumes in our adobe marketing cloud and creative cloud services, depreciation expense from higher capital expenditures in prior years and compensation and related benefits driven by additional headcount. amortization of purchased intangibles increased primarily due to increased amortization of intangible assets purchased associated with our acquisitions of behance and neolane in fiscal 2013.
services and support cost of services and support revenue is primarily comprised of employee-related costs and associated costs incurred to provide consulting services, training and product support.
cost of services and support revenue increased during fiscal 2014 as compared to fiscal 2013 primarily due to increases in compensation and related benefits driven by additional headcount and third-party fees related to training and consulting services provided to our customers.

research and development, sales and marketing and general and administrative expenses the increase in research and development and general and administrative expenses during fiscal 2014 as compared to fiscal 2013 is primarily due to increases in cash incentive and stock-based compensation. the increase in stock-based compensation was driven by a change in the vesting term for stock awards granted as part of our annual review process beginning in fiscal 2013, which decreased the term from four years to three years. the increase in sales and marketing expense during fiscal 2014 as compared to fiscal 2013 is primarily due to compensation and related benefits associated with additional headcount.
the increase in research and development, sales and marketing and general and administrative expenses during fiscal 2013 as compared to fiscal 2012 is primarily due to higher cash incentive compensation program achievement in fiscal 2013, increases in stock-based compensation expense due to higher share prices during fiscal 2013 as compared to fiscal 2012 as well as a shorter vesting term which decreased from four years to three years for stock awards granted as part of our annual review process during fiscal 2013.
research and development research and development expenses consist primarily of salary and benefit expenses for software developers, contracted development efforts, related facilities costs and expenses associated with computer equipment used in software development.
research and development expenses increased due to the following:

we believe that investments in research and development, including the recruiting and hiring of software developers, are critical to remain competitive in the marketplace and are directly related to continued timely development of new and enhanced products. we will continue to focus on long-term opportunities available in our end markets and make significant investments in the development of our application, tool and service offerings.
sales and marketing sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of salary and benefit expenses, sales commissions, travel expenses and related facilities costs for our sales, marketing, order management and global supply chain management personnel. sales and marketing expenses also include the costs of programs aimed at increasing revenue, such as advertising, trade shows, public relations and other market development programs. sales and marketing expenses for fiscal 2014 are lower than what was reported in our december 11, 2014 earnings press release by $19.5 million reflecting an update to our sales commission expense based on information received following the date of our press release.

see note 15 of our notes to the consolidated financial statements for further information regarding the loss contingency.
professional and consulting fees increased during fiscal 2013 as compared to fiscal 2012 primarily due to increased professional and legal fees including those associated with the attacks on our network discovered in september 2013.
restructuring and other charges during the past several years, we have initiated various restructuring plans. during fiscal 2014, in connection with our recent fiscal 2014 restructuring plan, we recorded $19.4 million associated with termination benefits and closing redundant facilities. in connection with our other restructuring plans, we recorded insignificant charges associated with closing redundant facilities. we also recorded minor adjustments for changes in previous estimates during the fiscal year.
during fiscal 2013, management approved a plan to sell land, building and other assets located in waltham, massachusetts (the "waltham property assets") with a total carrying amount of $47.4 million. as of may 31, 2013, we classified the waltham property assets as held for sale at $23.6 million representing their fair value, net of estimated costs to sell which was the lesser of the fair value less cost to sell or carrying amount of the assets. as a result, we recorded a write-down of $23.8 million during fiscal 2013. in september 2013, we finalized the sale of the waltham property assets for net proceeds of $24.3 million which approximated the carrying value of the assets at the time of sale.
also during fiscal 2013, in connection with our fiscal 2011 restructuring plan and other restructuring plans, we recorded $6.3 million associated with termination benefits and closing redundant facilities. we also recorded $3.0 million in net favorable employee termination and facility related adjustments for changes in previous estimates during the fiscal year.
during fiscal 2012, in connection with our fiscal 2011 restructuring plan and other restructuring plans, we recorded $17.4 million associated with termination benefits and closing redundant facilities. we also recorded $20.3 million in net favorable employee termination and facility related adjustments for changes in previous estimates during the fiscal year.
see note 10 of our notes to consolidated financial statements for further information regarding our restructuring plans.
amortization of purchased intangibles during the last several years, we have completed a number of business combinations and asset acquisitions. as a result of these acquisitions, we purchased intangible assets that are being amortized over their estimated useful lives ranging from one to fourteen years.
amortization expense increased 7% during fiscal 2013 as compared to fiscal 2012 primarily due to amortization expense associated with intangible assets purchased through our acquisitions of behance and neolane in fiscal 2013.

interest and other income (expense), net interest and other income (expense), net consists primarily of interest earned on cash, cash equivalents and short-term fixed income investments. interest and other income (expense), net also includes gains and losses on fixed income investments and foreign exchange gains and losses other than any gains recorded to revenue from hedging euros, british pounds and yen currencies.
interest and other income (expense), net increased in fiscal 2014 as compared to fiscal 2013 primarily due to decreased foreign currency losses and increased realized gains on fixed income investments. the increases were partially offset by decreased interest income on our investment in lease receivable due to the purchase of the east and west towers during fiscal 2014. see note 15 of our notes to consolidated financial statements for further details regarding our investment in lease receivables.
interest and other income (expense), net increased in fiscal 2013 as compared to fiscal 2012 primarily due to decreased foreign exchange losses.
interest expense decreased during fiscal 2014 as compared to fiscal 2013 due to the favorable impact of the interest rate swaps. see notes 5 and 13 of our notes to consolidated financial statements for further details regarding our interest rate swaps.
investment gains (losses), net investment gains (losses), net consists principally of realized gains or losses from the sale of marketable equity investments, other-than-temporary declines in the value of marketable and non-marketable equity securities and unrealized holding gains and losses associated with our deferred compensation plan assets (classified as trading securities) and gains and losses associated with our direct and indirect investments in privately held companies.

during fiscal 2014, total investment gains (losses), net increased to net gains primarily due to write-downs for other-than-temporary declines in value of our direct investments in privately held companies in fiscal 2013 that did not recur in fiscal 2014, offset in part by a decrease in net gains related to our trading securities.
during fiscal 2013, total investment gains (losses), net decreased to net losses primarily due to a decrease in net realized gains from the sale of marketable equity securities and an increase in write-downs for other-than-temporary declines in value of our direct investments in privately held companies.

our effective tax rate increased by approximately seven percentage points during fiscal 2014 as compared to fiscal 2013. the increase was primarily due to the expiration of the federal research and development tax credit in december 2013 and stronger domestic profits for fiscal 2014.
our effective tax rate decreased by approximately seven percentage points during fiscal 2013 as compared to fiscal 2012. the decrease is primarily related to the reinstatement of the u.s. research and development credit and tax benefits recognized as a result of the completion of certain income tax examinations.
in december 2014, the united states congress passed an extension of the federal research and development tax credit through december 31, 2014. as a result, we expect that our income tax provision for the first quarter of fiscal 2015 will include a discrete tax benefit which will reduce our effective tax rate for the quarter and to a lesser extent the effective annual tax rate.
we are a united states-based multinational company subject to tax in multiple u.s. and foreign tax jurisdictions. a significant portion of our foreign earnings for the current fiscal year were earned by our irish subsidiaries. in addition to providing for u.s. income taxes on earnings from the u.s., we provide for u.s. income taxes on the earnings of foreign subsidiaries unless the subsidiaries' earnings are considered permanently reinvested outside the u.s. while we do not anticipate changing our intention regarding permanently reinvested earnings, if certain foreign earnings previously treated as permanently reinvested are repatriated, the related u.s. tax liability may be reduced by any foreign income taxes paid on these earnings. currently, there are a significant amount of foreign earnings upon which u.s. income taxes have not been provided. see note 9 of our notes to the consolidated financial statements for further information on our provision for income taxes.
accounting for uncertainty in income taxes the gross liability for unrecognized tax benefits at november 28, 2014 was $148.8 million, exclusive of interest and penalties. if the total unrecognized tax benefits at november 28, 2014 were recognized in the future, $136.2 million of unrecognized tax benefits would decrease the effective tax rate, which is net of an estimated $12.6 million federal benefit related to deducting certain payments on future state tax returns.
as of november 28, 2014, the combined amount of accrued interest and penalties related to tax positions taken on our tax returns was approximately $14.6 million. this amount is included in non-current income taxes payable.
the timing of the resolution of income tax examinations is highly uncertain as are the amounts and timing of tax payments that are part of any audit settlement process. these events could cause large fluctuations in the balance sheet classification of
current and non-current assets and liabilities. we believe that within the next 12 months, it is reasonably possible that either certain audits will conclude or statutes of limitations on certain income tax examination periods will expire, or both. given the uncertainties described above, we can only determine a range of estimated potential decreases in underlying unrecognized tax benefits ranging from $0 to approximately $5 million.
in july 2013, a u.s. income tax examination covering fiscal 2008 and 2009 was completed. our accrued tax and interest related to these years was $48.4 million and was previously reported in long-term income taxes payable. we settled the tax obligation resulting from this examination with cash and income tax assets totaling $41.2 million, and the resulting $7.2 million income tax benefit was recorded in the third quarter of fiscal 2013.
liquidity and capital resources this data should be read in conjunction with our consolidated statements of cash flows.
as of
working capital                  $2,107.9                   $2,520.3
a summary of our cash flows is as follows:
net cash provided by operating activities                                   $1,287.5           $1,151.7               $1,499.6
effect of foreign currency exchange rates on cash and cash equivalents          (6.7    )          (5.2    )   5.4
our primary source of cash is receipts from revenue. the primary uses of cash are payroll related expenses, general operating expenses including marketing, travel and office rent, and cost of revenue. other sources of cash are proceeds from the exercise of employee options and participation in the employee stock purchase plan. other uses of cash include our stock repurchase program, which is described below, business acquisitions and purchases of property and equipment.
cash flows from operating activities for fiscal 2014, net cash provided by operating activities of $1.3 billion was primarily comprised of net income plus the net effect of non-cash items. the primary working capital sources of cash were net income coupled with increases in deferred revenue and accrued expenses. the increase in deferred revenue is primarily due to increased subscription and etla activity for our individual, team and enterprise creative cloud offerings and increases in digital marketing and digital publishing hosted services, offset in part by decreases in billings for our maintenance and creative product software upgrade plans which we discontinued in january 2013. accrued expenses increased primarily due to accruals for contract terminations and employee transition payments associated with business realignment initiatives implemented in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014.
for fiscal 2013, net cash provided by operating activities of $1.2 billion was primarily comprised of net income plus the net effect of non-cash items. the primary working capital sources of cash were net income coupled with increases in deferred revenue and accrued expenses and decreases in trade receivables. deferred revenue increased primarily due to increased subscription and etla activity for our creative cloud offering and increases in digital marketing hosted services, offset in part by decreases in billings for our maintenance and creative product software upgrade plans which we discontinued in january 2013. accrued expenses increased primarily due to amounts due under our fiscal 2013 annual incentive plan and sales commission accruals associated with higher achievement levels. trade receivables declined primarily due to lower perpetual license revenue levels and improved collections compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012.
the primary working capital uses of cash were decreases in taxes payable and increases in prepaid expenses and other assets. the decrease in taxes payable is largely attributed to tax payments made combined with audit settlement adjustments, offset in part by tax expense and other adjustments during fiscal 2013. prepaid expenses and other assets increased primarily due to
increases in short-term income tax receivables related to the carryback of r&d and foreign tax credits in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013.
for fiscal 2012, net cash provided by operating activities of $1.5 billion was primarily comprised of net income plus the net effect of non-cash items. the primary working capital sources of cash were net income coupled with increases in deferred revenue and decreases in trade receivables. deferred revenue increased primarily due to an increase in activity for both upgrade plans with support and site and term licenses largely associated with our digital media and digital marketing enterprise license agreements. the decrease in trade receivables is primarily related to an increase in revenue linearity and improved collections in our digital marketing portfolio offset in part by higher revenue levels due to the cs6 product release which occurred late in the second quarter of fiscal 2012.
the primary working capital uses of cash were decreases in accrued restructuring and trade payables. decreases in accrued restructuring primarily related to payments and adjustments for employee terminations and facility exit costs associated with the fiscal 2011 restructuring plan, a significant portion of which were paid and adjusted in the first and second quarters of fiscal 2012. trade payables decreased primarily due to the timing of payments as a greater number of invoices were paid prior to the fiscal year end in fiscal 2012 as compared to fiscal 2011.
cash flows from investing activities for fiscal 2014, net cash used for investing activities of $490.7 million was primarily due to purchases of short-term investments, purchases of property and equipment and a business acquisition. these cash outflows were offset in part by sales and maturities of short-term investments.
for fiscal 2013, net cash used for investing activities of $1,177.8 million was primarily due to our acquisitions of neolane and behance. other uses of cash during fiscal 2013 represented purchases of short-term investments, purchases of property and equipment associated with our construction projects in oregon and india and purchases of long-term technology licenses. these cash outflows were offset in part by sales and maturities of short-term investments and the sale of the waltham property. see note 2 of our notes to the consolidated financial statements for further information regarding our acquisitions of neolane and behance.
for fiscal 2012, net cash used for investing activities of $834.7 million was primarily due to our acquisition of efficient frontier in the first quarter of fiscal 2012. other uses of cash during fiscal 2012 represented purchases of short-term investments and property and equipment, offset in part by sales and maturities of short-term investments. see note 2 of our notes to the consolidated financial statements for further information regarding our acquisition of efficient frontier.
cash flows from financing activities for fiscal 2014, fiscal 2013 and fiscal 2012, net cash used for financing activities of $507.3 million, $559.1 million and $234.7 million, respectively, was primarily due to payments for our treasury stock repurchases and costs associated with the issuance of treasury stock, offset in part by proceeds from the issuance of treasury stock and excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation. see the section titled "stock repurchase program" discussed below.
we expect to continue our investing activities, including short-term and long-term investments, venture capital, facilities expansion and purchases of computer systems for research and development, sales and marketing, product support and administrative staff. furthermore, cash reserves may be used to repurchase stock under our stock repurchase program and to strategically acquire companies, products or technologies that are complementary to our business.
in december 2014, we entered into a definitive agreement under which we expect to acquire fotolia for approximately $800 million in cash. we expect to finance the acquisition using existing cash, cash equivalents and short-term investment balances, newly issued debt or drawings from our existing revolving credit agreement. we believe that these resources, in addition to cash generated from operations, will be sufficient to fund the acquisition. see note 2 of our notes to the consolidated financial statements for further information regarding our acquisition of fotolia.
restructuring during the past several years, we have initiated various restructuring plans. currently, the fiscal 2014 restructuring plan is the only plan of significance to us as we consider our restructuring plans initiated in prior years to be substantially complete.
as of november 28, 2014, we have accrued total restructuring charges of $22.3 million of which approximately $15.0 million relates to ongoing termination benefits that are expected to be paid during fiscal 2015. the remaining $7.3 million relates to the cost of closing redundant facilities and are expected to be paid under contract through fiscal 2021 of which approximately 45% will be paid through 2016. during fiscal 2014, we made payments related to our restructuring plans totaling $11.0 million
which consisted of $5.7 million and $5.3 million in payments related to termination benefits and contract terminations and the closing of redundant facilities, respectively.
as of november 29, 2013, we accrued total restructuring charges of $13.9 million of which approximately $11.7 million related to cost of closing redundant facilities. the remaining accrued restructuring charges of $2.2 million related to the cost of termination benefits and contract terminations. during fiscal 2013, we made payments related to the above restructuring plans totaling $10.3 million which consisted of $1.3 million and $9.0 million in payments related to termination benefits and contract terminations and the closing of redundant facilities, respectively.
as of november 30, 2012, we accrued total restructuring charges of $21.6 million of which $2.3 million related to ongoing termination benefits and contract terminations. the remaining accrued restructuring charges of $19.3 million related to the cost of closing redundant facilities. during fiscal 2012, we made payments related to restructuring plans totaling $63.1 million which consisted of $50.5 million and $12.6 million in payments related to termination benefits and contract terminations and the closing of redundant facilities, respectively.
see note 10 of our notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding our restructuring plans.
other liquidity and capital resources considerations our existing cash, cash equivalents and investment balances may fluctuate during fiscal 2015 due to changes in our planned cash outlay, including changes in incremental costs such as direct and integration costs related to our acquisitions. our cash and investments totaled $3.7 billion as of november 28, 2014. of this amount, approximately 80% was held by our foreign subsidiaries and subject to material repatriation tax effects. our intent is to permanently reinvest a significant portion of our earnings from foreign operations, and current plans do not anticipate that we will need funds generated from foreign operations to fund our domestic operations. in the event funds from foreign operations are needed to fund operations in the united states and if u.s. tax has not already been previously provided, we would provide for and pay additional u.s. taxes in connection with repatriating these funds.
cash from operations could also be affected by various risks and uncertainties, including, but not limited to the risks detailed in part i, item 1a titled "risk factors". however, based on our current business plan and revenue prospects, we believe that our existing cash, cash equivalents and investment balances, our anticipated cash flows from operations and our available credit facility will be sufficient to meet our working capital and operating resource expenditure requirements for the next twelve months.
on march 2, 2012, we entered into a five-year $1.0 billion senior unsecured revolving credit agreement (the "credit agreement"), providing for loans to us and certain of our subsidiaries. on march 1, 2013, we exercised our option under the credit agreement to extend the maturity date of the credit agreement by one year to march 2, 2018. as of november 28, 2014, there were no outstanding borrowings under this credit agreement and the entire $1.0 billion credit line remains available for borrowing.
as of november 28, 2014, the amount outstanding under our senior notes was $1.5 billion, consisting of $600 million of 3.25% senior notes due february 1, 2015 (the "2015 notes") and $900 million of 4.75% senior notes due february 1, 2020 (the "2020 notes"). during the first quarter of fiscal 2014, we reclassified $599.8 million as current debt on our consolidated balance sheets, which represented the 2015 notes, net of unamortized original issuance discount. we intend to refinance the current portion of our debt on or before the due date using either newly issued debt or drawings from our existing revolving credit agreement.
in anticipation of this refinancing, we entered into an interest rate lock agreement with a large financial institution subsequent to november 28, 2014, which fixed a benchmark u.s. treasury rate for an aggregate notional amount of $600.0 million. this derivative agreement hedges the impact on future interest payments attributable to changes in the benchmark interest rate and will be terminated upon the debt issuance.
we use professional investment management firms to manage a large portion of our invested cash. external investment firms managed, on average, 82% of our consolidated invested balances during fiscal 2014. the fixed income portfolio is primarily invested in corporate bonds and commercial paper, foreign government securities, money market mutual funds, municipal securities, u.s. agency securities and u.s. treasury securities.
stock repurchase program we are currently repurchasing common stock under our $2.0 billion authority granted by our board of directors in april 2012.
subsequent to november 28, 2014, as part of our $2.0 billion stock repurchase program, we entered into a structured stock repurchase agreement with a large financial institution whereupon we provided them with a prepayment of $200.0 million. this amount will be classified as treasury stock on our consolidated balance sheets. upon completion of the $200.0 million stock repurchase agreement, there is no remaining balance under our current authority.
subsequent to november 28, 2014, the board of directors approved a new stock repurchase program granting the company authority to repurchase up to $2.0 billion in common stock through the end of fiscal 2017. the new stock repurchase program approved by our board of directors is similar to our previous $2.0 billion stock repurchase program.
during fiscal 2014, 2013 and 2012, we entered into structured stock repurchase agreements with large financial institutions, whereupon we provided them with prepayments totaling $600.0 million, $1.1 billion and $405.0 million, respectively. the $600.0 million and $1.1 billion prepayments during fiscal 2014 and 2013, respectively, were under the $2.0 billion stock repurchase authority. of the $405.0 million of prepayments during fiscal 2012, $100.0 million were under the $2.0 billion stock repurchase program and the remaining $305.0 million were under our previous $1.6 billion stock repurchase authority. we enter into these agreements in order to take advantage of repurchasing shares at a guaranteed discount to the volume weighted average price ("vwap") of our common stock over a specified period of time. we only enter into such transactions when the discount that we receive is higher than the foregone return on our cash prepayments to the financial institutions. there were no explicit commissions or fees on these structured repurchases. under the terms of the agreements, there is no requirement for the financial institutions to return any portion of the prepayment to us.
the financial institutions agree to deliver shares to us at monthly intervals during the contract term. the parameters used to calculate the number of shares deliverable are: the total notional amount of the contract, the number of trading days in the contract, the number of trading days in the interval and the average vwap of our stock during the interval less the agreed upon discount. during fiscal 2014, we repurchased approximately 10.9 million shares at an average price of $63.48 through structured repurchase agreements entered into during fiscal 2014. during fiscal 2013, we repurchased approximately 21.6 million shares at an average price of $46.47 through structured repurchase agreements entered into during fiscal 2013 and fiscal 2012. during fiscal 2012, we repurchased approximately 11.5 million shares at an average price per share of $32.29 through structured repurchase agreements entered into during fiscal 2012.
for fiscal 2014, 2013 and 2012, the prepayments were classified as treasury stock on our consolidated balance sheets at the payment date, though only shares physically delivered to us by november 28, 2014, november 29, 2013 and november 30, 2012 were excluded from the computation of earnings per share. as of november 28, 2014, $40.3 million of prepayments remained under the agreement. see note 13 of our notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion of our stock repurchase programs.

off-balance sheet arrangements and aggregate contractual obligations our principal commitments as of november 28, 2014 consist of obligations under operating leases, capital leases, royalty agreements and various service agreements. see note 15 of our notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding our contractual commitments.
contractual obligations the following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of november 28, 2014 (in millions):
operating lease obligations             202.6                    42.6                    67.4                  46.8         45.8

senior notes in february 2010, we issued $600.0 million of 3.25% senior notes due february 1, 2015 and $900.0 million of 4.75% senior notes due february 1, 2020. interest on our senior notes is payable semi-annually, in arrears on february 1 and august 1. at november 28, 2014, our maximum commitment for interest payments under the senior notes was $244.9 million for the remaining duration of our senior notes. in june of fiscal 2014, we entered into interest rate swaps that effectively converted the fixed interest rate on our 2020 notes to a floating interest rate based on the london interbank offered rate ("libor") plus a fixed number of basis points through february 1, 2020.
capital lease obligation in january 2013, we entered into a sale-leaseback agreement to sell equipment totaling $25.7 million and leaseback the same equipment over a period of 24 months. this transaction was classified as a capital lease obligation and was recorded at fair value.
covenants our credit facility contains a financial covenant requiring us not to exceed a maximum leverage ratio. our almaden tower lease includes certain financial ratios as defined in the lease agreements that are reported to the lessors quarterly. as of november 28, 2014, we were in compliance with all of our covenants. we believe these covenants will not impact our credit or cash in the coming fiscal year or restrict our ability to execute our business plan. our senior notes do not contain any financial covenants.
under the terms of our credit agreement and lease agreements, we are not prohibited from paying cash dividends unless payment would trigger an event of default or one currently exists. we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future.
accounting for uncertainty in income taxes the gross liability for unrecognized tax benefits at november 28, 2014 was $148.8 million, exclusive of interest and penalties.
the timing of the resolution of income tax examinations is highly uncertain as are the amounts and timing of tax payments that are part of any audit settlement process. these events could cause large fluctuations in the balance sheet classification of current and non-current assets and liabilities. we believe that within the next 12 months, it is reasonably possible that either certain audits will conclude or statutes of limitations on certain income tax examination periods will expire, or both. given the uncertainties described above, we can only determine a range of estimated potential decreases in underlying unrecognized tax benefits ranging from $0 to approximately $5 million.
royalties we have certain royalty commitments associated with the shipment and licensing of certain products. royalty expense is generally based on a dollar amount per unit shipped or a percentage of the underlying revenue.
indemnifications in the normal course of business, we provide indemnifications of varying scope to customers against claims of intellectual property infringement made by third parties arising from the use of our products and from time to time, we are subject to claims by our customers under these indemnification provisions. historically, costs related to these indemnification provisions have not
been significant and we are unable to estimate the maximum potential impact of these indemnification provisions on our future results of operations.
to the extent permitted under delaware law, we have agreements whereby we indemnify our directors and officers for certain events or occurrences while the director or officer is or was serving at our request in such capacity. the indemnification period covers all pertinent events and occurrences during the director's or officer's lifetime. the maximum potential amount of future payments we could be required to make under these indemnification agreements is unlimited; however, we have director and officer insurance coverage that limits our exposure and enables us to recover a portion of any future amounts paid.

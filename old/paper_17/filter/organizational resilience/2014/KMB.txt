in october 2014, we initiated a restructuring plan in order to improve organization efficiency and offset the impact of stranded overhead costs resulting from the spin-off of our health care business. the successful implementation of this program presents significant organizational challenges, including successfully managing the relationship with halyard, and we may not be able to realize all of the expected benefits of the program. any failure to implement our restructuring plan in accordance with our expectations could adversely affect our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.

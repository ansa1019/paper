item 1a.  risk factors related to our business and operations our business activities and the value of our securities are subject to significant risk factors, including those described below.  the risk factors described below could negatively affect our operations, financial condition, liquidity and results of operations, and as a result, holders and purchasers of our securities could lose part or all of their investments.  it is possible that additional risks relating to our securities may be described in a prospectus supplement if we issue securities in the future.
our business and operating results are highly dependent on the market prices of crude oil, natural gas liquids and natural gas, which can be very volatile.  our estimated proved reserves, revenue, operating cash flows, operating margins, and future earnings are highly dependent on the prices of crude oil, natural gas liquids and natural gas, which are volatile and influenced by numerous factors beyond our control.  the major foreign oil producing countries, including members of the organization of petroleum exporting countries (opec), exert considerable influence over the supply and price of crude oil and refined petroleum products.  their ability or inability to agree on a common policy on rates of production and other matters has a significant impact on the oil markets.  in the fourth quarter of 2014, prices for brent crude oil and west texas intermediate crude oil declined by approximately 40% to end the year at $57 per barrel and $53 per barrel, respectively. if crude oil prices remain at these levels for the remainder of 2015, there will be a significant decrease in 2015 revenues, and earnings from 2014 levels. we cannot predict how long these lower price levels will continue to prevail.  the commodities trading markets as well as other supply and demand factors may also influence the selling prices of crude oil, natural gas liquids and natural gas.  to the extent that we engage in hedging activities to mitigate commodity price volatility, we may not realize the benefit of price increases above the hedged price.  changes in commodity prices can also have a material impact on collateral and margin requirements under our derivative contracts.  in order to manage the potential volatility of cash flows and credit requirements, the corporation maintains significant bank credit facilities.  an inability to renew or replace such credit facilities or access other sources of funding as they mature would negatively impact our liquidity.  in addition, we are exposed to risks related to changes in interest rates and foreign currency values, and may engage in hedging activities to mitigate related volatility.
if we fail to successfully increase our reserves, our future crude oil and natural gas production will be adversely impacted.  we own or have access to a finite amount of oil and gas reserves which will be depleted over time.  replacement of oil and gas production and reserves, including proved undeveloped reserves, is subject to successful exploration drilling, development activities, and enhanced recovery programs.  therefore, future oil and gas production is dependent on technical success in finding and developing additional hydrocarbon reserves.  exploration activity involves the interpretation of seismic and other geological and geophysical data, which does not always successfully predict the presence of commercial quantities of hydrocarbons.  drilling risks include unexpected adverse conditions, irregularities in pressure or formations, equipment failure, blowouts and weather interruptions.  future developments may be affected by unforeseen reservoir conditions which negatively affect recovery factors or flow rates.  the costs of drilling and development activities have increased in recent years which could negatively affect expected economic returns.  reserve replacement can also be achieved through acquisition.  similar risks, however, may be encountered in the production of oil and gas on properties acquired from others.  in addition to the technical risks to reserve replacement, replacing reserves and developing future production is also influenced by the price of crude oil and natural gas. persistent lower crude oil and natural gas prices, such as those currently prevailing, may have the effect of reducing capital available for exploration and development activity and may render certain development projects uneconomic or delay their completion and may result in negative revisions to existing reserves.
there are inherent uncertainties in estimating quantities of proved reserves and discounted future net cash flows, and actual quantities may be lower than estimated.  numerous uncertainties exist in estimating quantities of proved reserves and future net revenues from those reserves.  actual future production, oil and gas prices, revenues, taxes, capital expenditures, operating expenses, and quantities of recoverable oil and gas reserves may vary substantially from those assumed in the estimates and could materially affect the estimated quantities of our proved reserves and the related future net revenues.  in addition, reserve estimates may be subject to downward or upward changes based on production performance, purchases or sales of properties, results of future development, prevailing oil and gas prices, production sharing contracts, which may decrease reserves as crude oil and natural gas prices increase, and other factors. crude oil prices declined significantly in the fourth quarter of 2014.  see crude oil and natural gas reserves in critical accounting policies and estimates in item 7 - management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations.
we do not always control decisions made under joint operating agreements and the partners under such agreements may fail to meet their obligations.  we conduct many of our exploration and production operations through joint operating agreements with other parties under which we may not control decisions, either because we do not have a controlling interest or are not operator under the agreement.  there is risk that these parties may at any time have economic,
business, or legal interests or goals that are inconsistent with ours, and therefore decisions may be made which are not what we believe is in our best interest.  moreover, parties to these agreements may be unable to meet their economic or other obligations and we may be required to fulfill those obligations alone.  in either case, the value of our investment may be adversely affected.
we are subject to changing laws and regulations and other governmental actions that can significantly and adversely affect our business.  federal, state, local, territorial and foreign laws and regulations relating to tax increases and retroactive tax claims, disallowance of tax credits and deductions, expropriation or nationalization of property, mandatory government participation, cancellation or amendment of contract rights, imposition of capital controls or blocking of funds, changes in import and export regulations, limitations on access to exploration and development opportunities, anti-bribery or anti-corruption laws, as well as other political developments may affect our operations. we transport some of our crude oil production, particularly from the bakken shale oil play, by rail.  recent rail accidents have raised public awareness of rail safety and resulted in heightened regulatory scrutiny.  we own our own fleet of tank cars that exceed the current federal standards for construction and safety.  we expect that in 2015, the department of transportation will issue new standards for tank car design which may require us to retrofit our existing tank cars.  depending on the requirements of the regulation, changes in tank car design and limitations on the availability of shop capacity to undertake retrofits, as well as other possible regulations aimed at increasing rail safety, may lead to a significant increase in the costs of transporting crude oil and other hydrocarbons by rail and otherwise adversely affect our operations.
political instability in areas where we operate can adversely affect our business.  some of the international areas in which we operate, and the partners with whom we operate, are politically less stable than other areas and partners and may be subject to civil unrest, conflict, insurgency, corruption, security risks and labor unrest.  political and civil unrest in north africa and the middle east has affected and may affect our operations in these areas as well as oil and gas markets generally.  the threat of terrorism around the world also poses additional risks to the operations of the oil and gas industry.
our oil and gas operations are subject to environmental risks and environmental laws and regulations that can result in significant costs and liabilities.  our oil and gas operations, like those of the industry, are subject to environmental risks such as oil spills, produced water spills, gas leaks and ruptures and discharges of substances or gases that could expose us to substantial liability for pollution or other environmental damage.  our operations are also subject to numerous u.s. federal, state, local and foreign environmental laws and regulations.  non‚Äêcompliance with these laws and regulations may subject us to administrative, civil or criminal penalties, remedial clean-ups and natural resource damages or other liabilities.  in addition, increasingly stringent environmental regulations have resulted and will likely continue to result in higher capital expenditures and operating expenses for us and the oil and gas industry in general.  similarly, the corporation has material legal obligations to dismantle, remove and abandon production facilities and wells that will occur many years in the future, in most cases.  these estimates may be impacted by future changes in regulations and other uncertainties.
concerns have been raised in certain jurisdictions where we have operations concerning the safety and environmental impact of the drilling and development of shale oil and gas resources, particularly hydraulic fracturing, water usage, flaring of associated natural gas and air emissions.  while we believe that these operations can be conducted safely and with minimal impact on the environment, regulatory bodies are responding to these concerns and may impose moratoriums and new regulations on such drilling operations that would likely have the effect of prohibiting or delaying such operations and increasing their cost.
climate change initiatives may result in significant operational changes and expenditures, reduced demand for our products and adversely affect our business.  we recognize that climate change is a global environmental concern.  continuing political and social attention to the issue of climate change has resulted in both existing and pending international agreements and national, regional or local legislation and regulatory measures to limit greenhouse gas emissions.  these agreements and measures may require significant equipment modifications, operational changes, taxes, or purchase of emission credits to reduce emission of greenhouse gases from our operations, which may result in substantial capital expenditures and compliance, operating, maintenance and remediation costs.  in addition, our production is used to produce petroleum fuels, which through normal customer use may result in the emission of greenhouse gases.  regulatory initiatives to reduce the use of these fuels may reduce our sales of crude oil and other hydrocarbons.  the imposition and enforcement of stringent greenhouse gas emissions reduction targets could severely and adversely impact the oil and gas industry and significantly reduce the value of our business.
our industry is highly competitive and many of our competitors are larger and have greater resources than we have.  the petroleum industry is highly competitive and very capital intensive.  we encounter competition from numerous companies in each of our activities, including acquiring rights to explore for crude oil and natural gas.  many competitors,
including national oil companies, are larger and have substantially greater resources.  we are also in competition with producers of other forms of energy.  increased competition for worldwide oil and gas assets has significantly increased the cost of acquiring oil and gas assets.  in addition, competition for drilling services, technical expertise and equipment may affect the availability of technical personnel and drilling rigs, resulting in increased capital and operating costs.
catastrophic events, whether naturally occurring or man‚Äêmade, may materially affect our operations and financial conditions.  our oil and gas operations are subject to unforeseen occurrences which have affected us from time to time and which may damage or destroy assets, interrupt operations and have other significant adverse effects.  examples of catastrophic risks include hurricanes, fires, explosions, blowouts, such as the third party accident at the macondo prospect, pipeline interruptions and ruptures, severe weather, geological events, labor disputes or cyber‚Äêattacks.  although we maintain insurance coverage against property and casualty losses, there can be no assurance that such insurance will adequately protect the corporation against liability from all potential consequences and damages.  moreover, some forms of insurance may be unavailable in the future or be available only on terms that are deemed economically unacceptable.
significant time delays between the estimated and actual occurrence of critical events associated with development projects may result in material negative economic consequences.  the corporation is involved in several large development projects and the completion of those projects may be delayed beyond what was originally anticipated.  such examples include, but are not limited to, delays in receiving necessary approvals from project members or regulatory agencies, timely access to necessary equipment, availability of necessary personnel and unfavorable weather conditions.  this may lead to delays and differences between estimated and actual timing of critical events.  these delays could impact information detailed in forward-looking statements, and may have material negative economic consequences.
departures of key members from the corporation's senior management team, and/or difficulty in recruiting and retaining adequate numbers of experienced technical personnel, could negatively impact the corporation's ability to deliver its strategic goals.    the derivation and monitoring of successful strategies and related policies may be negatively impacted by the departure of key members of senior management.  moreover, an inability to recruit and retain adequate numbers of experienced technical and professional personnel in the necessary locations may prohibit the corporation from executing its strategy in full or, in part, with a commensurate impact on shareholder value.
the corporation is dependent on oilfield service companies for items including drilling rigs, equipment, supplies and skilled labor.  an inability or significant delay in securing these services, or a high cost thereof, may result in material negative economic consequences.  the availability and cost of drilling rigs, equipment, supplies and skilled labor will fluctuate over time given the cyclical nature of the exploration and production industry.  as a result, the corporation may encounter difficulties in obtaining required services or could face an increase in cost.  these consequences may impact the ability of the corporation to run its operations and to deliver projects on time with the potential for material negative economic consequences.
cyber‚Äêattacks targeting computer, telecommunications systems, and infrastructure used by the oil and gas industry may materially impact our business and operations.  computers and telecommunication systems are used to conduct our exploration, development and production activities and have become an integral part of our business.  we use these systems to analyze and store financial and operating data and to communicate within our company and with outside business partners.  cyber‚Äêattacks could compromise our computer and telecommunications systems and result in disruptions to our business operations or the loss of our data and proprietary information.  in addition, computers control oil and gas production, processing equipment, and distribution systems globally and are necessary to deliver our production to market.  a cyber‚Äêattack against these operating systems, or the networks and infrastructure on which they rely, could damage critical production, distribution and/or storage assets, delay or prevent delivery to markets, and make it difficult or impossible to accurately account for production and settle transactions.  as a result, a cyber-attack could have a material adverse impact on our cash flows and results of operations.  we routinely experience attempts by external parties to penetrate and attack our networks and systems.  although such attempts to date have not resulted in any material breaches, disruptions, or loss of business critical information, our systems and procedures for protecting against such attacks and mitigating such risks may prove to be insufficient in the future and such attacks could have an adverse impact on our business and operations.
item 7.  management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview hess corporation is a global exploration and production (e&p) company that develops, produces, purchases, transports and sells crude oil, natural gas liquids, and natural gas with production operations primarily in the united states (u.s.), denmark, equatorial guinea, the joint development area of malaysia/thailand (jda), malaysia, and norway.
transformation to a pure play exploration and production company in the first quarter of 2013, the corporation announced several initiatives to continue its transformation into a more focused pure play e&p company.  these initiatives represented the culmination of a multi-year strategic transformation designed to deliver long-term, cash generative growth and increase returns to stockholders by focusing on lower risk, higher growth unconventional assets, exploiting existing discoveries by leveraging offshore drilling and project development capabilities, and executing a smaller, more targeted exploratory program.
as part of its transformation, the corporation sold during the period of 2012 through 2014 mature or lower margin e&p assets in azerbaijan, indonesia, norway, russia, thailand, the united kingdom north sea (uk), and certain interests onshore in the u.s.  in addition, the transformation plan included fully exiting the corporation's marketing and refining (m&r) business, including its terminal, retail, energy marketing and energy trading operations, as well as the permanent shutdown of refining operations at its port reading facility.  hovensa l.l.c. (hovensa), a 50/50 joint venture between the corporation's subsidiary, hess oil virgin islands corp. (hovic), and a subsidiary of petroleos de venezuela s.a. (pdvsa), had previously shut down its u.s. virgin islands refinery in january 2012 and continued operating solely as an oil storage terminal through the first quarter of 2015.  see item 3.  legal proceedings.  as of december 31, 2014, all downstream businesses were sold or shutdown except for the energy trading joint venture, hetco, which was sold in february 2015, and hovensa, which will be shut down in the first quarter of 2015.
proceeds from sales of assets in e&p and m&r during the period of 2012 through 2014 totaling $13.4 billion were used primarily to reinvest in the e&p business, repay debt, repurchase the corporation's common stock, and increase cash balances.  in 2013, the corporation's board of directors authorized a plan to repurchase up to $4 billion of the corporation's outstanding common stock, and subsequently in 2014 increased the authorized repurchase plan to $6.5 billion.  through december 31, 2014, the corporation has repurchased a total of approximately $5.26 billion of outstanding common stock.
response to the fourth quarter 2014 decline in crude oil prices brent crude oil and west texas intermediate crude oil prices declined approximately 40 percent in the fourth quarter of 2014 to end the year at $57 per barrel and $53 per barrel, respectively.  the corporation has responded by reducing its planned 2015 capital and exploratory program to $4.7 billion, down 16 percent from $5.6 billion in 2014.  as part of the 2015 capital program, the corporation expects to spend $1.8 billion in the bakken shale play compared with $2.2 billion in 2014, and reflects reducing the rig count from seventeen rigs in 2014 to an average of 9.5 rigs in 2015.  the corporation plans to actively pursue other cost savings, including cost reductions from service providers, and significantly moderate the pace of share repurchases in 2015 to preserve liquidity in the current oil price environment.
consolidated net income net income was $2,317 million in 2014 compared with $5,052 million in 2013 and $2,025 million in 2012.  diluted earnings per share were $7.53 in 2014 compared with $14.82 in 2013 and $5.95 in 2012.  excluding items affecting comparability, net income was $1,308 million in 2014, $1,892 million in 2013, and $1,998 million in 2012.  see the table of items affecting comparability of earnings between periods on page 26.
exploration and production the corporation's total proved reserves were 1,431 million barrels of oil equivalent (boe) at december 31, 2014 compared with 1,437 million boe at december 31, 2013 and 1,553 million boe at december 31, 2012.  proved reserves related to assets sold were 77 million boe in 2014, 140 million boe in 2013 and 83 million boe in 2012.
e&p earnings were $2,098 million in 2014, $4,303 million in 2013 and $2,212 million in 2012.  excluding items affecting comparability of earnings between periods on page 31, e&p net income was $1,556 million, $2,192 million and $2,256 million for 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively.  average realized crude oil selling prices including the impact of
hedging were $92.17 per barrel in 2014, $98.48 in 2013 and $86.94 in 2012.  average realized natural gas selling prices were $6.04 per mcf in 2014, $6.64 in 2013 and $6.16 in 2012.  production averaged 329,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day (boepd) in 2014, 336,000 boepd in 2013 and 406,000 boepd in 2012.
the following is an update of significant e&p activities during 2014:
¬∑   in north dakota, net production from the bakken oil shale play averaged 83,000 boepd, an increase of 24% from 67,000 boepd in 2013, primarily due to ongoing field development and operations commencing at the expanded tioga gas plant in late march 2014. during 2014, the corporation operated an average of 17 rigs to drill 261 wells and complete 230 wells bringing the total operated production wells to 982 at december 31, 2014. drilling and completion costs per operated well averaged $7.3 million in 2014, down from $8.1 million in 2013. in 2015, the corporation plans to operate an average of 9.5 rigs to drill 170 wells and bring 210 wells on production while reducing capital expenditures to $1.8 billion from $2.2 billion in 2014. bakken production is forecast to average between 95,000 boepd and 105,000 boepd in 2015.
¬∑   at the valhall field in norway (hess 64%), net production averaged 31,000 boepd during 2014 compared with 23,000 boepd in 2013. this increase reflected the impact of start-up operations following completion of a redevelopment project in 2013, ongoing drilling of production wells and higher facilities uptime.
¬∑   at block a‚Äê18 of the joint development area of malaysia/thailand (jda), the operator, carigali hess operating company, continued drilling production wells and successfully installed a new wellhead platform in 2014. production averaged 42,000 boepd in 2014 compared to 45,000 boepd in 2013, including contribution from unitized acreage in malaysia. further development drilling is planned for 2015 and the completion of a booster compression project is planned for early 2016.
¬∑   at the hess operated tubular bells field in the gulf of mexico, the corporation achieved first production in november 2014 following completion of construction, installation and commissioning of offshore production facilities and subsea equipment. three wells are currently producing with a fourth production well expected to be completed in 2015. full year 2015 net production for tubular bells is expected to be in the range of 30,000 boepd to 35,000 boepd.
¬∑   in the north malay basin (nmb), net production from the early production system averaged 40 million cubic feet per day during 2014 compared with 30 million cubic feet per day in the fourth quarter of 2013. first production from the field commenced in october 2013 with the first condensate offtake occurring in november 2014. full field development is scheduled to be completed in 2017 when net production is expected to increase to approximately 165 million cubic feet per day.
¬∑   at the south arne field (hess 62%) offshore denmark, the corporation continued drilling operations in 2014 following the december 2013 start-up of its phrase three development project which comprised the installation of two new wellhead platforms and modifications to existing production facilities. development drilling is planned to continue into 2015.
¬∑   in the utica shale, 38 wells were drilled, 36 wells were completed and 39 wells were brought into operation. net production increased to approximately 13,000 boepd in the fourth quarter of 2014. the corporation and its joint venture partner plan to operate two drilling rigs in 2015 to drill 20 - 25 wells and bring on production 25 - 30 wells.
¬∑   in libya, civil and political unrest has largely interrupted production and crude oil export capability since august 2013. at the waha fields (hess 8%), the operator recommenced production in the third quarter of 2014 at a reduced rate and the corporation was able to sell four tank cargos of crude oil by year-end. the corporation's net production from libya averaged 4,000 boepd in 2014, 15,000 boepd in 2013 and 21,000 boepd in 2012. in december 2014 the libyan national oil company declared force majeure with respect to the waha fields and production is currently shut in.
¬∑   in ghana, the corporation completed its three well appraisal program on the deepwater tano cape three points block, offshore ghana. in 2015 the corporation and its partners will continue to analyze data from both appraisal drilling and 3d seismic with an expected project sanction decision in 2016.
¬∑   in the fourth quarter of 2014, the corporation announced that together with its project co-owners it will proceed with the development of the stampede project in the gulf of mexico. a two-rig drilling program is planned with
the first rig commencing operations in the fourth quarter of 2015 and the second in 2016. first production is expected in 2018.
¬∑   at the equus project in the offshore carnarvon basin of australia, the corporation executed a non-binding letter of intent with a third-party liquefaction partner. successful execution of a binding agreement with the third party liquefaction partner is necessary before the corporation can execute a gas sales agreement and sanction development.
¬∑   in the second quarter, the corporation completed its first exploration well on the shakrok block in the kurdistan region of iraq (hess 64%). the well encountered sub-commercial amounts of hydrocarbons and was expensed. drilling activities have been suspended on the shireen exploration well in the dinarta block and the corporation is currently assessing its completion options.
liquidity, and capital and exploratory expenditures net cash provided by operating activities was $4,464 million in 2014, $4,870 million in 2013 and $5,660 million in 2012.  at december 31, 2014, cash and cash equivalents totaled $2,444 million, up from $1,814 million at december 31, 2013.  total debt was $5,987 million at december 31, 2014 and $5,798 million at december 31, 2013.  the corporation's debt to capitalization ratio at december 31, 2014 was 21.2% compared with 19.0% at december 31, 2013.
capital and exploratory expenditures from continuing operations were as follows:
offshore                                                                    765               865               870
*   excludes capital expenditures related to discontinued operations of $431 million, $106 million and $113 million in 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively.
the corporation anticipates investing approximately $4.7 billion in capital and exploratory expenditures in 2015 down from $5.6 billion in 2014.  the decline reflects a planned reduction in the corporation's work program in response to the lower commodity price environment.
consolidated results of operations the after‚Äêtax income (loss) by major operating activity is summarized below:
the following table summarizes, on an after‚Äêtax basis, items of income (expense) that are included in net income and affect comparability between periods.  the items in the table below are explained on pages 31 through 34.
total items affecting comparability of earnings between periods          $1,009            $3,160           $27
in the following discussion and elsewhere in this report, the financial effects of certain transactions are disclosed on an after‚Äêtax basis.  management reviews segment earnings on an after‚Äêtax basis and uses after‚Äêtax amounts in its review of variances in segment earnings.  management believes that after‚Äêtax amounts are a preferable method of explaining variances in earnings, since they show the entire effect of a transaction rather than only the pre‚Äêtax amount.  after‚Äêtax amounts are determined by applying the income tax rate in each tax jurisdiction to pre‚Äêtax amounts.
comparison of results exploration and production following is a summarized income statement of the corporation's e&p operations:
revenues and non-operating income sales and other operating revenues                                                   $10,737            $11,905            $12,245

excluding the e&p items affecting comparability of earnings between periods in the table on page 31, the changes in e&p earnings are primarily attributable to changes in selling prices, production and sales volumes, cost of products sold, cash operating costs, depreciation, depletion and amortization, exploration expenses and income taxes, as discussed below.
selling prices:  average crude oil realized selling prices were $92.17 per boe in 2014, or 6% lower compared to 2013 primarily due to declines in the benchmark prices for brent and west texas intermediary (wti) crude oil.  average crude oil selling prices were 13% higher in 2013 compared to 2012 due to a combination of hedging losses realized in 2012, the second quarter 2013 sale of the corporation's subsidiary in russia which realized significantly lower crude oil prices, and slightly higher average wti benchmark prices in 2013.

united states:  crude oil, natural gas liquids and natural gas production was higher in 2014 compared with 2013, a result of continued development of the bakken oil shale play, higher production resulting from an active drilling program in the utica shale and a new production well combined with lower downtime at the llano field in the gulf of mexico.  crude oil, natural gas liquids and natural gas production was comparable in 2013 and 2012, as higher production from the bakken oil shale play was partly offset by natural decline and maintenance in the other u.s. assets.
europe:  crude oil production was lower in 2014 compared to 2013, primarily due to the april 2013 sale of the corporation's russian subsidiary, partially offset by higher production during 2014 at the vahall field in norway following completion of the redevelopment project in 2013.  higher natural gas production in 2014 compared to 2013 was a result of higher uptime from the valhall field.  crude oil and natural gas production was lower in 2013 compared to 2012, primarily due to asset sales.  the bittern and schiehallion fields in the uk north sea, which were sold in the second half of 2012, were producing at an aggregate net rate of approximately 12,000 boepd at the time of sale.  the beryl fields, also in the uk north sea, which were producing at an aggregate net rate of approximately 10,000 boepd at the time of sale, were sold in the first quarter of 2013, and the corporation's russian subsidiary, which was producing approximately 50,000 boepd at the time of sale, was sold in april 2013.
africa:  crude oil production in africa was lower in 2014 compared to 2013, and from 2013 to 2012, primarily due to the shutdown of the es sider terminal in libya in the third quarter of 2013, following civil unrest in the country.  in december 2014 the libyan national oil company declared force majeure with respect to the waha fields and production is currently shut-in.  the decline from 2013 compared to 2012 was also due to lower production from the okume complex in offshore equatorial guinea, which was partially offset by new production from the ceiba field.
asia and other:  crude oil production was lower in 2014 compared to 2013, largely as a result of the divestiture of the corporation's interests in the pangkah field in indonesia in january 2014 and the corporation's interest in the azeri-chirag-guneshli (acg) fields, azerbaijan in march 2013.  natural gas production was lower in 2014 compared to 2013 following the corporation's divestiture of its interests in indonesia and thailand in 2014 and lower production from the joint development area of malaysia/thailand (jda), which was partially offset by a full year of production from the north malay basin.   crude oil production was lower in 2013 compared to 2012 mainly due to the sale in march 2013 of the corporation's interest in the acg fields.  natural gas production was lower in 2013 compared to 2012, mainly due to lower production entitlement at the jda together with lower production at the pangkah field in indonesia.

*   reflects natural gas production converted on the basis of relative energy content (six mcf equals one barrel). barrel of oil equivalence does not necessarily result in price equivalence as the equivalent price of natural gas on a barrel of oil equivalent basis has been substantially lower than the corresponding price for crude oil over the recent past. in addition, natural gas liquids do not sell at prices equivalent to crude oil. see the average selling prices on page 28.
cost of products sold:  cost of products sold is mainly comprised of costs relating to the purchases of crude oil, natural gas liquids and natural gas from the corporation's partners in hess operated wells or other third parties.  cost of products sold in 2014 was comparable to 2013 as a result of increased volumes purchased from partners in wells operated by the corporation being offset by lower purchases from third parties.  the increase in cost of products sold in 2013 compared with 2012 principally reflected higher volumes of crude oil purchases from third parties.
cash operating costs:  cash operating costs, consisting of operating costs and expenses, production and severance taxes and general and administrative expenses, decreased by approximately $330 million in 2014 compared with 2013 and decreased by approximately $200 million in 2013 compared with 2012.  the decrease in 2014 compared to 2013 primarily reflects lower production taxes and operating costs following the divestitures of indonesia and thailand assets in early 2014 and the corporation's interests in russia in april 2013, as well as lower employee costs.  the decrease in 2013 was due to lower production taxes following the sale of the corporation's russian operations, and reductions in transportation costs, lease operating expenses and employee costs, which were partially offset by severance charges and other exit costs incurred as part of the corporation's transformation to a more focused e&p company.
depreciation, depletion and amortization:  depreciation, depletion and amortization charges increased by approximately $540 million in 2014 and decreased by $182 million in 2013, compared with the corresponding amounts in prior years.  the increase in 2014 was primarily associated with higher production volumes from the bakken, utica, valhall, and north malay basin, each of which had a dd&a rate higher than the portfolio average in 2014.  the decrease in 2013  largely reflects asset sales and the mix of production volumes.
excluding items affecting comparability of earnings between periods in the table below, cash operating costs per barrel of oil equivalent (boe) were $21.03 in 2014, $22.63 in 2013 and $20.63 in 2012 and depreciation, depletion and amortization costs per boe were $26.68 in 2014, $21.61 in 2013 and $19.20 in 2012.  total production unit costs were $47.71 per boe in 2014, $44.24 per boe in 2013 and $39.83 per boe in 2012.
for 2015, cash operating costs are estimated to be in the range of $19.50 to $20.50 per boe and depreciation, depletion and amortization costs are estimated to be in the range of $28.50 to $29.50 per boe, resulting in total production unit costs of $48.00 to $50.00 per boe assuming no contribution from libya.
exploration expenses:  exploration expenses, excluding items affecting comparability of earnings, were lower in 2014 compared to 2013, primarily due to lower leasehold impairment expense, geologic and seismic costs, and employee expenses.  exploration expenses decreased in 2013 compared to 2012, primarily due to lower dry hole expenses and geological and seismic expenses partly offset by higher leasehold impairment expenses.
income taxes:  excluding the impact of items affecting comparability of earnings between periods provided below, the effective income tax rates for e&p operations were 41% in 2014, 43% in 2013 and 45% in 2012.  the decline in the effective income tax rate in 2014 compared with 2013 and in 2013 compared with 2012 was primarily due to the impact of shut‚Äêin production in libya from the third quarter of 2013.  based on current strip crude oil prices, we are forecasting a pre-tax loss for 2015 and, as a result, the e&p effective tax rate, excluding items affecting comparability, is expected to be a benefit in the range of 38% to 42% excluding libyan operations.
items affecting comparability of earnings between periods:  reported e&p earnings included the following items affecting comparability of income (expense) before and after income taxes:

net cash provided by operating activities                        4,464              4,870              5,660
cash flows from investing activities capital expenditures                                                                                   (5,274   )         (5,767   )         (7,682   )
operating activities:  net cash provided by operating activities amounted to $4,464 million in 2014 compared with $4,870 million in 2013, reflecting the impact of changes in working capital, lower operating earnings primarily as a result of asset sales and the decline in benchmark crude oil prices.  operating cash flow decreased to $4,870 million in 2013 from $5,660 million in 2012 principally reflecting decreases in cash flows from asset sales and changes in working capital.
investing activities: the following table summarizes the corporation's capital expenditures:
production and development                                         4,702             5,051             6,790
total capital expenditures - continuing operations                 5,274             5,767             7,682
downstream businesses - discontinued operations                                        431               106               113
total capital expenditures            $5,705            $5,873            $7,795
the decrease in capital expenditures in 2014, as compared with 2013, is largely due to the ongoing reduction in capital expenditures in the bakken, reflecting lower well costs and completion of the tioga gas plant expansion project.  the decrease in capital expenditures in 2013 as compared to 2012 was mainly due to reduced capital expenditures in the bakken, resulting from fewer drilling rigs being operated in the field as well as lower costs per well.  in addition, completion of the redevelopment project at the valhall field in january 2013 as well as asset sales reduced 2013 capital expenditures.
total proceeds from the sale of assets related to continuing operations amounted to approximately $3.0 billion in 2014, $4.5 billion in 2013 and $0.8 billion in 2012.  in 2014, the corporation completed asset sales of its dry gas acreage in the utica shale play, its assets in thailand, the pangkah field, offshore indonesia, and its interests in two power plant joint ventures.  completed sales in 2013 included the corporation's interests in the beryl, acg, eagle ford and natuna a fields, and its russian subsidiary, samara‚Äênafta.
in 2014, net cash provided by investing activities from discontinued operations included proceeds of $2.8 billion from the sale of the retail business.  in addition, the corporation acquired in january 2014, its partners' 56% interest in wilcohess, a retail gasoline joint venture, for approximately $290 million.  in june 2014, the corporation incurred capital expenditures of $105 million related to the acquisition of previously leased retail gasoline stations.  both of these transactions were undertaken in connection with the corporation's divestiture of its retail business.  net cash provided by investing activities related to discontinued operations for 2013 includes proceeds of approximately $2.2 billion from the sales of the corporation's energy marketing operations and its u.s. east coast terminal network, st. lucia terminal and related businesses.
financing activities:  during 2014, the corporation issued $600 million ($598 million net of discount) of unsecured, fixed rate notes and repaid $590 million of debt, including $250 million of unsecured, fixed rate notes, $74 million assumed in the acquisition of wilcohess, and $249 million for the payment of various lease obligations primarily related to the retirement of the corporation's retail gasoline station leases.  in 2013, the corporation repaid $2,348 million, net under available credit facilities and repaid $136 million of other debt.  the net repayments under the credit facilities consisted of $990 million on the corporation's short‚Äêterm credit facilities, $758 million on its syndicated revolving credit facility and $600 million on its asset backed credit facility.  during 2012, the corporation borrowed a net of $1,845 million from available credit facilities, which consisted of borrowings of $758 million from its syndicated revolving credit facility, $890 million from its short‚Äêterm credit facilities and $250 million from its asset‚Äêbacked credit facility, partially offset by net repayments of other debt of $53 million.
the corporation repurchased hess common stock of approximately $3.7 billion in 2014 and approximately $1.5 billion in 2013 under its $6.5 billion board authorized stock repurchase plan.  total common stock dividends paid were $303 million in 2014, $235 million in 2013 and $171 million in 2012.  the corporation received net proceeds from the exercise of stock options, including related income tax benefits of $182 million, $128 million and $11 million in 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively.
future capital requirements and resources the corporation anticipates investing approximately $4.7 billion in capital and exploratory expenditures in 2015 compared to $5.6 billion in 2014.  based on current strip crude oil prices, the corporation forecasts in 2015 a significant net loss and net cash flow deficit after funding planned capital expenditures, dismantlement obligations, pension contributions, dividends and any share repurchases under its board authorized plan. the corporation expects to fund its 2015 net cash flow deficit with existing cash on hand of $2.4 billion at december 31, 2014 and, if necessary, borrowings under its long-term credit facility.
crude oil and natural gas prices are volatile and difficult to predict.  in addition, unplanned increases in the corporation's capital expenditure program could occur.  the corporation plans to preserve its financial flexibility and to improve its cash flow by pursuing cost reductions from vendors, significantly moderating stock repurchases compared with 2014, and depending on where crude oil prices trend, potentially further reducing its planned capital program.   in addition, should needs dictate, the corporation  may also access other sources of liquidity by utilizing other existing uncommitted credit facilities, issuing debt and equity securities, and/or pursuing further asset sales.
the corporation held $1.1 billion of its year-end 2014 total cash and cash equivalents of $2.4 billion outside of the u.s. and has the ability to bring its december 31, 2014 international cash balance back to the u.s. without triggering a u.s. cash tax liability.
the table below summarizes the capacity, usage, and available capacity of the corporation's borrowing and letter of credit facilities at december 31, 2014:
expiration date         capacity          borrowings         letters of credit issued         total used         available capacity
the corporation's $397 million in letters of credit outstanding at december 31, 2014 were primarily issued to satisfy margin requirements.  see also note 21, financial risk management and trading activities in the notes to the consolidated financial statements.
at december 31, 2014, the corporation had a $4 billion syndicated revolving credit facility with a maturity date of april 2016.  in january 2015, the corporation entered into a new $4 billion five‚Äêyear credit agreement with a maturity date of january 2020.  this facility can be used for borrowings and letters of credit. borrowings on the new facility bear interest at 1.075% above the london interbank offered rate.  a fee of 0.175% per annum is also payable on the amount of the facility.  the interest rate and facility fee are subject to adjustment if the corporation's credit rating changes.
the corporation's long‚Äêterm debt agreements, including the revolving credit facility, contain financial covenants that restrict the amount of total borrowings and secured debt.  the most restrictive of these covenants allow the corporation to borrow up to an additional $5.6 billion of secured debt at december 31, 2014.
the corporation also has a shelf registration under which it may issue additional debt securities, warrants, common stock or preferred stock.  promptly after filing this annual report on form 10-k, as a result of the corporation's existing shelf registration statement expiring on february 27, 2015, the corporation anticipates filing a new shelf registration statement under the securities act of 1933, as amended, under which it may issue, among other things, additional debt securities, warrants, common stock or preferred stock.
credit ratings there are three major credit rating agencies that rate the corporation's debt.  all three agencies have currently assigned an investment grade rating with a stable outlook to the corporation's debt.  the interest rates and facility fees charged on some of the corporation's credit facilities, as well as margin requirements from financial risk management counterparties, are subject to adjustment if the corporation's credit rating changes.
contractual obligations and contingencies the following table shows aggregate information about certain contractual obligations at december 31, 2014:
operating leases                                               2,818              773               1,049                651                  345

operating expenses                           1,306              451                 436                278                  141
*   the corporation anticipates cash payments for interest of $355 million for 2015, $722 million for 2016-2017, $680 million for 2018-2019, and $4,265 million thereafter for a total of $6,022 million.
capital expenditures represent amounts that were contractually committed at december 31, 2014, including the portion of the corporation's planned capital expenditure program for 2015.  obligations for operating expenses include commitments for oil and gas production expenses, seismic purchases and other normal business expenses.  other long‚Äêterm liabilities reflect contractually committed obligations in the consolidated balance sheet at december 31, 2014, including pension plan liabilities and estimates for uncertain income tax positions.
the corporation and certain of its subsidiaries, lease drilling rigs, tankers, office space and other assets for varying periods under leases accounted for as operating leases.
the corporation is contingently liable under $54 million of letters of credit at december 31, 2014.
off-balance sheet arrangements the corporation had leveraged leases associated with certain retail gasoline stations which were not included in its consolidated balance sheet and had a fair value of approximately $238 million at december 31, 2013. if these leases were included as debt, the corporation's december 31, 2013 debt to capitalization ratio would have increased to 19.6% from 19.0%.  the leases were terminated in 2014 in conjunction with the anticipated divestiture of retail marketing that closed in september 2014.
see also note 18, guarantees and contingencies in the notes to the consolidated financial statements.
foreign operations the corporation conducts exploration and production activities outside the u.s., principally in europe (norway and denmark), africa (equatorial guinea, libya, algeria and ghana) and asia and other (joint development area of malaysia/thailand, malaysia, australia, the kurdistan region of iraq, china, guyana and canada).  therefore, the corporation is subject to the risks associated with foreign operations, including political risk, corruption, acts of terrorism, tax law changes and currency risk.

accounting policies critical accounting policies and estimates accounting policies and estimates affect the recognition of assets and liabilities in the corporation's consolidated balance sheet and revenues and expenses in the statement of consolidated income.  the accounting methods used can affect net income, equity and various financial statement ratios.  however, the corporation's accounting policies generally do not change cash flows or liquidity.
accounting for exploration and development costs:  e&p activities are accounted for using the successful efforts method. costs of acquiring unproved and proved oil and gas leasehold acreage, including lease bonuses, brokers' fees and other related costs are capitalized.  annual lease rentals, exploration expenses and exploratory dry hole costs are expensed as incurred.  costs of drilling and equipping productive wells, including development dry holes, and related production facilities are capitalized.  in production operations, costs of injected co2 for tertiary recovery are expensed as incurred.
the costs of exploratory wells that find oil and gas reserves are capitalized pending determination of whether proved reserves have been found.  exploratory drilling costs remain capitalized after drilling is completed if (1) the well has found a sufficient quantity of reserves to justify completion as a producing well and (2) sufficient progress is being made in assessing the reserves and the economic and operational viability of the project.  if either of those criteria is not met, or if there is substantial doubt about the economic or operational viability of the project, the capitalized well costs are charged to expense. indicators of sufficient progress in assessing reserves, and the economic and operating viability of a project include: commitment of project personnel, active negotiations for sales contracts with customers, negotiations with governments, operators and contractors and firm plans for additional drilling and other factors.
crude oil and natural gas reserves:  the determination of estimated proved reserves is a significant element in arriving at the results of operations of exploration and production activities.  the estimates of proved reserves affect well capitalizations, the unit of production depreciation rates of proved properties and wells and equipment, as well as impairment testing of oil and gas assets and goodwill.
for reserves to be booked as proved they must be determined with reasonable certainty to be economically producible from known reservoirs under existing economic conditions, operating methods and government regulations.  in addition, government and project operator approvals must be obtained and, depending on the amount of the project cost, senior management or the board of directors must commit to fund the project.  the corporation maintains its own internal reserve estimates that are calculated by technical staff that work directly with the oil and gas properties.  the corporation's technical staff updates reserve estimates throughout the year based on evaluations of new wells, performance reviews, new technical data and other studies.  to provide consistency throughout the corporation, standard reserve estimation guidelines, definitions, reporting reviews and approval practices are used.  the internal reserve estimates are subject to internal technical audits and senior management review.  the corporation also engages an independent third party consulting firm to audit approximately 80% of the corporation's total proved reserves each year.
proved reserves are calculated using the average price during the twelve month period before december 31 determined as an unweighted arithmetic average of the first-day-of-the-month price for each month within the year, unless prices are defined by contractual agreements, excluding escalations based on future conditions.  crude oil prices remained at significantly higher levels during the first ten months of 2014 and declined during the last two months of the year.  as a result, the average crude oil price used to calculate proved reserves at december 31, 2014 is significantly higher than the year-end 2014 crude oil price.  the year-end 2015 reserve estimates will be based on the same unweighted arithmetic average formula using first-day-of-the-month prices for 2015 and will reflect the current low crude oil price environment from the beginning of the year.  if current strip crude oil prices hold through 2015, proved reserves at december 31, 2015 could be significantly lower than proved reserves at december 31, 2014.  it is difficult to estimate the magnitude of any net negative change in proved reserves that may result from lower crude oil prices due to a number of factors that are currently unknown, including 2015 crude oil prices, any revisions in proved reserves that may occur based on 2015 reservoir performance, the levels to which industry costs will decline in response to lower prices, and management's plans as of december 31, 2015 for developing proved undeveloped reserves through the year 2020 which will be the five-year window for recognizing proved undeveloped reserves as of december 31, 2015.  despite the uncertainties cited, based on facts and assumptions existing at december 31, 2014 if brent crude oil prices were to average $60 per barrel in 2015, the corporation estimates that 2015 depreciation, depletion, and amortization expenses would increase by not more than $75 million, after-tax as a result of changes in proved reserves compared with december 31, 2014.  see the supplementary oil and gas data on pages 87 through 95 in the accompanying financial statements for additional information on the corporation's oil and gas reserves.
impairment of long-lived assets:  the corporation reviews long‚Äêlived assets, including oil and gas fields, for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts may not be recovered.  long‚Äêlived assets are tested based on identifiable cash flows that are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities.  if the carrying amounts of the long-lived assets are not expected to be recovered by estimated undiscounted future net cash flows, the assets are impaired and an impairment loss is recorded.  the amount of impairment is determined based on the estimated fair value of the assets generally determined by discounting anticipated future net cash flows, an income valuation approach, or by a market‚Äêbased valuation approach, which are level 3 fair value measurements.
in the case of oil and gas fields, the present value of future net cash flows is based on management's best estimate of future prices, which is determined with reference to recent historical prices and published forward prices, applied to projected production volumes and discounted at a risk-adjusted rate.  the projected production volumes represent reserves, including probable reserves, expected to be produced based on a stipulated amount of capital expenditures.  the production volumes, prices and timing of production are consistent with internal projections and other externally reported information.  oil and gas prices used for determining asset impairments will generally differ from those used in the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows, since the standardized measure requires the use of historical twelve month average prices.
the corporation's impairment tests of long‚Äêlived e&p producing assets are based on its best estimates of future production volumes (including recovery factors), selling prices, operating and capital costs, the timing of future production and other factors, which are updated each time an impairment test is performed.  the corporation could have impairments if the projected production volumes from oil and gas fields decrease, crude oil and natural gas selling prices decline significantly for an extended period or future estimated capital and operating costs increase significantly.  as a result of the significant decline in crude oil prices in the fourth quarter of 2014, the corporation tested its oil and gas properties for impairment and determined no impairment existed at december 31, 2014.
impairment of goodwill:  the corporation's goodwill is tested for impairment annually on october 1st or when events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the goodwill may not be recoverable based on a two-step process.  the goodwill test is conducted at a reporting unit level, which is defined in accounting standards as an operating segment or one level below an operating segment.  the reporting unit or units to be used in an evaluation and measurement of goodwill for impairment testing are determined from a number of factors, including the manner in which the business is managed.  following a reorganization of its management structure in 2013, the corporation concluded that within its e&p segment it has two reporting units, offshore and onshore, consistent with the manner in which performance is assessed by the operating segment manager.
in step one of the impairment test, the fair value of a reporting unit is compared with its carrying amount, including goodwill.  if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying value, goodwill is not impaired.  if the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the corporation performs step two to determine possible impairment by comparing the implied fair value of goodwill with the carrying amount. the implied fair value of goodwill is determined by assuming the reporting unit is purchased at fair value with assets and liabilities of the reporting unit being reflected at fair value in the same manner as the accounting prescribed for a business combination.  the resulting excess of fair value of the reporting unit over the amounts assigned to the reporting unit's assets and liabilities represents the implied fair value of goodwill.  if the implied fair value of goodwill is less than its carrying amount, an impairment loss would be recorded.
the corporation's fair value estimate of each reporting unit is the sum of the anticipated discounted cash flows of producing assets and known development projects and an estimated market premium to reflect the market price an acquirer would pay for potential synergies including cost savings, access to new business opportunities, enterprise control and increased market share.  the determination of the fair value of each reporting unit depends on estimates about oil and gas reserves, future prices, timing of future net cash flows and market premiums.  the corporation also considers the relative market valuation of similar peer companies, and other market data if available, in determining fair value of a reporting unit.  in addition, a qualitative reconciliation of the corporation's market capitalization to the fair value of the reporting units used in the goodwill impairment test is performed as of the testing date to assess reasonableness of the reporting unit fair values.
significant extended declines in crude oil and natural gas prices or reduced reserve estimates could lead to a decrease in the fair value of a reporting unit that could result in failing step one and potentially result in an impairment of goodwill based on the outcome of step two.  if a reporting unit fails step one, it is possible that the implied fair value of goodwill in step two exceeds its carrying value due to one or more assets of the reporting unit having a fair value below its carrying value, or one or more assets of the reporting unit having taxable temporary differences that result in recognition of goodwill for the reporting unit under purchase accounting requirements in a business combination.
as there are significant differences in the way long-lived assets and goodwill are evaluated and measured for impairment testing, there may be impairments of individual assets that would not cause an impairment of the goodwill assigned at the reporting unit level or there could be an impairment of goodwill without a corresponding impairment of an underlying asset.
crude oil prices declined significantly following the date of the corporation's annual goodwill impairment test on october 1, 2014.  in addition, the corporation's stock price decreased to a level at december 31, 2014 that resulted in the corporation's book value exceeding its market capitalization by 6%.  as a result of these potential indicators of impairment, the corporation performed a separate goodwill impairment test at december 31, 2014.   the offshore and onshore reporting units, which have allocated goodwill of $1,098 million and $760 million, respectively at december 31, 2014, each passed step one of the impairment test.  however, the onshore reporting unit's fair value exceeded its carrying value by 5%.  while not required, the corporation performed a hypothetical step two test for the onshore reporting unit and estimated that the implied fair value of goodwill exceeded its carrying value.  accordingly, the corporation expects that the benefits of its goodwill totaling $1,858 million will be recovered through the operations of each of its reporting units based on market conditions at december 31, 2014.
income taxes:  judgments are required in the determination and recognition of income tax assets and liabilities in the financial statements.  these judgments include the requirement to only recognize the financial statement effect of a tax position when management believes that it is more likely than not, that based on the technical merits, the position will be sustained upon examination.
the corporation has net operating loss carryforwards or credit carryforwards in multiple jurisdictions and has recorded deferred tax assets for those losses and credits.  additionally, the corporation has deferred tax assets due to temporary differences between the book basis and tax basis of certain assets and liabilities.  regular assessments are made as to the likelihood of those deferred tax assets being realized.  if it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized, a valuation allowance is recorded to reduce the deferred tax assets to the amount that is expected to be realized.  in evaluating the realizability of deferred tax assets, the corporation considers the reversal of temporary differences, the expected utilization of net operating losses and credit carryforwards during available carryforward periods, the availability of tax planning strategies, the existence of appreciated assets and estimates of future taxable income and other factors.    estimates of future taxable income are based on assumptions of oil and gas reserves and selling prices that are consistent with the corporation's internal business forecasts.  the corporation does not provide for deferred u.s. income taxes for that portion of undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries that are indefinitely reinvested in foreign operations.
asset retirement obligations:  the corporation has material legal obligations to remove and dismantle long‚Äêlived assets and to restore land or seabed at certain exploration and production locations.  in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, the corporation recognizes a liability for the fair value of required asset retirement obligations.  in addition, the fair value of any legally required conditional asset retirement obligations is recorded if the liability can be reasonably estimated.  the corporation capitalizes such costs as a component of the carrying amount of the underlying assets in the period in which the liability is incurred.  in order to measure these obligations, the corporation estimates the fair value of the obligations by discounting the future payments that will be required to satisfy the obligations. in determining these estimates, the corporation is required to make several assumptions and judgments related to the scope of dismantlement, timing of settlement, interpretation of legal requirements, inflationary factors and discount rate.  in addition, there are other external factors which could significantly affect the ultimate settlement costs for these obligations including changes in environmental regulations and other statutory requirements, fluctuations in industry costs and foreign currency exchange rates and advances in technology.  as a result, the corporation's estimates of asset retirement obligations are subject to revision due to the factors described above.  changes in estimates prior to settlement result in adjustments to both the liability and related asset values.
retirement plans:  the corporation has funded non-contributory defined benefit pension plans, an unfunded supplemental pension plan and an unfunded post-retirement medical plan. the corporation recognizes in the consolidated balance sheet the net change in the funded status of the projected benefit obligation for these plans.
the determination of the obligations and expenses related to these plans are based on several actuarial assumptions, the most significant of which relate to the discount rate for measuring the present value of future plan obligations; expected long‚Äêterm rates of return on plan assets; the rate of future increases in compensation levels, and participant mortality assumptions.  these assumptions represent estimates made by the corporation, some of which can be affected by external factors.  for example, the discount rate used to estimate the corporation's projected benefit obligation is based on a portfolio of high‚Äêquality, fixed income debt instruments with maturities that approximate the expected payment of plan obligations,
while the expected return on plan assets is developed from the expected future returns for each asset category, weighted by the target allocation of pension assets to that asset category.  changes in these assumptions can have a material impact on the amounts reported in the corporation's financial statements.
derivatives:  the corporation utilizes derivative instruments for both financial risk management and trading activities.  in financial risk management activities, the corporation uses futures, forwards, options and swaps, individually or in combination to mitigate its exposure to fluctuations in the prices of crude oil and natural gas, as well as changes in interest and foreign currency exchange rates.  in trading activities, the corporation, principally through a consolidated partnership, trades energy‚Äêrelated commodities and derivatives, including futures, forwards, options and swaps, based on expectations of future market conditions. the energy trading joint venture, hetco, was sold in the first quarter of 2015.
all derivative instruments are recorded at fair value in the corporation's consolidated balance sheet.  the corporation's policy for recognizing the changes in fair value of derivatives varies based on the designation of the derivative.  the changes in fair value of derivatives that are not designated as hedges are recognized currently in earnings.  derivatives may be designated as hedges of expected future cash flows or forecasted transactions (cash flow hedges) or hedges of firm commitments (fair value hedges).  the effective portion of changes in fair value of derivatives that are designated as cash flow hedges is recorded as a component of other comprehensive income (loss).  amounts included in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) for cash flow hedges are reclassified into earnings in the same period that the hedged item is recognized in earnings.  the ineffective portion of changes in fair value of derivatives designated as cash flow hedges is recorded currently in earnings.  changes in fair value of derivatives designated as fair value hedges are recognized currently in earnings.  the change in fair value of the related hedged commitment is recorded as an adjustment to its carrying amount and recognized currently in earnings.
derivatives that are designated as either cash flow or fair value hedges are tested for effectiveness prospectively before they are executed and both prospectively and retrospectively on an on-going basis to determine whether they continue to qualify for hedge accounting.  the prospective and retrospective effectiveness calculations are performed using either historical simulation or other statistical models, which utilize historical observable market data consisting of futures curves and spot prices.
fair value measurements:  the corporation uses various valuation approaches in determining fair value for financial instruments, including the market and income approaches.  the corporation's fair value measurements also include non-performance risk and time value of money considerations.  counterparty credit is considered for receivable balances, and the corporation's credit is considered for accrued liabilities.
the corporation also records certain nonfinancial assets and liabilities at fair value when required by generally accepted accounting principles.  these fair value measurements are recorded in connection with business combinations, qualifying non-monetary exchanges, the initial recognition of asset retirement obligations and any impairment of long-lived assets, equity method investments or goodwill.
the corporation determines fair value in accordance with the fair value measurements accounting standard which established a hierarchy for the inputs used to measure fair value based on the source of the inputs, which generally range from quoted prices for identical instruments in a principal trading market (level 1) to estimates determined using related market data (level 3).  measurements derived indirectly from observable inputs or from quoted prices from markets that are less liquid are considered level 2.
when level 1 inputs are available within a particular market, those inputs are selected for determination of fair value over level 2 or 3 inputs in the same market.  to value derivatives that are characterized as level 2 and 3, the corporation uses observable inputs for similar instruments that are available from exchanges, pricing services or broker quotes.  these observable inputs may be supplemented with other methods, including internal extrapolation or interpolation, that result in the most representative prices for instruments with similar characteristics.  multiple inputs may be used to measure fair value, however, the level of fair value for each physical derivative and financial asset or liability is based on the lowest significant input level within this fair value hierarchy.
fair value measurements based on level 1 inputs:  measurements that are most observable are based on quoted prices of identical instruments obtained from the principal markets in which they are traded.  closing prices are both readily available and representative of fair value. market transactions occur with sufficient frequency and volume to assure liquidity.
fair value measurements based on level 2 inputs:  measurements derived indirectly from observable inputs or from quoted prices from markets that are less liquid are considered level 2.  measurements based on level 2 inputs include over‚Äêthe‚Äêcounter derivative instruments that are priced on an exchange traded curve but have contractual terms that are not identical to exchange traded contracts.
fair value measurements based on level 3 inputs:  measurements that are least observable are estimated from related market data determined from sources with little or no market activity for comparable contracts or are positions with longer durations.  fair values determined using discounted cash flows and other unobservable data are also classified as level 3.
environment, health and safety the corporation's long term vision and values provide a foundation for how we do business and define our commitment to meeting the highest standards of corporate citizenship and creating a long lasting positive impact on the communities where we do business.  the corporation's strategy is reflected in its environment, health, safety and social responsibility (ehs & sr) policies and by a management system framework that helps protect the corporation's workforce, customers and local communities.  the corporation's management systems are intended to promote internal consistency, adherence to policy objectives and continual improvement in ehs & sr performance.  improved performance may, in the short‚Äêterm, increase the corporation's operating costs and could also require increased capital expenditures to reduce potential risks to assets, reputation and license to operate.  in addition to enhanced ehs & sr performance, improved productivity and operational efficiencies may be realized from investments in ehs & sr. the corporation has programs in place to evaluate regulatory compliance, audit facilities, train employees, prevent and manage risks and emergencies and to generally meet corporate ehs & sr goals and objectives.
the corporation recognizes that climate change is a global environmental concern.  the corporation assesses, monitors and takes measures to reduce our carbon footprint at existing and planned operations.  the corporation is committed to complying with all greenhouse gas (ghg) emissions mandates and the responsible management of ghg emissions at its facilities.
the corporation will have continuing expenditures for environmental assessment and remediation.  sites where corrective action may be necessary include onshore exploration and production facilities, sites from discontinued operations as to which the corporation retained liability and, although not currently significant, "superfund" sites where the corporation has been named a potentially responsible party.
the corporation accrues for environmental assessment and remediation expenses when the future costs are probable and reasonably estimable.  at year‚Äêend 2014, the corporation's reserve for estimated remediation liabilities was approximately $80 million.  the corporation expects that existing reserves for environmental liabilities will adequately cover costs to assess and remediate known sites.  the corporation's remediation spending was approximately $12 million in 2014, $16 million in 2013 and $19 million in 2012.  the level of other expenditures to comply with federal, state, local and foreign country environmental regulations is difficult to quantify as such costs are captured as mostly indistinguishable components of the corporation's capital expenditures and operating expenses.
forward-looking information certain sections of this annual report on form 10‚Äêk, including business and properties, management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk, include references to the corporation's future results of operations and financial position, liquidity and capital resources, capital expenditures, asset sales, oil and gas production, tax rates, debt repayment, hedging, derivative, market risk and environmental disclosures, off‚Äêbalance sheet arrangements and contractual obligations and contingencies, which include forward‚Äêlooking information.  these sections typically include statements with words such as "anticipate", "estimate", "expect", "forecast", "guidance", "could", "may", "should", "would" or similar words, indicating that future outcomes are uncertain.  forward‚Äêlooking disclosures are based on the corporation's current understanding and assessment of these activities and reasonable assumptions about the future.  actual results may differ from these disclosures because of changes in market conditions, government actions and other factors.  for more information regarding the factors that may cause the corporation's results to differ from these statements, see item 1a. risk factors related to our business and operations.

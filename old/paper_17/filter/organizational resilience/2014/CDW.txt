item 1a. risk factors there are many factors that affect our business, results of operations and cash flows, some of which are beyond our control. the following is a description of some important factors that may cause our actual results of operations and cash flows in future periods to differ materially from those currently expected or desired.
risks related to our business general economic conditions could negatively affect technology spending by our customers and put downward pressure on prices, which may have an adverse impact on our business, results of operations or cash flows.
weak economic conditions generally, sustained uncertainty about global economic conditions, u.s. federal government spending cuts and the impact of new government programs, or a tightening of credit markets could cause our customers and potential customers to postpone or reduce spending on technology products or services or put downward pressure on prices, which could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations or cash flows.
our financial performance could be adversely affected by decreases in spending on technology products and services by our public segment customers.
our sales to our public segment customers are impacted by government spending policies, budget priorities and revenue levels. although our sales to the federal government are diversified across multiple agencies and departments, they collectively accounted for approximately 7% of 2014 net sales. an adverse change in government spending policies (including ongoing budget cuts at the federal level), budget priorities or revenue levels could cause our public segment customers to reduce their purchases or to terminate or not renew their contracts with us, which could adversely affect our business, results of operations or cash flows. for example, in 2013, as a result of sequestration and related budget uncertainty and the partial shutdown of the federal government for 16 days, we experienced significantly reduced federal sales in our public segment.
our business depends on our vendor partner relationships and the availability of their products.
we purchase products for resale from vendor partners, which include oems and software publishers, and wholesale distributors. for the year ended december 31, 2014, we purchased approximately 54% of the products we sold directly from vendor partners and the remaining amount from wholesale distributors. we are authorized by vendor partners to sell all or some of their products via direct marketing activities. our authorization with each vendor partner is subject to specific terms and conditions regarding such things as sales channel restrictions, product return privileges, price protection policies, purchase discounts and vendor partner programs and funding, including purchase rebates, sales volume rebates, purchasing incentives and cooperative advertising reimbursements. however, we do not have any long-term contracts with our vendor partners and many of these arrangements are terminable upon notice by either party. a reduction in vendor partner programs or funding or our failure to timely react to changes in vendor partner programs or funding could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations or cash flows. in addition, a reduction in the amount of credit granted to us by our vendor partners could increase our need for, and the cost of, working capital and could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations or cash flows, particularly given our substantial indebtedness.
from time to time, vendor partners may terminate or limit our right to sell some or all of their products or change the terms and conditions or reduce or discontinue the incentives that they offer us. for example, there is no assurance that, as our vendor partners continue to sell directly to end users and through resellers, they will not limit or curtail the availability of their products to solutions providers like us. any such termination or limitation or the implementation of such changes could have a negative impact on our business, results of operations or cash flows.
although we purchase from a diverse vendor base, in 2014, products we purchased from distributors tech data, synnex and ingram micro each represented 9% of our total purchases. in addition, sales of apple, cisco, emc, hewlett-packard, lenovo and microsoft products comprise a substantial portion of our sales, representing approximately 54% of net sales in 2014. sales of products manufactured by hewlett-packard and cisco represented approximately 18% and 14%, respectively, of our 2014 net sales. the loss of, or change in business relationship with, any of these or any other key vendor partners, the diminished availability of their products, or backlogs for their products leading to manufacturer allocation, could reduce the supply and increase the cost of products we sell and negatively impact our competitive position.
additionally, the relocation of key distributors utilized in our purchasing model could increase our need for, and the cost of, working capital and have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations or cash flows. further, the sale, spin-off or combination of any of our vendor partners and/or certain of their business units, including any such sale to or combination with a vendor with whom we do not currently have a commercial relationship or whose products we do not sell, could have an adverse impact on our business, results of operations or cash flows.
our sales are dependent on continued innovations in hardware, software and services offerings by our vendor partners and the competitiveness of their offerings, and our ability to partner with new and emerging technology providers.
the technology industry is characterized by rapid innovation and the frequent introduction of new and enhanced hardware, software and services offerings, such as cloud-based solutions, including saas, iaas and paas. we have been and will continue to be dependent on innovations in hardware, software and services offerings, as well as the acceptance of those innovations by customers. a decrease in the rate of innovation, or the lack of acceptance of innovations by customers, could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations or cash flows.
in addition, if we are unable to keep up with changes in technology and new hardware, software and services offerings, for example by providing the appropriate training to our account managers, sales technology specialists and engineers to enable them to effectively sell and deliver such new offerings to customers, our business, results of operations or cash flows could be adversely affected.
we also are dependent upon our vendor partners for the development and marketing of hardware, software and services to compete effectively with hardware, software and services of vendors whose products and services we do not currently offer or that we are not authorized to offer in one or more customer channels. in addition, our success is dependent on our ability to develop relationships with and sell hardware, software and services from new emerging vendors and vendors that we have not historically represented in the marketplace. to the extent that a vendor's offering that is highly in demand is not available to us for resale in one or more customer channels, and there is not a competitive offering from another vendor that we are authorized to sell in such customer channels, or we are unable to develop relationships with new technology providers or companies that we have not historically represented, our business, results of operations or cash flows could be adversely impacted.
substantial competition could reduce our market share and significantly harm our financial performance.
•   resellers, such as dimension data, eplus, insight enterprises, pc connection, pcm, presidio, softchoice, world wide technology and many smaller resellers;
•   manufacturers who sell directly to customers, such as dell, hewlett-packard and apple;
•   large service providers and system integrators, such as ibm, accenture, hewlett-packard and dell;
•   cloud providers, such as at&amp;t, amazon web services and box; and
•   retailers (including their e-commerce activities), such as staples and office depot.
we expect the competitive landscape in which we compete to continue to change as new technologies are developed. while innovation can help our business as it creates new offerings for us to sell, it can also disrupt our business model and create new and stronger competitors. for instance, while cloud-based solutions present an opportunity for us, cloud-based solutions and technologies that deliver technology solutions as a service could increase the amount of sales directly to customers rather than through solutions providers like us, or could reduce the amount of hardware we sell, leading to a reduction in our sales and/or profitability. in addition, some of our hardware and software vendor partners sell, and could intensify their efforts to sell, their products directly to our customers. moreover, traditional oems have increased their services capabilities through mergers and acquisitions with service providers, which could potentially increase competition in the market to provide comprehensive technology solutions to customers. if any of these trends becomes more prevalent, it could adversely affect our business, results of operations or cash flows.
we focus on offering a high level of service to gain new customers and retain existing customers. to the extent we face increased competition to gain and retain customers, we may be required to reduce prices, increase advertising expenditures or take other actions which could adversely affect our business, results of operations or cash flows. additionally, some of our competitors may reduce their prices in an attempt to stimulate sales, which may require us to reduce prices. this would require us to sell a greater number of products to achieve the same level of net sales and gross profit. if such a reduction in prices occurs and we are unable to attract new customers and sell increased quantities of products, our sales growth and profitability could be adversely affected.
the success of our business depends on the continuing development, maintenance and operation of our information technology systems.
our success is dependent on the accuracy, proper utilization and continuing development of our information technology systems, including our business systems, such as our sales, customer management, financial and accounting, marketing, purchasing, warehouse management, e-commerce and mobile systems, as well as our operational platforms, including voice and data networks and power systems. the quality and our utilization of the information generated by our information technology systems, and our success in implementing new systems and upgrades, affects, among other things, our ability to:
•   conduct business with our customers, including delivering services and solutions to them;
•   purchase, sell, ship and invoice our hardware and software products and provide and invoice our services efficiently and on a timely basis; and
•   maintain our cost-efficient operating model while scaling our business.
the integrity of our information technology systems is vulnerable to disruption due to forces beyond our control. while we have taken steps to protect our information technology systems from a variety of threats, including computer viruses, malware, phishing, social engineering, unauthorized access and other malicious attacks, both internal and external, and human error, there can be no guarantee that those steps will be effective. furthermore, although we have redundant systems at a separate location to back up our primary systems, there can be no assurance that these redundant systems will operate properly if and when required. any disruption to or infiltration of our information technology systems could significantly harm our business and results of operations.
breaches of data security could adversely impact our business.
our business involves the storage and transmission of proprietary information and sensitive or confidential data, including personal information of coworkers, customers and others. in addition, we operate data centers for our customers which host their technology infrastructure and may store and transmit both business-critical data and confidential information. in connection with our services business, our coworkers also have access to our customers' confidential data and other information. we have privacy and data security policies in place that are designed to prevent security breaches; however, as newer technologies evolve, we could be exposed to increased risk of breaches in security. breaches in security could expose us, our customers or other individuals to a risk of public disclosure, loss or misuse of this information, resulting in legal claims or proceedings, liability or regulatory penalties under laws protecting the privacy of personal information, as well as the loss of existing or potential customers and damage to our brand and reputation. in addition, the cost and operational consequences of implementing further data protection measures could be significant. such breaches, costs and consequences could adversely affect our business, results of operations or cash flows.
the failure to comply with our public segment contracts or applicable laws and regulations could result in, among other things, termination, fines or other liabilities, and changes in procurement regulations could adversely impact our business, results of operations or cash flows.
revenues in our public segment are derived from sales to governmental entities, educational institutions and healthcare customers, through various contracts and open market sales of products and services. sales to public segment customers are highly regulated. noncompliance with contract provisions, government procurement regulations or other applicable laws or regulations (including but not limited to the false claims act and the medicare and medicaid anti-kickback statute) could result in civil, criminal and administrative liability, including substantial monetary fines or damages, termination of government contracts or other public segment customer contracts, and suspension, debarment or ineligibility from doing business with the government and other customers in the public segment. in addition, contracts in the public segment are generally terminable at any time for convenience of the contracting agency or group purchasing organization ("gpo") or upon default. furthermore, our inability to enter into or retain contracts with gpos may threaten our ability to sell to customers in those gpos and compete. the effect of any of these possible actions could adversely affect our business, results of operations or cash flows. in addition, the adoption of new or modified procurement regulations and other requirements may increase our compliance costs and reduce our gross margins, which could have a negative effect on our business, results of operations or cash flows.
if we fail to provide high-quality services to our customers, or if our third-party service providers fail to provide high-quality services to our customers, our reputation, business, results of operations or cash flows could be adversely affected.
our service offerings include field services, managed services, warranties, configuration services, partner services and telecom services. additionally, we deliver and manage mission critical software, systems and network solutions for our customers. we also offer certain services, such as implementation and installation services and repair services, to our customers through various third-party service providers engaged to perform these services on our behalf. if we or our third-party service providers fail to provide high quality services to our customers or such services result in a disruption of our customers' businesses, this could, among other things, result in legal claims and proceedings and liability. moreover, as we expand our services and solutions business, we may be exposed to additional operational, regulatory and other risks. we also could incur liability for failure to comply with the rules and regulations applicable to the new services and solutions we provide to our customers. if any of the foregoing were to occur, our reputation with our customers, our brand and our business, results of operations or cash flows could be adversely affected.
if we lose any of our key personnel, or are unable to attract and retain the talent required for our business, our business could be disrupted and our financial performance could suffer.
our success is heavily dependent upon our ability to attract, develop, engage and retain key personnel to manage and grow our business, including our key executive, management, sales, services and technical coworkers.
our future success will depend to a significant extent on the efforts of thomas e. richards, our chairman and chief executive officer, as well as the continued service and support of our other executive officers. our future success also will depend on our ability to retain our customer-facing coworkers, who have been given critical cdw knowledge regarding, and the opportunity to develop strong relationships with, many of our customers. in addition, as we seek to expand our offerings of value-added services and solutions, our success will even more heavily depend on attracting and retaining highly skilled technology specialists and engineers, for whom the market is extremely competitive.
our inability to attract, develop and retain key personnel could have an adverse effect on our relationships with our vendor partners and customers and adversely affect our ability to expand our offerings of value-added services and solutions. moreover, our inability to train our sales, services and technical personnel effectively to meet the rapidly changing technology
needs of our customers could cause a decrease in the overall quality and efficiency of such personnel. such consequences could adversely affect our business, results of operations or cash flows.
the interruption of the flow of products from suppliers could disrupt our supply chain.
a significant portion of the products we sell are manufactured or purchased by our vendor partners outside of the u.s., primarily in asia. political, social or economic instability in asia, or in other regions in which our vendor partners purchase or manufacture the products we sell, could cause disruptions in trade, including exports to the u.s. other events that could also cause disruptions to our supply chain include:
•   the imposition of additional trade law provisions or regulations;
•   the imposition of additional duties, tariffs and other charges on imports and exports;
•   natural disasters or other adverse occurrences at, or affecting, any of our suppliers' facilities;
•   restrictions on the transfer of funds;
•   the financial instability or bankruptcy of manufacturers; and
we cannot predict whether the countries in which the products we sell are purchased or manufactured, or may be purchased or manufactured in the future, will be subject to new or additional trade restrictions or sanctions imposed by the u.s. or foreign governments, including the likelihood, type or effect of any such restrictions. trade restrictions, including new or increased tariffs or quotas, embargoes, sanctions, safeguards and customs restrictions against the products we sell, as well as foreign labor strikes and work stoppages or boycotts, could increase the cost or reduce the supply of product available to us and adversely affect our business, results of operations or cash flows. in addition, our exports are subject to regulations and noncompliance with these requirements could have a negative effect on our business, results of operations or cash flows.
a natural disaster or other adverse occurrence at one of our primary facilities or customer data centers could damage our business.
substantially all of our corporate, warehouse and distribution functions are located at our vernon hills, illinois facilities and our second distribution center in north las vegas, nevada. if the warehouse and distribution equipment at one of our distribution centers were to be seriously damaged by a natural disaster or other adverse occurrence, we could utilize the other distribution center or third-party distributors to ship products to our customers. however, this may not be sufficient to avoid interruptions in our service and may not enable us to meet all of the needs of our customers and would cause us to incur incremental operating costs. in addition, we operate three customer data centers and numerous sales offices which may contain both business-critical data and confidential information of our customers. a natural disaster or other adverse occurrence at any of the customer data centers or at any of our major sales offices could negatively impact our business, results of operations or cash flows.
we are heavily dependent on commercial delivery services.
we generally ship hardware products to our customers by fedex, united parcel service and other commercial delivery services and invoice customers for delivery charges. if we are unable to pass on to our customers future increases in the cost of commercial delivery services, our profitability could be adversely affected. additionally, strikes, inclement weather, natural disasters or other service interruptions by such shippers could adversely affect our ability to deliver products on a timely basis.
we are exposed to accounts receivable and inventory risks.
we extend credit to our customers for a significant portion of our net sales, typically on 30-day payment terms. we are subject to the risk that our customers may not pay for the products they have purchased, or may pay at a slower rate than we have historically experienced, the risk of which is heightened during periods of economic downturn or uncertainty or, in the case of public segment customers, during periods of budget constraints.
we are also exposed to inventory risks as a result of the rapid technological changes that affect the market and pricing for the products we sell. we seek to minimize our inventory exposure through a variety of inventory management procedures and policies, including our rapid-turn inventory model, as well as vendor price protection and product return programs. however, if we were unable to maintain our rapid-turn inventory model, if there were unforeseen product developments that
created more rapid obsolescence or if our vendor partners were to change their terms and conditions, our inventory risks could increase. we also from time to time take advantage of cost savings associated with certain opportunistic bulk inventory purchases offered by our vendor partners or we may decide to carry high inventory levels of certain products that have limited or no return privileges due to customer demand or request. these bulk purchases could increase our exposure to inventory obsolescence.
we could be exposed to additional risks if we continue to make strategic investments or acquisitions or enter into alliances.
we may continue to pursue transactions, including strategic investments, acquisitions or alliances, in an effort to extend or complement our existing business. these types of transactions involve numerous business risks, including finding suitable transaction partners and negotiating terms that are acceptable to us, the diversion of management's attention from other business concerns, extending our product or service offerings into areas in which we have limited experience, entering into new geographic markets, the potential loss of key coworkers or business relationships and successfully integrating acquired businesses, any of which could adversely affect our operations.
in addition, our financial results could be adversely affected by financial adjustments required by accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america ("gaap") in connection with these types of transactions where significant goodwill or intangible assets are recorded. to the extent the value of goodwill or identifiable intangible assets with indefinite lives becomes impaired, we may be required to incur material charges relating to the impairment of those assets.
our future operating results may fluctuate significantly.
we may experience significant variations in our future quarterly results of operations. these fluctuations may cause the market price of our common stock to be volatile and may result from many factors, including the condition of the technology industry in general, shifts in demand and pricing for hardware, software and services and the introduction of new products or upgrades.
our operating results are also highly dependent on our level of gross profit as a percentage of net sales. our gross profit percentage fluctuates due to numerous factors, some of which may be outside of our control, including general macroeconomic conditions; pricing pressures; changes in product costs from our vendor partners; the availability of price protection, purchase discounts and incentive programs from our vendor partners; changes in product, order size and customer mix; the risk of some items in our inventory becoming obsolete; increases in delivery costs that we cannot pass on to customers; and general market and competitive conditions.
in addition, our cost structure is based, in part, on anticipated sales and gross margins. therefore, we may not be able to adjust our cost structure quickly enough to compensate for any unexpected sales or gross margin shortfall, and any such inability could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations or cash flows.
we are exposed to risks from legal proceedings and audits.
we are party to various legal proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of our business, which include commercial, employment, tort and other litigation.
we are subject to intellectual property infringement claims against us in the ordinary course of our business, either because of the products and services we sell or the business systems and processes we use to sell such products and services, in the form of cease-and-desist letters, licensing inquiries, lawsuits and other communications and demands. in our industry, such intellectual property claims have become more frequent as the complexity of technological products and the intensity of competition in our industry have increased. increasingly, many of these assertions are brought by non-practicing entities whose principal business model is to secure patent licensing revenue, but we may also be subject to suits from inventors, competitors or other patent holders who may seek licensing revenue, lost profits and/or an injunction preventing us from engaging in certain activities, including selling certain products and services.
because of our significant sales to governmental entities, we also are subject to audits by federal, state and local authorities. we also are subject to audits by various vendor partners and large customers, including government agencies, relating to purchases and sales under various contracts. in addition, we are subject to indemnification claims under various contracts.
current and future litigation, infringement claims, governmental proceedings, audits or indemnification claims that we face may result in substantial costs and expenses and significantly divert the attention of our management regardless of the outcome. in addition, current and future litigation, infringement claims, governmental proceedings, audits or indemnification claims could lead to increased costs or interruptions of our normal business operations. litigation, infringement claims, governmental proceedings, audits or indemnification claims involve uncertainties and the eventual outcome of any litigation,
infringement claim, governmental proceeding, audit or indemnification claim could adversely affect our business, results of operations or cash flows.
failure to comply with the laws and regulations applicable to our operations could adversely impact our business, results of operations or cash flows.
our operations are subject to numerous u.s. and foreign laws and regulations in a number of areas including, but not limited to, areas of labor and employment, advertising, e-commerce, tax, import and export requirements, anti-corruption, data privacy requirements, anti-competition, and environmental, health, and safety. compliance with these laws, regulations and similar requirements may be onerous and expensive, and they may be inconsistent from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, further increasing the cost of compliance and doing business, and the risk of noncompliance. we have implemented policies and procedures designed to help ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations, but there can be no guarantee against coworkers, contractors, or agents violating such laws and regulations or our policies and procedures.
we have significant deferred cancellation of debt income.
as a result of a 2009 debt modification, we realized $395.5 million of cancellation of debt income ("codi"). we made an election under code section 108(i) to defer this codi from taxable income, pursuant to which we are also required to defer certain original issue discount ("oid") deductions as they accrue. as of december 31, 2013, we had deferred approximately $114.5 million of oid deductions. starting in 2014, we were required to include the deferred codi and the deferred oid into taxable income ratably over a five-year period ending in 2018. because we have more codi than the aggregate of our deferred oid on the relevant remaining debt instruments, we will have a future cash tax liability associated with our significant deferred codi. we have reflected the associated cash tax liability in our deferred taxes for financial accounting purposes.
all of our deferred codi will be accelerated into current taxable income if, prior to 2018, we engage in a so-called "impairment transaction" and the gross value of our assets immediately afterward is less than 110% of the sum of our total liabilities and the tax on the net amount of our deferred codi and oid (the "110% test") as determined under the applicable treasury regulations. an "impairment transaction" is any transaction that impairs our ability to pay the tax on our deferred codi, and includes dividends or distributions with respect to our equity and charitable contributions, in each case in a manner that is not consistent with our historical practice within the meaning of the applicable treasury regulations.
prior to 2018, our willingness to pay dividends or make distributions with respect to our equity could be adversely affected if, at the time, we do not meet the 110% test and, as a result, the payment of a dividend or the making of a distribution would accelerate the tax payable with respect to our deferred codi. we believe that, based on our interpretation of applicable treasury regulations, the gross value of our assets exceeds 110% of the sum of our total liabilities and the tax on the net amount of our deferred codi and oid as of the filing date of this annual report on form 10-k. however, we cannot assure you that this will continue to be true in the future.
risks related to our indebtedness we have a substantial amount of indebtedness, which could have important consequences to our business.
we have a substantial amount of indebtedness. as of december 31, 2014, we had $3.2 billion of total long-term debt outstanding, as defined by gaap, and $332.1 million of obligations outstanding under our inventory financing agreements, and the ability to borrow an additional $935.6 million under our senior secured asset-based revolving credit facility (the "revolving loan"). our substantial indebtedness could have important consequences, including the following:
•   making it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to our indebtedness;
•   requiring us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to debt service payments on our and our subsidiaries' debt, which reduces the funds available for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and other general corporate purposes;
•   requiring us to comply with restrictive covenants in our senior credit facilities and indentures, which limit the manner in which we conduct our business;
•   making it more difficult for us to obtain vendor financing from our vendor partners, including original equipment manufacturers and software publishers;
•   limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in the industry in which we operate;
•   placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to any of our less-leveraged competitors;
•   increasing our vulnerability to both general and industry-specific adverse economic conditions; and
•   limiting our ability to obtain additional debt or equity financing to fund future working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions or other general corporate requirements and increasing our cost of borrowing.
restrictive covenants under our senior credit facilities and, to varying degrees, our indentures may adversely affect our operations and liquidity.
our senior credit facilities and, to varying degrees, our indentures contain, and any future indebtedness of ours may contain, various covenants that limit our ability to, among other things:
•   pay dividends or make distributions to holders of our capital stock or to make certain other restricted payments or investments;
•   repurchase or redeem capital stock;
•   make loans, capital expenditures or investments or acquisitions;
•   merge or consolidate with other companies or transfer all or substantially all of our assets;
•   transfer or sell assets, including capital stock of subsidiaries; and
as a result of these covenants, we are limited in the manner in which we conduct our business and we may be unable to engage in favorable business activities or finance future operations or capital needs. a breach of any of these covenants or any of the other restrictive covenants would result in a default under our senior credit facilities. upon the occurrence of an event of default under our senior credit facilities, the lenders:
•   could elect to declare all borrowings outstanding thereunder, together with accrued and unpaid interest and fees, to be due and payable; or
•   could require us to apply all of our available cash to repay these borrowings.
the acceleration of amounts outstanding under our senior credit facilities would likely trigger an event of default under our existing indentures.
if we were unable to repay those amounts, the lenders under our senior credit facilities could proceed against the collateral granted to them to secure our borrowings thereunder. we have pledged a significant portion of our assets as collateral under our senior credit facilities. if the lenders under our senior credit facilities accelerate the repayment of borrowings, we cannot assure you that we will have sufficient assets to repay our senior credit facilities and our other indebtedness or the ability to borrow sufficient funds to refinance such indebtedness. even if we were able to obtain new financing, it may not be on commercially reasonable terms, or terms that are acceptable to us.
in addition, under our revolving loan, we are permitted to borrow an aggregate amount of up to $1,250.0 million. however, our ability to borrow under our revolving loan is limited by a borrowing base and a liquidity condition. the borrowing base at any time equals the sum of up to 85% of cdw llc and its subsidiary guarantors' eligible accounts receivable (net of accounts reserves) (up to 30% of such eligible accounts receivable which can consist of federal government accounts receivable) plus the lesser of (i) 75% of cdw llc and its subsidiary guarantors' eligible inventory (valued at cost and net of inventory reserves) and (ii) the product of 85% multiplied by the net orderly liquidation value percentage multiplied by eligible inventory (valued at cost and net of inventory reserves), less reserves (other than accounts reserves and inventory
reserves). the borrowing base in effect as of december 31, 2014 was $1,253.4 million, and therefore, did not restrict our ability to borrow under our revolving loan as of that date.
our ability to borrow under our revolving loan is also limited by a minimum liquidity condition, which provides that, if excess cash availability is less than the lesser of (i) $125.0 million and (ii) the greater of (a) 10% of the borrowing base and (b) $100.0 million, the lenders are not required to lend any additional amounts under our revolving loan unless the consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio (as defined in the credit agreement for our revolving loan) is at least 1.0 to 1.0. moreover, our revolving loan provides discretion to the agent bank acting on behalf of the lenders to impose additional availability reserves, which could materially impair the amount of borrowings that would otherwise be available to us. we cannot assure you that the agent bank will not impose such reserves or, were it to do so, that the resulting impact of this action would not materially and adversely impair our liquidity.
we will be required to generate sufficient cash to service our indebtedness and, if not successful, we may be forced to take other actions to satisfy our obligations under our indebtedness.
our ability to make scheduled payments on or to refinance our debt obligations depends on our financial and operating performance, which is subject to prevailing economic and competitive conditions and to certain financial, business and other factors beyond our control. our outstanding long-term debt will impose significant cash interest payment obligations on us and, accordingly, we will have to generate significant cash flow from operating activities to fund our debt service obligations. we cannot assure you that we will maintain a level of cash flows from operating activities sufficient to permit us to pay the principal, premium, if any, and interest on our indebtedness. see "management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations-liquidity and capital resources" included elsewhere in this report.
if our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt service obligations, we may be forced to reduce or delay capital expenditures, sell assets or operations, seek additional debt or equity capital, restructure or refinance our indebtedness, or revise or delay our strategic plan. we cannot assure you that we would be able to take any of these actions, that these actions would be successful and permit us to meet our scheduled debt service obligations or satisfy our capital requirements, or that these actions would be permitted under the terms of our existing or future debt agreements, including our senior credit facilities and indentures. in the absence of such operating results and resources, we could face substantial liquidity problems and might be required to dispose of material assets or operations to meet our debt service and other obligations. our senior credit facilities and the indenture governing our 8.5% senior notes due 2019 ("2019 senior notes") restrict our ability to dispose of assets and use the proceeds from the disposition. we may not be able to consummate those dispositions or to obtain the proceeds which we could realize from them and these proceeds may not be adequate to meet any debt service obligations then due. furthermore, the sponsors have no obligation to provide us with debt or equity financing.
•   the lenders under our senior credit facilities could foreclose against the assets securing the borrowings from them and the lenders under our term loan facility could terminate their commitments to lend us money; and
despite our indebtedness levels, we and our subsidiaries may be able to incur substantially more debt, including secured debt. this could further increase the risks associated with our leverage.
we and our subsidiaries may be able to incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future. the terms of our senior credit facilities and indentures do not fully prohibit us or our subsidiaries from doing so. to the extent that we incur additional indebtedness or such other obligations, the risks associated with our substantial indebtedness described above, including our possible inability to service our debt, will increase. as of december 31, 2014, we had approximately $935.6 million available for additional borrowing under our revolving loan after taking into account borrowing base limitations (net of $2.1 million of issued and undrawn letters of credit and $332.1 million of reserves related to our floorplan sub-facility).
variable rate indebtedness subjects us to interest rate risk, which could cause our debt service obligations to increase significantly.
certain of our borrowings, primarily borrowings under our senior credit facilities, are at variable rates of interest and expose us to interest rate risk. as of december 31, 2014, we had $1,513.5 million of variable rate debt outstanding. if interest rates increase above 1% per annum, our debt service obligations on the variable rate indebtedness would increase even though the amount borrowed remained the same, and our net income would decrease. although we have entered into interest rate cap
agreements on our term loan facility to reduce interest rate volatility, we cannot assure you we will be able to enter into interest rate cap agreements in the future on acceptable terms or that such caps or the caps we have in place now will be effective.
risks related to ownership of our common stock our common stock price may be volatile and may decline regardless of our operating performance, and holders of our common stock could lose a significant portion of their investment.
the market price for our common stock may be volatile. our stockholders may not be able to resell their shares of common stock at or above the price at which they purchased such shares, due to fluctuations in the market price of our common stock, which may be caused by a number of factors, many of which we cannot control, including the risk factors described in this annual report on form 10-k and the following:
•   changes in financial estimates by any securities analysts who follow our common stock, our failure to meet these estimates or failure of securities analysts to initiate or maintain coverage of our common stock;
•   future sales of our common stock by our officers, directors and significant stockholders, including the sponsors;
•   market conditions or trends in our industry or the economy as a whole;
•   investors' perceptions of our prospects;
•   announcements by us or our competitors of significant contracts, acquisitions, joint ventures or capital commitments;
•   changes in key personnel; and
•   our limited public float in light of the sponsors' beneficial ownership of a majority of our common stock, which may result in the trading of relatively small quantities of shares by our stockholders having a disproportionate positive or negative influence on the market price of our common stock.
in addition, the stock markets have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have affected and continue to affect the market prices of equity securities of many companies, including companies in our industry. in the past, securities class action litigation has followed periods of market volatility. if we were involved in securities litigation, we could incur substantial costs, and our resources and the attention of management could be diverted from our business.
madison dearborn beneficially owns approximately 15.5% of our common stock and providence equity beneficially owns approximately 13.7% of our common stock as of february 20, 2015. as a result of their ownership, each sponsor, so long as it holds a sizable portion of our outstanding common stock, will have substantial voting power with respect to matters submitted to a vote of stockholders. in addition, so long as each sponsor has representation on our board of directors, it will have the ability to exercise influence over decision-making with respect to our business direction and policies. matters over which each of the sponsors may, directly or indirectly, exercise influence include:
•   the election of our board of directors and the appointment and removal of our officers;
•   mergers and other business combination transactions, including proposed transactions that would result in our stockholders receiving a premium price for their shares;
•   other acquisitions or dispositions of businesses or assets;
•   incurrence of indebtedness and the issuance of equity securities;
•   repurchase of stock and payment of dividends; and
•   the issuance of shares to management under our equity incentive plans.
under our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, each sponsor and its affiliates do not have any obligation to present to us, and each sponsor may separately pursue, corporate opportunities of which it becomes aware, even if those opportunities are ones that we would have pursued if granted the opportunity.
future sales of our common stock, or the perception in the public markets that these sales may occur, may depress our stock price.
sales of substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market, or the perception that these sales could occur, could adversely affect the price of our common stock and could impair our ability to raise capital through the sale of additional shares. as of february 20, 2015, there were 172,275,656 shares of our common stock outstanding. the shares of our common stock sold in our initial public offering and in registered secondary offerings are freely tradable without restriction under the securities act of 1933, as amended (the "securities act"), except that any shares of our common stock that may be acquired by our directors, executive officers and other affiliates, as that term is defined in the securities act, may be sold only in compliance with certain volume limitations and other restrictions of rule 144 under the securities act.
the remaining shares of our common stock, to the extent not previously sold pursuant to an exemption from registration, will continue to be "restricted securities" within the meaning of rule 144 under the securities act and subject to certain restrictions on resale. restricted securities may be sold in the public market only if they are registered under the securities act or are sold pursuant to an exemption from registration such as rule 144 under the securities act.
as of february 20, 2015, the holders of approximately 53,000,000 shares of our common stock will continue to have the right to require us to register the sales of such shares under the securities act, under the terms of an agreement between us and the holders.
in the future, we may also issue our securities in connection with investments or acquisitions. the number of shares of our common stock issued in connection with an investment or acquisition could constitute a material portion of our then-outstanding shares of our common stock.
our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws contain provisions that may make the acquisition of the company more difficult without the approval of our board of directors. these provisions:
•   authorize the issuance of undesignated preferred stock, the terms of which may be established and the shares of which may be issued without stockholder approval, and which may include super voting, special approval, dividend, or other rights or preferences superior to the rights of the holders of common stock;
•   establish a classified board of directors so that not all members of our board of directors are elected at one time;
•   generally prohibit stockholder action by written consent, requiring all stockholder actions be taken at a meeting of our stockholders;
•   provide that special meetings of the stockholders can only be called by or at the direction of (i) our board of directors pursuant to a written resolution adopted by the affirmative vote of the majority of the total number of directors that the company would have if there were no vacancies;
•   establish advance notice requirements for nominations for elections to our board of directors or for proposing matters that can be acted upon by stockholders at stockholder meetings; and
•   provide that our board of directors is expressly authorized to make, alter or repeal our amended and restated bylaws.
our amended and restated certificate of incorporation also contains a provision that provides us with protections similar to section 203 of the delaware general corporation law, and will prevent us from engaging in a business combination with a person who acquires at least 15% of our common stock for a period of three years from the date such person acquired such common stock, unless board or stockholder approval is obtained prior to the acquisition. these anti-takeover provisions and other provisions under delaware law could discourage, delay or prevent a transaction involving a change in control of the company, even if doing so would benefit our stockholders. these provisions could also discourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for our stockholders to elect directors of their choosing and to cause us to take other corporate actions our stockholders desire.
conflicts of interest may arise because some of our directors are principals of our largest stockholders.
paul finnegan and robin selati, who are principals of madison dearborn, and glenn creamer and michael dominguez, who are managing directors of providence equity, serve on our board of directors. as of february 20, 2015, madison dearborn and providence equity each continue to hold a sizable portion of our outstanding common stock. the sponsors and the entities respectively controlled by them may hold equity interests in entities that directly or indirectly compete with us, and companies in which they currently invest may begin competing with us. as a result of these relationships, when conflicts arise between the interests of madison dearborn or providence equity, on the one hand, and of other stockholders, on the other hand, these directors may not be disinterested. although our directors and officers have a duty of loyalty to us under delaware law and our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, transactions that we enter into in which a director or officer has a conflict of interest are generally permissible so long as (1) the material facts relating to the director's or officer's relationship or interest as to the transaction are disclosed to our board of directors and a majority of our disinterested directors approves the transaction, (2) the material facts relating to the director's or officer's relationship or interest as to the transaction are disclosed to our stockholders and a majority of our disinterested stockholders approve the transaction or (3) the transaction is otherwise fair to us. our amended and restated certificate of incorporation also provides that any principal, officer, member, manager and/or employee of a sponsor or any entity that controls, is controlled by or under common control with a sponsor (other than us or any company that is controlled by us) or a sponsor-managed investment fund will not be required to offer any transaction opportunity of which they become aware to us and could take any such opportunity for themselves or offer it to other companies in which they have an investment, unless such opportunity is offered to them solely in their capacities as our directors.
we cannot assure you that we will continue to pay dividends on our common stock or repurchase any of our common stock under our share repurchase program, and our indebtedness and certain tax considerations could limit our ability to continue to pay dividends on, or make share repurchases of, our common stock. if we do not continue to pay dividends, you may not receive any return on investment unless you are able to sell your common stock for a price greater than your purchase price.
we expect to continue to pay a cash dividend on our common stock of $0.0675 per share per quarter, or $0.27 per share per annum. any determination to pay dividends in the future will be at the discretion of our board of directors. any determination to pay dividends on, or repurchase, shares of our common stock in the future will depend upon our results of operations, financial condition, business prospects, capital requirements, contractual restrictions, including those under our senior credit facilities and indentures, any potential indebtedness we may incur, restrictions imposed by applicable law, tax considerations and other factors our board of directors deems relevant. in addition, our ability to pay dividends on, or repurchase, shares of our common stock will be limited by restrictions on our ability to pay dividends or make distributions to our stockholders and on the ability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends or make distributions to us, in each case, under the terms of our current and any future agreements governing our indebtedness. there can be no assurance that we will continue to pay a dividend at the current rate or at all or that we will repurchase shares of our common stock. if we do not pay dividends in the future, realization of a gain on your investment will depend entirely on the appreciation of the price of our common stock, which may never occur. see "--risks related to our business--we have significant deferred cancellation of debt income" for a discussion of certain tax considerations that could affect our willingness to pay dividends in the future.
we are a holding company and rely on dividends, distributions and other payments, advances and transfers of funds from our subsidiaries to meet our obligations.
we are a holding company that does not conduct any business operations of our own. as a result, we are largely dependent upon cash dividends and distributions and other transfers from our subsidiaries to meet our obligations. the agreements governing the indebtedness of our subsidiaries impose restrictions on our subsidiaries' ability to pay dividends or other distributions to us. the deterioration of the earnings from, or other available assets of, our subsidiaries for any reason could also limit or impair their ability to pay dividends or other distributions to us.
item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations unless otherwise indicated or the context otherwise requires, as used in this "management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations," the terms "we," "us," "the company," "our," "cdw" and similar terms refer to cdw corporation and its subsidiaries. "management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations" should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this report. this discussion contains forward-looking statements that are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties. actual results may differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements. see "forward-looking statements" above.
overview cdw is a fortune 500 company and a leading provider of integrated information technology ("it") solutions in the u.s. and canada. we help our customer base of approximately 250,000 small, medium and large business, government, education and healthcare customers by delivering critical solutions to their increasingly complex it needs. our broad array of offerings ranges from discrete hardware and software products to integrated it solutions such as mobility, security, data center optimization, cloud computing, virtualization and collaboration. we are technology "agnostic," with a product portfolio that includes more than 100,000 products from more than 1,000 brands. we provide our products and solutions through sales force and service delivery teams consisting of nearly 4,600 coworkers, including more than 1,800 field sellers, highly-skilled technology specialists and advanced service delivery engineers.
we are a leading u.s. sales channel partner for many original equipment manufacturers ("oems") and software publishers (collectively, our "vendor partners"), whose products we sell or include in the solutions we offer. we believe we are an important extension of our vendor partners' sales and marketing capabilities, providing them with a cost-effective way to reach customers and deliver a consistent brand experience through our established end-market coverage and extensive customer access.
we have two reportable segments: corporate, which is comprised primarily of private sector business customers, and public, which is comprised of government agencies and education and healthcare institutions. our corporate segment is divided into a medium/large business customer channel, primarily serving customers with more than 100 employees, and a small business customer channel, primarily serving customers with up to 100 employees. we also have three other operating segments, cdw advanced services, canada and kelway topco limited ("kelway"), which do not meet the reportable segment quantitative thresholds and, accordingly, are combined together as "other." in november 2014, we acquired a 35% non-controlling equity interest in kelway. see note 15 to the accompanying audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report for additional details.
the cdw advanced services business consists primarily of customized engineering services delivered by technology specialists and engineers, and managed services that include infrastructure as a service ("iaas") offerings. revenues from the sale of hardware, software, custom configuration and third-party provided services are recorded within our corporate and public segments.
we may sell all or only select products that our vendor partners offer. each vendor partner agreement provides for specific terms and conditions, which may include one or more of the following: product return privileges, price protection policies, purchase discounts and vendor incentive programs, such as purchase or sales rebates and cooperative advertising reimbursements. we also resell software for major software publishers. our agreements with software publishers allow the end-user customer to acquire software or licensed products and services. in addition to helping our customers determine the best software solutions for their needs, we help them manage their software agreements, including warranties and renewals. a significant portion of our advertising and marketing expenses is reimbursed through cooperative advertising reimbursement programs with our vendor partners. these programs are at the discretion of our vendor partners and are typically tied to sales or purchasing volumes or other commitments to be met by us within a specified period of time.
trends and key factors affecting our financial performance we believe the following trends may have an important impact on our financial performance:
•   our public segment sales are impacted by government spending policies, budget priorities and revenue levels. an adverse change in any of these factors could cause our public segment customers to reduce their purchases or to terminate or not renew contracts with us, which could adversely affect our business, results of operations or cash flows. although our sales to the federal government are diversified across multiple
agencies and departments, they collectively accounted for approximately 7%, 7% and 10% of our net sales for the years ended december 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. in 2013, and through the second quarter of 2014, public segment results were impacted by the combined and residual negative effects of sequestration, the partial shutdown of the federal government in 2013 and federal government budget uncertainty. however, with the finalization of federal budget allocations in early 2014, we began to see improvement in federal sales in the second quarter of 2014. the momentum continued through the third quarter of 2014 in conjunction with the federal fiscal year-end. this recovery continued into the fourth quarter of 2014 in connection with increased customer confidence that a federal budget for 2015 would be in place.
•   an important factor affecting our ability to generate sales and achieve our targeted operating results is the impact of general economic conditions on our customers' willingness to spend on information technology. while macroeconomic uncertainty drove a cautious approach to customer spending in the early part of 2013, uncertainty began to dissipate in the back half of 2013 and continued to dissipate throughout 2014. our sales to small business customers increased in 2014 as a result of the improvement in the macroeconomic environment. we will continue to closely monitor macroeconomic conditions during 2015. uncertainties related to potential reductions in government spending, requirements associated with implementation of the affordable care act, potential changes in tax and regulatory policy, weakening consumer and business confidence or increased unemployment could result in reduced or deferred spending on information technology products and services by our customers and result in increased competitive pricing pressures.
•   we believe that our customers' transition to more complex technology solutions will continue to be an important growth area for us in the future. however, because the market for technology products and services is highly competitive, our success at capitalizing on this transition will be based on our ability to tailor specific solutions to customer needs, the quality and breadth of our product and service offerings, the knowledge and expertise of our sales force, price, product availability and speed of delivery. in 2014, market dynamics, including client device refresh and digital testing needs for k-12 students, drove customer demand for transactional products, primarily client devices, which include notebooks/mobile devices and desktops. our diverse product suite of more than 100,000 products from over 1,000 leading and emerging brands and efficient, distribution capabilities enabled us to capitalize on this demand. while sales growth for transactional products was strong during the year, growth in solutions-focused products, including netcomm and software, also contributed to the increase in net sales during 2014. we expect the demand for client devices to moderate in 2015, both from the client device refresh slowing and a wind-down in preparation for digital testing requirements.
key business metrics our management monitors a number of financial and non-financial measures and ratios on a regular basis in order to track the progress of our business and make adjustments as necessary. we believe that the most important of these measures and ratios include average daily sales, gross margin, operating margin, net income, non-gaap net income, net income per diluted share, non-gaap net income per diluted share, ebitda and adjusted ebitda, return on invested capital, cash and cash equivalents, cash flow, net working capital, cash conversion cycle (defined to be days of sales outstanding in accounts receivable plus days of supply in inventory minus days of purchases outstanding in accounts payable, based on a rolling three-month average), debt levels including available credit and leverage ratios, sales per coworker and coworker turnover. these measures and ratios are compared to standards or objectives set by management, so that actions can be taken, as necessary, in order to achieve the standards and objectives. non-gaap net income, non-gaap net income per diluted share and adjusted ebitda are non-gaap financial measures. we believe these measures provide helpful information with respect to the company's operating performance and cash flows including our ability to meet our future debt service, capital expenditures, dividend payments, and working capital requirements. adjusted ebitda also provides helpful information as it is the primary measure used in certain financial covenants contained in our senior credit facilities. see "selected financial data" included elsewhere in this report for the definitions of non-gaap net income and adjusted ebitda and reconciliations to net income.
the results of certain key business metrics are as follows:
gross profit                                                           1,921.3                 1,760.3                 1,669.6
(1)   cash conversion cycle is defined as days of sales outstanding in accounts receivable plus days of supply in inventory minus days of purchases outstanding in accounts payable, based on a rolling three-month average. the prior periods have been revised to conform to the current definition.

total net sales in 2014 increased $1,305.9 million, or 12.1%, to $12,074.5 million, compared to $10,768.6 million in 2013. there were 254 selling days for both the years ended december 31, 2014 and 2013. the increase in total net sales was primarily the result of continued growth in transactional products driven by notebooks/mobile devices and desktop computers as customers across all channels refreshed their client devices and k-12 customers continued to prepare for digital testing requirements, and the addition of more than 140 customer-facing coworkers, the majority in pre- and post-sale technical positions such as technical specialists and service delivery roles. growth in solutions-focused products, including netcomm and software, also contributed to the increase in net sales during 2014.
corporate segment net sales in 2014 increased $515.4 million, or 8.6%, compared to 2013, driven by sales growth in the medium/large customer channel. within our corporate segment, net sales to medium/large customers increased $432.7 million, or 8.6%, between years primarily due to customers refreshing their client devices and making continued investments in technology infrastructure and a continued focus on seller productivity. this increase was led by growth in notebooks/mobile devices, netcomm products, software, and desktop computers. net sales to small business customers increased $82.7 million, or 9.1%, between years, driven by growth in notebooks/mobile devices and desktop computers due to customers refreshing their client devices.
public segment net sales in 2014 increased $714.9 million, or 17.2%, between years, driven by strong performance across all channels. in 2013, and through the second quarter of 2014, public segment results were impacted by the combined and residual negative effects of sequestration, the partial shutdown of the federal government in 2013 and federal government budget uncertainty. however, with the finalization of federal budget allocations in early 2014, we began to see improvement in federal sales in the second quarter of 2014 and saw continued momentum through the third quarter of 2014 in conjunction with
the federal fiscal year-end. this recovery continued into the fourth quarter of 2014 in connection with increased customer confidence that a federal budget for 2015 would be in place. net sales to government customers increased $198.8 million, or 15.9%. the increase in net sales to the federal government was led by increases in sales of notebooks/mobile devices and desktop computers. the increase in net sales to state/local government customers was led by growth in sales of notebooks/mobile devices, netcomm products, enterprise storage, and software due to a continued focus on public safety solutions. net sales to education customers increased $375.0 million, or 25.9%, between years, led by growth in net sales to k-12 customers, reflecting increased sales of notebooks/mobile devices to support digital testing requirements. net sales to healthcare customers increased $141.1 million, or 9.6%, between periods, driven by growth in netcomm products, notebook/mobile devices, and desktop computers.
gross profit gross profit increased $161.0 million, or 9.1%, to $1,921.3 million in 2014, compared to $1,760.3 million in 2013. as a percentage of total net sales, gross profit decreased 40 basis points to 15.9% during 2014, down from 16.3% in 2013. gross profit margin was negatively impacted 30 basis points by unfavorable price/mix changes within product margin, as transactional product categories such as notebooks/mobile devices and desktops experienced a higher rate of net sales growth than our overall net sales growth, accompanied by continuing product margin compression in these product categories. additionally, we experienced an unfavorable impact of 10 basis points from vendor funding in 2014. although vendor funding dollars increased, it represented a lower percentage of net sales in 2014 compared to 2013. vendor funding includes purchase discounts, volume rebates and cooperative advertising.
the gross profit margin may fluctuate based on various factors, including vendor incentive and inventory price protection programs, cooperative advertising funds classified as a reduction of cost of sales, product mix, net service contract revenue, commission revenue, pricing strategies, market conditions and other factors, any of which could result in changes in gross profit margins.
selling and administrative expenses selling and administrative expenses decreased $10.6 million, or 0.9%, to $1,110.3 million in 2014, compared to $1,120.9 million in 2013. the overall decrease was largely driven by the absence of $74.3 million in costs incurred during 2013 related to the completion of our ipo. this decrease was partially offset by an increase of $31.4 million, or 14.3%, of certain coworker costs between years which was primarily due to higher compensation consistent with increased coworker count and attainment-based compensation accruals tied to annual performance. total coworker count was 7,211, up 244 from 6,967 at december 31, 2013. in addition, sales payroll, including sales commissions and other variable compensation costs, increased $18.6 million, or 3.9% between years, consistent with higher sales and gross profit. further offsetting the decrease in selling and administrative expenses was an increase in long-term compensation expense and equity compensation expense of $7.2 million during 2014.
as a percentage of total net sales, selling and administrative expenses decreased 120 basis points to 9.2% in 2014, down from 10.4% in 2013. the decrease in selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales was largely driven by a decline of 70 basis points in costs related to the ipo in 2013. sales payroll as a percentage of net sales also decreased 30 basis points during 2014 reflecting the lower cost to serve transactional sales compared to solutions-focused sales, consistent with our variable compensation cost structure.
advertising expense advertising expense increased $7.2 million, or 5.5%, to $138.0 million in 2014, compared to $130.8 million in 2013. as a percentage of net sales, advertising expense remained relatively consistent at 1.1% in 2014, compared to 1.2% in 2013. the dollar increase in advertising expense was due to a continued focus on advertising our solutions and products, which reinforces our reputation as a leading it solutions provider.
income from operations the following table presents income from operations by segment, in dollars and as a percentage of net sales, and the year-over-year percentage change in income from operations for the years ended december 31, 2014 and 2013:

(1)   segment income (loss) from operations includes the segment's direct operating income (loss) and allocations for headquarters' costs, allocations for income and expenses from logistics services, certain inventory adjustments and volume rebates and cooperative advertising from vendors.
income from operations was $673.0 million in 2014, an increase of $164.4 million, or 32.3%, compared to $508.6 million in 2013. the increase in income from operations was driven by higher net sales and gross profit and the absence of ipo-related costs. total operating margin percentage increased 90 basis points to 5.6% in 2014, from 4.7% in 2013. operating margin percentage benefited from the decrease in selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales, which was driven by the absence of $74.3 million in costs related to our ipo in 2013, and was partially offset by a decrease in gross profit margin.
corporate segment income from operations was $439.8 million in 2014, an increase of $76.5 million, or 21.1%, compared to $363.3 million in 2013. this increase was primarily driven by higher net sales and gross profit. corporate segment operating margin percentage increased 70 basis points to 6.8% in 2014, from 6.1% in 2013. operating margin percentage benefited from the decrease in selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales, which was driven by the absence of costs related to our ipo in 2013, and was partially offset by a decrease in gross profit margin.
public segment income from operations was $313.2 million in 2014, an increase of $66.7 million, or 27.1%, compared to $246.5 million in 2013. this increase was primarily driven by higher net sales and gross profit. public segment operating margin percentage increased 50 basis points to 6.4% in 2014, from 5.9% in 2013. operating margin percentage benefited from the decrease in selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales, which was driven by the absence of costs related to our ipo in 2013, and was partially offset by a decrease in gross profit margin.
interest expense, net at december 31, 2014, our outstanding long-term debt totaled $3,190.0 million, compared to $3,251.2 million at december 31, 2013. we reduced our long-term debt during 2014 through refinancing activities to redeem our higher interest debt. net interest expense in 2014 was $197.3 million, a decrease of $52.8 million compared to $250.1 million in 2013. this decrease was primarily due to lower debt balances and effective interest rates for 2014 compared to 2013 as a result of debt repayments and refinancing activities completed during 2014 and 2013. see "liquidity and capital resources" below for a description of the significant debt refinancings in 2014.

income tax expense income tax expense was $142.8 million in 2014, compared to $62.7 million in 2013. the effective income tax rate, expressed by calculating income tax expense or benefit as a percentage of income before income taxes, was 36.8% and 32.1% for 2014 and 2013, respectively.
for 2014, the effective tax rate differed from the u.s. federal statutory rate primarily due to state income taxes, including current year state income tax credits. for 2013, the effective tax rate differed from the u.s. federal statutory rate primarily due to state income taxes, including current year state income tax credits and an adjustment to deferred state income taxes due to changes in apportionment factors. the higher effective tax rate for 2014 as compared to 2013 was primarily attributable to the favorable impact of changes in state tax apportionment factors had on deferred state income taxes in 2013 and a lower rate impact of state income tax credits due to the increase in income before income taxes in 2014.
net income net income was $244.9 million in 2014, compared to $132.8 million in 2013. significant factors and events causing the net changes between the periods are discussed above.
non-gaap net income non-gaap net income was $409.9 million for the year ended december 31, 2014, an increase of $95.6 million, or 30.4%, compared to $314.3 million for the year ended december 31, 2013.
we have included a reconciliation of non-gaap net income for the years ended december 31, 2014 and 2013 below. non-gaap net income excludes, among other things, charges related to the amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets, non-cash equity-based compensation, and gains and losses from the early extinguishment of debt. non-gaap net income is considered a non-gaap financial measure. generally, a non-gaap financial measure is a numerical measure of a company's performance, financial position, or cash flows that either excludes or includes amounts that are not normally included or excluded in the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with gaap. non-gaap measures used by the company may differ from similar measures used by other companies, even when similar terms are used to identify such measures. we believe that non-gaap net income provides helpful information with respect to our operating performance and cash flows including our ability to meet our future debt service, capital expenditures and working capital requirements.

adjusted ebitda adjusted ebitda was $907.0 million for the year ended december 31, 2014, an increase of $98.5 million, or 12.2%, compared to $808.5 million for the year ended december 31, 2013. as a percentage of net sales, adjusted ebitda was 7.5% for both the years ended december 31, 2014 and 2013.
we have included a reconciliation of ebitda and adjusted ebitda for the years ended december 31, 2014 and 2013 in the tables below. ebitda is defined as consolidated net income before interest expense, income tax expense, depreciation and amortization. adjusted ebitda, which is a measure defined in our credit agreements, means ebitda adjusted for certain items which are described in the table below. both ebitda and adjusted ebitda are considered non-gaap financial measures. generally, a non-gaap financial measure is a numerical measure of a company's performance, financial position or cash flows that either excludes or includes amounts that are not normally included or excluded in the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with gaap. non-gaap measures used by the company may differ from similar measures used by other companies, even when similar terms are used to identify such measures. we believe that ebitda and adjusted ebitda provide helpful information with respect to our operating performance and cash flows including our ability to meet our future debt service, capital expenditures and working capital requirements. adjusted ebitda also provides helpful information as it is the primary measure used in certain financial covenants contained in our credit agreements.

total net sales in 2013 increased $640.4 million, or 6.3%, to $10,768.6 million, compared to $10,128.2 million in 2012. there were 254 selling days for both the years ended december 31, 2013 and 2012. the increase in total net sales was primarily the result of growth in hardware and software, a more tenured sales force, a continued focus on seller productivity across all areas of the organization and the addition of nearly 120 customer-facing coworkers, the majority in pre- and post-sale technical positions such as technical specialists and service delivery roles. our total net sales growth for the year ended december 31, 2013 reflected growth in notebooks/mobile devices, netcomm products and software. software gains were driven by growth in security, document management software and network management software, partially offset by a decline in application suites.
corporate segment net sales in 2013 increased $447.3 million, or 8.1%, compared to 2012, driven by sales growth in the medium/large customer channel. within our corporate segment, net sales to medium/large customers increased 10.5% between years primarily due to certain of these customers increasing their it spending, a more tenured sales force, a continued focus on seller productivity and additional customer-facing coworkers, the majority in pre- and post-sale technical positions such as technical specialists and service delivery roles. this increase was led by unit volume growth in netcomm products and growth in notebooks/mobile devices and software. partially offsetting the growth in the medium/large customer channel was a 3.5% decline in net sales to small business customers, due to certain of these customers taking a more cautious approach to spending as macroeconomic and regulatory uncertainty impacted decision-making. this decrease was led by unit volume declines in notebooks/mobile devices, partially offset by growth in netcomm products.
public segment net sales in 2013 increased $141.5 million, or 3.5%, between years, driven by strong performance in the education customer channel. net sales to education customers increased $256.7 million, or 21.5%, between years, led by growth in net sales to k-12 customers, reflecting increased sales of notebooks/mobile devices to support new standardized digital testing requirements that will take effect in 2014. net sales to government customers decreased $143.5 million, or 10.3%, in 2013 compared to 2012 due to reductions and delays in federal government spending following sequestration, uncertainty over future budget negotiations and the partial shutdown of the federal government. the government customer channel net sales decline was led by decreases in sales of enterprise storage and notebooks/mobile devices, partially offset by growth in software. net sales to healthcare customers increased $28.3 million, or 2.0%, between years, driven by growth in notebooks/mobile devices and desktop computers.
gross profit gross profit increased $90.7 million, or 5.4%, to $1,760.3 million in 2013, compared to $1,669.6 million in 2012. as a percentage of total net sales, gross profit decreased 20 basis points to 16.3% in 2013, down from 16.5% in 2012. gross profit margin was negatively impacted 30 basis points by unfavorable price/mix changes within product margin, as we experienced product margin compression in transactional product categories such as desktops and notebooks. partially offsetting this decrease was an increase of 10 basis points due to a higher mix of net service contract revenue. net service contract revenue, including items such as third-party services and warranties, has a positive impact on gross profit margin as our cost paid to the vendor or third-party service provider is recorded as a reduction to net sales, resulting in net sales being equal to the gross profit on the transaction.
the gross profit margin may fluctuate based on various factors, including vendor incentive and inventory price protection programs, cooperative advertising funds classified as a reduction of cost of sales, product mix, net service contract revenue, commission revenue, pricing strategies, market conditions and other factors, any of which could result in changes in gross profit margins.
selling and administrative expenses selling and administrative expenses increased $91.3 million, or 8.9%, to $1,120.9 million in 2013, compared to $1,029.5 million in 2012. as a percentage of total net sales, selling and administrative expenses increased 20 basis points to 10.4% in 2013, up from 10.2% in 2012. sales payroll, including sales commissions and other variable compensation costs, increased $28.9 million, or 6.4%, between years, consistent with higher sales and gross profit. additionally, selling and administrative expenses for 2013 included ipo- and secondary-offering related expenses of $75.0 million, as follows:
•   pre-tax charges of $36.7 million related to the acceleration of the expense recognition for certain equity awards and $4.0 million for the related employer payroll taxes. see note 10 of the accompanying audited consolidated financial statements for additional discussion of the impact of the ipo on our equity awards.
•   a pre-tax charge of $24.4 million related to the payment of a termination fee to affiliates of the sponsors in connection with the termination of the management services agreement with such entities.
•   a pre-tax charge of $7.5 million related to compensation expense in connection with the restricted debt unit plan. see note 12 of the accompanying audited consolidated financial statements for additional discussion of this charge.
•   other ipo- and secondary-offering related expenses of $2.4 million.
we did not record any ipo- or secondary-offering related expenses during 2012. partially offsetting these increases in 2013 was the favorable resolution of a class action legal proceeding in which we were a claimant, which reduced selling and administrative expenses by $10.4 million in 2013 compared to 2012. total coworker count increased by 163 coworkers, from 6,804 at december 31, 2012, to 6,967 at december 31, 2013.
advertising expense advertising expense increased $1.3 million, or 0.9%, to $130.8 million in 2013, compared to $129.5 million in 2012. as a percentage of net sales, advertising expense was 1.2% in 2013, compared to 1.3% in 2012. the dollar increase in advertising expense was due to a continued focus on advertising our solutions and products, which reinforces our reputation as a leading it solutions provider.
income from operations the following table presents income from operations by segment, in dollars and as a percentage of net sales, and the year-over-year percentage change in income from operations for the years ended december 31, 2013 and 2012:

(1)   segment income (loss) from operations includes the segment's direct operating income (loss) and allocations for headquarters' costs, allocations for logistics services, certain inventory adjustments, and volume rebates and cooperative advertising from vendors.
income from operations was $508.6 million in 2013, a decrease of $2.0 million, or 0.4%, compared to $510.6 million in 2012. the decrease in income from operations was driven by higher selling and administrative expenses primarily resulting from $75.0 million of ipo- and secondary-offering related expenses recorded during 2013, mostly offset by higher net sales and gross profit. total operating margin percentage decreased 30 basis points to 4.7% in 2013, from 5.0% in 2012. operating margin percentage was negatively impacted by the increase in selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales and gross profit margin compression, partially offset by a decrease in advertising expense as a percentage of net sales.
corporate segment income from operations was $363.3 million in 2013, an increase of $14.3 million, or 4.1%, compared to $349.0 million in 2012. corporate segment operating margin percentage decreased 20 basis points to 6.1% in 2013, from 6.3% in 2012. results for 2013 included $26.4 million of ipo- and secondary-offering related expenses, which reduced corporate segment operating margin by 40 basis points. higher sales and gross profit dollars offset the effect of ipo- and secondary-offering related expenses on income from operations for 2013.
public segment income from operations was $246.5 million in 2013, a decrease of $0.2 million, or 0.1%, compared to $246.7 million in 2012. public segment operating margin percentage decreased 20 basis points to 5.9% in 2013, from 6.1% in 2012. results for 2013 included $14.4 million of ipo- and secondary-offering related expenses, which reduced public segment operating margin by 30 basis points. higher sales and gross profit dollars nearly offset the effect of ipo- and secondary-offering related expenses on income from operations for 2013.
interest expense, net at december 31, 2013, our outstanding long-term debt totaled $3,251.2 million, compared to $3,771.0 million at december 31, 2012. we reduced long-term debt throughout the year primarily through the use of a portion of the net proceeds from the ipo and cash flows provided by operating activities. net interest expense in 2013 was $250.1 million, a decrease of $57.3 million compared to $307.4 million in 2012. this decrease was primarily due to lower debt balances and effective interest rates for 2013 compared to 2012 as a result of debt repayments and refinancing activities completed during 2012 and 2013.
net loss on extinguishments of long-term debt during 2013, we recorded a net loss on extinguishments of long-term debt of $64.0 million compared to $17.2 million in 2012.
in october 2013, we redeemed $155.0 million aggregate principal amount of the senior subordinated notes. in connection with this redemption, we recorded a loss on extinguishment of long-term debt of $8.5 million, representing the difference between the redemption price and the net carrying amount of the purchased debt, adjusted for a portion of the unamortized deferred financing costs.
in august 2013, we redeemed $324.0 million aggregate principal amount of the senior subordinated notes. in connection with this redemption, we recorded a loss on extinguishment of long-term debt of $24.6 million, representing the difference between the redemption price and the net carrying amount of the purchased debt, adjusted for a portion of the unamortized deferred financing costs.
in july 2013, we redeemed $175.0 million aggregate principal amount of the senior secured notes. in connection with this redemption, we recorded a loss on extinguishment of long-term debt of $16.7 million, representing the difference between the redemption price and the net carrying amount of the purchased debt, adjusted for a portion of the unamortized deferred financing costs.
in april 2013, we entered into a new seven-year, $1,350.0 million aggregate principal amount term loan. substantially all of the proceeds were used to repay the $1,299.5 million outstanding aggregate principal amount of the prior senior secured term loan facility. in connection with this refinancing, we recorded a loss on extinguishment of long-term debt of $10.3 million, representing a write-off of the remaining unamortized deferred financing costs related to the prior senior secured term loan facility.
in march 2013, we redeemed $50.0 million aggregate principal amount of the senior subordinated notes. we recorded a loss on extinguishment of long-term debt of $3.9 million, representing the difference between the redemption price and the net carrying amount of the purchased debt, adjusted for a portion of the unamortized deferred financing costs.
in december 2012, we redeemed $100.0 million aggregate principal amount of the senior subordinated notes. we recorded a loss on extinguishment of long-term debt of $7.8 million representing the difference between the redemption price and the net carrying amount of the purchased debt, adjusted for a portion of the unamortized deferred financing costs.
in february and march 2012, we purchased or redeemed the remaining $129.0 million of 11.0% senior exchange notes due 2015 and 11.5%/12.25% senior pik election exchange notes due 2015 (together, the "senior notes due 2015"), funded with the issuance of an additional $130.0 million of senior notes due 2019. as a result, we recorded a loss on extinguishment of long-term debt of $9.4 million, representing the difference between the purchase or redemption price of the senior notes due 2015 and the net carrying amount of the purchased debt, adjusted for the remaining unamortized deferred financing costs.
for 2013, the effective tax rate differed from the u.s. federal statutory rate primarily due to state income taxes, including current year state income tax credits and an adjustment to deferred state income taxes due to changes in apportionment factors. for 2012, the effective tax rate differed from the u.s. federal statutory rate primarily due to favorable adjustments to state tax credits which were partially offset by the unfavorable impact of adjustments to deferred state income taxes due to changes in state tax laws and non-deductible expenses, primarily equity-based compensation and meals and entertainment. the lower effective tax rate for 2013 as compared to 2012 was primarily driven by the favorable impact of adjustments to deferred state income taxes due to changes in state tax apportionment factors and lower non-deductible expenses.
net income net income was $132.8 million in 2013, compared to $119.0 million in 2012. significant factors and events causing the net changes between the periods are discussed above.
non-gaap net income non-gaap net income was $314.3 million for the year ended december 31, 2013, an increase of $67.2 million, or 27.2%, compared to $247.1 million for the year ended december 31, 2012.
we have included a reconciliation of non-gaap net income for the years ended december 31, 2013 and 2012 below. non-gaap net income excludes, among other things, charges related to the amortization of acquisition-related intangibles, non-cash equity-based compensation, ipo- and secondary-offering related expenses and gains and losses from the early extinguishment of debt. non-gaap net income is considered a non-gaap financial measure. generally, a non-gaap financial measure is a numerical measure of a company's performance, financial position, or cash flows that either excludes or includes amounts that are not normally included or excluded in the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with gaap. non-gaap measures used by the company may differ from similar measures used by other companies, even when similar terms are used to identify such measures. we believe that non-gaap net income provides helpful information with respect to our operating performance and cash flows including our ability to meet our future debt service, capital expenditures and working capital requirements.

adjusted ebitda adjusted ebitda was $808.5 million in 2013, an increase of $41.9 million, or 5.5%, compared to $766.6 million in 2012. as a percentage of net sales, adjusted ebitda was 7.5% and 7.6% in 2013 and 2012, respectively.
we have included a reconciliation of ebitda and adjusted ebitda for 2013 and 2012 in the table below. ebitda is defined as consolidated net income before interest expense, income tax expense, depreciation and amortization. adjusted ebitda, which is a measure defined in our credit agreements, means ebitda adjusted for certain items which are described in the table below. both ebitda and adjusted ebitda are considered non-gaap financial measures. generally, a non-gaap financial measure is a numerical measure of a company's performance, financial position or cash flows that either excludes or includes amounts that are not normally included or excluded in the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with gaap. non-gaap measures used by the company may differ from similar measures used by other companies, even when similar terms are used to identify such measures. we believe that ebitda and adjusted ebitda provide helpful information with respect to our operating performance and cash flows including our ability to meet our future debt service, capital expenditures and working capital requirements. adjusted ebitda also provides helpful information as it is the primary measure used in certain financial covenants contained in our credit agreements.

seasonality while we have not historically experienced significant seasonality throughout the year, sales in our corporate segment, which primarily serves private sector business customers, are typically higher in the fourth quarter than in other quarters due to customers spending their remaining technology budget dollars at the end of the year. additionally, sales in our public segment have historically been higher in the third quarter than in other quarters primarily due to the buying patterns of the federal government and education customers.
liquidity and capital resources
overview we finance our operations and capital expenditures through a combination of internally generated cash from operations and from borrowings under our senior secured asset-based revolving credit facility. we believe that our current sources of funds will be sufficient to fund our cash operating requirements for the next year. in addition, we believe that, in spite of the uncertainty of future macroeconomic conditions, we have adequate sources of liquidity and funding available to meet our longer-term needs. however, there are a number of factors that may negatively impact our available sources of funds. the amount of cash generated from operations will be dependent upon factors such as the successful execution of our business plan and general economic conditions.
long-term debt activities during the year ended december 31, 2014, we had significant debt refinancings. in connection with these refinancings, we recorded a loss on extinguishment of long-term debt of $90.7 million in our consolidated statement of operations for the year ended december 31, 2014. see note 7 to the accompanying audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report for additional details.
share repurchase program on november 6, 2014, we announced that our board of directors approved a $500 million share repurchase program effective immediately under which we may repurchase shares of our common stock in the open market or through privately negotiated transactions, depending on share price, market conditions and other factors. the share repurchase program does not obligate us to repurchase any dollar amount or number of shares, and repurchases may be commenced or suspended from time to time without prior notice. as of the date of this filing, no shares have been repurchased under the share repurchase program.
dividends a summary of 2014 dividend activity for our common stock is shown below:
on february 10, 2015, we announced that our board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend on our common stock of $0.0675 per share. the dividend will be paid on march 10, 2015 to all stockholders of record as of the close of business on february 25, 2015.
the payment of any future dividends will be at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend upon our results of operations, financial condition, business prospects, capital requirements, contractual restrictions, any potential indebtedness we may incur, restrictions imposed by applicable law, tax considerations and other factors that our board of directors deems relevant. in addition, our ability to pay dividends on our common stock will be limited by restrictions on our ability to pay dividends or make distributions to our stockholders and on the ability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends or make distributions to us, in each case, under the terms of our current and any future agreements governing our indebtedness.
cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities were as follows:
operating activities                                              $435.0                $366.3                $317.4
net change in accounts payable - inventory financing                75.5                   7.4                 (29.5    )
effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents        (1.8    )             (0.7    )              0.3
operating activities net cash provided by operating activities for 2014 increased $68.7 million compared to 2013. net income adjusted for the impact of non-cash items such as depreciation and amortization, equity-based compensation expense and net loss on extinguishments of long-term debt was $476.8 million during 2014, compared to $413.4 million during 2013. the increase in cash of $63.4 million reflected stronger operating results in 2014 compared to 2013. net changes in assets and liabilities reduced cash by $41.8 million in 2014 compared to a reduction of $47.1 million in 2013, resulting in a change of $5.3 million between periods. the decrease in inventory balances year over year contributed to a $111.7 million increase in cash flows which was primarily due to the timing of inventory receipts and earlier than expected inventory shipments at the end of 2014 due to accelerated customer roll-outs. partially offsetting the increase in cash flows from inventory was a decline in cash inflows from accounts payable of $102.4 million driven by the timing of inventory receipts at the end of 2014 versus 2013.
net cash provided by operating activities for 2013 increased $48.9 million compared to 2012. net income adjusted for the impact of non-cash items such as depreciation and amortization, equity-based compensation expense and net loss on extinguishments of long-term debt was $413.4 million during 2013, compared to $326.8 million during 2012, an increase of $86.6 million. the increase in cash of $86.6 million reflected stronger operating results in 2013 compared to 2012. net changes in assets and liabilities reduced cash by $47.1 million in 2013 compared to a reduction of $9.4 million in 2012, resulting in a change of $37.7 million between periods. while changes in assets and liabilities were relatively flat during 2012, during 2013, accounts receivable and accounts payable balances decreased and increased cash by $170.8 million and $146.1 million, respectively, primarily as a result of accelerated sales growth during the final month of 2013. merchandise inventory also increased during 2013 to support strong sales order volume near the end of 2013.
in order to manage our working capital and operating cash needs, we monitor our cash conversion cycle, defined as days of sales outstanding in accounts receivable plus days of supply in inventory minus days of purchases outstanding in accounts payable, based on a rolling three-month average. the following table presents the components of our cash conversion cycle:
days of sales outstanding (dso) (1)        42            44            42
days of supply in inventory (dio) (2)      13            14            14
days of purchases outstanding (dpo) (3)   (34   )       (35   )       (32   )
(1)   represents the rolling three-month average of the balance of trade accounts receivable, net at the end of the period divided by average daily net sales for the same three-month period. also incorporates components of other miscellaneous receivables.
(2)   represents the rolling three-month average of the balance of inventory at the end of the period divided by average daily cost of goods sold for the same three-month period. the prior period has been revised to conform to the current definition.
(3)   represents the rolling three-month average of the combined balance of accounts payable-trade, excluding cash overdrafts, and accounts payable-inventory financing at the end of the period divided by average daily cost of goods sold for the same three-month period.
the cash conversion cycle decreased to 21 days at december 31, 2014 compared to 23 days at december 31, 2013, primarily driven by improvement in dso. the decline in dso was primarily driven by improved collections and early payments from certain customers. additionally, the timing of inventory receipts at the end of 2014 had a favorable impact on dio and an unfavorable impact on dpo.
the cash conversion cycle decreased to 23 days at december 31, 2013 compared to 24 days at december 31, 2012. the increase in dso was primarily driven by an increase in receivables for third-party services such as software assurance and warranties. these services have an unfavorable impact on dso as the receivable is recognized on the balance sheet on a gross basis while the corresponding sales amount in the statement of operations is recorded on a net basis. the dpo increase was primarily due to an increase in payables for third-party services, which offsets the related increase in dso discussed above. these services have a favorable impact on dpo as the payable is recognized on the balance sheet without a corresponding cost of sales in the statement of operations because the cost paid to the vendor or third-party service provider is recorded as a reduction to net sales. the timing of quarter-end payments also had a favorable impact on dpo at december 31, 2013.
investing activities net cash used in investing activities increased $117.7 million in 2014 compared to 2013. we paid $86.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2014 to acquire a 35% non-controlling interest in kelway. additionally, capital expenditures increased $7.9 million to $55.0 million from $47.1 million for 2014 and 2013, respectively, primarily for improvements to our information technology systems during both years.
net cash used in investing activities increased $5.4 million in 2013 compared to 2012. capital expenditures were $47.1 million and $41.4 million for 2013 and 2012, respectively, primarily for improvements to our information technology systems during both years.
financing activities net cash used in financing activities decreased $56.3 million in 2014 compared to 2013. the decrease was primarily driven by several debt refinancing transactions during each period and our july 2013 ipo, which generated net proceeds of $424.7 million after deducting underwriting discounts, expenses and transaction costs. the net impact of our debt transactions resulted in cash outflows of $161.3 million and $569.4 million during 2014 and 2013, respectively, as cash was used in each period to reduce our total long-term debt. see note 7 to the accompanying audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report for a description of the debt transactions impacting each period.
net cash used in financing activities decreased $169.7 million in 2013 compared to 2012. the decrease was primarily driven by various debt transactions during each period and our july 2013 ipo, which generated net proceeds of $424.7 million after deducting underwriting discounts, expenses and transaction costs. the net impact of our debt transactions resulted
in cash outflows of $569.4 million and $310.6 million during 2013 and 2012, respectively, as cash was used in each period to reduce our total long-term debt.
long-term debt and financing arrangements as of december 31, 2014, we had total indebtedness of $3.2 billion, of which $1.5 billion was secured indebtedness.
at december 31, 2014, we were in compliance with the covenants under our various credit agreements and indentures. under the indenture governing the 8.5% senior notes due 2019, which contains the most restrictive restricted payment provisions in our various credit agreements and indentures, we are generally restricted from paying dividends and making other restricted payments. for the purpose of determining restricted payment capacity, consolidated net income or loss includes certain adjustments that are defined in the applicable indenture. at december 31, 2014, the amount of cumulative consolidated net income free of restrictions under our credit agreements and indentures was $230.3 million.
see note 7 to the accompanying audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report for further details regarding our debt and each of the transactions described below.
during the year ended december 31, 2014, the following events occurred with respect to our debt structure:
•   on january 22, 2014 and february 21, 2014, we redeemed $30.0 million and $20.0 million aggregate principal amounts of the 12.535% senior subordinated exchange notes due 2017, respectively.
•   on march 20, 2014, we repurchased and subsequently canceled $25.0 million aggregate principal amount of the 8.5% senior notes due 2019 from an affiliate of providence equity in a privately-negotiated transaction on an arms' length basis.
•   on may 9, 2014, we redeemed all of the remaining $42.5 million aggregate principal amount of the 12.535% senior subordinated exchange notes due 2017.
•   on august 5, 2014, we completed the issuance of $600.0 million aggregate principal amount of 6.0% senior notes due 2022 which will mature on august 15, 2022.
•   on september 5, 2014, we redeemed all of the remaining $325.0 million aggregate principal amount of the 12.535% senior subordinated exchange notes due 2017, plus accrued and unpaid interest through the date of redemption.
•   on september 5, 2014, we redeemed $234.7 million aggregate principal amount of the 8.5% senior notes due 2019, plus accrued and unpaid interest through the date of redemption.
•   on december 1, 2014, we completed the issuance of $575.0 million principal amount of 5.5% senior notes due 2024 which will mature on december 1, 2024.
•   on december 31, 2014, we redeemed $541.4 million aggregate principal amount of the 8.5% senior notes due 2019, plus accrued and unpaid interest through the date of redemption.
inventory financing agreements we have entered into agreements with certain financial intermediaries to facilitate the purchase of inventory from various suppliers under certain terms and conditions. these amounts are classified separately as accounts payable-inventory financing on the consolidated balance sheets. we do not incur any interest expense associated with these agreements as balances are paid when they are due. see note 5 to the accompanying audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report for further details.
contractual obligations we have future obligations under various contracts relating to debt and interest payments, operating leases and asset retirement obligations. the following table presents our estimated future payments under contractual obligations that existed as of december 31, 2014, based on undiscounted amounts.
operating leases (3)                     127.5                19.1                  31.4                  26.4                    50.6
(1)   includes future principal and cash interest payments on long-term borrowings through scheduled maturity dates. interest payments for variable rate debt were calculated using interest rates as of december 31, 2014. excluded from these amounts are the amortization of debt issuance and other costs related to indebtedness.
(2)   includes future principal and cash interest payments on long-term borrowings through scheduled maturity dates. interest on the senior notes is calculated using the stated interest rates. excluded from these amounts are the amortization of debt issuance and other costs related to indebtedness.
(3)   includes the minimum lease payments for non-cancelable leases of properties and equipment used in our operations. additionally, included in these amounts are future minimum lease payments commencing in the fourth quarter of 2016 that relate to a new lease entered into in december 2014 for our future headquarters in lincolnshire, illinois. also reflected in these amounts is the future expiration of two leases in the first quarter of 2016 for facilities currently in use by us which we plan to consolidate into the new headquarters location and accordingly, these leases will not be renewed.
(4)   represent commitments to return property subject to operating leases to original condition upon lease termination.
off-balance sheet arrangements we have no off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a material current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources.
inflation inflation has not had a material impact on our operating results. we generally have been able to pass along price increases to our customers, though certain economic factors and technological advances in recent years have tended to place downward pressure on pricing. we also have been able to generally offset the effects of inflation on operating costs by continuing to emphasize productivity improvements and by accelerating our overall cash conversion cycle. there can be no assurances, however, that inflation would not have a material impact on our sales or operating costs in the future.
commitments and contingencies the information set forth in note 14 to the accompanying audited consolidated financial statements included in part ii, item 8 of this form 10-k is incorporated herein by reference.
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in accordance with gaap requires management to make use of certain estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reported periods. we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. actual results could differ from those estimates.
in note 1 to the accompanying audited consolidated financial statements, we include a discussion of the significant accounting policies used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. we believe the following are the most critical accounting policies and estimates that include significant judgments used in the preparation of our financial statements. we consider an accounting policy or estimate to be critical if it requires assumptions to be made that were uncertain at the time they were made, and if changes in these assumptions could have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations.
revenue recognition we are a primary distribution channel for a large group of vendors and suppliers, including oems, software publishers and wholesale distributors. we record revenue from sales transactions when title and risk of loss are passed to our customer, there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement for sale, delivery has occurred and/or services have been rendered, the sales price is fixed or determinable, and collectability is reasonably assured. our shipping terms typically specify f.o.b. destination, at which time title and risk of loss have passed to the customer.
revenues from the sales of hardware products and software products and licenses are generally recognized on a gross basis with the selling price to the customer recorded as sales and the acquisition cost of the product recorded as cost of sales. these items can be delivered to customers in a variety of ways, including (i) as physical product shipped from our warehouse, (ii) via drop-shipment by the vendor or supplier, or (iii) via electronic delivery for software licenses. at the time of sale, we record an estimate for sales returns and allowances based on historical experience. our vendor partners warrant most of the products we sell.
we leverage drop-shipment arrangements with many of our vendors and suppliers to deliver products to our customers without having to physically hold the inventory at our warehouses, thereby increasing efficiency and reducing costs. we recognize revenue for drop-shipment arrangements on a gross basis upon delivery to the customer with contract terms that typically specify f.o.b. destination. we recognize revenue on a gross basis as the principal in the transaction because we are the primary obligor in the arrangement, we assume inventory risk if the product is returned by the customer, we set the price of the product charged to the customer, we assume credit risk for the amounts invoiced, and we work closely with our customers to determine their hardware and software specifications. these arrangements generally represent approximately 40% to 50% of total net sales, including approximately 15% to 20% related to electronic delivery for software licenses.
revenue from professional services is either recognized as provided for services billed at an hourly rate or recognized using a proportional performance model for services provided at a fixed fee. revenue from cloud computing solutions including software as a service ("saas") and infrastructure as a service ("iaas") arrangements, as well as data center services such as managed and remote managed services, server co-location, internet connectivity and data backup and storage, is recognized over the period service is provided.
we also sell certain products for which we act as an agent. products in this category include the sale of third-party services, warranties, software assurance ("sa") and third-party hosted saas and iaas arrangements. sa is a product that allows customers to upgrade, at no additional cost, to the latest technology if new applications are introduced during the period that the sa is in effect. these sales do not meet the criteria for gross sales recognition, and thus are recognized on a net basis at the time of sale. under net sales recognition, the cost paid to the vendor or third-party service provider is recorded as a reduction to sales, resulting in net sales being equal to the gross profit on the transaction.
our larger customers are offered the opportunity by certain of our vendors to purchase software licenses and sa under enterprise agreements ("eas"). under eas, customers are considered to be compliant with applicable license requirements for the ensuing year, regardless of changes to their employee base. customers are charged an annual true-up fee for changes in the number of users over the year. with most eas, our vendors will transfer the license and bill the customer directly, paying resellers such as us an agency fee or commission on these sales. we record these fees as a component of net sales as earned and there is no corresponding cost of sales amount. in certain instances, we bill the customer directly under an ea and account for the individual items sold based on the nature of the item. our vendors typically dictate how the ea will be sold to the customer.
from time to time, we sell some of our products and services as part of bundled contract arrangements containing multiple deliverables, which may include a combination of the products and services. for each deliverable that represents a separate unit of accounting, total arrangement consideration is allocated based upon the relative selling prices of each element. the allocated arrangement consideration is recognized as revenue in accordance with the principles described above. selling prices are determined by using vendor specific objective evidence ("vsoe") if it exists. otherwise, selling prices are determined using third party evidence ("tpe"). if neither vsoe or tpe is available, we use our best estimate of selling prices.
we record freight billed to our customers as net sales and the related freight costs as a cost of sales.
deferred revenue includes (1) payments received from customers in advance of providing the product or performing services, and (2) amounts deferred if other conditions of revenue recognition have not been met.
we perform an analysis of the estimated number of days of sales in-transit to customers at the end of each period based on a weighted-average analysis of commercial delivery terms that includes drop-shipment arrangements. this analysis is the basis upon which we estimate the amount of sales in-transit at the end of the period and adjust revenue and the related costs
to reflect only what has been received by the customer. changes in delivery patterns may result in a different number of business days used in making this adjustment and could have a material impact on our revenue recognition for the period.
inventory valuation inventory is valued at the lower of cost or market value. cost is determined using a weighted-average cost method. price protection is recorded when earned as a reduction to the cost of inventory. we decrease the value of inventory for estimated obsolescence equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value, based upon an aging analysis of the inventory on hand, specifically known inventory-related risks, and assumptions about future demand and market conditions. if future demand or actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management, additional inventory write-downs may be required.
vendor programs we receive incentives from certain of our vendors related to cooperative advertising allowances, volume rebates, bid programs, price protection and other programs. these incentives generally relate to written agreements with specified performance requirements with the vendors and are recorded as adjustments to cost of sales or inventory, depending on the nature of the incentive. vendors may change the terms of some or all of these programs, which could have an impact on our results of operations.
we record receivables from vendors related to these programs when the amounts are probable and reasonably estimable. some programs are based on the achievement of specific targets, and we base our estimates on information provided by our vendors and internal information to assess our progress toward achieving those targets. if actual performance does not match our estimates, we may be required to adjust our receivables. we record reserves for vendor receivables for estimated losses due to vendors' inability to pay or rejections by vendors of claims; however, if actual collections differ from our estimates, we may incur additional losses that could have a material impact on gross margin and operating income.
goodwill and other intangible assets goodwill is not amortized but is subject to periodic testing for impairment at the reporting unit level. our reporting units used to assess potential goodwill impairment are the same as our operating segments. we are required to perform an evaluation of goodwill on an annual basis or more frequently if circumstances indicate a potential impairment. the annual test for impairment is conducted as of december 1. we have the option of performing a qualitative assessment of a reporting unit's fair value from the last quantitative assessment to determine if it is more likely than not that the reporting unit's goodwill is impaired or performing a quantitative assessment by comparing a reporting unit's estimated fair value to its carrying amount. under the quantitative assessment, testing for impairment of goodwill is a two-step process. the first step compares the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount, including goodwill. if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the second step compares the implied fair value of reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill to determine the amount of impairment loss. fair value of a reporting unit is determined by using a weighted combination of an income approach and a market approach, as this combination is considered the most indicative of the reporting units' fair value in an orderly transaction between market participants. under the income approach, we determine fair value based on estimated future cash flows of a reporting unit, discounted by an estimated weighted-average cost of capital, which reflects the overall level of inherent risk of a reporting unit and the rate of return an outside investor would expect to earn. under the market approach, we utilize valuation multiples derived from publicly available information for peer group companies to provide an indication of how much a knowledgeable investor in the marketplace would be willing to pay for a company. we have weighted the income approach and the market approach at 75% and 25%, respectively.
determining the fair value of a reporting unit (and the allocation of that fair value to individual assets and liabilities within the reporting unit to determine the implied fair value of goodwill in the event a step two analysis is required) is judgmental in nature and requires the use of significant estimates and assumptions. these estimates and assumptions include primarily, but are not limited to, discount rate, terminal growth rate, selection of appropriate peer group companies and control premium applied, and forecasts of revenue growth rates, gross margins, operating margins, and working capital requirements. the allocation requires analysis to determine the fair value of assets and liabilities including, among others, customer relationships, trade names, and property and equipment. any changes in the judgments, estimates, or assumptions used could produce significantly different results. although we believe our assumptions are reasonable, actual results may vary significantly and may expose us to material impairment charges in the future.
intangible assets include customer relationships, trade names, internally developed software and other intangibles. intangible assets with determinable lives are amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets. the cost of software developed or obtained for internal use is capitalized and amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the software. these intangible assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances
indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable. determination of recoverability is based on an estimate of undiscounted future cash flows resulting from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition. if the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated future undiscounted cash flows, an impairment loss is recorded for the excess of the asset's carrying amount over its fair value.
allowance for doubtful accounts we record an allowance for doubtful accounts related to trade accounts receivable for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments. we take into consideration historical loss experience, the overall quality of the receivable portfolio and specifically identified customer risks. if actual collections of customer receivables differ from our estimates, additional allowances may be required which could have an impact on our results of operations.
income taxes deferred income taxes are provided to reflect the differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts in the consolidated financial statements using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. we perform an evaluation of the realizability of our deferred tax assets on a quarterly basis. this evaluation requires us to use estimates and make assumptions and considers all positive and negative evidence and factors, such as the scheduled reversal of temporary differences, the mix of earnings in the jurisdictions in which we operate, and prudent and feasible tax planning strategies.
we account for unrecognized tax benefits based upon our assessment of whether a tax benefit is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by tax authorities. we report a liability for unrecognized tax benefits resulting from unrecognized tax benefits taken or expected to be taken in a tax return and recognize interest and penalties, if any, related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense.

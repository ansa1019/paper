notes to consolidated financial statements summary of significant accounting policies nature of business the company franchises and operates mcdonald's restaurants in the global restaurant industry. all restaurants are operated either by the company or by franchisees, including conventional franchisees under franchised arrangements, and developmental licensees or affiliates under license agreements.
the following table presents restaurant information by ownership type:
developmental licensed                  8,229                    7,913                   7,663
total systemwide restaurants           40,275                   40,031                  39,198
the results of operations of restaurant businesses purchased and sold in transactions with franchisees were not material either individually or in the aggregate to the consolidated financial statements for periods prior to purchase and sale.
consolidation the consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the company and its subsidiaries. investments in affiliates owned 50% or less (primarily mcdonald's china and japan) are accounted for by the equity method.
on an ongoing basis, the company evaluates its business relationships such as those with franchisees, joint venture partners, developmental licensees, suppliers and advertising cooperatives to identify potential variable interest entities. generally, these businesses qualify for a scope exception under the variable interest entity consolidation guidance. the company has concluded that consolidation of any such entity is not appropriate for the periods presented.
estimates in financial statements the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the u.s. requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. actual results could differ from those estimates.
foreign currency translation generally, the functional currency of operations outside the u.s. is the respective local currency.
recent accounting pronouncements recently adopted accounting pronouncements leases in july 2021, the financial accounting standards board (the "fasb") issued accounting standards update ("asu") no. 2021-05, "leases (topic 842): lessors-certain leases with variable lease payments" ("asu 2021-05"). the pronouncement amends the current guidance on classification for a lease that includes variable lease payments that do not depend on an index or rate. under the amended guidance, a lessor must classify as an operating lease any lease that would otherwise be classified as a sales-type or direct financing lease and that would result in the recognition of a selling loss at lease commencement. asu 2021-05 is effective for fiscal years beginning after december 15, 2021, including applicable interim periods. the company adopted the new standard effective january 1, 2022. the adoption of this standard did not have a material effect on the company's consolidated financial statements.
reference rate reform in march 2020, the fasb issued asu no. 2020-04, "reference rate reform (topic 848): facilitation of the effects of reference rate reform on financial reporting" ("asu 2020-04"). the pronouncement provides temporary optional expedients and exceptions to the current guidance on contract modifications and hedge accounting to ease the financial reporting burdens related to the expected market transition from the london interbank offered rate and other interbank offered rates to alternative reference rates. the guidance was effective upon issuance and may be applied prospectively to contract modifications made and hedging relationships entered into or evaluated on or before december 31, 2022. the adoption of this standard did not have a material effect on the company's consolidated financial statements.
mcdonald's corporation 2022 annual report revenue recognition the company's revenues consist of sales by company-operated restaurants and fees from restaurants operated by franchisees, developmental licensees and affiliates. revenues from conventional franchised restaurants include rent and royalties based on a percent of sales with minimum rent payments, and initial fees. revenues from restaurants licensed to developmental licensees and affiliates include a royalty based on a percent of sales, and generally include initial fees. the company's other revenues are comprised of fees paid by franchisees to recover a portion of costs incurred by the company for various technology platforms, revenues from brand licensing arrangements to market and sell consumer packaged goods using the mcdonald's brand and third-party revenues for the dynamic yield business, for periods prior to its sale on april 1, 2022.
sales by company-operated restaurants are recognized on a cash basis at the time of the underlying sale and are presented net of sales tax and other sales-related taxes. royalty revenues are based on a percent of sales and recognized at the time the underlying sales occur. rental income includes both minimum rent payments, which are recognized straight-line over the franchise term (with the exception of rent concessions as a result of covid-19 - refer to the leasing section that follows) and variable rent payments based on a percent of sales, which are recognized at the time the underlying sales occur. initial fees are recognized as the company satisfies the performance obligation over the franchise term, which is generally 20 years.
the company provides goods or services related to various technology platforms to certain franchisees that are distinct from the franchise agreement because they do not require integration with other goods or services that the company provides. the company has determined that it is the principal in these arrangements. accordingly, the related revenue is presented on a gross basis on the consolidated statement of income. these revenues are recognized as the goods or services are transferred to the franchisee, and related expenses are recognized as incurred. brand licensing arrangement revenues are based on a percent of sales and are recognized at the time the underlying sales occur. for periods prior to april 1, 2022, dynamic yield third party revenues were generated from providing software as a service solutions to customers and were recognized over the applicable subscription period as the service was performed.
property and equipment property and equipment are stated at cost, with depreciation and amortization provided using the straight-line method over the following estimated useful lives: buildings-up to 40 years; leasehold improvements-the lesser of useful lives of assets or lease terms, which generally include certain option periods; and equipment-3 to 12 years.
the company periodically reviews these lives relative to physical factors, economic factors and industry trends. if there are changes in the planned use of property and equipment, or if technological changes occur more rapidly than anticipated, the useful lives assigned to these assets may need to be shortened, resulting in the accelerated recognition of depreciation and amortization expense or write-offs in future periods.
the company may share in the cost of certain restaurant improvements with its franchisees, primarily in the u.s. since mcdonald's manages the project and provides up front funding in these instances, during the project the company estimates which costs are the responsibility of mcdonald's and which are the responsibility of the franchisee, and allocates the corresponding costs between property and equipment and accounts receivable. upon the completion of the project, the allocation of costs is finalized and may result in immaterial adjustments to the balances and associated depreciation expense.
refer to the property and equipment footnote on page 49 of this form 10-k for additional information.
leasing the company is the lessee in a significant real estate portfolio, primarily through ground leases (the company leases the land and generally owns the building) and through improved leases (the company leases the land and buildings). the lease right-of-use asset and lease liability reflect the present value of the company's estimated future minimum lease payments over the lease term, which includes options that are reasonably assured of being exercised, discounted using the rate implicit in each lease, if determinable, or a collateralized incremental borrowing rate considering the term of the lease and particular currency environment. leases with an initial term of 12 months or less, primarily related to leases of office equipment, are not included in the lease right-or-use asset or lease liability and continue to be recognized in the consolidated statement of income on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
the company has elected not to separate non-lease components from lease components in its lessee portfolio. to the extent that occupancy costs, such as site maintenance, are included in the asset and liability, the impact is immaterial and is generally limited to company-owned restaurant locations. for franchised locations, which represent the majority of the restaurant portfolio, the related occupancy costs including property taxes, insurance and site maintenance are generally required to be paid by the franchisees as part of the franchise arrangement. in addition, the company is the lessee under non-restaurant related leases such as office buildings, vehicles and office equipment. these leases are not a material subset of the company's lease portfolio.
in 2020, the company elected the practical expedient to account for covid-19 related rent concessions as if they were part of the enforceable rights and obligations of the parties under the existing lease contract. this was elected for the company's entire lessee and lessor portfolio for any rent deferrals or rent abatements. for the lessee portfolio, the company elected not to remeasure the lease right- of-use asset and lease liability if a rent deferral or a rent abatement was granted. refer to the leasing arrangements footnote on page 50 of this form 10-k for additional information on the lease right-of-use asset and lease liability.
rental income includes both minimum rent payments and variable rent payments based on a percent of sales.
refer to the franchise arrangements footnote on page 49 of this form 10-k for additional information on deferred collections of rental income as well as royalties.
mcdonald's corporation 2022 annual report capitalized software capitalized software is stated at cost and amortized using the straight-line method over the estimated useful life of the software, which primarily ranges from 2 to 10 years. customer facing software is typically amortized over a shorter useful life, while back office and corporate systems may have a longer useful life. capitalized software less accumulated amortization is recorded within miscellaneous other assets on the consolidated balance sheet and was (in millions): 2022-$864.3; 2021-$795.0; 2020-$691.2.
the company reviews capitalized software for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable or if an indicator of impairment exists, which occurs more regularly throughout the year, such as when new software may be ready for its intended use. the company did not identify any indicators of material impairment of capitalized software for the years ended december 31, 2022 and 2021. results for 2020 reflected write-offs of impaired software of $26.3 million.
long-lived assets long-lived assets are reviewed for impairment annually in the fourth quarter and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. for purposes of annually reviewing mcdonald's restaurant assets for potential impairment, assets are initially grouped together in the u.s. at a field office level, and internationally, at a market level. the company manages its restaurants as a group or portfolio with significant common costs and promotional activities; as such, an individual restaurant's cash flows are not generally independent of the cash flows of others in a market. if an indicator of impairment exists for any grouping of assets, an estimate of undiscounted future cash flows produced by each individual restaurant within the asset grouping is compared to its carrying value. if an individual restaurant is determined to be impaired, the loss is measured by the excess of the carrying amount of the restaurant over its fair value as determined by an estimate of discounted future cash flows.
losses on assets held for disposal are recognized when management and the company's board of directors, as required, have approved and committed to a plan to dispose of the assets, the assets are available for disposal and the disposal is probable of occurring within 12 months, and the net sales proceeds are expected to be less than its net book value, among other factors. generally, such losses are related to restaurants that have closed and ceased operations as well as other assets that meet the criteria to be considered "held for sale."
goodwill goodwill represents the excess of cost over the net tangible assets and identifiable intangible assets of acquired restaurants and other businesses, and it is generally assigned to the reporting unit (defined as each individual market) expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination. the company's goodwill primarily results from purchases of mcdonald's restaurants from franchisees or transactions in which the company obtains a controlling interest in subsidiaries or affiliates. when purchasing restaurants from a franchisee, the company generally uses a discounted cash flow methodology (level 3 inputs within the valuation hierarchy), which determines the fair value of restaurants acquired based on their expected profitability and cash flows. during 2022, the company acquired restaurants from franchisees in order to expand its company-operated restaurant footprint in key growth areas and to support key strategic franchising initiatives. in conjunction with these purchases, the company recorded approximately $75 million of net tangible assets, $525 million of identifiable intangible assets (primarily consisting of reacquired franchise rights) and $190 million of goodwill. these acquisitions did not have a material impact on the amount of recorded revenues or net income of the company. if a company-operated restaurant is sold within 24 months of acquisition, the goodwill associated with the acquisition is written off in its entirety. if a company-operated restaurant is sold beyond 24 months months from the acquisition, the amount of goodwill written off is based on the relative fair value of the business sold compared to the reporting unit.
in millions                                       u.s.   international                     international developmental licensed markets &amp; corporate                  consolidated operated markets balance at december 31, 2021              $1,673.4                         $1,109.1                                               $-                                                       $2,782.5
the company conducts goodwill impairment testing in the fourth quarter of each year or whenever indicators of impairment exist. if an indicator of impairment exists, the goodwill impairment test compares the fair value of a reporting unit, generally based on discounted future cash flows, with its carrying amount including goodwill. if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss is recorded for the difference. in the current period, the company performed a qualitative assessment and did not identify any indicators of impairment. historically, goodwill impairment has not significantly impacted the consolidated financial statements. goodwill on the consolidated balance sheet reflects accumulated impairment losses of $14.5 million as of december 31, 2022 and 2021.
advertising costs advertising costs included in operating expenses of company-operated restaurants primarily consist of contributions to advertising cooperatives based upon a percent of sales, and were (in millions): 2022-$334.5; 2021-$377.6; 2020-$325.5. the decrease in 2022 is primarily due to lower sales in the international operated markets as a result of the sale of the company's business in russia and the temporary restaurant closures in ukraine.
in addition, significant advertising costs are incurred by conventional franchisees through contributions to advertising cooperatives in individual markets that are also based upon a percent of sales. in the markets that make up the vast majority of the systemwide advertising spend, including the u.s., mcdonald's is not the primary beneficiary of these entities, and therefore has concluded that consolidation would not be appropriate, as the company does not have the power through voting or similar rights to direct the activities of the cooperatives that most significantly impact their economic performance.
mcdonald's corporation 2022 annual report production costs for radio and television advertising are expensed when the commercials are initially aired. these production costs, primarily in the u.s., as well as other marketing-related expenses are included in selling, general & administrative expenses and were (in millions): 2022-$63.8; 2021-$82.9; 2020-$329.2. results for 2020 included about $175 million of incremental marketing contributions by the company to the system's advertising cooperative arrangements across the u.s. and international operated markets, as well as higher investments in brand communications.
income taxes income tax uncertainties the company, like other multi-national companies, is regularly audited by federal, state and foreign tax authorities, and tax assessments may arise several years after tax returns have been filed. accordingly, tax liabilities are recorded when, in management's judgment, a tax position does not meet the more likely than not threshold for recognition. for tax positions that meet the more likely than not threshold, a tax liability may still be recorded depending on management's assessment of how the tax position will ultimately be settled. the company records interest and penalties on unrecognized tax benefits in the provision for income taxes.
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting basis and the tax basis of existing assets and liabilities. the company records a valuation allowance to reduce its deferred tax assets if it is considered more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. while the company has considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax strategies, including the sale of appreciated assets, in assessing the need for the valuation allowance, if these estimates and assumptions change in the future, the company may be required to adjust its valuation allowance. this could result in a charge to, or an increase in, income in the period such determination is made.
refer to the income taxes footnote on page 52 of this form 10-k for additional information.
the accounting policy of the company is to record any tax on gilti in the provision for income taxes in the year it is incurred.
fair value measurements the company measures certain financial assets and liabilities at fair value on a recurring basis, and certain non-financial assets and liabilities on a nonrecurring basis. fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in the principal or most advantageous market in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. fair value disclosures are reflected in a three-level hierarchy, maximizing the use of observable inputs and minimizing the use of unobservable inputs.
the valuation hierarchy is based upon the transparency of inputs to the valuation of an asset or liability on the measurement date. the three levels are defined as follows:
▪level 1 - inputs to the valuation methodology are quoted prices (unadjusted) for an identical asset or liability in an active market.
▪level 2 - inputs to the valuation methodology include quoted prices for a similar asset or liability in an active market or model-derived valuations in which all significant inputs are observable for substantially the full term of the asset or liability.
▪level 3 - inputs to the valuation methodology are unobservable and significant to the fair value measurement of the asset or liability.
certain of the company's derivatives are valued using various pricing models or discounted cash flow analyses that incorporate observable market parameters, such as interest rate yield curves, option volatilities and foreign currency rates, classified as level 2 within the valuation hierarchy. derivative valuations incorporate credit risk adjustments that are necessary to reflect the probability of default by the counterparty or the company.
▪certain financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value the following tables present financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis by the valuation hierarchy as defined in the fair value guidance:
(1)    level 1 is comprised of derivatives that hedge market driven changes in liabilities associated with the company's supplemental benefit plans.
▪non-financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis certain assets and liabilities are measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis; that is, the assets and liabilities are not measured at fair value on an ongoing basis, but are subject to fair value adjustments in certain circumstances (e.g., when there is evidence of impairment). for the years ended december 31, 2022 and 2021, the company did not record any material fair value adjustments to long-lived assets (including goodwill).
▪certain financial assets and liabilities not measured at fair value at december 31, 2022, the fair value of the company's debt obligations was estimated at $33.5 billion, compared to a carrying amount of $35.9 billion. the fair value was based on quoted market prices, level 2 within the valuation hierarchy. the carrying amount of cash and equivalents and notes receivable approximate fair value.
financial instruments and hedging activities the company is exposed to global market risks, including the effect of changes in interest rates and foreign currency fluctuations. the company uses foreign currency denominated debt and derivative instruments to mitigate the impact of these changes. the company does not hold or issue derivatives for trading purposes.
the company documents its risk management objective and strategy for undertaking hedging transactions, as well as all relationships between hedging instruments and hedged items. the company's derivatives that are designated for hedge accounting consist mainly of interest rate swaps, foreign currency forwards, and cross-currency interest rate swaps, and are classified as either fair value, cash flow or net investment hedges. further details are explained in the "fair value," "cash flow" and "net investment" hedge sections.
the company enters into certain derivatives that are not designated for hedge accounting. the company has entered into equity derivative contracts, including total return swaps, to hedge market-driven changes in certain of its supplemental benefit plan liabilities. in addition, the company uses foreign currency forwards to mitigate the change in fair value of certain foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities. further details are explained in the "undesignated derivatives" section.
all derivatives (including those not designated for hedge accounting) are recognized on the consolidated balance sheet at fair value and classified based on the instruments' maturity dates. changes in the fair value measurements of the derivative instruments are reflected as adjustments to aoci and/or current earnings.
the following table presents the fair values of derivative instruments included on the consolidated balance sheet as of december 31, 2022 and 2021:

fair value hedges the company enters into fair value hedges to reduce the exposure to changes in fair values of certain liabilities. the company enters into fair value hedges that convert a portion of its fixed rate debt into floating rate debt by use of interest rate swaps. at december 31, 2022, the carrying amount of fixed-rate debt that was effectively converted was an equivalent notional amount of $1.2 billion, which included a decrease of $91.5 million of cumulative hedging adjustments. for the year ended december 31, 2022, the company recognized a $96.3 million loss on the fair value of interest rate swaps, and a corresponding gain on the fair value of the related hedged debt instrument to interest expense.
cash flow hedges the company enters into cash flow hedges to reduce the exposure to variability in certain expected future cash flows. to protect against the reduction in value of forecasted foreign currency cash flows (such as royalties denominated in foreign currencies), the company uses foreign currency forwards to hedge a portion of anticipated exposures. the hedges cover up to the next 18 months for certain exposures and are denominated in various currencies. as of december 31, 2022, the company had derivatives outstanding with an equivalent notional amount of $1.5 billion that hedged a portion of forecasted foreign currency denominated cash flows.
based on market conditions at december 31, 2022, the $30.7 million in cumulative cash flow hedging gains, after tax, is not expected to have a significant effect on earnings over the next 12 months.
net investment hedges the company uses foreign currency denominated debt (third party and intercompany) as well as foreign currency derivatives to hedge its investments in certain foreign subsidiaries and affiliates. realized and unrealized translation adjustments from these hedges are included in shareholders' equity in the foreign currency translation component of other comprehensive income ("oci") and offset translation adjustments on the underlying net assets of foreign subsidiaries and affiliates, which also are recorded in oci. as of december 31, 2022, $12.2 billion of the company's third party foreign currency denominated debt, $679 million of intercompany foreign currency denominated debt, and $585 million of foreign currency derivatives were designated to hedge investments in certain foreign subsidiaries and affiliates.
undesignated derivatives the company enters into certain derivatives that are not designated for hedge accounting. therefore, the changes in the fair value of these derivatives are recognized immediately in earnings together with the gain or loss from the hedged balance sheet position. as an example, the company enters into equity derivative contracts, including total return swaps, to hedge market-driven changes in certain of its supplemental benefit plan liabilities. changes in the fair value of these derivatives are recorded in selling, general & administrative expenses together with the changes in the supplemental benefit plan liabilities. in addition, the company uses foreign currency forwards to mitigate the change in fair value of certain foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities. the changes in the fair value of these derivatives are recognized in nonoperating (income) expense, net, along with the currency gain or loss from the hedged balance sheet position.
credit risk the company is exposed to credit-related losses in the event of non-performance by its derivative counterparties. the company did not have significant exposure to any individual counterparty at december 31, 2022 and has master agreements that contain netting arrangements. for financial reporting purposes, the company presents gross derivative balances in the financial statements and supplementary data, including for counterparties subject to netting arrangements. some of these agreements also require each party to post collateral if credit ratings fall below, or aggregate exposures exceed, certain contractual limits. at december 31, 2022, the company was required to post $78 million of collateral due to the negative fair value of certain derivative positions. the company's counterparties were not required to post collateral on any derivative position, other than on certain hedges of the company's supplemental benefit plan liabilities where the counterparties were required to post collateral on their liability positions.
mcdonald's corporation 2022 annual report share-based compensation the company has a share-based compensation plan, which authorizes the granting of various equity-based incentives including stock options and restricted stock units ("rsus") to employees and nonemployee directors.
share-based compensation, which includes the portion vesting of all share-based awards granted based on the grant date fair value, is generally amortized on a straight-line basis over the vesting period in selling, general & administrative expenses.
the fair value of each stock option granted is estimated on the date of grant using a closed-form pricing model. the pricing model requires assumptions, which impact the assumed fair value, including the expected life of the stock option, the risk-free interest rate, expected volatility of the company's stock over the expected life and the expected dividend yield. the company uses historical data to determine these assumptions and if these assumptions change significantly for future grants, share-based compensation expense will fluctuate in future years. in addition, the company estimates forfeitures when determining the amount of compensation costs to be recognized each period.
the fair value of each rsu granted is equal to the market price of the company's stock at date of grant. for performance-based rsus, the company includes a relative total shareholder return ("tsr") modifier to determine the number of shares earned at the end of the performance period. the fair value of performance-based rsus that include the tsr modifier is determined using a monte carlo valuation model.
refer to the share-based compensation footnote on page 56 of this form 10-k for additional information.
per common share information diluted earnings per common share is calculated using net income divided by diluted weighted-average shares. diluted weighted-average shares include weighted-average shares outstanding plus the dilutive effect of share-based compensation calculated using the treasury stock method, of (in millions of shares): 2022-4.8; 2021-5.5; 2020-5.5. share-based compensation awards that were not included in diluted weighted-average shares because they would have been antidilutive were (in millions of shares): 2022-1.5; 2021-2.2; 2020-1.8.
cash and equivalents the company considers short-term, highly liquid investments with an original maturity of 90 days or less to be cash equivalents. as of december 31, 2022, cash and equivalents was $2.6 billion of which $1.8 billion consisted of certificates of deposit.

total long-lived assets, primarily property and equipment and the company's lease right-of-use asset, were (in millions)-consolidated: 2022-$37,403.0; 2021-$39,267.0; u.s. based: 2022-$19,416.3; 2021-$19,600.1.
property and equipment net property and equipment consisted of:
depreciation and amortization expense for property and equipment was (in millions): 2022-$1,454.0; 2021-$1,530.7; 2020-$1,469.4. the decrease in both buildings and improvements on leased land and equipment, signs and seating from 2021 to 2022 was primarily driven by the company's sale of the business in russia.
franchise arrangements conventional franchise arrangements generally include a lease and a license and provide for payment of initial fees, as well as continuing rent and royalties to the company based upon a percent of sales with minimum rent payments. minimum rent payments are based on the company's underlying investment in owned sites and parallel the company's underlying leases and escalations on properties that are leased. under the franchise arrangement, franchisees are granted the right to operate a restaurant using the mcdonald's system and, in most cases, the use of a restaurant facility, generally for a period of 20 years. at the end of the 20-year franchise arrangement, the company maintains control of the underlying real estate and building and can either enter into a new 20-year franchise arrangement with the existing franchisee or a different franchisee, or close the restaurant. franchisees generally pay related occupancy costs including property taxes, insurance and site maintenance.
developmental licensees and affiliates operating under license agreements pay a royalty to the company based upon a percent of sales, and generally pay initial fees.
mcdonald's has elected to allocate consideration in the franchise contract among lease and non-lease components in the same manner that it has historically: rental income (lease), royalty income (non-lease) and initial fee income (non-lease). this disaggregation and presentation of revenue is based on the nature, amount, timing and certainty of the revenue and cash flows. the allocation has been determined based on a mix of both observable and estimated standalone selling prices (the price at which an entity would sell a promised good or service separately to a customer).
revenues from franchised restaurants consisted of:
as rent and royalties are based upon a percent of sales, government restrictions as a result of covid-19 had a more significant negative impact on revenues in 2020. the company granted the deferrals of cash collection for certain rent and royalties earned from franchisees in substantially all markets primarily in the first half of 2020. in total, the company deferred collection of approximately $1 billion and has collected all of these deferrals as of december 31, 2022.
future gross minimum rent payments due to the company under existing conventional franchise arrangements are:
at december 31, 2022, net property and equipment under franchise arrangements totaled $20.2 billion (including land of $5.9 billion) after deducting accumulated depreciation and amortization of $14.3 billion.
mcdonald's corporation 2022 annual report leasing arrangements the company is the lessee in a significant real estate portfolio, primarily through ground leases (the company leases the land and generally owns the building) and through improved leases (the company leases the land and buildings). the company determines whether an arrangement is a lease at inception. lease terms for most restaurants, where market conditions allow, are generally for 20 years and, in many cases, provide for rent escalations and renewal options. renewal options are typically solely at the company's discretion. escalation terms vary by market with examples including fixed-rent escalations, escalations based on an inflation index and fair-value market adjustments. the timing of these escalations generally range from annually to every five years.
the following table provides detail of rent expense:
rent expense included percent rents in excess of minimum rents (in millions) as follows-company-operated restaurants: 2022-$39.6; 2021-$69.2; 2020-$53.7. franchised restaurants: 2022-$209.0; 2021-$160.0; 2020-$136.5. these variable rent payments are based on a percent of sales.
the lease right-of-use asset and lease liability reflect the present value of the company's estimated future minimum lease payments over the lease term, which includes options that are reasonably assured of being exercised, discounted using a collateralized incremental borrowing rate. typically, renewal options are considered reasonably assured of being exercised if the associated asset lives of the building or leasehold improvements exceed that of the initial lease term, and the sales performance of the restaurant remains strong. therefore, the lease right-of-use asset and lease liability include an assumption on renewal options that have not yet been exercised by the company, and are not currently a future obligation.
the company's lease portfolio includes both operating and finance leases, however as of december 31, 2022, the vast majority of the portfolio was classified as operating leases.
as the rate implicit in each lease is not readily determinable, the company uses an incremental borrowing rate to calculate the lease liability that represents an estimate of the interest rate the company would incur to borrow on a collateralized basis over the term of a lease within a particular currency environment. the weighted average discount rate used for leases was 3.5% as of december 31, 2022 and 3.7% as of december 31, 2021.
as of december 31, 2022, maturities of lease liabilities for the company's lease portfolio were as follows:
present value of lease liability         $12,795.5
*    total lease payments include option periods that are reasonably assured of being exercised.
the decrease in the present value of the lease liability since december 31, 2021 is approximately $(0.9) billion. the lease liability will continue to be impacted by new leases, lease modifications, lease terminations, reevaluation of lease terms, and foreign currency.
the weighted average lease term remaining that is included in the maturities of lease liabilities was 19 years as of december 31, 2022 and 20 years as of december 31, 2021.

the 2022 effective income tax rate reflected the tax impact of $537 million of non-operating expense related to the settlement of the tax audit in france. in 2021, u.s./foreign tax law changes included a $364 million income tax benefit related to the remeasurement of deferred taxes as a result of a change in the u.k. statutory income tax rate.
as of december 31, 2022 and 2021, the company's gross unrecognized tax benefits totaled $647.0 million and $1,504.9 million, respectively. after considering the deferred tax accounting impact, it is expected that about $410 million of the total as of december 31, 2022 would favorably affect the effective tax rate if resolved in the company's favor.
the following table presents a reconciliation of the beginning and ending amounts of unrecognized tax benefits:
lapsing of statutes of limitations                                (0.5)                     (12.4)
(1)of this amount, $619.6 million and $1,157.5 million are included in long-term income taxes for 2022 and 2021, respectively, and $27.3 million and $332.0 million are included in prepaid expenses and other current assets for 2022 and 2021, respectively, on the consolidated balance sheet. the remainder is included in deferred income taxes on the consolidated balance sheet.
in 2015, the u.s. internal revenue service (the "irs") issued a revenue agent report ("rar") that included certain disagreed transfer pricing adjustments related to the company's u.s. federal income tax returns for 2009 and 2010. also in 2015, the company filed a protest with the irs related to these disagreed transfer pricing matters. during 2017, the company received a response to its protest, and beginning in december 2018 the company met with the irs appeals team regarding settlement of these issues. in february 2023, the company finalized a settlement agreement with the irs appeals team related to the disagreed transfer pricing matters for the years 2009-2010.
in 2017, the irs completed its examination of the company's u.s. federal income tax returns for 2011 and 2012. in 2018, the irs issued a rar for these years. as expected, the rar included the same disagreed transfer pricing matters as the 2009 and 2010 rar. also in 2018, the company filed a protest with the irs related to these disagreed transfer pricing matters. the company continues to meet with the irs appeals team regarding the settlement of these issues.
the company is also under audit in multiple foreign tax jurisdictions for matters primarily related to transfer pricing, and the company is under audit in multiple state tax jurisdictions. while the company cannot estimate the impact to the effective tax rate, it is reasonably possible that the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits could decrease up to $70 million within the next 12 months. this would be due to the possible settlement of the irs transfer pricing matters, completion of the aforementioned foreign and state tax audits and the expiration of the statute of limitations in multiple tax jurisdictions. in 2022, the company settled an income tax audit with france, which resulted in $537 million of nondeductible non-operating expense and conclusion of income tax matters related to transfer pricing for the years 2009-2020.
during 2022, the company finalized and settled certain tax examinations and remeasured other income tax reserves based on audit progression. it is reasonably possible that, as a result of audit progression in both the u.s. and foreign tax audits within the next 12 months, there may be new information that causes the company to reassess the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits recorded. while the company cannot estimate the impact that new information may have on the unrecognized tax benefit balance, it believes that the liabilities recorded are appropriate and adequate.
the company had $24.7 million and $183.6 million accrued for interest and penalties related to tax matters at december 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. the company recognized interest and penalties related to tax matters of $90.5 million in 2022, $24.4 million in 2021, and $32.4 million in 2020, which are included in the provision for income taxes.
mcdonald's corporation 2022 annual report as of december 31, 2022, the company has accumulated undistributed earnings generated by its foreign subsidiaries, which were predominantly taxed in the u.s. as a result of the transition tax provisions enacted under the tax cuts and jobs act of 2017. management does not assert that these previously-taxed unremitted earnings are indefinitely reinvested in operations outside the u.s. accordingly, the company has provided deferred taxes for the tax effects incremental to the transition tax. the company has not provided for deferred taxes on outside basis differences in its investments in its foreign subsidiaries that are unrelated to these accumulated undistributed earnings, as these outside basis differences are indefinitely reinvested. a determination of the unrecognized deferred taxes related to these other components of the outside basis differences is not practicable.
employee benefit plans the company's 401(k) plan is maintained for u.s.-based employees and includes a 401(k) feature, as well as an employer match. the 401(k) feature allows eligible participants to make pre-tax contributions that are matched each pay period (with an annual true-up) through cash contributions.
all current account balances, future contributions and related earnings can be invested in nine investment alternatives (including a target date fund series), as well as mcdonald's stock in accordance with each participant's investment elections. future participant contributions are limited to 20% investment in mcdonald's stock and participants may not transfer their existing account balance into mcdonald's stock if the transfer would cause the value of their interest in the fund to exceed 20% of their total 401(k) plan account balance. participants may choose to make separate investment choices for current account balances and future contributions.
the company also maintains certain unfunded nonqualified supplemental benefit plans that allow participants to (i) make tax-deferred contributions and (ii) receive an annual company-match allocation that cannot be made under the 401(k) plan because of irs limitations. the investment alternatives and returns are based on certain market-rate investment alternatives under the 401(k) plan, net of expenses. total liabilities were $380.0 million and $456.8 million at december 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, and were primarily included in other long-term liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet.
the company has entered into derivative contracts to hedge market-driven changes in certain of the liabilities. at december 31, 2022, derivatives with a fair value of $200.5 million indexed to the company's stock and a total return swap with a notional amount of $164.4 million indexed to certain market indices were included at their fair value in prepaid expenses and other current assets on the consolidated balance sheet. changes in liabilities for these nonqualified plans and in the fair value of the derivatives are recorded primarily in selling, general & administrative expenses. changes in fair value of the derivatives indexed to the company's stock are recorded in the income statement because the contracts provide the counterparty with a choice to settle in cash or shares.
total u.s. costs for the 401(k) plan and nonqualified benefits and related hedging activities, were (in millions): 2022-$54.2; 2021-$39.5; 2020-$37.0. certain subsidiaries outside the u.s. also offer profit sharing, stock purchase or other similar benefit plans. total plan costs outside the u.s. were (in millions): 2022-$44.4; 2021-$41.8; 2020-$36.6.
the total combined liabilities for international retirement plans were $36.6 million and $41.7 million at december 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. other post-retirement benefits and post-employment benefits were immaterial to the consolidated income statement.
debt financing line of credit agreements at december 31, 2022, the company had a line of credit agreement of $3.5 billion, which expires in december 2024. the company incurs fees of 0.08% per annum on the total commitment, which remained unused. fees and interest rates on this line are primarily based on the company's long-term credit rating assigned by moody's and standard & poor's. in addition, the company's subsidiaries had unused lines of credit that were primarily uncommitted, short-term and denominated in various currencies at local market rates of interest.
the weighted-average interest rate of short-term borrowings was 5.2% at december 31, 2022 (based on $264.5 million of foreign currency bank line borrowings) and 2.4% at december 31, 2021 (based on $263.1 million of foreign currency bank line borrowings).
debt obligations the company has incurred debt obligations principally through public and private offerings and bank loans. there are no provisions in the company's debt obligations that would accelerate repayment of debt as a result of a change in credit ratings or a material adverse change in the company's business. certain of the company's debt obligations contain cross-acceleration provisions, and restrictions on company and subsidiary mortgages and the long-term debt of certain subsidiaries. under certain agreements, the company has the option to retire debt prior to maturity, either at par or at a premium over par. the company has no current plans to retire a significant amount of its debt prior to maturity, but continues to look for ways to optimize its debt portfolio.
the following table summarizes the company's debt obligations (interest rates and debt amounts reflected in the table include the effects of interest rate swaps used to hedge debt).

(4)the carrying value of underlying items in fair value hedges, in this case debt obligations, are adjusted for fair value changes to the extent they are attributable to the risk designated as being hedged. the related hedging instruments are also recorded at fair value on the consolidated balance sheet.
share-based compensation the company maintains a share-based compensation plan, which authorizes the granting of various equity-based incentives including stock options and rsus to employees and nonemployee directors. the number of shares of common stock reserved for issuance under the plan was 34.4 million at december 31, 2022, including 21.8 million available for future grants.
as of december 31, 2022, there was $161.1 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to nonvested share-based compensation that is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 2.0 years.
stock options stock options to purchase common stock are granted with an exercise price equal to the closing market price of the company's stock on the date of grant. substantially all of the options become exercisable in four equal installments, beginning a year from the date of the grant, and generally expire 10 years from the grant date.
the following table presents the weighted-average assumptions used in the option pricing model for the 2022, 2021 and 2020 stock option grants. the expected life of the options represents the period of time the options are expected to be outstanding and is based on historical trends. expected stock price volatility is generally based on the historical volatility of the company's stock for a period approximating the expected life. the expected dividend yield is based on the company's most recent annual dividend rate. the risk-free interest rate is based on the u.s. treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant with a term equal to the expected life.

ii.provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and iii.provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
there are inherent limitations in the effectiveness of any internal control, including the possibility of human error and the circumvention or overriding of controls. accordingly, even effective internal controls can provide only reasonable assurances with respect to financial statement preparation. further, because of changes in conditions, the effectiveness of internal controls may vary over time.
management assessed the design and effectiveness of the company's internal control over financial reporting as of december 31, 2022. in making this assessment, management used the criteria set forth by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission ("coso") in internal control - integrated framework (2013 framework).
based on management's assessment using those criteria, as of december 31, 2022, management believes that the company's internal control over financial reporting is effective.
ernst & young, llp, independent registered public accounting firm, has audited the financial statements of the company for the fiscal years ended december 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020 and the company's internal control over financial reporting as of december 31, 2022. their reports are presented on the following pages. the independent registered public accountants and internal auditors advise management of the results of their audits, and make recommendations to improve the system of internal controls. management evaluates the audit recommendations and takes appropriate action.
mcdonald's corporation 2022 annual report report of independent registered public accounting firm the board of directors and shareholders of mcdonald's corporation opinion on the financial statements we have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of mcdonald's corporation (the company) as of december 31, 2022 and 2021, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, shareholders' equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended december 31, 2022, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the "consolidated financial statements"). in our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the company at december 31, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended december 31, 2022, in conformity with u.s. generally accepted accounting principles.
we also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board (united states) (pcaob), the company's internal control over financial reporting as of december 31, 2022, based on criteria established in internal control-integrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission (2013 framework) and our report dated february 24, 2023 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.
basis for opinion these financial statements are the responsibility of the company's management. our responsibility is to express an opinion on the company's financial statements based on our audits. we are a public accounting firm registered with the pcaob and are required to be independent with respect to the company in accordance with the u.s. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the securities and exchange commission and the pcaob.
we conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the pcaob. those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. we believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
critical audit matter the critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective or complex judgments. the communication of the critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosure to which it relates.
valuation of unrecognized tax benefits and related regulatory actions description of the matter                       as described in the income taxes footnote to the consolidated financial statements, the company's unrecognized tax benefits, which includes transfer pricing matters, totaled $647.0 million at december 31, 2022. the company, like other multi-national companies, is regularly audited by federal, state and foreign tax authorities, and tax assessments may arise several years after tax returns have been filed. accordingly, tax liabilities are recorded when, in management's judgment, a tax position does not meet the more likely than not threshold for recognition. for tax positions that meet the more likely than not threshold, a tax liability may still be recorded depending on management's assessment of how the tax position will ultimately be settled. the company may also be subject to regulatory actions related to these tax matters. the company accrues liabilities for regulatory actions when a loss is probable and the amount or range of loss is reasonably estimable.
auditing the measurement of unrecognized tax benefits and liabilities arising from regulatory actions related to transfer pricing used in intercompany transactions was challenging because the measurement is based on judgmental interpretations of complex tax laws and legal rulings and because the pricing of the intercompany transactions is based on studies that may produce a range of outcomes (e.g., the price that would be charged in an arm's-length transaction).
how we addressed the matter in our audit        we obtained an understanding, evaluated the design, and tested the operating effectiveness of controls over the company's process to assess the technical merits and measurement of these unrecognized tax benefits and related regulatory liabilities. for example, we tested management's review of the unrecognized tax benefit calculations, which included evaluation of the comparable transactions used to determine the ranges of outcomes, pricing conclusions reached in management's transfer pricing studies, the assessment of other third-party information, and settlement agreements with relevant tax and regulatory authorities.
with the assistance of our income tax professionals, we performed audit procedures that included, among others, evaluating the technical merits of the company's position and assessing the recognition and measurement of unrecognized tax benefits and liabilities resulting from regulatory actions related to transfer pricing. for example, we assessed the inputs utilized and the pricing conclusions reached in the transfer pricing studies executed by management, and compared the methods used to alternative methods and industry benchmarks. we reviewed advice obtained by the company from third-party advisors. in addition, we used our knowledge of historical settlement activity, income tax laws, and other market information to evaluate the technical merits of the company's positions. for positions settled or effectively settled in the current year, we reviewed the company's communications and agreements with the relevant tax and regulatory authorities. where applicable, we requested and received an external legal counsel confirmation letter to independently verify our understanding of settlement agreements.
report of independent registered public accounting firm on internal control over financial reporting the board of directors and shareholders of mcdonald's corporation opinion on internal control over financial reporting we have audited mcdonald's corporation's internal control over financial reporting as of december 31, 2022, based on criteria established in internal control-integrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission (2013 framework) (the coso criteria). in our opinion, mcdonald's corporation (the company) maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of december 31, 2022, based on the coso criteria.
we also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board (united states) (pcaob), the consolidated balance sheets of mcdonald's corporation as of december 31, 2022 and 2021, and the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, shareholders' equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended december 31, 2022, and the related notes and our report dated february 24, 2023 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.
basis for opinion the company's management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying management's assessment of internal control over financial reporting. our responsibility is to express an opinion on the company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. we are a public accounting firm registered with the pcaob and are required to be independent with respect to the company in accordance with the u.s. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the securities and exchange commission and the pcaob.
we conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the pcaob. those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.
our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. we believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
definition and limitations of internal control over financial reporting a company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. a company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
controls and procedures disclosure controls an evaluation was conducted under the supervision and with the participation of the company's management, including the chief executive officer ("ceo") and chief financial officer ("cfo"), of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the company's disclosure controls and procedures (as that term is defined in rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the securities exchange act of 1934, as amended (the "exchange act")) as of december 31, 2022. based on that evaluation, the ceo and cfo concluded that the company's disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of such date to provide reasonable assurances that information required to be disclosed by the company in the reports filed or submitted under the exchange act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in securities and exchange commission rules and forms, and is accumulated and communicated to the company's management, including the ceo and cfo, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
internal control over financial reporting the company is in the process of implementing a comprehensive, multi-year finance and technology transformation initiative to migrate its general ledger, financial close and consolidation processes onto new financial systems. the company is performing the implementation in the ordinary course of business to increase efficiency and to modernize the tools and technology used in its key financial processes. this is not in response to any identified deficiency or weakness in the company's internal control over financial reporting. as the phased implementation of the systems continues, the company has modified certain processes and procedures to enhance the quality of internal control over financial reporting. the company will continue to monitor and modify, as needed, the design and operating effectiveness of key control activities to align with the updated business processes and capabilities of the new financial systems.
except for these changes, the company's management, including the ceo and cfo, confirm there has been no change in the company's internal control over financial reporting during the fiscal year ended december 31, 2022 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the company's internal control over financial reporting.
management's report management's report and the report of independent registered public accounting firm on internal control over financial reporting are set forth in the consolidated financial statements.

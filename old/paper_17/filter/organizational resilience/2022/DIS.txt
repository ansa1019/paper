the audit committee is responsible for, among other things, overseeing the company's financial statements, internal controls and audit, compliance with legal and regulatory requirements and independent auditor. the committee also has oversight of cybersecurity and data security risks and mitigation strategies. the committee also reviews the company's policies and practices with respect to risk assessment and risk management. the committee met 9 times during fiscal 2022. all of the members of the committee are independent within the meaning of sec regulations, the listing standards of the new york stock exchange and the company's corporate governance guidelines. the board has determined that all members of the committee, ms. catz, mr. desouza and mr. rice, are qualified as audit committee financial experts within the meaning of sec regulations and that they have accounting and related financial management expertise within the meaning of the listing standards of the new york stock exchange and that mr. froman, who served on the committee through january 10, 2022, is financially literate within the meaning of the listing standards of the new york stock exchange. the board has determined that mr. rice's simultaneous service on the audit committees of more than three public companies will not impair his ability to effectively serve on the committee. following the 2023 annual meeting, the board intends to appoint mr. rice as the chair of the committee. ms. catz will remain as a member of the committee.
corporate governance documents the board has adopted corporate governance guidelines, which set forth a flexible framework within which the board, assisted by its committees, directs the affairs of the company. the guidelines address, among other things, the composition and functions of the board, director independence, stock ownership by and compensation of directors, management succession and review, board leadership, board committees and selection of new directors.
the company has standards of business conduct, which are applicable to all employees of the company, including the principal executive officer, the principal financial officer and the principal accounting officer. the board has a separate code of business conduct and ethics for directors, which contains provisions specifically applicable to directors.
each standing committee of the board is governed by a charter adopted by the board.
the corporate governance guidelines, the standards of business conduct, the code of business conduct and ethics for directors and each of the audit, compensation and governance and nominating committee charters are available on the company's investor relations website under the "corporate governance" heading at www.disney.com/investors and in print to any shareholder who requests them from the company's secretary. if the company amends or waives the code of business conduct and ethics for directors or the standards of business conduct with respect to the principal executive officer, principal financial officer or principal accounting officer, it will post the amendment or waiver at the same location on its website.
director selection process working closely with the full board, the governance and nominating committee develops criteria for open board positions. applying these criteria, the committee considers candidates for board membership suggested by committee members, other board members, management and shareholders. the committee retains third-party executive search firms to identify and review candidates, including to generate candidate pools consistent with the criteria below, upon request of the committee from time to time.
once the committee has identified a prospective nominee - including prospective nominees recommended by shareholders - it determines whether to conduct a full evaluation. the committee may request the third-party search firm to gather additional information about the prospective nominee's background and experience and to report its findings. the committee then evaluates the prospective nominee against the specific criteria that it has established for the position, as well as the standards and qualifications set out in the company's corporate governance guidelines, including but not limited to:
•   the ability of the prospective nominee to represent the interests of the shareholders of the company;
•   the extent to which the prospective nominee contributes to the range of talent, skill and expertise appropriate for the board; and
•   the extent to which the prospective nominee helps the board reflect the diversity of the company's shareholders, employees, customers and guests and the communities in which it operates.
in selecting director nominees, the board seeks to achieve a mix of members who together bring experience and personal backgrounds relevant to the company's strategic priorities and the scope and complexity of the company's business. the current nominees' qualifications set forth in their individual biographies under the section titled "directors" sets out how each of the current nominees (comprised of all current directors other than ms. arnold) contributes to the mix of experience and qualifications the board seeks. the board also considers the tenure policy under the corporate governance guidelines, pursuant to which the board will not nominate for re-election any non-management director that completed fifteen years of service as a member of the board on or prior to the date of election or any director that turned 75 years of age of older in the calendar year preceding the related annual meeting, in each case, unless the board concludes that such director's continuing service would better serve the best interests of the shareholders.
in making its recommendations with respect to the nomination for election or re-election of existing directors at the annual shareholders meeting, the committee assesses the composition of the board at the time and considers the extent to which the board continues to reflect the criteria set forth above.
during fiscal 2023, the board appointed two new directors: carolyn everson and bob iger. ms. everson was recommended by non-management directors, a third-party search firm and a shareholder. in connection with ms. everson's appointment, the company entered into a support agreement with third point pursuant to which the company appointed ms. everson as a director and agreed to include ms. everson as a director nominee for the 2023 annual meeting and third point agreed to customary standstill, voting and other provisions through the 2024 annual meeting. mr. iger was recommended by non-management directors. the company has agreed in mr. iger's employment agreement to nominate him for re-election as a member of the board at the expiration of each term of office during the term of the agreement, and he has agreed to continue to serve on the board if elected.
a shareholder who wishes to recommend a prospective nominee for the board should notify the company's secretary or any member of the governance and nominating committee in writing with whatever supporting material the shareholder considers appropriate. the governance and nominating committee will also consider whether to nominate any person nominated by a shareholder pursuant to the provisions of the company's bylaws relating to shareholder nominations.
the elements of annual director compensation for fiscal 2022 were as follows:
to encourage directors to experience the company's products, services and entertainment offerings personally, each non-employee director may receive company products and services up to a maximum of $15,000 in fair market value per calendar year plus reimbursement of associated tax liabilities. each first-year non-employee director may receive company products and services up to a maximum of $25,000 in fair market value plus reimbursement of associated tax liabilities for one year following their respective start date. after the first anniversary of their start date, such first-year non-employee directors will have an additional allowance of $15,000 prorated for the balance of the remaining calendar year. directors' spouses, children and grandchildren may also participate in this benefit within each director's limit.
family members of directors may accompany directors traveling on company aircraft for business purposes on a space-available basis.
directors participate in the company's employee gift matching program on the same terms as senior executives. under this program, the company matches contributions of up to $20,000 per calendar year per director to charitable and educational institutions meeting the company's criteria. beginning in calendar 2022, the board amended the directors' participation in the company's employee gift matching program to decrease the maximum amount of contributions matched by the company from $50,000 to $20,000 per calendar year.
directors who are also employees of the company receive no additional compensation for service as a director.
under the company's corporate governance guidelines, non-employee director compensation is determined annually by the board acting on the recommendation of the governance and nominating committee. in formulating its recommendation, the governance and nominating committee receives input from the third-party compensation consultant retained by the compensation committee regarding market practices for director compensation.
fees earned or paid in cash. "fees earned or paid in cash" includes the annual board retainer and annual committee and committee-chair retainers, whether paid currently or deferred by the director to be paid in cash or shares after service ends. directors are permitted to elect each year to receive all or part of their retainers in disney stock and, whether paid in cash or stock, to defer all or part of their retainers until after service as a director ends. directors who elect to receive deferred compensation in cash receive a credit each quarter and the balance in their deferred cash account earns interest at an annual rate equal to 120% of the applicable long-term federal interest rate, as determined from time to time by the united states internal revenue service. for fiscal 2022, the average interest rate was 3.67%.
the following table sets forth the form of fees received by each director who elected to receive any portion of the compensation in a form other than currently paid cash. the number of stock units awarded is equal to the dollar amount of fees accruing each quarter divided by the average over the last ten trading days of the quarter of the average of the high and low trading price for shares of company common stock on each day in the ten-day period. stock units distributed currently were accumulated throughout the year and distributed as shares following december 31, 2022.
cash                                    stock units paid currently            deferred      value distributed currently             value deferred               number of units mary t. barra                      -                      -                      -                                 $125,000                       1,065
stock awards. "stock awards" sets forth the market value of the deferred stock unit grants to directors and the amount reported is equal to the market value of the company's common stock on the date of the award times the number of shares underlying the units. units are awarded at the end of each quarter and the number of units is determined by dividing the amount payable with respect to the quarter by the average over the last ten trading days of the quarter of the average of the high and low trading price for shares of the company common stock on each day in the ten-day period. each director other than ms. arnold was awarded 2,044 units in fiscal 2022. ms. arnold was awarded 2,544 units in fiscal 2022 due to the annual retainer for independent chairman.
unless a director elects to defer receipt of shares until after the director's service ends, shares with respect to annual deferred stock unit grants are normally distributed to the director on the second anniversary of the award date, whether or not the director is still a director on the date of distribution.
at the end of any quarter in which dividends are distributed to shareholders, directors receive additional stock units with a value (based on the average of the high and low trading prices of the company common stock averaged over the last ten trading days of the quarter) equal to the amount of dividends they would have received on all stock units held by them at the end of the prior quarter. shares with respect to these additional units are distributed when the underlying units are distributed. units awarded in respect of dividends are included in the fair value of the stock units when the units are initially awarded and therefore are not included in the tables above, but they are included in the total units held at the end of the fiscal year in the table below.
the following table sets forth all stock units held by each non-management director serving during fiscal 2022, as of the end of fiscal 2022. all stock units are fully vested when granted, but shares are distributed with respect to the units only later, as described above. stock units in this table are included in the stock ownership table in item 12. security ownership of certain beneficial owners and management and related stockholder matters - "stock ownership" except to the extent they may have been distributed as shares and sold prior to the date of the stock ownership table.
the company's corporate governance guidelines encourage directors to own or acquire within three years of first becoming a director, shares of company common stock (including stock units received as director compensation) having a market value of at least five times the amount of the annual board retainer for the director. unless the board exempts a director, each director is also required to retain stock representing no less than 50% of the after-tax value of exercised options and shares received upon distribution of deferred stock units until such director meets the stock holding guideline described above.
•   reimbursement of tax liabilities associated with the product familiarization benefits. the value of the product familiarization benefits themselves and travel benefits are not included in the table as permitted by sec rules because the aggregate incremental cost to the company of providing these benefits did not exceed $10,000 for any director. the reimbursement of associated tax liabilities was $1,475 for ms. arnold, $6,520 for ms. chang, $5,296 for mr. desouza, $16,968 for mr. froman and $100 for ms. lagomasino.
•   the matching charitable contribution of the company, which was $25,000 for ms. arnold, $50,000 for ms. catz, $35,000 for ms. chang, $55,000 for mr. froman and $70,000 for mr. rice. matched amounts exceed $20,000 in a fiscal year if contributions for separate calendar years are made in the same fiscal year or if there were delays in processing earlier year matches and due to the change in maximum amount of contributions matched by the company in calendar 2022.
•   in fiscal 2022, the company reimbursed security charges to ms. arnold totaling $32,985 for equipment and security services.

fiscal 2022 compensation practices executive compensation objectives and methods: we maintain an integrated approach to attract and retain high-caliber executives in a competitive market for talent, while adhering to key corporate governance best practices summarized below.
shareholder engagement and responsiveness   investor relations and members of the board regularly engage in investor outreach. with regard to executive compensation, the compensation committee has addressed shareholder feedback and made changes to compensation for fiscal 2022, including: • utilized the structure of 50% of the ceo's fiscal 2022 equity award as performance-based restricted stock units ("pbus"), in response to feedback to prioritize pay for performance. • increased pbus from 30% to 50% of the overall long-term incentive grant value for the neos other than the ceo. • increased the rigor of the test for the total shareholder return ("tsr") portion of pbus by setting target performance at the 55th percentile of the s&amp;p 500 companies, an increase from the 50th percentile, with maximum payout at 200% of target. • for the fiscal 2022 annual bonus plan, significantly increased the required revenue and operating income amounts to achieve target-level payouts year-over-year.
incentive plan non-financial metrics        fiscal 2022 bonus plan maintains incorporation of diversity and inclusion (e.g., representation, retention and content), which has the highest weighting among a limited number of focused non-financial metrics.
equity retention guidelines                 neos must hold a meaningful amount of the company's stock. the ceo must hold equity valued at five times his salary within five years of becoming ceo, while other neos must hold equity valued at three times their salary within five years of becoming an executive officer.
compensation at risk                        a majority of neo compensation is tied to either short- or long-term company performance. for robert a. chapek in fiscal 2022, 90% of his total target compensation was tied to financial performance, contributions towards organization goals, equity compensation or stock price performance. this includes 50% of his annual equity grant awarded in pbus.
annual risk assessment                      each year, the compensation committee's compensation consultant completes a risk assessment of the company's compensation programs. based on this assessment for fiscal 2022, the compensation committee determined that risks arising from the company's policies and practices are not reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on the company.
clawback policy                             the board may recover or cancel any bonus or incentive payments in cases where an executive's misconduct results in either financial or reputational harm.
no option re-pricing or cash buyouts        the company does not allow re-pricing or cash buyouts of underwater stock options without shareholder approval.
independent compensation consultant         the compensation committee has retained a compensation consultant whose relationship with the company was confirmed to be independent for fiscal 2022.
changes for fiscal 2023
after fiscal year 2022, on november 20, 2022, the company exercised its right to involuntarily terminate mr. chapek's employment. for details of his separation, please see the section titled "executive compensation - compensation tables - potential payments and rights on termination or change in control" below.
on november 20, 2022, the company entered into an employment agreement with mr. iger and he was appointed as ceo. in connection with the agreement, mr. iger's annual base salary was set at $1,000,000 and he is eligible for an annual bonus determined through financial and individual performance objectives with a target of 100% of base salary (up to a maximum of 200%). mr. iger's annual long-term incentive grant target is $25,000,000 and will have the following vehicle mix: 60% pbus and 40% stock options. the pbus have a 2-year performance period aligned with the term of his employment agreement. the committee determined that mr. iger's interest in the value of his existing equity holdings aligned with his mandate to develop a long-term successor by 2024. the committee also evaluated the long-term incentive structure of the ceo and neos' executive compensation programs. starting in fiscal 2020, 50% of pbus were eligible to vest based on return on invested capital ("roic") performance. while the initial intent was to set a full 3-year roic goal, due to challenges in forecasting posed by the covid-19 pandemic, roic goals have been set and measured each year of the 3-year performance period for grants made in fiscal 2020 through fiscal 2022. in november 2022, the compensation committee determined that long-term incentive grants made in fiscal 2023 (i.e., in december 2022) will utilize a full 3-year goal for the roic portion of pbus, excluding mr. iger's long-term incentive grant, which will have a 2-year performance period to reflect his 2-year employment term.                                              increase to 60% performance-based units for the ceo return to full 3-year return on invested capital goal for other neos the following chart shows the percentage of the target total direct annual compensation for mr. iger that varies with performance and equity versus being fixed with respect to fiscal 2023. performance-based and equity compensation represents target performance-based bonus and equity awards while fixed compensation represents base salary.
executive compensation program structure - objectives and methods we design our executive compensation program to drive the creation of long-term shareholder value. we do this by tying compensation to the achievement of performance goals that promote the creation of shareholder value and by designing compensation to attract and retain high-caliber executives in a competitive market for talent. we aim to provide compensation opportunities that take into account compensation levels and practices of our peers. for a more detailed description of the peer groups we use for compensation purposes, see the discussion under the heading, "executive compensation - other compensation information - peer groups," set forth below. total direct compensation comprises a mix of variable and fixed compensation that is heavily weighted toward variable performance-based compensation. our performance-based compensation includes a short-term annual performance-based bonus and longer-term equity awards that deliver value based on stock price performance and in the case of performance-based stock units, whose vesting depends on meeting performance targets. as prospective performance targets are central to our business strategy, for competitive reasons we do not publicly disclose them for either the short-term annual performance-based bonus plan or the long-term incentive plan. the company enters into employment agreements with our senior executives when the compensation committee determines that it is appropriate to attract or retain an executive or where an employment agreement is consistent with our practices with respect to other similarly situated executives.
the following table sets forth the elements of total direct compensation in fiscal 2022 and fiscal 2023 and the objectives and key features of each element:
objectives and key features salary objectives: the compensation committee sets salaries to reflect job responsibilities and to provide competitive fixed pay to balance performance-based risks. key features: • minimum salaries set in employment agreement • committee discretion to adjust annually based on changes in experience, nature and responsibility of the position, competitive considerations and ceo recommendation (except in the case of the ceo)
performance-based bonus objectives: the compensation committee structures the bonus program to incentivize performance at the high end of the financial performance measure ranges that it establishes each year. the committee believes that incentivizing performance in this fashion will lead to long-term, sustainable gains in shareholder value. key features: • target bonus for each neo set by the committee early in the fiscal year in light of employment agreement provisions, competitive considerations, ceo recommendation (except targets for the ceo) and other factors the committee deems appropriate; bonus opportunity normally limited to 200% of target bonus • unless otherwise adjusted downward by the committee, payout on 70% of target is formulaic and determined by performance against financial performance ranges developed by the committee early in the fiscal year • unless otherwise determined by the committee, payout on 30% of target determined by company-wide other performance factors and the committee's assessment of individual performance based both on other performance objectives and on ceo recommendation (except the payouts for the ceo)
equity awards objectives: the compensation committee structures equity awards to directly reward long-term gains in shareholder value. equity awards carry vesting terms that now extend for three years and include pbus whose value depends on company performance, including performance relative to the s&amp;p 500. these awards provide incentives to create and sustain long-term growth in shareholder value. key features: • combined value of options, performance units and time-based units determined by the committee in light of employment agreement provisions, competitive market conditions, evaluation of executive's performance and ceo recommendation (except awards for the ceo) • for fiscal 2022, allocation of annual awards for mr. iger in his role as executive chairman (based on award value): 50% pbus; 50% stock options. for fiscal 2023, in his role as ceo, the allocation of annual awards will be: 60% pbus and 40% stock options • allocation of annual awards for other neos including mr. chapek in fiscal 2022 (based on award value): 50% pbus; 25% time-based restricted stock units; 25% stock options stock option awards key features: • exercise price equal to average of the high and low trading prices on day of award • option re-pricing without shareholder approval is prohibited • ten-year term • vest one-third per year annual performance-based restricted stock units key features: • pbus reward executives only if specified financial performance measures are met • pbus vest subject to the level of achievement under multiple multi-year performance tests • half of awards vest based on three-year cumulative tsr relative to the s&amp;p 500; the other half vest based on three-year roic measured over three one-year performance periods. for fiscal 2022, roic awards included three measurement periods of one year each due to continued financial uncertainties resulting from the covid-19 pandemic. for fiscal 2023, roic awards include one measurement period of three years (two years in the case of mr. iger). awards as described in the section titled "executive compensation - compensation tables - fiscal 2022 grants of plan based awards table" annual time-based restricted stock units key features: • one-third vests each year following grant date • annual units awarded to executive officers are subject to section 162(m) test to the extent necessary and available to obtain tax deductibility by the company of the payments • for fiscal 2023, mr. iger will not receive time-based rsus
compensation at risk the compensation committee believes that most of the compensation for neos should be at risk and tied to a combination of long-term and short-term company performance. in fiscal 2022, our neos consisted of mr. chapek, christine mccarthy, horacio gutierrez, paul richardson, kristina schake, mr. iger and geoffrey morrell.
in establishing a mix of fixed to variable compensation, the composition of equity awards, target bonus levels, grant date equity award values and performance ranges, the committee seeks to maintain its goal of making compensation overwhelmingly tied to performance, while also providing compensation opportunities that are competitive with alternatives available to the executive. in particular, the committee expects that performance at the high-end of ranges will result in overall compensation that is sufficiently attractive relative to compensation available at successful competitors and that performance at the low-end of ranges will result in overall compensation that is less than that available from competitors with more successful performance.
the following charts show the percentage of the target total direct annual compensation for first, mr. chapek, and second, all neos other than mr. chapek and mr. iger, that varies with performance and equity versus being fixed with respect to fiscal 2022. performance-based and equity compensation represents target performance-based bonus and equity awards while fixed compensation represents base salary.
beginning in fiscal 2022, the compensation committee determined to increase pbus from 30% to 50% of the overall long-term incentive grant value for the neos other than the ceo, who already had 50% in the form of pbus (and who will have 60% in the form of pbus for fiscal 2023). this shift reflects a meaningful increase in at-risk compensation, as evidenced by the actual results realized with respect to recent pbu grants. for example, below is a table reflecting annual grant pbus vesting in the last five years which resulted in below target payouts:
% of target payout            85%               96%               62%               48%               50%
the fiscal 2021 roic test resulted in a 150% payout, which is being assessed for outstanding pbu grants made in december 2019 and 2020. the fiscal 2022 roic test had a threshold, target and maximum of 1.6%, 4.1% and 5.4% respectively. actual fiscal 2022 roic performance was just under 5.4%, which resulted in 148% payout for the fiscal 2022 portion of the roic test, which is being assessed for outstanding pbu grants made in december 2019 and 2020. as the maximum payout for fiscal 2022 pbu awards increased to 200% of target, roic performance of approximately 5.4% resulted in a 196% payout for the fiscal 2022 roic portion of grants made in december 2021. the compensation committee believes this pbu structure strongly aligns pay and performance, which is underscored by the decision to further increase the weighting of pbus for other neos.
salaries                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       performance-based bonus

management input in addition to the chief executive officer recommendations described above, management regularly:
•   provides an ongoing review of the effectiveness of the compensation programs, including competitiveness and alignment with the company's objectives; and
•   recommends changes to compensation programs if needed to help achieve program objectives.
the committee meets regularly in executive session without management present to discuss compensation decisions and matters relating to the design and operation of the executive compensation program.
compensation consultant the compensation committee retained pay governance llc as the compensation consultant for fiscal 2022. the consultant assists the committee's development and evaluation of compensation policies and practices and the committee's determinations of compensation awards through various services, including providing third-party data, advice and expertise on proposed executive compensation awards and plan designs; reviewing briefing materials prepared by management and outside advisers; and advising the committee on the matters included in these materials and preparing its own analysis of compensation matters.
the committee considers input from the consultant as one factor in making decisions on compensation matters, along with information and analyses it receives from management and its own judgment and experience.
the committee has adopted a policy requiring its consultant to be independent of company management. the committee performs an annual assessment of the consultant's independence to determine whether the consultant is independent. the committee assessed pay governance llc's independence in december 2022 and confirmed that the firm's work has not raised any conflict of interest and the firm is independent. pay governance llc does not provide any services to the company other than the services provided to the compensation committee.
fiscal 2022 compensation decisions this section discusses the specific decisions made by the compensation committee in fiscal 2022. these decisions were made taking into consideration the results of the most recent shareholder advisory vote on executive compensation. based on the results of the advisory vote on executive compensation, members of management and the board engaged in extensive outreach to shareholders. the board took several actions in response to the shareholder feedback received.
performance goals the compensation committee normally develops performance goals for each fiscal year early in that year and evaluates performance against those goals after the fiscal year has ended to arrive at its compensation decisions.
annual incentive goals annual incentive financial performance in november 2021, the compensation committee reviewed the annual performance-based bonus program. the committee determined to retain the financial measures and relative weights for calculating the portion of the neos bonuses that is based on financial performance as follows:
•   adjusted segment operating income-50%
the committee also developed performance ranges for each of the measures in november 2021. these ranges are used to determine the multiplier that is applied to 70% of each neo's target bonus. the overall financial performance multiple is equal to the weighted average of the performance multiples for each of these three measures. the performance multiple for each measure is zero if performance is below the bottom of the range and varies from 35% at the low end of the range to a maximum of 200% at the top end of the range. the committee believes the top of each range represents extraordinary performance and the bottom represents satisfactory performance, below which no award would be provided. in addition, 30% of each neo's target bonus is based on performance against key strategic goals for the company, called "other performance factors." we believe the mix between key financial and strategic factors is appropriate, given the majority of the bonus opportunity is focused on company financial performance, while still recognizing the importance that other performance factors have on establishing a successful culture that supports the company's strategic goals.
for fiscal 2022, with the recovery from the pandemic and our desire to deliver strong results for our shareholders, the committee significantly increased performance ranges year-over-year for all three financial metrics. in addition, for fiscal 2022, the committee expanded the width of the performance range (i.e., the difference between the maximum performance and threshold performance) for adjusted revenue in order to account for both upside and downside risks. the following table shows the performance ranges approved by the committee for fiscal 2022 and actual performance (dollars in millions):
fiscal 2022 performance threshold         fiscal 2022 performance target          fiscal 2022 performance maximum     fiscal 2022 actual      fiscal 2022 actual performance             performance as % of target segment operating income                                         $ 6,556                                 $ 9,856                                 $12,656                 $12,121                    181%
*   for purposes of the annual performance-based bonuses, "adjusted after-tax free cash flow" was defined as cash provided by operations less investments in parks, resorts and other properties, all on a consolidated basis and reflects the adjustments described under "- evaluating performance" below.
other performance factors the compensation committee developed other performance factors for the fiscal 2022 annual bonus in november 2021. for fiscal 2022, the other performance factors continued to emphasize the importance of diversity and inclusion, which had the highest weighting among the other performance factors. the committee established the following factors based on the strategic objectives of the company:
•   diversity &amp; inclusion - meaningful progress building an inclusive culture through increased representation, recruitment, retention and/or promotion of women and underrepresented groups globally; advance inclusive content by increasing underrepresented groups in creative hiring exploring culturally diverse and authentic themes, characters and narratives; ensure transparency and accountability of efforts that align with our values and advance change/impact to the business
•   collaboration on strategic priorities - actively promote collaboration and synergy on key strategic priorities of the company with a one-company mindset and drive clear accountabilities and partnership across all lines of business, in support of developing content and product for our key franchises, accelerating our dtc initiatives and enabling the success of creative, operating and corporate teams
•   efforts towards creativity &amp; innovation - drive company growth through innovation and creativity, using quality franchise content and experiences that can be leveraged across the company to create new sources of revenue
evaluating performance the compensation committee reviewed the overall operating results of the company in fiscal 2022, evaluating them against the bonus plan performance ranges developed by the committee early in the fiscal year. the compensation committee approved no adjustments to actual fiscal 2022 total segment operating income and revenue. after-tax free cash flow performance for incentive purposes was overall adjusted downward to exclude non-recurring items, such as litigation proceeds and restructuring payments.
in fiscal 2022, the company achieved strong financial growth for all three financial metrics, even after ranges were significantly increased for fiscal 2022. the financial performance achieved included: segment operating income of $12,121 million, revenue of $82,722 million and adjusted after-tax free cash flow of $1,043 million. based on these results and due to the increase in targets, the weighted financial performance factor was 159% in fiscal 2022 compared to a performance factor of 200% in fiscal 2021. additional details regarding the performance of the company are set forth in our annual report on form 10-k for fiscal 2022.
with respect to the other performance factors, the committee recognizes that while we still have more work ahead of us, the neos delivered results on these key strategic objectives, including:
•   adjusted pay ratios of over 99% for base pay for u.s. women and people of color. for more details on the adjusted pay ratio analysis and our commitment to expand pay ratio analyses further going forward, please see our pay ratio dashboard on the "esg reporting" page of our csr website.
•   we expanded our efforts to increase diverse representation, which helped produce year-over-year growth, especially at the executive and management levels. representation for women increased 2.2 and 1.2 percentage points at the executive and management levels, respectively. representation for people of color increased 2.8 and 1.8 percentage points at the executive and management levels, respectively. for more detailed results, please see our diversity dashboard on the "esg reporting" page of our csr website. the diversity dashboard includes our commitment to further disclosures in the future.
•   efforts also resulted in positive trends in hires and promotions of women and people of color to executive and manager positions, as well as in our overall employee population. in addition, the company was able to retain and develop diverse executives and management in an extremely competitive market for talent.
•   released award-winning and critically-acclaimed diverse content with diverse talent across our platforms, such as encanto, abbott elementary, prey, turning red, reservation dogs, dr. strange in the multiverse of madness, moon knight and andor.
•   established a new pride 365 collective of senior-level leaders of the company to support the lgbtqia+ community, such as providing a financial commitment to organizations who support the lgbtqia+ community.
collaboration on strategic priorities

see tabular disclosure for each neo below under "executive compensation - compensation discussion and analysis - individual compensation decisions" for additional information regarding key contributions and accomplishments of each neo.
individual compensation decisions annual compensation decisions the following table summarizes annual compensation decisions made by the compensation committee with respect to each of the neos. the committee established the salary and performance-based bonus target multiple of salary for each of the neos early in the fiscal year following the processes described above. the final bonus award was calculated after the fiscal year ended using the financial performance factor of 159% described above. given the enterprise-wide nature of the other performance factors and the contributions of each currently employed neo, the committee established a consistent other performance factor of 114% for the neos listed in the following table below.
for mr. chapek, the committee determined to provide a bonus at 90% of target. for more discussion of mr. chapek's separation, including the rationale, see the section titled "executive compensation - compensation tables - potential payments and rights on termination or change in control." details of mr. morrell's separation, including the rationale for providing him certain enhanced payments, are presented in the section titled "executive compensation - compensation tables - potential payments and rights on termination or change in control."

5   mr. iger retired from the company effective december 31, 2021. mr. iger was eligible for a 2022 pro-rated bonus per his employment agreement for his services during fiscal 2022. the committee awarded mr. iger a bonus of $4,370,000.
•   the compensation set forth above does not include the change in pension value and non-qualified deferred compensation earnings, as these items do not reflect decisions made by the committee during the fiscal year.
•   the compensation set forth above does not include perquisites and benefits and other compensation, as these items are generally determined by contract and do not reflect decisions made by the committee during the fiscal year.
the compensation committee's determination on each of these matters was based on the recommendation of mr. iger (except in the case of his own and mr. chapek's compensation), the parameters established by the executive's employment agreement and the factors described below. in determining equity awards, the committee considered its overall long-term incentive guidelines for all executives, which, in the context of the competitive market for executive talent, attempt to balance the benefits of incentive compensation tied to performance of the company's common stock with the dilutive effect of equity compensation awards.

salary. this column sets forth the base salary earned during each fiscal year. fiscal 2020 reflects the voluntary reduction of the salary of neos in response to the covid-19 pandemic. each of the company's neos serving at that time agreed to temporarily reduce their base salary, effective with the payroll period commencing april 5, 2020. mr. iger agreed to forgo his salary through the end of the fiscal year. mr. chapek agreed to forgo 50% and ms. mccarthy agreed to forgo 30% of the base salary that would otherwise have been payable through august 22, 2020.
stock awards. this column sets forth the grant date fair value of the restricted stock unit awards granted to the neos during each fiscal year as part of the company's long-term incentive compensation program. the grant date fair value of these awards was calculated by multiplying the number of units awarded by the average of the high and low trading price of the company's common stock on the grant date, subject to valuation adjustments for restricted stock unit awards subject to vesting conditions other than, where applicable, the test to assure deductibility under section 162(m) of the internal revenue code. the valuation adjustments for performance-based awards reflect the fact that the number of shares received on vesting varies based on the level of performance achieved and were determined using a monte carlo simulation that determines the probability that the performance targets will be achieved. the grant date fair value of the restricted stock unit awards granted during fiscal 2022 is also included in the fiscal 2022 grants of plan based awards table.
option awards. this column sets forth the grant date fair value of options to purchase shares of the company's common stock granted to the neos during each fiscal year. the grant date fair value of these options was calculated using a binomial option pricing model. the assumptions used in estimating the fair value of these options are set forth in footnote 12 to the company's audited financial statements for fiscal 2022. the grant date fair value of the options granted during fiscal 2022 is also included in the fiscal 2022 grants of plan based awards table.
non-equity incentive plan compensation. this column sets forth the amount of compensation earned by the neos under the company's annual performance-based bonus program during each fiscal year. a description of the company's annual performance-based bonus program is included in the section "executive compensation - compensation discussion and analysis - executive compensation program structure-objectives and methods" and the determination of performance-based bonuses for fiscal 2022 is described in the section "executive compensation - compensation discussion and analysis - fiscal 2022 compensation decisions." as a result of the covid-19 pandemic, fiscal 2020 reflects the compensation committee's determination to pay no bonuses to the neos, despite achievement of certain performance metrics and considerations that might have otherwise supported a bonus payment.
change in pension value and non-qualified deferred compensation earnings. this column reflects the aggregate change in the actuarial present value of each neo's accumulated benefits under all defined benefit plans, including supplemental plans, during each fiscal year. the amounts reported in this column vary with a number of factors, including the discount rate applied to determine
the value of future payment streams, the neo's age and additional earned benefits as a result of an additional year of service. the discount rate used pursuant to pension accounting rules to calculate the present value of future payments was 2.82% for fiscal 2020, 2.88% for fiscal 2021 and 5.44% for fiscal 2022. neither increases nor decreases in pension value resulting from changes in the discount rate result in any increase or decrease in benefits payable to participants under the plan. as mr. gutierrez, ms. schake and mr. morrell all joined the company in 2022, they are not eligible for the company's defined benefit pension. for mr. chapek, ms. mccarthy, mr. richardson and mr. iger, the increase in interest rate for fiscal 2022 drove the change in pension value for such year to be negative (-$2,910,803, - $1,304,748, -$690,638 and -$5,303,886, respectively).
mr. chapek and ms. mccarthy had losses on deferred compensation as disclosed below under "executive compensation - compensation tables - fiscal 2022 non-qualified deferred compensation table."
all other compensation. this column sets forth all of the compensation for each fiscal year that we could not properly report in any other column of the table, including:
•   the incremental cost to the company of perquisites and other personal benefits;
•   the amount of company contributions to employee savings plans;
•   the dollar value of insurance premiums paid by the company with respect to excess liability insurance for the neos; and
•   the dollar amount of matching charitable contributions made to charities pursuant to the company's charitable gift matching program, which is available to all regular u.s. employees with at least one year of service.
the dollar amount of matching charitable contributions was $27,600 for mr. chapek, $32,000 for ms. mccarthy, $10,000 for mr. richardson and $65,000 for mr. iger. matched amounts exceed $50,000 in a fiscal year if contributions for separate calendar years are made in the same fiscal year or if there were delays in processing earlier year matches.
upon his retirement on december 31, 2021, the consulting period established under mr. iger's then current employment agreement with the company commenced. in connection with his consulting agreement, mr. iger received quarterly payments of $500,000 for each quarter he served in this capacity; for fiscal 2022 he received $1,500,000.
in accordance with the sec's interpretations of its rules, this column also sets forth the incremental cost to the company of certain items that are provided to the neos for business purposes but which may not be considered integrally related to duties.
the following table sets forth the incremental cost to the company of each other perquisite and other personal benefit that exceeded the greater of $25,000 or 10% of the total amount of perquisites and personal benefits for an neo in fiscal 2022.
geoffrey s. morrell                 -                  -                 527,438         506,310          1,033,748
the incremental cost to the company of the items specified above was determined as follows:
•   personal air travel: the actual catering costs, landing and ramp fees, fuel costs and lodging costs incurred by flight crew plus a per hour charge based on the average hourly maintenance costs for the aircraft during the year for flights that were purely personal in nature, and a pro-rata portion of catering costs where personal guests accompanied an neo on flights that were business in nature. where a personal flight coincided with the repositioning of an aircraft following a business flight, only the incremental costs of the flight compared to an immediate repositioning of the aircraft are included. as noted below, our ceo is, and executive chairman was, required for security reasons to use corporate aircraft for all of their personal travel.
•   security: the actual costs incurred by the company for providing security services and equipment.
the "other" column in the table above includes, to the extent an neo elected to receive any of these benefits, the incremental cost to the company of the vehicle benefit, personal air travel (except for the neos whose personal air travel is separately identified in the "personal air travel" column in the table above), reimbursement of up to $1,000 per calendar year for wellness-related purposes such as fitness and nutrition management, reimbursement of expenses for financial consulting and for officers at the vice president level and higher before october 1, 2012, a fixed monthly payment to offset the costs of owning and maintaining an automobile. in addition, included for mr. morrell is a $500,000 payment, paid on june 25, 2022, which was provided to account for his unique circumstances, including costs expended by mr. morrell, who was in the process of relocating his family internationally.

grant date. the compensation committee made the annual grant of stock options and restricted stock unit awards for fiscal 2022 on december 14, 2021. as roic targets for fiscal 2022 were set on november 30, 2021, fiscal 2020 and 2021 roic portions were considered granted on that date. a portion of the fiscal 2022 pbus granted on december 14, 2021 are subject to the roic performance test, as described below. one-third of such units were eligible to vest based on the roic performance target established for fiscal 2022. because the performance targets for fiscal 2023 and 2024 have not yet been established, the grant date value of such portion of these awards was not determinable in fiscal 2022. therefore, the grant date fair value listed for fiscal 2022 includes only the grant date value of that portion of such awards subject to the 2022 roic target. based on the company's fiscal 2022 roic, 148% of the reported portion of fiscal 2020 and fiscal 2021 awards will vest and 196% of the reported portion of fiscal 2022 awards will vest. roic targets for fiscal 2023 and fiscal 2024 will be set early each year for the remaining portion of those grants, and the grant date values for the remaining portions of those grants will be reported for the appropriate fiscal year when the applicable targets are established.
estimated possible payouts under non-equity incentive plan awards. as described in the section "executive compensation - compensation discussion and analysis," the compensation committee sets the target bonus opportunity for the neos at the beginning of the fiscal year as a percentage of fiscal year-end salary, and the actual bonuses for the neos may, except in special circumstances such as unusual challenges or extraordinary successes, range from 35% to 200% of the target level based on the compensation committee's evaluation of financial and other performance factors for the fiscal year. the bonus amount may be zero if actual performance is below the specified threshold levels or less than the calculated amounts if the compensation committee otherwise decides to reduce the bonus. as addressed in the discussion of "executive compensation - compensation discussion and analysis," the employment agreements of each executive officer require that the target used to calculate the bonus opportunity (but not the actual bonus awarded) be at least the amount specified in each agreement. this column shows the range of potential bonus payments for each neo from the threshold to the maximum based on the target range set at the beginning of the fiscal year. the actual bonus amounts received for fiscal 2022 are set forth in the "non-equity incentive plan compensation" column of the "fiscal 2022 summary compensation table."
estimated future payouts under equity incentive plan awards. this column sets forth the number of restricted stock units awarded to the neos during fiscal 2022 that are subject to performance tests as described below. these include units awarded to each of the neos as part of the annual grant in december 2021 and, for mr. chapek, ms. mccarthy and mr. iger, when fiscal 2022 roic targets were set with respect to fiscal 2020 and 2021 grants in november 2021. the vesting dates for all of the outstanding restricted stock unit awards held by the neos as of the end of fiscal 2022 are set forth in the "fiscal 2022 outstanding equity awards at fiscal year-end table" below.
all units in row b are subject to the following vesting conditions: half of the units subject to the performance test are subject to a tsr test and half of the units are subject to a roic test.
•   for the half of the units subject to the tsr performance test:
•   none of the units related to this measure vest if the company's tsr is below the 25th percentile of the s&amp;p 500 for that measure.
•   if the company's tsr is at or above the 25th percentile of the s&amp;p 500 for the related measure, the number of units related to that measure that vest will vary from 50% of the target number related to that measure (at the 25th percentile) to 100% of the target number related to that measure (at the 55th percentile) to 200% of the target number related to that measure (at or above the 75th percentile) (in each case, plus dividend equivalent units).
•   for the half of the units subject to the roic performance test:
•   none of the units related to this measure vest if the company's fiscal year roic performance in each of the applicable fiscal years is below threshold of target roic.
•   if the company's roic is above the threshold in any fiscal year, the number of units related to that measure for that year that vest will vary from 50% of the target number related to that measure (equals threshold) to 200% of the target number related to that measure (exceeds maximum) (in each case, plus dividend equivalent units). for roic portions from the fiscal 2020 and 2021 grants, maximum payout was 150% of target.
roic for the company is adjusted (i) to exclude the effect of extraordinary, unusual and/or nonrecurring items and (ii) to reflect such other factors, as the committee deems appropriate to fairly reflect roic for the applicable fiscal year.
when dividends are distributed to shareholders, dividend equivalents are credited in an amount equal to the dollar amount of dividends on the number of units held on the dividend record date divided by the fair market value of the company's shares of common stock on the dividend distribution date. dividend equivalents vest only when, if and to the extent that the underlying units vest.
all other option awards: number of securities underlying options. this column sets forth the options to purchase shares of the company's common stock granted to the neos as part of the annual grant in december 2021. the vesting dates for these options are set forth in the "fiscal 2022 outstanding equity awards at fiscal year-end table" below. these options are scheduled to expire ten years after the date of grant.
exercise or base price of option awards; grant date closing price of shares underlying options. these columns set forth the exercise price for each option grant and the closing price of the company's common stock on the date of grant. the exercise price is equal to the average of the high and low trading price on the grant date, which may be higher or lower than the closing price on the grant date.
grant date fair value of stock and option awards. this column sets forth the grant date fair value of the stock and option awards granted during fiscal 2022 calculated in accordance with applicable accounting requirements. the grant date fair value of all restricted stock unit awards and options is determined as described in the section "grant date" above.
fiscal 2022 outstanding equity awards at fiscal year-end table the following table provides information concerning outstanding unexercised options and unvested restricted stock unit awards held by the neos as of october 1, 2022. additional information regarding the amounts reported in each column follows the table.

number of securities underlying unexercised options: exercisable and unexercisable. these columns set forth, for each neo and for each grant made to the officer, the number of shares of the company's common stock that could be acquired upon exercise of outstanding options at the end of fiscal 2022. the vesting schedule for each option with unexercisable shares is shown under "vesting schedule" below. the vesting of options held by the neos may be accelerated in the circumstances described under the section "executive compensation - compensation tables - potential payments and rights on termination or change in control" below.
number; market value of units of stock that have not vested. these columns report the number and market value, respectively, of shares underlying each grant of restricted stock units to each officer that is not subject to performance vesting conditions nor the test to assure eligibility for deduction pursuant to section 162(m). the number of shares includes dividend equivalent units that have accrued for dividends payable through october 1, 2022. the market value is equal to the number of shares underlying the units times the closing market price of the company's common stock on september 30, 2022, the last trading day of the company's fiscal year. the vesting schedule for each grant is shown below, with grants identified by the letter following the number of shares underlying the grant. vesting of restricted stock units held by neos may be accelerated in the circumstances described under the section "executive compensation - compensation tables - potential payments and rights on termination or change in control" below.
number; market value of unearned units that have not vested. these columns set forth the target number and market value, respectively, of shares of the company's common stock underlying each restricted stock unit award held by each neo that is subject to performance-based vesting conditions and/or the test to assure eligibility for deduction pursuant to section 162(m). the number of shares includes dividend equivalent units that have accrued for dividends payable through october 1, 2022. the market value is equal to the number of shares underlying the units multiplied by the closing market price of the company's common stock on september 30, 2022, the last trading day of the company's fiscal year. the vesting schedule and performance tests and/or the test to assure eligibility under section 162(m) are shown in "vesting schedule" below.
(a) unless otherwise noted, stock options and restricted stock units granted before december 2020 will vest 25% on each of the first four anniversaries of the grant date. grants made in or after december 2020 will vest one-third on each of the first three anniversaries of the grant date.
(c) pbus will cliff vest on the third anniversary of grant date, based on 3-year tsr versus s&p 500 and absolute roic tests for each of the fiscal years in the 3-year period (targets set each year). grants before 2020 for ms. mccarthy are subject to performance under section 162(m).
(d) while restricted stock units will vest 25% on each of the first four anniversaries of the grant date for grants made before december 2020 and one-third on each of the first three anniversaries of the grant date for grants made in or after december 2020, grants before 2020 for ms. mccarthy are also subject to a performance test to assure eligibility for deduction under section 162(m).
(e) restricted stock units granted february 28, 2020 in connection with mr. chapek's appointment as chief executive officer. the units are scheduled to vest on december 17, 2022 subject to satisfaction of a 3-year tsr test and 3 1-year roic tests, with the number of units vesting depending on the level at which the tests were satisfied.
(h) pbus will cliff vest on december 14, 2024, based on 3-year tsr versus s&p 500 and absolute roic tests for each of the fiscal years in the 3-year period (targets set each year).
(k) options granted march 21, 2019 following the close of the tfcf acquisition. the remaining unexercisable options are scheduled to become exercisable on december 19, 2022.
extended vesting of equity awards options and restricted stock units continue to vest beyond retirement (and options remain exercisable) if (1) they were awarded at least one year prior to the date of an employee's retirement and (2) the employee was age 60 or older and had at least ten years of service on the date such employee retired. in these circumstances:
•   options continue to vest following retirement according to the original vesting schedule. they remain exercisable for up to five years following retirement. options do not, however, remain exercisable beyond the original expiration date of the option.
•   restricted stock units continue to vest following retirement according to the original vesting schedule, but vesting remains subject to any applicable performance conditions (except, in some cases, the test to ensure that the compensation is deductible pursuant to section 162(m)).
options and restricted stock units awarded to executive officers with employment agreements also continue to vest (and options remain exercisable) beyond termination of employment if the executive's employment is terminated by the company without cause or by the executive with good reason. in this case, options and restricted stock units continue to vest (and options remain exercisable) as though the executive remained employed through the end of the stated term of the employment agreement. if the executive would be age 60 or older and have at least ten years of service as of the end of the stated term of the employment agreement, the options and restricted stock units awarded at least one year prior to the end of the stated term of the agreement would continue to vest (and options remain exercisable) beyond the stated term of the employment agreement. in addition, the grants to mr. iger in fiscal 2022 continue to vest (and options remain exercisable) upon his retirement at december 31, 2021.
fiscal 2022 option exercises and stock vested table the following table provides information concerning the exercise of options and vesting of restricted stock unit awards held by the neos during fiscal 2022.
option awards                                    stock awards number of                   value                number of                   value shares                      realized on          shares                      realized on acquired on                 exercise             acquired on                 vesting exercise                                         vesting robert a. chapek                -                   $-                            26,350                     $ 3,909,801
the value realized on the exercise of options is equal to the amount per share at which the neo sold shares acquired on exercise (all of which occurred on the date of exercise) minus the exercise price of the option times the number of shares acquired on exercise of
the options. the value realized on the vesting of stock awards is equal to the closing market price of the company's common stock on the date of vesting times the number of shares acquired upon vesting. the number of shares and value realized on vesting includes shares that were withheld at the time of vesting to satisfy tax withholding requirements.
equity compensation plans the following table summarizes information, as of october 1, 2022, relating to equity compensation plans of the company pursuant to which grants of options, restricted stock, restricted stock units or other rights to acquire shares of the company's common stock may be granted from time to time.
plan category                                                number of securities to be issued upon exercise of outstanding options, warrants and rights (a)           weighted-average              number of securities exercise price of             remaining available for outstanding options,          future issuance under warrants and rights           equity compensation
1   these plans are the company's amended and restated 2011 stock incentive plan ("2011 stock incentive plan"), the walt disney company/pixar 2004 equity incentive plan (the "disney/pixar plan", which was assumed by the company in connection with the acquisition of pixar) and the walt disney company/tfcf 2013 equity incentive plan (the "disney/tfcf plan", which was assumed by the company in connection with the acquisition of tfcf).
2   includes an aggregate of 17,970,581 time-based restricted stock units and pbus. includes an aggregate of 23,281 restricted stock units granted under the disney/pixar plan, which was approved by the shareholders of pixar prior to the company's acquisition.
3   assumes shares issued upon vesting of pbus vest at 100% of target number of units. for awards granted in fiscal 2020 and 2021, the actual number of shares issued on vesting of pbus could be zero to 150% of the target number of pbus. for awards granted in fiscal 2022, the actual number of shares issued on vesting of pbus could be zero to 200% of the target number of pbus.
4   reflects the weighted average exercise price of outstanding options; excludes restricted stock units and pbus.
5   includes 382,356 securities available for future issuance under the disney/pixar plan, which was approved by the shareholders of pixar prior to the company's acquisition. includes 27,720,535 securities available for future issuance under the disney/tfcf plan, which was approved by the shareholders of tfcf prior to the company's acquisition. assumes all awards are made in the form of options. each award of one restricted stock unit under the 2011 stock incentive plan reduces the number of shares available under the plan by two, so the number of securities available for issuance will be smaller to the extent awards are made as restricted stock units.
pension benefits the company maintains a tax-qualified, noncontributory retirement plan, called the disney salaried pension plan d, for salaried employees who commenced employment before january 1, 2012. benefits are based on a percentage of total average monthly compensation multiplied by years of credited service. for service years after 2012, average monthly compensation includes overtime, commission and regular bonus and is calculated based on the highest five consecutive years of compensation during the ten-year period prior to termination of employment or retirement, whichever is earlier. for service years prior to 2012, average monthly compensation considers only base salary, benefits were based on a somewhat higher percentage of average monthly compensation and benefits included a flat dollar amount based solely on years and hours of service. retirement benefits are non-forfeitable after three years of vesting service (five years of vesting service prior to 2012) or at age 65 after one year of service. actuarially reduced benefits are paid to participants whose benefits are non-forfeitable and who retire before age 65 but on or after age 55. the early retirement reduction is 50% at age 55, decreasing to 0% at age 65.
in calendar year 2022, the maximum compensation limit under a tax-qualified plan was $305,000 and the maximum annual benefit that may be accrued under a tax-qualified defined benefit plan was $245,000. to provide additional retirement benefits for key salaried employees, the company maintains a supplemental non-qualified, unfunded plan, the amended and restated key plan,
which provides retirement benefits in excess of the compensation limitations and maximum benefit accruals under tax-qualified plans. under this plan, benefits are calculated in the same manner as under the disney salaried pension plan d, including the differences in benefit determination for years before and after january 1, 2012, described above, except as follows:
•   starting on january 1, 2017, average annual compensation used for calculating benefits under the plans for any participant was capped at the greater of $1,000,000 or the participant's average annual compensation determined as of january 1, 2017; and
•   benefits for persons who were neos on january 1, 2012 are limited to the amount the executive officer would have received had the plan in effect prior to its january 1, 2012 amendment continued without change.
company employees who either transferred to the company from abc, inc. after the company's acquisition of abc or worked for a legacy abc company (e.g., espn) are also eligible to receive benefits under the disney salaried pension plan a (formerly known as the abc, inc. retirement plan) and a benefit equalization plan, which, like the amended and restated key plan, provides eligible participants retirement benefits in excess of the compensation limits and maximum benefit accruals that apply to tax-qualified plans. mr. iger received credited years of service under those plans for the years prior to the company's acquisitions of abc, inc. a term of the 1995 purchase agreement between abc, inc. and the company provides that employees transferring employment to coverage under a disney pension plan will receive an additional benefit under disney plans equal to (a) the amount the employee would receive under the disney pension plans if all of the employee's abc service were counted under the disney pension less (b) the combined benefits the employee receives under the abc plan (for service prior to the transfer) and the disney plan (for service after the transfer). mr. iger transferred from abc and mr. richardson worked for a legacy abc company and, as such, each receives a pension benefit under the disney plans to bring the employee's total benefit up to the amount the employee would have received if all the employee's years of service had been credited under the disney plans. the effect of these benefits is reflected in the present value of benefits under the disney plans in the table below.
as of the end of fiscal 2022, mr. chapek and mr. richardson were eligible for early retirement; ms. mccarthy was eligible for retirement and mr. iger had elected retirement.
fiscal 2022 pension benefits table the following table sets forth the present value of the accumulated pension benefits that each neo is eligible to receive under each of the plans described above.

these present values assume that each neo retires at age 65 (or their age on october 1, 2022, if older) for purposes of the disney salaried pension plan d and the amended and restated key plan, and age 62 (or their age on october 1, 2022, if older) for purposes of the disney salaried pension plan a and the benefit equalization plan of abc, inc. age 65 is the normal retirement age under each of the plans and is also the age at which unreduced benefits are payable, except the earliest age at which unreduced benefits are payable under the abc plans is age 62 for service years prior to 2012. the values also assume a straight life-annuity payment for an unmarried participant. participants may elect other actuarially reduced forms of payment, such as joint and survivor benefits and payment of benefits for a period certain irrespective of the death of the participant. the present values were calculated using the 5.44% discount rate assumption set forth in footnote 10 to the company's audited financial statements for fiscal 2022 and using actuarial factors including pri-2012 annuitant mortality table, projected generationally with a modified version of the mp-2019 scale for males and females. the present values reported in the table are not available as lump sum payments under the plans.
fiscal 2022 non-qualified deferred compensation table under the company's non-qualified deferred compensation plan, u.s.-based executives at the level of vice president or above may defer a portion of their compensation and applicable taxes with an opportunity to earn a tax-deferred return on the deferred amounts. the plan gives eligible executives the opportunity to defer up to 50% of their base salary and up to 100% of their annual performance-based bonus award until retirement or termination of employment or, at the executive's election, until an earlier date at least five years following the date the compensation is earned. the company also has the option to make a contribution into an executive's deferred compensation account on terms and subject to any conditions (such as vesting conditions) the company chooses. amounts in an executive's deferred account earn a return based on the executive's election among a series of mutual funds designated by the company, which are generally the same funds available under the company's qualified deferred compensation plans. returns on the funds available for the deferred account ranged from -30.55% to 0.68% for the year ended october 1, 2022.
the deferred amounts and any deemed earnings on the amounts are not actual investments and are obligations of the company. ms. mccarthy participated in this plan in fiscal 2022 and her contributions and aggregate earnings during the fiscal year and aggregate balance at the end of the fiscal year are reflected in the table below. ms. mccarthy's contributions represent deferred salary in the amount of $989,231 and bonus in the amount of $5,565,846. mr. chapek had a negative return on the year, but he did not make a contribution in fiscal 2022.
from 2000 through 2005, $500,000 per year of mr. iger's annual base salary was deferred. the interest rate is adjusted annually in march and the weighted average interest rate for fiscal 2022 was 1.118%. there were no additions during the fiscal year to the deferred amount by either the company or mr. iger other than these earnings and no withdrawals during the fiscal year. in connection with his retirement, and in order to avoid the imposition of an additional tax on mr. iger under section 409a of the internal revenue code, mr. iger was paid $4,569,183 on july 1, 2022. with this payment, mr. iger no longer has an outstanding non-qualified deferred compensation balance.
because the earnings accrued under these programs were not "above market" or preferential, these amounts are not reported in the fiscal 2022 summary compensation table. a portion of the aggregate balances at last fiscal year-end were however included in the summary compensation table since fiscal 2020, as follows:
potential payments and rights on termination or change in control our neos may receive compensation in connection with termination of their employment. this compensation is payable pursuant to (a) the terms of compensation plans applicable by their terms to all participating employees and (b) the terms of employment agreements with each of our neos. during fiscal 2022, we had employment agreements with our neos with the following end dates: june 30, 2025 for mr. chapek, june 30, 2024 for ms. mccarthy, december 31, 2024 for mr. gutierrez, june 30, 2024 for mr. richardson, june 29, 2025 for ms. schake, december 31, 2021 for mr. iger and december 31, 2024 for mr. morrell. as mr. iger retired from the company as executive chairman before fiscal year end, he was not entitled to termination payments as of october 1, 2022. in fiscal 2023, the company entered into a new employment agreement with mr. iger as chief executive officer with an end date of december 31, 2024.
in june 2022, the board agreed to extend mr. chapek's employment agreement based on mr. chapek's work navigating the company through the unprecedented challenges of the pandemic and growing the company's streaming business. the board continued to spend significant time discussing the leadership of the company in the months that followed and determined that mr. chapek was no longer the right person to serve in the ceo role. the significant developments and change in the broader macroeconomic environment over this period informed how the board viewed the appropriate leader in light of the rapidly evolving industry and market dynamics. the board therefore concluded that, as disney embarks on an increasingly complex period of industry transformation, mr. iger is best situated to lead the company while an appropriate longer-term successor is identified. on november 20, 2022 (after fiscal 2022), the board decided to exercise its right to terminate mr. chapek's employment without cause. in connection with this termination, in the event that mr. chapek successfully completes all of the terms of his post-employment consulting agreement and does not violate the terms of the employment agreement that survive his termination or the general release, mr. chapek's severance would strictly conform to the terms of his employment agreement such that he would be entitled to the following cash termination payments:
•   $6,527,397 in remaining base salary through the scheduled expiration date of his employment agreement, as amended; and
although the company made the unilateral decision to exercise its right to terminate mr. morrell's employment during fiscal 2022, mr. morrell was not entitled to termination payments during fiscal 2022. in the event that mr. morrell successfully completes all of the terms of his post-employment consulting agreement and general release, he would be entitled to the following cash based payments:
•   $2,506,849 in remaining base salary through the end of his original employment agreement term;
•   a buyout of the home mr. morrell purchased in southern california. consistent with past relocation practices for unique circumstances, a third-party vendor purchased mr. morrell's property on the company's behalf in june 2022 for the same price at which the property was originally purchased. the company will go through the sale process and realize any gains or losses on the sale of the property. in no situation will mr. morrell monetarily benefit from the sale of the property. as of october 1, 2022 and the date of the filing of this report, the property has not been sold.
the treatment of the equity awards held by mr. chapek and mr. morrell at their respective termination dates under their employment agreements is described below in the section titled "executive compensation - compensation tables - termination pursuant to company termination right other than for cause or by executive for good reason."
it is the standard practice of the compensation committee to only approve termination payments for a senior executive within the obligations of the company's plans and current employment agreements. the committee approved the termination payments and conditions for mr. morrell due to unique factors specific to his situation that involved an international move for mr. morrell and his family. this decision was made in the best interest of the company and, we believe, will mitigate further disruption to the company.
the termination provisions included in our executive officers' employment agreements serve a variety of purposes, including: providing the benefits of equity incentive plans to the executive and the executive's family in case of death or disability; defining when the executive may be terminated with cause and receive no further compensation; and clearly defining rights in the event of a termination in other circumstances. the availability, nature and amount of compensation on termination differ depending on whether employment terminates because of:
•   death or disability;
•   the company's termination of the executive pursuant to the company's termination right or the executive's decision to terminate because of action the company takes or fails to take;
•   the company's termination of the executive for cause; or
•   expiration of an employment agreement, retirement or other voluntary termination.
the compensation that each of our neos may receive under each of these termination circumstances is described below.
it is important to note that the amounts of compensation set forth in the tables below are based on the specific assumptions noted and do not predict the actual compensation that our neos would receive. actual compensation received would be a function of a number of factors that are unknowable at this time, including: the date of the executive's termination of employment; the executive's base salary at the time of termination; the executive's age and service with the company at the time of termination; and, because many elements of the compensation are performance-based pursuant to the company's compensation philosophy described in "executive compensation - compensation discussion and analysis" above, the future performance of the company.
moreover, the option and restricted stock unit acceleration amounts in case of a termination without cause or by the executive for good reason assume that these awards immediately accelerate, which is not the case in the absence of a change in control. rather, options and units continue to vest over time and in most cases are subject to the same performance measures that apply if there had been no termination. (the performance measures do not apply to vesting of restricted stock unit awards when termination is due to death or disability and the test to assure deductibility under section 162(m) does not apply if it is not necessary to preserve deductibility.)
in each of the circumstances described below, our neos are eligible to receive earned, unpaid salary through the date of termination and benefits that are unconditionally accrued as of the date of termination pursuant to policies applicable to all employees. this includes the deferred compensation and earnings on these deferred amounts as described under the "fiscal 2022 non-qualified deferred compensation table." this earned compensation is not described or quantified below because these amounts represent earned, vested benefits that are not contingent on the termination of employment, but we do describe and quantify benefits that continue beyond the date of termination that are in addition to those provided for in the applicable benefit plans. the executive's accrued benefits include the pension benefits described under "executive compensation - compensation tables - pension benefits," which become payable to all participants who have reached retirement age. because they have reached early retirement or retirement age under the plans, mr. chapek, ms. mccarthy and mr. richardson would have been eligible to receive these benefits if
their employment had terminated at the end of fiscal 2022. because the pension benefits do not differ from those described under "executive compensation - compensation tables - pension benefits" except in ways that are equally applicable to all salaried employees, the nature and amount of their pension benefits are not described or quantified below.
death and disability the employment agreement of each neo provides for payment of any unpaid bonus for any fiscal year that had been completed at the time of the executive's death or termination of employment due to disability. the amount of the bonus will be determined by the compensation committee using the same criteria used for determining a bonus as if the executive remained employed.
in addition to the compensation and rights in employment agreements, the 2011 stock incentive plan and award agreements thereunder provide that all options awarded to a participant (including the neos) become fully exercisable upon the death or disability of the participant and remain exercisable for 18 months in the case of death and 12 months in the case of disability (or 18 months in the case of participants who are eligible for immediate retirement benefits or 36 to 60 months, depending on the original grant date, in the case of participants who would at the time of termination due to disability be over 60 years of age and have at least ten years of service and where the options have been outstanding for one year at such time), and if the performance measurement has not been made at the time of death or disability, all restricted stock units awarded to the participant under the 2011 stock incentive plan will, to the extent the units had not previously been forfeited, fully vest and become payable upon the death or disability of the participant. if a performance measurement has been made at the time of death or disability with respect to restricted stock units, the restricted stock units will vest and accelerate based on the performance measurement.
the following table sets forth the value of the estimated payments and benefits each of our neos would have received under our compensation plans and their employment agreements if their employment had terminated at the close of business on the last day of fiscal 2022 as a result of death or disability. the value of option acceleration is equal to the difference between the $94.33 closing market price of shares of the company's common stock on september 30, 2022 (the last trading day in fiscal 2022) and the weighted average exercise price of options with an exercise price less than the market price times the number of shares subject to such options that would accelerate as a result of termination. the value of restricted stock unit acceleration is equal to the $94.33 closing market price of shares of the company's common stock on september 30, 2022 multiplied by the number of units that would accelerate as a result of termination, which, for pbus, is equal to the target number of units.
1   this amount is equal to the bonus awarded to the neos with respect to fiscal 2022 and set forth in the "non-equity incentive plan compensation" column of the "fiscal 2022 summary compensation table". in fiscal 2022, mr. chapek was entitled to receive compensation under the annual performance-based bonus program pursuant to his employment agreement because his termination occurred after the end of the fiscal year.
termination pursuant to company termination right other than for cause or by executive for good reason the employment agreement with each neo provides that the executive officer will receive a bonus for any fiscal year that had been completed at the time of termination of employment if the executive officer's employment is terminated by the company pursuant to the company's termination right other than for cause (as described below) or by the neo with good reason (as described below). the amount of the bonus will be determined by the compensation committee using the same criteria used for determining a bonus if the executive remained employed.
in addition, each neo's employment agreement provides that the neo will receive the following compensation and rights conditioned on the neo executing a general release of claims and agreeing to provide the company with consulting services for a period of six months after the neo's termination (or, if shorter, until the employment agreement expiration date):
•   a lump sum payment equal to the base salary the neo would have earned had the neo remained employed during the term of the neo's consulting agreement, paid six months and one day after termination.
•   if the consulting agreement was terminated other than as a result of the neo's material breach of the consulting agreement, a further lump sum payment equal to the base salary the neo would have earned had the neo remained employed after the termination of the neo's consulting agreement and until the employment agreement expiration date, paid six months and one day after termination of employment.
•   a bonus for the year in which the neo is terminated equal to a pro-rata portion of a target bonus amount determined in accordance with the employment agreement.
•   all options that had vested as of the termination date or were scheduled to vest no later than three months after the employment agreement expiration date will remain or become exercisable as though the neo were employed until that date. the options will remain exercisable until the earlier of (a) the scheduled expiration date of the options and (b) three months after the employment agreement expiration date. in addition, as is true for all employees, options awarded at least one year before termination will continue to vest and will remain exercisable until the earlier of the expiration date of the option and five years after the termination date if the officer would have attained age 60 and have completed at least ten years of service as of that date. pursuant to employment agreements with each of the neos, the termination date for these purposes will be deemed to be the employment agreement expiration date. for any employee that is eligible for immediate retirement benefits, options awarded within, but less than, one year of termination will vest to the extent they are scheduled to vest within three months of termination and will remain exercisable for 18 months following termination.
•   all restricted stock units that were scheduled to vest prior to the employment agreement expiration date will vest as though the neo were employed until that date to the extent applicable performance tests are met (but any test to assure deductibility of compensation under section 162(m) will be waived for any units scheduled to vest after the fiscal year in which the termination of employment occurs unless application of the test is necessary to preserve deductibility). as is true for all employees, restricted stock units awarded at least one year before termination will continue to vest through the end of the vesting schedule to the extent applicable performance criteria are met if the officer would be over 60 years of age and have at least ten years of service as of the termination date. pursuant to employment agreements with each of the neos, the termination date for these purposes will be deemed to be the employment agreement expiration date.
the employment agreements provide that the company has the right to terminate the neo's employment subject to payment of the foregoing compensation in its sole, absolute and unfettered discretion for any reason or no reason whatsoever. a termination for cause does not constitute an exercise of this right and would be subject to the compensation provisions described below under the section "- termination for cause."
the employment agreements provide that an neo can terminate the neo's employment for "good reason" following notice to the company within three months of the neo having actual notice of the occurrence of any of the following events (except that the company will have 30 days after receipt of the notice to cure the conduct specified in the notice):
(iv)    the assignment to the neo of duties that are materially inconsistent with the neo's position or duties or that materially impair the neo's ability to function in the neo's office;
(v)    relocation of the neo's principal office to a location that is more than 50 miles outside of the greater los angeles area; or
(vi)    a material breach of any material provision of the neo's employment agreement by the company.
an neo (or any employee holding equity awards) can also terminate for "good reason" after a change in control (as defined in the 2011 stock incentive plan) if, within 12 months following the change in control, a "triggering event" occurs and in that case the 2011 stock incentive plan provides that any outstanding options, restricted stock units, pbus or other plan awards will generally become fully vested and, in certain cases, paid to the plan participant. a "triggering event" is defined to include: (a) a termination of employment by the company other than for death, disability or "cause;" or (b) a termination of employment by the participant following a reduction in position, pay or other "constructive termination." under the 2011 stock incentive plan, "cause" has the same meaning as in the neo's employment agreement, as defined below under "- termination for cause." any such payments that become subject to the excess parachute tax rules may be reduced in certain circumstances.
each neo's employment agreement specifies that any compensation resulting from subsequent employment will not be offset against amounts described above.
the following table provides a quantification of benefits (as calculated in the following paragraph) each of the neos would have received if their employment had been terminated at the end of fiscal 2022 (under their employment agreements as in effect at that time) by the company pursuant to its termination right or by the executive with good reason.
the "option valuation" amount is (a) the difference between the $94.33 closing market price of shares of the company's common stock on september 30, 2022 and the weighted average exercise price of options with an exercise price less than the market price times (b) the number of options with in-the-money exercise prices that would become exercisable despite the termination. the "restricted stock unit valuation" amount is the $94.33 closing market price on september 30, 2022, times the target number of units that could vest. however, as described above, options do not become immediately exercisable and restricted stock units do not immediately vest (and would eventually vest only to the extent applicable performance conditions are met) absent a change in control. the actual value realized from the exercise of the options and the vesting of restricted stock units may therefore be more or less than the amount shown below depending on changes in the market price of the company's common stock and the satisfaction of applicable performance tests.

1   this amount is equal to the bonus awarded to the neos with respect to fiscal 2022 and set forth in the "non-equity incentive plan compensation" column of the "fiscal 2022 summary compensation table," plus the lump sum payments based on salary through the end of the employment term as described above.
2   while this is the payment mr. chapek would have earned had he been separated at the end of fiscal 2022, the actual cash amounts to which he is actually entitled are described under the section titled "executive compensation - compensation tables - potential payments and rights on termination or change in control" in connection with his separation. in fiscal 2022, mr. chapek was entitled to receive compensation under the annual performance-based bonus program pursuant to his employment agreement because his termination occurred after the end of the fiscal year.
3   this amount represents the estimated values that would have been ascribed to the enhanced vesting of his outstanding equity awards had mr. chapek been separated at the end of fiscal 2022. however, because these awards will continue to vest on the same basis as though mr. chapek had remained employed, the values that will actually derive will be based on the value of the underlying shares if and when they become vested or exercisable. moreover, because mr. chapek had attained age 60 and completed 10 years of service, had mr. chapek retired upon november 20, 2022, all of the equity awards taken into account in the above table, except those granted in fiscal 2022, would nonetheless have remained outstanding and eligible to vest as though he remained employed under the policies generally applicable to retirement.
termination for cause each neo's employment agreement provides that, if the neo's employment is terminated by the company for cause, the neo will only be eligible to receive the compensation earned and benefits vested through the date of such termination of employment, including any rights the neo may have under the neo's indemnification agreement with the company or the equity plans of the company.
"termination for cause" is defined in each neo's employment agreements as termination by the company due to gross negligence, gross misconduct, willful nonfeasance or willful material breach of the agreement by the executive unless, if the company determines that the conduct or cause is curable, such conduct or cause is timely cured by the neo.
expiration of employment term; retirement each of the neos is eligible to receive earned, unpaid salary and unconditionally vested accrued benefits (including continued vesting of restricted stock units and vesting and exercisability of options awarded more than one year prior to retirement if they are over 60 years of age with at least ten years of service) if the neo's employment terminates at the expiration of the neo's employment agreement or the neo otherwise retires, but except as described below, they are not contractually entitled to any additional compensation in this circumstance.
under the terms of mr. iger's employment agreement as in effect at december 31, 2021, to enable the company to have access to mr. iger's unique skills, knowledge and experience with regard to the media and entertainment business and his institutional knowledge of the company and its strategic evolution, upon his retirement, mr. iger was to serve as a consultant to the company for a period of five years. in this capacity, mr. iger would provide assistance, up to certain specified monthly and annual maximum time commitments, on such matters as his successor as chief executive officer may request from time to time. in consideration of his consulting services, mr. iger is to receive a quarterly fee of $500,000 for each of the quarters of this five-year period. for the five years following termination of employment, the company would also provide mr. iger with the same security services (other than the personal use of a company-provided or company-leased aircraft) as it has made available to him as chief executive officer. under his employment agreement entered into on november 20, 2022, upon the re-commencement of his employment, the parties' obligations in respect of these post-employment commitments are suspended and will resume to be fulfilled for the remaining term when mr. iger again terminates his employment with the company.
other neo employment agreements each provide that the chief executive officer will recommend to the compensation committee an annual cash bonus for the fiscal year in which their respective employment agreements end based on the executive's contributions during that fiscal year.
as in the case of a termination under the company's termination right other than for cause or the executive's right to terminate for good reason, vested options and restricted stock units will remain exercisable for 18 months for executives eligible to receive retirement benefits, and options and restricted stock units outstanding for at least one year will continue to vest, and options will
remain exercisable, for up to three or five years (depending on the original grant date) if the neo was age 60 or greater and had at least ten years of service at the date of retirement. in addition, under the terms of his employment agreement as in effect at december 31, 2021, the equity grants made to mr. iger in fiscal 2022 became eligible to continue to vest (and options remain exercisable) upon his retirement at december 31, 2021.
pay ratio in accordance with sec rules, we are providing the ratio of the annual total compensation of our chief executive officer to the annual total compensation of the company's median employee. the ratio is a reasonable estimate calculated in a manner consistent with sec rules and the methodology described below.
per sec rules, the company is permitted to use the same median employee as was used in fiscal 2021. however, since the median employee used for the past two years has separated from the company, we have conducted an analysis and selected a similarly situated employee. our methodology to confirm the median employee is consistent with last year. we reviewed the annual base salary of the global workforce as of the last business day of the fiscal year, october 1, 2022. due to population size, we identified a band of employees with a base salary that approximates the median base salary for the company. the median base salary reflects a workforce with large populations of seasonal, part-time and international employees working in multiple, distinct lines of business. we calculated the median employee's total annual compensation for fiscal 2022 (which consisted of an increase to base salary, overtime pay and the company's contribution to health insurance premiums) and ensured the median employee's compensation did not contain distortive compensation features (e.g., abnormal amounts of overtime, special premium pay or commissions/tips, etc.).
the median disney employee works in a full-time hourly role in parks and has been with the company for over eleven years. for fiscal 2022, the median employee's total annual compensation was $54,256. mr. chapek's total annual compensation, including the company's contribution to health insurance premiums (which are not included in the fiscal 2022 summary compensation table in this report), was $24,198,254. the ratio of these amounts was 446:1.
other compensation information risk management considerations the compensation committee believes that the following features of performance-based bonus and equity programs appropriately incentivize the creation of long-term shareholder value while discouraging behavior that could lead to excessive risk:
•   financial performance measures. the financial metrics used to determine the amount of an executive's bonus are measures the committee believes drive long-term shareholder value. the ranges set for these measures are intended to reward success without encouraging excessive risk-taking.
•   limit on bonus. the overall bonus opportunity is not expected to exceed two times the target amount, no matter how much financial performance exceeds the ranges established at the beginning of the fiscal year.
•   equity vesting periods. performance-based stock units generally vest in three years. time-based stock units and options vest annually for up to four years and options remain exercisable for ten years. these periods are designed to reward sustained performance over several periods, rather than performance in a single period.
•   equity retention guidelines. neos are required to acquire within five years of becoming an executive officer and hold as long as they are executive officers of the company, shares (including restricted stock units) having a value of at least three times their base salary amounts, or five times in the case of the chief executive officer. if these levels have not been reached, these officers are required to retain ownership of shares representing at least 75% of the net after-tax gain (100% in the case of the chief executive officer) realized on exercise of options for a minimum of twelve months.
•   no hedging or pledging. the company's insider trading compliance program prohibits members of the board of directors, neos and all other employees subject to the company's insider trading compliance program from entering into any transaction designed to hedge, or having the effect of hedging, the economic risk of owning the company's securities and prohibits certain persons, including members of the board of directors and the neos, from pledging company securities.
•   clawback policy. if the company is required to restate its financial results due to material noncompliance with financial reporting requirements under the securities laws as a result of misconduct by an executive officer, applicable law permits the company to recover incentive compensation from that executive officer (including profits realized from the sale of company securities). in such a situation, the board of directors would exercise its business judgment to determine what action it believes is appropriate.
action may include recovery or cancellation of any bonus or incentive payments made to an executive on the basis of having met or exceeded performance targets during a period of fraudulent activity or a material misstatement of financial results if the board determines that such recovery or cancellation is appropriate due to intentional misconduct by the executive officer that resulted in performance targets being achieved that would not have been achieved absent such misconduct. under the 2011 stock incentive plan approved at the company's 2020 annual meeting, equity awards pursuant to the plan may be clawed back where there is reputational or financial harm to the company, even in the absence of a restatement.
equity awards are generally approved on dates the compensation committee meets. committee meetings are normally scheduled well in advance and are not scheduled with an eye to announcements of material information regarding the company. the committee may make an award with an effective date in the future, including awards contingent on commencement of employment, execution of a new employment agreement or some other subsequent event, or may act by unanimous written consent on the date of such an event when the proposed issuances have been reviewed by the committee prior to the date of the event.
at the compensation committee's request, management conducted its annual assessment of the risk profile of our compensation programs in december 2022. the assessment included an inventory of the compensation programs at each of the company's segments and an evaluation of whether any program contained elements that created risks that could have a material adverse impact on the company. management provided the results of this assessment to pay governance llc, the committee's compensation consultant, which evaluated the findings and reviewed them with the committee. as a result of this review, the committee determined that the risks arising from the company's policies and practices are not reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on the company.
peer groups summary of peer groups the following graph summarizes the three distinct peer groups we use for three distinct purposes and the companies that met these criteria and were included at the beginning of fiscal 2022, described in more detail below:
• alphabet, inc. • amazon.com, inc. • apple, inc. • at&amp;t inc. • charter communications, inc. • cisco systems • comcast corporation • ibm corporation • intel • meta platforms, inc. • microsoft corporation • netflix, inc. • oracle corporation • paramount global • verizon communications inc. • warner bros. discovery, inc.1                                                                                                                                                                                                                media industry peers
1 in april 2022, discovery inc. completed its acquisition of the warnermedia assets from at&amp;t and became warner bros. discovery, inc.
media industry peers the media industry peer group helps evaluate compensation levels for the neos. the compensation committee believes that there is a limited pool of talent with the set of creative and organizational skills needed to run a global creative organization like the company. the committee also understands that executives with the background needed to manage a company such as ours have career options with compensation opportunities that normally exceed those available in most other industries, and that compensation levels within the peer group are driven by the dynamics of compensation in the entertainment industry and not the ownership structure of a particular company. accordingly, the market for executive talent to lead the company, and the group against which to compare our executive compensation, is best represented by the companies in our media industry peer group.
general industry peers the general industry peer group helps evaluate general compensation structure, policies and practices. the compensation committee believes that the features of the company's overall compensation structure, policies and practices should normally be consistent for all executives. because our operations span multiple industries, the committee believes that a consistent approach across the breadth of the company's operations with respect to features of our overall executive compensation structure is best achieved by reference to a group of general industry peers that is broader than the media industry peers.
the peer group used for establishing compensation structure, policies and practices consists of companies that have:
•   a consumer orientation and/or strong brand recognition;
•   as a general matter, a market capitalization in the range of approximately one-quarter to four times our market capitalization.
additionally, the general industry peer group includes companies that do not meet the revenue or market cap test, but that are included in the peer groups used by one or more of the media industry peers.
performance peers the performance peers help evaluate relative economic performance of the company. the overall financial performance of the company is driven by the company's diverse businesses, which compete in multiple sectors of the overall market. the compensation committee believes that, given the span of the company's businesses, the best measure of relative performance is how the company's diverse businesses have fared in the face of the economic trends that impact companies in the overall market and that the best benchmark for measuring such success is the company's relative performance compared to that of the companies comprising the s&p 500. accordingly, the committee has selected the s&p 500 to set the context for evaluating the company's performance and to measure relative performance for pbu awards.
changes for fiscal 2023
advised by its independent compensation consultant, the compensation committee reviewed the criteria for selecting members of the company's peer groups during fiscal 2022 and made the following changes for fiscal 2023:
•   with at&amp;t's divestiture of its media assets, the company moved at&amp;t from the media industry peer group to the general industry peer group.
•   given their primary focus on it hardware/semiconductors more strongly oriented toward business-to-business sales, the committee removed cisco and intel from the general industry peer group.
•   as it reflects a prominent global brand with strong consumer orientation and a broadening focus on digital sales and applications, the committee added nike, inc. to the general industry peer group.
the committee will continue to monitor the competitive landscapes in which the company's various business units operate and implement changes to the peer group as it deems appropriate.
deductibility of compensation for taxable years commencing after 2017, section 162(m) of the internal revenue code generally disallows a tax deduction to public corporations for compensation over $1 million paid to any person whose compensation was required to be included in this report for any fiscal year after 2016 because such person was either the company's chief executive officer or chief financial officer or was one of the company's three other most highly compensated executive officers for such fiscal year. accordingly, to the extent that compensation in excess of $1 million is payable to any such person in any fiscal year after fiscal 2018, such excess amount is likely to be non-deductible by the company for federal income tax purposes. however, section 162(m) exempts qualifying performance-based compensation paid after fiscal 2018 pursuant to a binding written agreement in effect on november 2, 2017. thus, performance-based awards that were outstanding on that date or awarded thereafter pursuant to a binding written agreement can be exempt from the deduction limit if applicable requirements are met. for fiscal 2022, none of the executive officers served under employment agreements that were in place without amendment prior to november 2, 2017.
however, awards to executive officers under the annual performance-based bonus program and the long-term incentive program that were (i) granted prior to november 2, 2017, or (ii) may continue to qualify for the exemption because they were granted pursuant to a binding written agreement in effect on such date, have been or will be made payable or vest subject to achievement of a performance test based on adjusted net income in order to qualify for the exemption from section 162(m), to the extent available. if this test is satisfied, the additional performance tests described in the compensation discussion and analysis are applied to determine the actual payout of such bonuses and awards, which in order to remain deductible may not be more than the maximum level funded based on achievement of the section 162(m) test. adjusted net income means net income adjusted, as appropriate, to exclude the following items or variances: change in accounting principles; acquisitions; dispositions of a business; asset impairments; restructuring
charges; extraordinary, unusual or infrequent items; and extraordinary litigation costs and insurance recoveries. for fiscal 2022, the adjusted net income target was $2.5 billion and the company achieved adjusted net income of $6.4 billion. net income was adjusted to account for transaction purchase accounting, restructuring and impairment charges, gain on sale of equity investments and litigation settlement.

pursuant to the corporate governance guidelines, the board undertook its annual review of director independence in november 2022. during this review, the board considered transactions and relationships between the company and its subsidiaries and affiliates on the one hand, and on the other hand, directors, immediate family members of directors or entities of which a director or an immediate family member is an executive officer, general partner or significant equity holder. the board also considered whether there were any transactions or relationships between any of these persons or entities and the company's executive officers or their affiliates. as provided in the corporate governance guidelines, the purpose of this review was to determine whether any such relationships or transactions existed that were inconsistent with a determination that the director is independent.
as a result of this review, the board affirmatively determined that all of the directors serving in fiscal 2022 or nominated for election at the 2023 annual meeting are independent of the company and its management under the standards set forth in the corporate governance guidelines, with the exception of mr. iger and mr. chapek, neither of which is considered independent because of employment as a senior executive of the company. additionally, mr. chapek's son provided producer services to the company in fiscal 2022, as discussed under the section titled "certain relationships and related person transactions" above.

in february 2022, the fca published a portfolio letter on its cra supervision strategy. among other things, the fca explained that it takes a holistic approach to supervising cras. this means that if a cra or the group to which it belongs also carries on unregulated activities (for example, esg ratings), the fca may assess these unregulated activities as part of its supervision of regulated activities. cras need to be able to demonstrate that they have considered, and are actively managing, potential risks from any unregulated activities. the fca also identified its supervisory priorities for cras, which consist of: ratings process and methodologies; governance and oversight; market and perimeter risks; and operational resilience and resourcing. the fca also identified some other priority areas where it will be carrying out work relevant to cras, including a market study on accessing and using wholesale data and ongoing work on esg ratings.

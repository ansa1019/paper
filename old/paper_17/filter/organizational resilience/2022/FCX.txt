in addition, as part of our commitment to enhancing our resilience to climate change risks as well as our commitment to implement the tailings standard, we will be required to consider uncertainties as a result of climate change, incorporate that assessment into the relevant knowledge base for our tailings facilities, use this knowledge base to enhance the resilience of our approach to the impacts of climate change using an adaptive management approach, incorporate that knowledge into facility operations, and take measures to mitigate both environmental impact and potential failure risks at our active and inactive tailings facilities, including those arising from climate change. these obligations will likely require future changes at our tailings facilities, which could increase our operational expenses or require further capital investments. for further discussion of potential physical impacts of climate change see the related risk factor below.
2021 climate report . in september 2022, we published our updated climate report which details our ongoing initiatives to reduce our greenhouse gas (ghg) emissions, improve energy efficiency, evaluate and integrate the use of lower carbon and renewable energy sources and enhance our resilience to future climate-related risks. we continue to advance ghg emissions reduction initiatives across our global operations and established our 2030 ghg reduction targets that collectively cover nearly 100% of our scope 1 and 2 ghg emissions. refer to item 1a. "risk factors" contained in part i of our annual report on form 10-k for the year ended december 31, 2022, for further discussion of climate-related risks.

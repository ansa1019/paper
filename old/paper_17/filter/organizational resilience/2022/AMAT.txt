item 1a:      risk factors the following risk factors could materially and adversely affect applied's business, financial condition or results of operations and cause reputational harm, and should be carefully considered in evaluating the company and its business, in addition to other information presented elsewhere in this report.
business and industry risks the industries that applied serves can be volatile and difficult to predict.
as a supplier to the global semiconductor and display and related industries, applied is subject to variable industry conditions, since demand for manufacturing equipment and services can change depending on several factors, including the nature and timing of technology inflections and advances in fabrication processes, the timing and requirements of new and emerging technologies and market drivers, production capacity relative to demand for chips and display technologies, end-user demand, customers' capacity utilization, production volumes, access to affordable capital, consumer buying patterns and general economic and political conditions. applied's industries historically have been cyclical, and are subject to volatility and sudden changes in customer requirements for new manufacturing capacity and advanced technology. these changes can affect the timing and amounts of customer investments in technology and manufacturing equipment and can have a significant impact on applied's net sales, operating expenses, gross margins and net income. the amount and mix of capital equipment spending between different products and technologies can have a significant impact on applied's results of operations.
to meet rapidly changing demand in the industries it serves, applied must accurately forecast demand and effectively manage its resources and production capacity across its businesses, and may incur unexpected or additional costs to align its business operations. during periods of increasing demand for its products, applied must have sufficient manufacturing capacity and inventory to meet customer demand; effectively manage its supply chain; attract, retain and motivate a sufficient number of qualified employees; and continue to control costs. during periods of decreasing demand, applied must reduce costs and align its cost structure with prevailing market conditions; effectively manage its supply chain; and motivate and retain key employees. if applied does not effectively manage these challenges during periods of changing demand, its business performance and results of operations may be adversely impacted. even with effective allocation of resources and management of costs, during periods of decreasing demand, applied's gross margins, cash flows and earnings may be adversely impacted.
applied is exposed to risks associated with an uncertain global economy.
uncertain or adverse economic and business conditions, including uncertainties and volatility in the financial markets, national debt, fiscal or monetary concerns, rising inflation and interest rates in various regions, and economic recession, could materially adversely impact applied's operating results. markets for semiconductors and displays depend largely on business and consumer spending and demand for electronic products. uncertain or adverse economic and business conditions could result in decreases in consumer spending and demand. such decreases in spending and demand have in the past caused, and may in the future cause, our customers to push out, cancel or refrain from purchasing our equipment or services, which could negatively impact demand for our products and services, reduce our backlog, increase our inventory, and materially adversely impact our operating results.
similarly, changes that result in sudden increases in consumer demand for electronic products have resulted in, and may continue to result in, a shortage of parts and materials needed to manufacture our products. such shortages, as well as shipment delays due to transportation capacity and interruptions, have adversely impacted, and may continue to adversely impact, our suppliers' ability to meet our demand requirements. accelerated digital transformation may further increase consumer demand and exacerbate such shortages and also strain our manufacturing capacity, which may adversely impact our ability to meet customer demands and thus have an adverse impact on our revenues, results of operations and financial condition.
uncertain or adverse economic and market conditions, difficulties in obtaining capital, increased costs or reduced profitability may also cause some customers to scale back operations, exit businesses, merge with other manufacturers, or file for bankruptcy protection and potentially cease operations, which can also result in lower sales, additional inventory or bad debt expense for applied. economic and industry uncertainty may similarly affect suppliers, which could impair their ability to deliver parts and negatively affect applied's ability to manage operations and deliver its products. these conditions may also lead to consolidation or strategic alliances among other equipment manufacturers, which could adversely affect applied's ability to compete effectively.
uncertain economic and industry conditions and continued supply chain disruptions also make it more challenging for applied to forecast its operating results, make business decisions, and identify and prioritize the risks that may affect its businesses, sources and uses of cash, financial condition and results of operations. if applied does not appropriately manage its business operations in response to changing economic and industry conditions, it could have a significant negative impact on its business performance and financial condition. applied may be required to implement additional cost reduction efforts, including restructuring activities, which may adversely affect applied's ability to capitalize on opportunities. even during periods of economic uncertainty or lower revenues, applied must continue to invest in research and development and maintain a global business infrastructure to compete effectively and support its customers, which can have a negative impact on its operating margins and earnings.
applied maintains an investment portfolio that is subject to general credit, liquidity, market and interest rate risks. the risks to applied's investment portfolio may be exacerbated if financial market conditions deteriorate due to rising inflation, rising interest rates, economic recession or impacts of the covid-19 pandemic and, as a result, the value and liquidity of the investment portfolio, as well as returns on pension assets, could be negatively impacted and lead to impairment charges. applied also maintains cash balances in various bank accounts globally in order to fund normal operations. if any of these financial institutions becomes insolvent, it could limit applied's ability to access cash in the affected accounts, which could affect its ability to manage its operations.
applied is exposed to the risks of operating a global business.
applied has product development, engineering, manufacturing, sales and other operations distributed throughout many countries, and some of its business activities are concentrated in certain geographic areas. moreover, in fiscal 2022, approximately 88% of applied's net sales were to customers in regions outside the united states. as a result of the global nature of its operations, applied's business performance and results of operations may be adversely affected by a number of factors, including:
•uncertain global economic and political business conditions and demands;
•global trade issues and changes in and uncertainties with respect to trade and export regulations, trade policies and sanctions, tariffs, and international trade disputes, including new and changing export regulations for certain exports to china and any retaliatory measures;
•positions taken by governmental agencies regarding possible national, commercial and/or security issues posed by the development, sale or export of certain products and technologies;
•political instability, natural disasters, regional or global health epidemics, social unrest, terrorism, acts of war or other geopolitical turmoil, or cybersecurity incidents in locations where applied has operations, suppliers or sales, or that may influence the value chain of the industries that applied serves;
•political and social attitudes, laws, rules, regulations and policies within countries that favor domestic companies over non-domestic companies, including customer- or government-supported efforts to promote the development and growth of local competitors;
•customer- or government-supported efforts to influence applied to conduct more or less of its operations and sourcing in a particular country;
•variations among, and changes in, local, regional, national or international laws and regulations, including contract, intellectual property, cybersecurity, data privacy, labor, tax, and import/export laws, and the interpretation and application of such laws and regulations;
•ineffective or inadequate legal protection of intellectual property rights in certain countries;
•the availability or increasing costs of raw material, commodity, energy and shipping or volatility in such costs;
•geographically diverse operations and projects, and our ability to maintain appropriate business processes, procedures and internal controls, and comply with environmental, health and safety, anti-corruption and other regulatory requirements;
•failure to effectively manage a diverse workforce with different experience levels, languages, cultures, customs, business practices and worker expectations, and differing employment practices and labor issues;
•variations in the ability to develop relationships with local customers, suppliers and governments;
•fluctuations in interest rates and currency exchange rates, including the relative strength or weakness of the u.s. dollar against the japanese yen, israeli shekel, euro, taiwanese dollar, singapore dollar, chinese yuan or korean won;
•the need to provide sufficient levels of technical support in different locations around the world;
•performance of third-party providers of outsourced functions, including certain engineering, software development, manufacturing, information technology and other activities;
•service interruptions from utilities, transportation, data hosting or telecommunications providers, or other events beyond our control;
•impacts of climate change on the operations of applied, its customers and suppliers;
•challenges in hiring and integration of an increasing number of workers in new countries;
•uncertainties with respect to economic growth rates in various countries, including for the manufacture and sale of semiconductors and displays in the developing economies of certain countries.
global trade issues and changes in and uncertainties with respect to trade policies and export regulations, including import and export license requirements, trade sanctions, tariffs and international trade disputes, have adversely impacted and could further adversely impact our business and operations, and reduce the competitiveness of our products relative to local and global competitors.
we sell a significant majority of our products into jurisdictions outside of the united states including china, taiwan, japan and korea. we also purchase a significant portion of equipment and supplies from suppliers outside of the united states. there is inherent risk, based on the complex relationships among the united states and the countries in which we conduct our business, that political, diplomatic, and national security factors can lead to global trade issues and changes in trade policies and export regulations, in particular, with respect to those affecting the semiconductor industry. the united states and other countries have imposed and may continue to impose new trade restrictions and export regulations, and have also levied tariffs and taxes on certain goods. trade restrictions and export regulations, or increases in tariffs and additional taxes, including any retaliatory measures, can negatively impact end-user demand and customer investment in manufacturing equipment, increase our manufacturing costs, decrease margins, reduce the competitiveness of our products, or prohibit our ability to sell products, provide services or purchase necessary equipment and supplies, any or all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition.
for example, certain international sales depend on our ability to obtain export licenses, and our inability to obtain such licenses has limited and could further limit our markets and negatively impact our business. the u.s. government recently announced new export regulations for u.s. semiconductor technology sold in china, including wafer fabrication equipment and related parts and services, which have limited the market for certain of our products, adversely impacted our revenues, and increased our exposure to foreign competition. the u.s. department of commerce has promulgated rules and regulations expanding export license requirements for u.s. companies that sell certain products to entities in china whose actions or functions are intended to support military end uses, eliminated certain export license exceptions that applied to exports of certain items to china, added certain chinese companies to its "entity list" and "unverified list," making those companies subject to additional licensing requirements, and expanded licensing requirements for exports to china of items for use in the development or production of integrated circuits and certain technologies. these rules and regulations require us to obtain additional export licenses to supply certain of our products or provide services to certain customers in china. obtaining export licenses may be difficult, costly and time-consuming, and there is no assurance that we will be issued licenses that we apply for on a timely basis or at all. our inability to obtain such licenses could limit our markets in china, may cause us to be displaced by foreign businesses and competitors and adversely affect our results of operations. the implementation and interpretation of these rules and other regulatory actions taken by the u.s. government is uncertain and evolving, and may make it more challenging for applied to manage its operations and forecast its operating results. the u.s. and other governmental agencies may in the future promulgate new or additional export licensing or other requirements that have the effect of further limiting the company's ability to provide certain of its products and services to customers outside the u.s., including china. these and other regulatory changes that may occur in the future could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition.
as a global business with customers, suppliers and operations in many countries around the world, applied may from time to time receive inquiries from government authorities about transactions between applied and certain foreign entities. for example, in august 2022, applied received a subpoena from the u.s. attorney's office for the district of massachusetts requesting information relating to certain china customer shipments. we are cooperating fully with the government. these inquiries are subject to uncertainties, and we cannot predict the outcome of this inquiry, or any other governmental inquires or proceedings that may occur. any violation or alleged violation of law or regulations could result in significant legal costs or in legal proceedings in which applied or its employees could be subjected to fines and penalties and could result in restrictions on applied's business and damage to its reputation, and could have an adverse impact on its business operations, financial condition and results of operations.
furthermore, government authorities may take retaliatory actions, impose conditions that require the use of local suppliers or partnerships with local companies, require the license or other transfer of intellectual property, or engage in other efforts to promote local businesses and local competitors, which could have a significant adverse impact on applied's business. many of these challenges are present in china and korea, markets that represent a significant portion of applied's business.
applied is exposed to risks associated with a highly concentrated customer base.
applied's customer base is highly concentrated and has become increasingly so as a result of continued consolidation. applied's customer base is also geographically concentrated, particularly in china, taiwan and korea. a relatively limited number of manufacturers account for a substantial portion of applied's business. as a result, the actions of even a single customer or export regulations that apply to customers in certain countries, such as those in china, have exposed and can further expose applied's business and results of operations to greater volatility. the geographic concentration of applied's customer base could shift over time as a result of government policy and incentives to develop regional semiconductor industries. the mix and type of customers, and sales to any single customer, including as a result of changes in government policy, have varied and may vary significantly from quarter to quarter and from year to year, and have had, and may continue to have, a significant impact on applied's net sales, gross margins and net income. applied's products are configured to customer specifications, and changing, rescheduling or canceling orders may result in significant, non-recoverable costs. if customers do not place orders, or they substantially reduce, delay or cancel orders (including as a result of uncertain or adverse economic conditions, our inability to fulfill orders due to export regulations, shortage of parts, transportation capacity/interruptions or any other reason), applied may not be able to replace the business, which may have a significant adverse impact on its results of operations and financial condition. the concentration of applied's customer base increases its risks related to the financial condition of its customers, and the deterioration in financial condition of a single customer or the failure of a single customer to perform its obligations could have a material adverse effect on applied's results of operations and cash flow. to the extent its customers experience liquidity constraints, applied may incur bad debt expense, which may have a significant impact on its results of operations. major customers may also seek pricing, payment, intellectual property-related, or other commercial terms that are less favorable to applied, which may have a negative impact on applied's business, cash flow, revenue and gross margins.
supply chain disruptions, manufacturing interruptions or delays, or the failure to accurately forecast customer demand, could affect applied's ability to meet customer demand, lead to higher costs, or result in excess or obsolete inventory.
applied's business depends on its timely supply of equipment, services and related products to meet the changing technical and volume requirements of its customers, which depends in part on the timely delivery of parts, materials and services, including components and subassemblies, from suppliers and contract manufacturers. significant and sudden increases in demand for applied's products, as well as worldwide demand for electronic products, have resulted in, and may continue to result in, a shortage of parts, materials and services needed to manufacture applied's products. such shortages, as well as delays in and unpredictability of shipments due to transportation interruptions, have adversely impacted, and may continue to adversely impact, our suppliers' ability to meet our demand requirements. difficulties in obtaining sufficient and timely supply of parts, materials or services, and delays in and unpredictability of shipments due to transportation interruptions, have adversely impacted, and may continue to adversely impact, applied's manufacturing operations and its ability to meet customer demand. moreover, lockdowns that may from time to time be imposed in various geographic regions in response to periodic spikes in covid-19 cases and related travel and logistics restrictions may result in additional supply chain and transportation disruptions, production delays, capacity limitations and cost increases. our operating results may be adversely impacted if we are unable to obtain parts, materials or services needed to manufacture applied's products, or if we are unable to do so on a timely manner or on favorable terms. ongoing supply chain constraints may continue to increase costs of logistics and parts for our products and may cause us to pass on increased costs to our customers. such increase in costs may lead to reduced demand for our products and materially adversely impact our operating results. some key parts are subject to long lead-times or available only from a single supplier or limited group of suppliers, and some sourcing or subassembly is provided by suppliers located in countries other than the countries where applied conducts its manufacturing. supply chain disruptions have caused and may continue to cause delays in our equipment production and delivery schedules, which can lead to our business performance becoming significantly dependent on quarter-end production and delivery schedules, and could have an adverse impact on our operating and financial results. volatility of demand for manufacturing equipment can also increase capital, technical, operational and other risks for applied and for companies throughout its supply chain, and may cause some suppliers to exit businesses, or scale back or cease operations, which could impact our ability to meet customer demand.
applied may also experience significant interruptions of its manufacturing operations, delays in its ability to deliver or install products or services, increased costs, customer order cancellations or reduced demand for its products as a result of:
•global trade issues and changes in and uncertainties with respect to trade and export regulations, trade policies and sanctions, tariffs, and international trade disputes, including new and changing export regulations for certain exports to china, where a significant portion of applied's supply chain is located, and any retaliatory measures, that adversely impact applied or its direct or sub-tier suppliers;
•the failure or inability to accurately forecast demand and obtain sufficient quantities of quality parts on a cost-effective basis;
•volatility in the availability and cost of parts, commodities, energy and shipping related to our products, including increased costs due to rising inflation or interest rates or other market conditions;
•shipment delays due to transportation interruptions or capacity constraints;
•a worldwide shortage of semiconductor components as a result of sharp increases in demand for semiconductor products in general;
•information technology or infrastructure failures, including those of a third party supplier or service provider; and
•natural disasters, the impacts of climate change, or other events beyond applied's control (such as earthquakes, utility interruptions, tsunamis, hurricanes, typhoons, floods, storms or extreme weather conditions, fires, regional economic downturns, regional or global health epidemics, including the covid-19 pandemic, geopolitical turmoil, increased trade restrictions between the u.s. and china and other countries, social unrest, political instability, terrorism, or acts of war) in locations where it or its customers or suppliers have manufacturing, research, engineering or other operations.
if a supplier fails to meet applied's requirements concerning quality, cost, intellectual property protection, socially-responsible business practices, or other performance factors, applied may transfer its business to alternative sources. transferring business to alternative suppliers could result in manufacturing delays, additional costs or other difficulties, and may impair applied's ability to protect, enforce and extract the full value of its intellectual property rights, as well as the intellectual property rights of its customers' and other third parties. these outcomes could have an adverse impact on its business and competitive position and subject applied to legal proceedings and claims. in addition, if applied is unable to meet its customers' demand for a prolonged period due to its inability to obtain certain parts or components from suppliers on a timely basis or at all, its business, results of operations and customer relationships could be adversely impacted.
in addition, if applied needs to rapidly increase its business and manufacturing capacity to meet increases in demand or expedited shipment schedules, this may strain applied's manufacturing and supply chain operations, and negatively impact applied's working capital. moreover, if actual demand for applied's products is different than expected, applied may purchase more or fewer parts than necessary or incur costs for canceling, postponing or expediting delivery of parts. if applied purchases or commits to purchase inventory in anticipation of customer demand that does not materialize, or such inventory is rendered obsolete by the rapid pace of technological change, or if customers reduce, delay or cancel orders, applied may incur excess or obsolete inventory charges.
the continued effects of the covid-19 pandemic and global measures taken in response have adversely impacted, and may continue to adversely impact, applied's operations and financial results.
the continued effects of the covid-19 pandemic and measures taken in response by governments and businesses worldwide to contain its spread have adversely impacted and may continue to adversely impact applied's supply chain, manufacturing, logistics, workforce and operations, as well as the operations of applied's customers, suppliers and partners globally. there is continued uncertainty regarding the duration, scope and severity of the pandemic, particularly with the emergence of new variants of covid-19 and periodic spikes in covid-19 cases in various geographic regions, and the impacts on our business and the global economy from the effects of the pandemic and response measures. travel and logistics restrictions, lockdowns, vaccine requirements and other measures from time to time implemented by foreign and domestic authorities have resulted in, and may continue to result in, supply chain and transportation disruptions, production delays and capacity limitations at applied and some of its customers, suppliers and partners, as well as reduced workforce availability or productivity at applied and customer sites, and additional data, information and cyber security risks associated with an extensive workforce working remotely.
as economic activity and business operations in certain regions recover, there have been and may continue to be periods of significant or sudden increases in demand for applied's products, as well as worldwide demand for electronic products. significant or sudden demand increases have resulted in, and may continue to result in, a shortage of parts, materials or services needed to manufacture applied's products. we have also experienced, and may continue to experience, shipment delays due to transportation interruptions or capacity constraints. such shortages or delays have adversely impacted, and could continue to adversely impact, our suppliers' ability to meet our demand requirements and do so on favorable terms, and our ability to meet our customer demand. there can be no assurance that applied or its suppliers will be able to maintain manufacturing operations at levels necessary to adequately address demand for applied products. in addition, the pandemic and measures taken in response thereto have had, and may continue to have, a significant adverse impact on the global economic activity and could also result in a reduced demand for our products, delayed deliveries or installation, cancelled orders or increase in logistics and operating costs, and materially and adversely affect applied's business, financial condition and results of operations.
the degree to which the pandemic ultimately impacts applied's business, financial condition and results of operations and the global economy will depend on future developments beyond our control, which are highly uncertain and difficult to predict, including the severity, duration and any resurgence of the pandemic, the extent, duration and effectiveness of periodic lockdowns and other containment actions, the availability, public adoption and efficacy of covid vaccines, how quickly and to what extent normal economic and operating activity can resume, and the severity and duration of resulting global economic volatility.
applied is exposed to risks as a result of ongoing changes in the various industries in which it operates.
the global semiconductor, display and related industries in which applied operates are characterized by ongoing changes affecting some or all of these industries that impact demand for and the profitability of applied's products and its consolidated results of operations, including:
•the nature, timing and degree of visibility of changes in end demand for electronic products, including those related to fluctuations in consumer buying patterns tied to general economic conditions, seasonality or the introduction of new products, and the effects of these changes on customers' businesses and on demand for applied's products;
•increasing capital requirements for building and operating new fabrication plants and customers' ability to raise the necessary capital;
•trade, regulatory, tax or government incentive policies impacting the timing of customers' investment in new or expanded fabrication plants;
•differences in growth rates among the semiconductor, display and other industries in which applied operates;
•the increasing importance of establishing, improving and maintaining strong relationships with customers;
•the increasing cost and complexity for customers to move from product design to volume manufacturing, which may slow the adoption rate of new manufacturing technology;
•the need for customers to continually reduce the total cost of manufacturing system ownership;
•the heightened importance to customers of system reliability and productivity and the effect on demand for fabrication systems as a result of their increasing productivity, device yield and reliability;
•manufacturers' ability to reconfigure and re-use fabrication systems which can reduce demand for new equipment;
•the increasing importance of, and difficulties in, developing products with sufficient differentiation to influence customers' purchasing decisions;
•requirements for shorter cycle times for the development, manufacture and installation of manufacturing equipment;
•price and performance trends for semiconductor devices and displays, and the corresponding effect on demand for such products;
•the increasing importance of the availability of spare parts to maximize the time that customers' systems are available for production;
•the increasing role for and complexity of software in applied products; and
•the increasing focus on reducing energy usage and improving the environmental impact and sustainability associated with manufacturing operations.
applied is exposed to risks as a result of ongoing changes specific to the semiconductor industry.
the largest proportion of applied's consolidated net sales and profitability is derived from sales of manufacturing equipment in the semiconductor systems segment to the global semiconductor industry. in addition, a majority of the revenues of applied global services is from sales to semiconductor manufacturers. the semiconductor industry is characterized by ongoing changes particular to this industry that impact demand for and the profitability of applied's semiconductor manufacturing equipment and service products, including:
•the increasing frequency and complexity of technology transitions and inflections, and applied's ability to timely and effectively anticipate and adapt to these changes;
•the increasing cost of research and development due to many factors, including shrinking geometries, the use of new materials, new and more complex device structures, more applications and process steps, increasing chip design costs, and the increasing cost and complexity of integrated manufacturing processes;
•the need to reduce product development time, despite the increasing difficulty of technical challenges;
•the growing number of types and varieties of semiconductors and number of applications across multiple substrate sizes;
•the increasing cost and complexity for semiconductor manufacturers to move more technically advanced capability and smaller geometries to volume manufacturing, and the resulting impact on the rates of technology transition and investment in capital equipment;
•challenges in generating organic growth given semiconductor manufacturers' levels of capital expenditures and the allocation of capital investment to market segments that applied does not serve, such as lithography, or segments where applied's products have lower relative market presence;
•customer investment in semiconductor manufacturing capabilities in china, which has been affected by changes in economic conditions and governmental regulations, including trade policies and export regulations;
•the importance of increasing market positions in segments with growing demand;
•semiconductor manufacturer's ability to reconfigure and re-use equipment, resulting in diminished need to purchase new equipment and services from us, and challenges in providing parts for reused equipment;
•shorter cycle times between order placements by customers and product shipment require greater reliance on forecasting of customer investment, which may lead to inventory write-offs and manufacturing inefficiencies that decrease gross margin;
•competitive factors that make it difficult to enhance position, including challenges in securing development-tool-of-record (dtor) and production-tool-of-record (ptor) positions with customers;
•shifts in sourcing strategies by computer and electronics companies, and manufacturing processes for advanced circuit technologies, that impact the equipment requirements of applied's foundry customers;
•the concentration of new wafer starts in korea and taiwan, where applied's service penetration and service-revenue-per-wafer-start have been lower than in other regions;
•the increasing fragmentation of semiconductor markets, leading certain markets to become too small to support the cost of a new fabrication plant, while others require less technologically advanced products; and
•the growing importance of specialty markets (such as internet of things, communications, automotive, power and sensors) that use mature process technologies and have a low barrier to entry.
if applied does not accurately forecast and allocate appropriate resources and investment towards addressing key technology changes and inflections, successfully develop and commercialize products to meet demand for new technologies, and effectively address industry trends, its business and results of operations may be adversely impacted.
applied is exposed to risks as a result of ongoing changes specific to the display industry.
the global display industry historically has experienced considerable volatility in capital equipment investment levels, due in part to the limited number of display manufacturers, the concentrated nature of end-use applications, production capacity relative to end-use demand, and panel manufacturer profitability. industry growth depends primarily on consumer demand for increasingly larger and more advanced tvs, and on demand for advanced smartphones and mobile device displays, which demand is highly sensitive to cost and improvements in technologies and features. the display industry is characterized by ongoing changes particular to this industry that impact demand for and the profitability of applied's display products and services, including:
•the importance of new types of display technologies, such as organic light-emitting diode (oled), low temperature polysilicon (ltps) and metal oxide transistor backplanes, flexible displays, and new touch panel films;
•the increasing cost of research and development, and complexity of technology transitions and inflections, and applied's ability to timely and effectively anticipate and adapt to these changes;
•the timing and extent of an expansion of manufacturing facilities in china, which may be affected by changes in economic conditions and governmental regulations, including trade policies and export regulations;
•the importance of increasing market positions in products and technologies with growing demand;
•the rate of transition to larger substrate sizes for tvs and to new display technologies for tvs, information technology products and mobile applications, and the resulting effect on capital intensity in the industry and on applied's product differentiation, gross margin and return on investment; and
•fluctuations in customer spending quarter over quarter and year over year for display manufacturing equipment, concentration of display manufacturer customers and their ability to successfully commercialize new products and technologies, and uncertainty with respect to future display technology end-use applications and growth drivers.
if applied does not successfully develop and commercialize products to meet demand for new and emerging display technologies, or if industry demand for display manufacturing equipment and technologies slows, applied's business and its results of operations may be adversely impacted.
the industries in which applied operates are highly competitive and subject to rapid technological and market changes.
applied operates in a highly competitive environment in which innovation is critical, and its future success depends on many factors, including the development of new technologies and effective commercialization and customer acceptance of its equipment, services and related products, and its ability to increase its position in its current markets, expand into adjacent and new markets, and optimize operational performance. the development, introduction and support of a broadening set of products in a geographically diverse and competitive environment, and that may require greater collaboration with customers and other industry participants, have grown more complex and expensive over time. furthermore, new or improved products may entail higher costs, longer development cycles, lower profits and may have unforeseen product design or manufacturing defects. to compete successfully, applied must:
•identify and address technology inflections, market changes, competitor innovations, new applications, customer requirements and end-use demand in a timely and effective manner;
•develop new products and disruptive technologies, improve and develop new applications for existing products, and adapt products for use by customers in different applications and markets with varying technical requirements;
•differentiate its products from those of competitors, meet customers' performance specifications (including those related to energy consumption and environmental impact more broadly), appropriately price products, and achieve market acceptance;
•maintain operating flexibility to enable responses to changing markets, applications, customers and customer requirements;
•enhance its worldwide operations across its businesses to reduce cycle time, enable continuous quality improvement, reduce costs, and enhance design for manufacturability and serviceability;
•focus on product development and sales and marketing strategies that address customers' high value problems and strengthen customer relationships;
•effectively allocate resources between its existing products and markets, the development of new products, and expanding into new and adjacent markets;
•improve the productivity of capital invested in r&d activities;
•improve its manufacturing processes and achieve cost efficiencies across product offerings;
•adapt to changes in value offered by companies in different parts of the supply chain;
•qualify products for evaluation and volume manufacturing with its customers; and
•implement changes in its design engineering methodology to reduce material costs and cycle time, increase commonality of platforms and types of parts used in different systems, and improve product life cycle management.
if applied does not successfully anticipate technology inflections, develop and commercialize new products and technologies, and respond to changes in customer requirements and market trends, its business performance and results of operations may be adversely impacted.
applied is exposed to risks associated with expanding into new and related markets and industries.
as part of its growth strategy, applied seeks to expand into related or new markets and industries, either with its existing products or with new products developed internally, or those developed in collaboration with third parties, or obtained through acquisitions. applied's ability to successfully expand its business into new and related markets and industries may be adversely affected by a number of factors, including:
•the need to devote additional resources to develop new products for, and operate in, new markets;
•the need to develop new sales and technical marketing strategies, cultivate relationships with new customers and meet different customer service requirements;
•differing rates of profitability and growth among multiple businesses;
•applied's ability to anticipate demand, capitalize on opportunities, and avoid or minimize risks;
•the complexity of managing multiple businesses with variations in production planning, execution, supply chain management and logistics;
•the adoption of new business models, business processes and systems;
•the complexity of entering into and effectively managing strategic alliances or partnering opportunities;
•new materials, processes and technologies;
•the need to attract, motivate and retain employees with skills and expertise in these new areas;
•new and more diverse customers and suppliers, including some with limited operating histories, uncertain or limited funding, evolving business models or locations in regions where applied does not have, or has limited, operations;
•new or different competitors with potentially more financial or other resources, industry experience and established customer relationships;
•entry into new industries and countries, with differing levels of government involvement, laws and regulations, and business, employment and safety practices and requirements;
•the need to comply with, or work to establish, industry standards and practices.
in addition, applied from time to time receives funding from united states and other government agencies for certain strategic development programs to increase its research and development resources and address new market opportunities. as a condition to this government funding, applied is often subject to certain record-keeping, audit, intellectual property rights-sharing, and/or other obligations.
operational and financial risks applied is exposed to various risks related to protection and enforcement of intellectual property rights.
applied's success depends in significant part on the protection of its technology using patents, trade secrets, copyrights and other intellectual property rights. infringement or misappropriation of applied's intellectual property rights, such as the unauthorized manufacture or sale of equipment or spare parts, could result in uncompensated lost market and revenue opportunities for applied. monitoring and detecting any unauthorized use of intellectual property is difficult and costly and applied cannot be certain that the protective measures it has implemented will completely prevent misuse. applied's ability to enforce its intellectual property rights is subject to litigation risks, as well as uncertainty as to the protection and enforceability of those rights in some countries. if applied seeks to enforce its intellectual property rights, it may be subject to claims that those rights are invalid or unenforceable, and others may seek counterclaims against applied, which could have a negative impact on its business. if applied is unable to enforce and protect intellectual property rights, or if they are circumvented, rendered obsolete or invalidated by the rapid pace of technological change, or stolen or misappropriated by employees or third parties, it could have an adverse impact on its competitive position and business. in addition, changes in intellectual property laws or their interpretation may impact applied's ability to protect and assert its intellectual property rights, increase costs and uncertainties in the prosecution of patent applications or related enforcement actions, and diminish the value and competitive advantage conferred by applied's intellectual property assets.
third parties may also assert claims against applied and its products. claims that applied's products infringe the rights of others, whether or not meritorious, can be expensive and time-consuming to defend and resolve, and may divert the efforts and attention of management and personnel. the inability to obtain rights to use third party intellectual property on commercially reasonable terms could have an adverse impact on applied's business. in addition, applied may face claims based on the theft or unauthorized use or disclosure of third-party trade secrets and other confidential business information. any such incidents and claims could severely harm applied's business and reputation, result in significant expenses, harm its competitive position, and prevent applied from selling certain products, all of which could have a significant adverse impact on applied's business and results of operations.
applied is exposed to risks related to cybersecurity threats and incidents.
in the conduct of its business, applied collects, uses, transmits and stores data on information technology systems, including systems owned and maintained by applied or its third-party providers. these data include confidential information and intellectual property belonging to applied or its customers or other business partners, as well as personal information of individuals. all information technology systems are subject to disruption, breach or failure. applied and its third-party providers have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, cybersecurity incidents, some of which have been, and may continue to be, successful. these cybersecurity incidents may range from employee error or misuse or unauthorized use of information technology systems or confidential information, to individual attempts to gain unauthorized access to these information systems, to sophisticated cybersecurity attacks, known as advanced persistent threats, any of which may target the company directly or indirectly through its third party providers and global supply chain. globally, cybersecurity attacks are increasing in number and the attackers are increasingly organized and well-financed, or at times supported by state actors. in addition, geopolitical tensions or conflicts, such as russia's invasion of ukraine or increasing tension with china, may create a heightened risk of cybersecurity attacks. although no such cybersecurity incident has been material to the company to date, applied continues to devote significant resources to network security, data encryption, and other measures to protect its systems and data from unauthorized access or misuse, and it may be required to expend greater resources in the future, especially in the face of continuously evolving and increasingly sophisticated cybersecurity threats and privacy and data protection laws. applied may be unable to anticipate, prevent or remediate future attacks, and in some instances applied may be unaware of a cybersecurity incident or its magnitude and effects, particularly as attackers are becoming increasingly able to circumvent controls and remove forensic evidence. depending on their nature and scope, cybersecurity incidents may result in business disruption, such as delay in the development and delivery of applied's products or disruption of applied's manufacturing processes, internal communications, interactions with customers and suppliers and processing and reporting financial results; the theft or misappropriation of intellectual property; corruption, loss of, or inability to access (e.g., through ransomware or denial of service) confidential information and critical data (i.e., that of applied and its third party providers and customers); reputational damage; litigation or regulatory enforcement action related to contractual or regulatory privacy, cybersecurity, data protection, or other confidentiality obligations; diminution in the value of applied's investment in research, development and engineering; and increased costs associated with the implementation of cybersecurity measures to detect, deter, protect against, and recover from such incidents. compliance with, and changes to, laws and regulations concerning privacy, cybersecurity, and data protection, including developing restrictions on cross-border data transfer, could result in significant expense, and any failure to comply could result in proceedings against applied by regulatory authorities or other third parties. further, customers and third-party providers increasingly demand rigorous contractual provisions regarding privacy, cybersecurity, data protection, confidentiality, and intellectual property, which may also increase our overall compliance burden.
applied is exposed to risks associated with business combinations, acquisitions, strategic investments and divestitures.
applied engages in acquisitions of or investments in companies, technologies or products in existing, related or new markets for applied. business combinations, acquisitions and investments involve numerous risks to applied's business, financial condition and operating results, including but not limited to:
•diversion of management's attention and disruption of ongoing businesses;
•the failure to realize expected revenues, gross and operating margins, net income and other returns from acquired businesses;
•requirements imposed by government regulators in connection with their review of a transaction, which may include, among other things, divestitures and restrictions on the conduct of applied's existing business or the acquired business;
•following completion of acquisitions, ineffective integration of businesses, operations, systems, digital and physical security, technologies, products, employees, compliance programs, changes in laws or regulations, including tax laws, or other factors, may impact the ability to realize anticipated synergies or other benefits;
•failure to commercialize technologies from acquired businesses or developed through strategic investments;
•inability to capitalize on characteristics of new markets that may be significantly different from applied's existing markets and where competitors may have stronger market positions and customer relationships;
•failure to retain and motivate key employees of acquired businesses;
•the potential impact of the announcement or consummation of a proposed transaction on relationships with third parties;
•potential changes in applied's credit rating, which could adversely impact the company's access to and cost of capital;
•reductions in cash balances or increases in debt obligations to finance activities associated with a transaction, which increase interest expense, and reductions in cash balances, which reduce the availability of cash flow for general corporate or other purposes, including share repurchases and dividends;
•exposure to new operational risks, rules, regulations, worker expectations, customs and practices to the extent acquired businesses are located in regions where applied has not historically conducted business;
•inadequacy or ineffectiveness of an acquired company's internal financial controls, disclosure controls and procedures, cybersecurity, privacy policies and compliance programs, or environmental, health and safety, anti-corruption, human resource, or other policies or practices;
•impairment of acquired intangible assets and goodwill as a result of changing business conditions, technological advancements or worse-than-expected performance of the segment;
•the risk of litigation or claims associated with a proposed or completed transaction;
•unknown, underestimated, undisclosed or undetected commitments or liabilities or non-compliance with laws, regulations or policies; and
•the inappropriate scale of acquired entities' critical resources or facilities for business needs.
applied also makes investments in other companies, including companies formed as joint ventures, which may decline in value or not meet desired objectives. the success of these investments depends on various factors over which applied may have limited or no control and, particularly with respect to joint ventures, requires ongoing and effective cooperation with partners. in addition, new legislation, additional regulations or global economic or political conditions may affect or impair our ability to invest in certain countries or require us to obtain regulatory approvals to do so. applied may not receive the necessary regulatory approvals or the approvals may come with significant conditions or obligations. the risks to applied's investment portfolio may be exacerbated by unfavorable financial market and macroeconomic conditions and, as a result, the value of the investment portfolio could be negatively impacted and lead to impairment charges.
applied continually assesses the strategic fit of its businesses and may from time to time seek to divest portions of its business that are not deemed to fit with its strategic plan. some divestitures may take the form of applied contributing assets to a joint venture, and thus are subject to the joint venture risks discussed above. in addition, divestitures involve significant risks and uncertainties, such as ability to sell such businesses on satisfactory price and terms and in a timely manner (including long and costly sales processes and the possibility of lengthy and potentially unsuccessful attempts by a buyer to receive required regulatory approvals), or at all, disruption to other parts of the businesses and distraction of management, allocation of internal resources that would otherwise be devoted to completing strategic acquisitions, loss of key employees or customers, exposure to unanticipated liabilities (including, among other things, those arising from representations and warranties made to a buyer regarding the businesses) or ongoing obligations to support the businesses following such divestitures, and other adverse financial impacts.
the ability to attract, retain and motivate key employees is vital to applied's success.
applied's success, competitiveness and ability to execute on its global strategies and maintain a culture of innovation depend in large part on its ability to attract, retain and motivate qualified employees and leaders with the necessary expertise and capabilities, representing diverse backgrounds and experiences. achieving this objective may be difficult due to many factors, including fluctuations in global economic and industry conditions, management or organizational changes, increasing competition for talent, the availability of qualified employees in the markets, availability of career development opportunities, the ability to obtain necessary authorizations for workers to provide services outside their home countries, and the attractiveness of applied's compensation and benefit programs, including its share-based programs, and applied's employment policies, including the flexibility of its remote-work arrangements. we have experienced, and may continue to experience, increasing costs to attract and retain needed talent, driven by macro-economic conditions and a highly competitive labor market. if we are unable to attract, retain and motivate qualified employees and leaders, we may be unable to fully capitalize on current and new market opportunities, which could adversely impact applied's business and results of operations. the loss or retirement of employees presents particular challenges to the extent they involve the departure of knowledgeable and experienced employees and the resulting need to identify and train existing or new candidates to perform necessary functions, which may result in unexpected costs, reduced productivity, and/or difficulties with respect to internal processes and controls.
applied is exposed to risks associated with operating in jurisdictions with complex and changing tax laws.
applied is subject to income taxes in the united states and foreign jurisdictions. significant judgment is required to determine and estimate worldwide tax liabilities. applied's provision for income taxes and effective tax rates could be affected by numerous factors, including changes in applicable tax laws, interpretations of applicable tax laws, amount and composition of pre-tax income in jurisdictions with differing tax rates, and valuation of deferred tax assets.
beginning in fiscal 2023, the tax cuts and jobs act enacted on december 22, 2017 eliminates the option to deduct research and development expenditures currently and requires taxpayers to capitalize and amortize them over five or fifteen years. although congress is considering legislation that would defer the capitalization and amortization requirement, there is no assurance that the provision will be repealed or otherwise modified. if the requirement is not modified, it may increase applied's provision for income taxes and effective tax rates beginning in fiscal 2023.
on august 16, 2022, the u.s. government enacted the inflation reduction act, which introduces a new 15% corporate minimum tax and includes an excise tax that would impose a 1% surcharge on stock repurchases, and which may impact applied's financial results beginning in fiscal 2024 and 2023, respectively.
there have been a number of proposed changes in the tax laws that, if enacted, would increase our tax liability. while it is too early to predict the outcome of these proposals, if enacted, they could have a material impact on our provision for income taxes and effective tax rate. an increase in applied's provision for income taxes and effective tax rate could, in turn, have a material adverse impact on applied's results of operations and financial condition.
consistent with the international nature of its business, applied conducts certain manufacturing, supply chain, and other operations in asia, bringing these activities closer to customers and reducing operating costs. in certain foreign jurisdictions, conditional reduced income tax rates have been granted to applied. to obtain the benefit of these tax incentives, applied must meet requirements relating to various activities. applied's ability to realize benefits from these incentives could be materially affected if, among other things, applicable requirements are not met or applied incurs net losses in these jurisdictions.
in addition, applied is subject to examination by the u.s. internal revenue service and other tax authorities, and from time to time amends previously filed tax returns. applied regularly assesses the likelihood of favorable or unfavorable outcomes resulting from these examinations and amendments to determine the adequacy of its provision for income taxes, which requires estimates and judgments. although applied believes its tax estimates are reasonable, there can be no assurance that the tax authorities will agree with such estimates. applied may have to engage in litigation to achieve the results reflected in the estimates, which may be time-consuming and expensive. there can be no assurance that applied will be successful or that any final determination will not be materially different from the treatment reflected in applied's historical income tax provisions and effective tax rates.
applied's indebtedness and debt covenants could adversely affect its financial condition and business.
applied has $5.5 billion in aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes outstanding. under the indenture governing the senior unsecured notes, it may be required to offer to repurchase the notes at a price equal to 101% of the principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest, upon a change of control of applied and a contemporaneous downgrade of the notes below investment grade. applied also has in place a $1.5 billion revolving credit facility. while no amounts were outstanding under this credit facility as of october 30, 2022, applied may borrow amounts in the future under this credit facility. applied may also enter into new financing arrangements. applied's ability to satisfy its debt obligations is dependent upon the results of its business operations and subject to other risks discussed in this section. significant changes in applied's credit rating, disruptions in the global financial markets or changes in the interest rate environment could have a material adverse consequence on applied's access to and cost of capital for future financings, and financial condition. if applied fails to satisfy its debt obligations, or comply with financial and other debt covenants, it may be in default and any borrowings may become immediately due and payable, and such default may also constitute a default under other of applied's obligations. there can be no assurance that applied would have sufficient financial resources or be able to arrange financing to repay any borrowings at such time.
the failure to successfully implement enterprise resource planning and other information systems changes could adversely impact applied's business and results of operations.
applied periodically implements new or enhanced enterprise resource planning and related information systems in order to better manage its business operations, align its global organizations and enable future growth. implementation of new business processes and information systems requires the commitment of significant personnel, training and financial resources, and entails risks to applied's business operations. if applied does not successfully implement enterprise resource planning and related information systems improvements, or if there are delays or difficulties in implementing these systems, applied may not realize anticipated productivity improvements or cost efficiencies, and may experience interruptions in service and operational difficulties, such as its ability to track orders, timely manufacture and ship products, project inventory requirements, effectively manage its supply chain and allocate human resources, aggregate financial data and report operating results, and otherwise effectively manage its business, all of which could result in quality issues, reputational harm, lost market and revenue opportunities, and otherwise adversely affect applied's business, financial condition and results of operations.
applied may incur impairment charges related to goodwill or long-lived assets.
applied has a significant amount of goodwill and other acquired intangible assets related to acquisitions. goodwill and purchased intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are not amortized, but are reviewed for impairment annually during the fourth quarter of each fiscal year, and more frequently when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable. the review compares the fair value for each of applied's reporting units to its associated carrying value, including goodwill. factors that could lead to impairment of goodwill and intangible assets include adverse industry or economic trends, reduced estimates of future cash flows, declines in the market price of applied common stock, changes in applied's strategies or product portfolio, and restructuring activities. applied's valuation methodology for assessing impairment requires management to make judgments and assumptions based on historical experience and projections of future operating performance. applied may be required to record future charges to earnings during the period in which an impairment of goodwill or intangible assets is determined to exist.
legal, compliance, and other risks applied is exposed to various risks related to legal proceedings, claims and investigations.
applied from time to time is, and in the future may be involved in legal proceedings or claims regarding patent infringement, trade secret misappropriation, and other intellectual property rights, trade, including import, export and customs, antitrust, environmental regulations, privacy, data protection, securities, contracts, product performance, product liability, unfair competition, employment, workplace safety, and other matters. applied also may receive, and has received, inquiries, warrants, subpoenas, and other requests for information in connection with government investigations of potential or suspected violations of law or regulations by applied and/or its employees. applied also on occasion receives notification from customers who believe that applied owes them indemnification, product warranty or has other obligations related to claims made against such customers by third parties.
legal proceedings, claims, and government investigations, whether with or without merit, and internal investigations, may be time-consuming and expensive to prosecute, defend or conduct; divert management's attention and other applied resources; inhibit applied's ability to sell its products; result in adverse judgments for damages, injunctive relief, penalties and fines; and negatively affect applied's business. there can be no assurance regarding the outcome of current or future legal proceedings, claims or investigations.
applied is exposed to various risks related to the global regulatory environment.
as a public company with global operations, applied is subject to the laws of the united states and multiple foreign jurisdictions and the rules and regulations of various governing bodies, which may differ among jurisdictions, including those related to financial and other disclosures, accounting standards, corporate governance, intellectual property, tax, trade (including import, export and customs), antitrust, environment, health and safety (including those relating to climate change), employment, immigration and travel regulations, privacy, data protection and localization, and anti-corruption. changing, inconsistent or conflicting laws, rules and regulations, and ambiguities in their interpretation and application create uncertainty and challenges, and compliance with laws, rules and regulations may be onerous and expensive, divert management time and attention from revenue-generating activities, and otherwise adversely impact applied's business operations. violations of law, rules and regulations, including, among others, those related to financial and other disclosures, trade, import and export regulations, antitrust, privacy, data protection, and anti-corruption, could result in fines, criminal penalties, restrictions on applied's business, and damage to its reputation, and could have an adverse impact on its business operations, financial condition and results of operations.
applied's environmental, social and governance commitments could result in additional costs, and our inability to achieve them could have an adverse impact on our reputation and performance.
from time to time applied communicates its strategies, commitments and targets related to sustainability, carbon emissions, diversity and inclusion, human rights, and other environmental, social and governance matters. these strategies, commitments and targets reflect applied's current plans and aspirations, and applied may be unable to achieve them. changing customer sustainability requirements, as well as applied's sustainability targets, could cause applied from time to time to alter its manufacturing, operations or equipment designs and processes, and incur substantial additional expense to meet such requirements and targets. any failure to meet these sustainability requirements or targets could adversely impact the demand for applied's products and subject applied to significant costs and liabilities and reputational risks that could adversely affect applied's business, financial condition and results of operations. in addition, standards and processes for measuring and reporting carbon emissions and other sustainability metrics may change over time, and may result in inconsistent data, or could result in significant revisions to our strategies, commitments and targets, or our ability to achieve them. any scrutiny of our carbon emissions or other sustainability disclosures or our failure to achieve related strategies, commitments and targets could negatively impact our reputation or performance.
applied is subject to risks associated with environmental, health and safety regulations.
applied is subject to environmental, health and safety regulations in connection with its global business operations, including but not limited to: regulations related to the development, manufacture, sale, shipping and use of its products; handling, discharge, recycling and disposal of hazardous materials used in its products or in producing its products; the operation of its facilities; and the use of its real property. the failure or inability to comply with existing or future environmental, health and safety regulations could result in: significant remediation or other legal liabilities; the imposition of penalties and fines; restrictions on the development, manufacture, sale, shipping or use of certain of its products; limitations on the operation of its facilities or ability to use its real property; and a decrease in the value of its real property. applied could also be required to alter its manufacturing, operations and product design, and incur substantial expense in order to comply with environmental, health and safety regulations. any failure to comply with these regulations could subject applied to significant costs and liabilities that could adversely affect applied's business, financial condition and results of operations.
item 7:      management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations introduction management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (md&a) is intended to facilitate an understanding of applied's business and results of operations. this md&a should be read in conjunction with applied's consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form 10-k. the following discussion contains forward-looking statements and should also be read in conjunction with the cautionary statement set forth at the beginning of this form 10-k. md&a consists of the following sections:
•applied's pandemic response
•overview: a summary of applied's business and measurements
•results of operations: a discussion of operating results
•segment information: a discussion of segment operating results
•recent accounting pronouncements: a discussion of new accounting pronouncements and its impact to applied's consolidated financial statements
•financial condition, liquidity and capital resources: an analysis of cash flows, sources and uses of cash
•contractual obligations and off-balance sheet arrangements
•critical accounting policies and estimates: a discussion of critical accounting policies that require the exercise of judgments and estimates
•non-gaap adjusted results: a presentation of results reconciling gaap to non-gaap adjusted measures applied's pandemic response as the covid-19 pandemic emerged in 2020, applied materials responded quickly to put in place precautionary measures to keep its workplaces healthy and safe, while ensuring compliance with orders and restrictions imposed by government authorities, everywhere applied operates in the world. applied's top priority remains protecting the health and safety of its employees and their families, customers, suppliers and community. applied continues to support workplace flexibility and will work to respond appropriately to the impact of covid-19 on its business, its customers' and suppliers' businesses and its communities.
overview applied provides manufacturing equipment, services and software to the semiconductor, display, and related industries. applied's customers include manufacturers of semiconductor wafers and chips, liquid crystal and organic light-emitting diode (oled) displays, and other electronic devices. these customers may use what they manufacture in their own end products or sell the items to other companies for use in electronic products. each of applied's segments is subject to variable industry conditions, as demand for manufacturing equipment and services can change depending on supply and demand for chips, display technologies, and other electronic devices, as well as other factors, such as global economic, political and market conditions, and the nature and timing of technological advances in fabrication processes.
applied operates in three reportable segments: semiconductor systems, applied global services, and display and adjacent markets. a summary of financial information for each reportable segment is found in note 17 of notes to consolidated financial statements. a discussion of factors that could affect applied's operations is set forth under "risk factors" in part i, item 1a, which is incorporated herein by reference. product development and manufacturing activities occur primarily in the united states, europe, israel, and asia. applied's broad range of equipment and service products are highly technical and are sold primarily through a direct sales force.
applied's results are driven primarily by customer spending on capital equipment and services to support key technology transitions or to increase production volume in response to worldwide demand for semiconductors and displays. spending by semiconductor customers, which include companies that operate in the foundry, logic, memory, and other semiconductor chip markets, is driven by demand for electronic products, including smartphones and other mobile devices, servers, personal computers, automotive devices, storage, and other products. the growth of data and emerging end-market drivers such as artificial intelligence, the internet of things, 5g networks, smart vehicles and augmented and virtual reality are also creating the next wave of growth for the industry. as a result, products within the semiconductor systems segment are subject to significant changes in customer requirements, including transitions to smaller dimensions, increasingly complex chip architectures, new materials and an increasing number of applications. demand for display manufacturing equipment spending depends primarily on consumer demand for increasingly larger and more advanced tvs as well as larger and higher resolution displays for next-generation mobile devices, and investments in new types of display technologies. while certain existing technologies may be adapted to new requirements, some applications create the need for an entirely different technological approach. the timing of customer investment in manufacturing equipment is also affected by the timing of next-generation process development and the timing of capacity expansion to meet end-market demand. in light of these conditions, applied's results can vary significantly year-over-year, as well as quarter-over-quarter.
applied's strategic priorities include developing products that help solve customers' challenges at technology inflections; expanding its served market opportunities in the semiconductor and display industries; and growing its services business. applied's long-term growth strategy requires continued development of new materials engineering capabilities, including products and platforms that enable expansion into new and adjacent markets. applied's significant investments in research, development and engineering must generally enable it to deliver new products and technologies before the emergence of strong demand, thus allowing customers to incorporate these products into their manufacturing plans during early-stage technology selection. applied works closely with its global customers to design systems and processes that meet their planned technical and production requirements.

semiconductor equipment customers continued to make strategic investments in new technology transitions and new capacity during fiscal 2022. foundry and logic spending increased in fiscal 2022 compared to fiscal 2021 driven by customer investments in both advanced and mature nodes. overall spending by memory customers was flat in fiscal 2022 compared to fiscal 2021 as they continued to maintain balance between supply and demand and invested in new technology.
applied saw continued growth in its services business in fiscal 2022 compared to fiscal 2021 driven by an increase in the installed base of equipment, the rate of customer equipment utilization, long-term service agreements and spares and legacy systems sales. applied's display and adjacent markets revenue decreased in fiscal 2022 compared to fiscal 2021 primarily due to decreased investment in display manufacturing equipment for tvs and mobile products.
while customer demand increased during fiscal 2022 compared to fiscal 2021, supply chain and logistics constraints impacted applied's ability to fulfill demand in fiscal 2022. although there have been improvements in supply chain performance, applied expects some shortages to persist into fiscal 2023 and managing these supply chain constraints to increase shipments to customers remains a top priority.
in fiscal 2023, applied expects memory customers' spending to be lower as compared to fiscal 2022 due to some customers deferring capacity additions as a result of weakness in consumer electronics and personal computer markets. advanced foundry and logic demand is expected to remain strong in fiscal 2023 as customers continue to invest in new technology.
on october 7, 2022, the united states government announced new export regulations for u.s. semiconductor technology sold in china, including wafer fabrication equipment and related parts and services, that require export licenses and authorizations. these new export regulations resulted in lower net sales in china than expected for fiscal 2022. applied is pursuing additional export licenses and authorizations where needed. while applied currently estimates lower net sales to china of up to $2.5 billion and lower overall gross margin of up to 1% in fiscal 2023, applied is continuing to assess the implication of these complex regulations to its business. see also "risk factors - global trade issues and changes in and uncertainties with respect to trade policies and export regulations, including import and export license requirements, trade sanctions, tariffs and international trade disputes, have adversely impacted and could further adversely impact our business and operations, and reduce the competitiveness of our products relative to local and global competitors" for further details.
in response to the ongoing covid-19 pandemic and evolving conditions and worldwide response, applied made adjustments to its global operations and is actively managing its responses in collaboration with its employees, customers and suppliers. however, the situation remains fluid and uncertain. for additional risks associated with the ongoing covid-19 pandemic, see the risk factor entitled "the continued effects of covid-19 pandemic and global measures taken in response have adversely impacted, and may continue to adversely impact, applied's operations and financial results" in part i, item 1a, "risk factors."

the semiconductor systems segment continued to represent the largest contributor of net sales. net sales in fiscal 2022 compared to fiscal 2021 and fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020 increased primarily due to increased customer investments in semiconductor equipment as well as customer spending on spares and comprehensive service agreements.
net sales by geographic region, determined by the location of customers' facilities to which products were shipped, were as follows:
change
the increases in net sales in all regions other than china and korea in fiscal 2022 compared to fiscal 2021 primarily reflected changes in semiconductor equipment spending and customer spending on comprehensive service agreements. the decrease in net sales to customers in china for fiscal 2022 compared to fiscal 2021 primarily reflected decreased investment in display manufacturing equipment and semiconductor equipment, partially offset by increased spending on spares and comprehensive service agreements. the decrease in net sales to customers in korea for fiscal 2022 compared to fiscal 2021 primarily reflected decreased investment in semiconductor equipment, partially offset by increased investment in display manufacturing equipment.
the changes in net sales in all regions in fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020 primarily reflected changes in investments in semiconductor manufacturing equipment and customer spending on comprehensive service agreements. the decrease in net sales to customers in japan for fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020 primarily reflected a decrease in investments in semiconductor manufacturing equipment, partially offset by an increase in customer spending on comprehensive service agreements.

gross margin in fiscal 2021 increased compared to fiscal 2020 primarily due to the increase in net sales and favorable changes in customer and product mix, partially offset by higher freight costs and higher personnel costs due to an increase in headcount to provide manufacturing capacity and flexibility.
gross margin during fiscal 2022, 2021 and 2020 included $147 million, $118 million and $103 million, respectively, of share-based compensation expense.
research, development and engineering research, development and engineering (rd&e) expenses for the periods indicated were as follows:
change
research, development and engineering           $2,771                  $2,485                  $2,234               $286                          $251
applied's future operating results depend to a considerable extent on its ability to maintain a competitive advantage in the equipment and service products it provides. development cycles range from 12 to 36 months depending on whether the product is an enhancement of an existing product, which typically has a shorter development cycle, or a new product, which typically has a longer development cycle. most of applied's existing products resulted from internal development activities and innovations involving new technologies, materials and processes. in certain instances, applied acquires technologies, either in existing or new product areas, to complement its existing technology capabilities and to reduce time to market.
management believes that it is critical to continue to make substantial investments in rd&e to assure the availability of innovative technology that meets the current and projected requirements of its customers' most advanced designs. applied has maintained and intends to continue its commitment to investing in rd&e in order to continue to offer new products and technologies.
applied continued its rd&e investments across semiconductor systems and display and adjacent markets on the development of new unit process systems and integrated materials solutions. areas of investment include etch, deposition, metrology and inspection, patterning, packaging and other technologies to improve chip performance, power, area, cost and time-to-market. in display and adjacent markets, rd&e investments were focused on expanding the company's market opportunity with new display technologies.
the increases in rd&e expenses during fiscal 2022 compared to fiscal 2021 were primarily due to additional headcount, higher consumable and equipment costs associated with ongoing product development and share-based compensation expense. the increases in rd&e expenses during fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020 were primarily due to additional headcount and higher expense associated with share-based compensation and variable compensation. these increases reflect applied's ongoing investments in product development initiatives, consistent with the company's growth strategy. applied continued to prioritize existing rd&e investments in technical capabilities and critical research and development programs in current and new markets, with a focus on semiconductor technologies.
rd&e expenses during fiscal 2022, 2021 and 2020 included $151 million, $129 million and $116 million, respectively, of share-based compensation expense.

marketing and selling expenses for fiscal 2022 increased compared to fiscal 2021 primarily due to additional headcount. marketing and selling expenses for fiscal 2021 increased compared to fiscal 2020 primarily due to additional headcount and higher variable compensation. marketing and selling expenses for fiscal years 2022, 2021 and 2020 included $49 million, $43 million and $36 million, respectively, of share-based compensation expense.
change
g&a expenses during fiscal 2022, 2021 and 2020 included $66 million, $56 million and $52 million, respectively, of share-based compensation expense.
change
in the first quarter of fiscal 2021, applied enacted a severance plan (fiscal 2021 severance plan) to realign its workforce. under this plan, applied implemented a one-time voluntary retirement program and other workforce reduction actions. the voluntary retirement program was available to certain u.s. employees who met minimum age and length of service requirements, as well as other business-specific criteria. in addition, applied implemented other workforce reduction actions globally across the display and adjacent markets business.
deal termination fee operating income (loss) for fiscal 2021 included a $154 million deal termination fee associated with the termination of a share purchase agreement with kokusai electric corporation and kkr hke investment l. p. during the second quarter of fiscal 2021.
change
interest expense incurred was primarily associated with the senior unsecured notes. interest expense in fiscal 2022 remained relatively flat compared fiscal 2021 and fiscal 2020 due to the average principal balance of the senior unsecured notes remained consistent at $5.5 billion in each of the last three years.
interest and other income, net in fiscal 2022 decreased compared to fiscal 2021, primarily driven by higher net loss from equity investments, partially offset by higher interest income during fiscal 2022 compared to fiscal 2021. interest and other income, net in fiscal 2021 increased compared to fiscal 2020, primarily driven by a higher net gain from equity investments, partially offset by lower interest income during fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020.
change
effective income tax rate             14.1   %                  13.0   %                  13.1   %                       1.1   points                     (0.1)   points applied's provision for income taxes and effective tax rate are affected by the geographical composition of pre-tax income which includes jurisdictions with differing tax rates, conditional reduced tax rates and other income tax incentives. it is also affected by events that vary from period to period, such as changes in income tax laws and the resolution of prior years' income tax filings.
the effective tax rate for fiscal 2022 was higher than fiscal 2021 primarily due to a reduction of deferred tax assets related to a new tax incentive in singapore, partially offset by changes in uncertain tax positions. applied's effective tax rate for fiscal 2021 was slightly lower than fiscal 2020 primarily due to higher proportion of pre-tax income in lower tax jurisdictions, partially offset by resolutions of prior years' income tax filings.
on august 9, 2022, the u.s. government enacted the u.s. chips and science act ("chips act"). the chips act creates a 25% investment tax credit for certain investments in domestic semiconductor manufacturing. the credit is provided for qualifying property, which is placed in service after december 31, 2022, and any impact to applied would start in fiscal 2023.
on august 16, 2022, the u.s. government enacted the inflation reduction act. the inflation reduction act introduces a new 15% corporate minimum tax, based on adjusted financial statement income of certain large corporations. applicable corporations would be allowed to claim a credit for the minimum tax paid against regular tax in future years. the minimum tax impacts applied starting in fiscal 2024. the inflation reduction act also includes an excise tax that would impose a 1% surcharge on stock repurchases. this excise tax is effective january 1, 2023.
applied is currently evaluating the effect the chips act and the inflation reduction act will have on its consolidated financial statements.
segment information applied reports financial results in three segments: semiconductor systems, applied global services, and display and adjacent markets. a description of the products and services, as well as financial data, for each reportable segment can be found in note 17 of notes to consolidated financial statements.
the corporate and other category includes revenues from products, as well as costs of products sold, for fabricating solar photovoltaic cells and modules and certain operating expenses that are not allocated to its reportable segments and are managed separately at the corporate level. these operating expenses include costs for share-based compensation; certain management, finance, legal, human resource, and rd&e functions provided at the corporate level; and unabsorbed information technology and occupancy. in addition, applied does not allocate to its reportable segments restructuring, severance and asset impairment charges and any associated adjustments related to restructuring actions, unless these actions pertain to a specific reportable segment.
semiconductor systems segment the semiconductor systems segment is comprised primarily of capital equipment used to fabricate semiconductor chips. semiconductor industry spending on capital equipment is driven by demand for electronic products, including smartphones and other mobile devices, servers, personal computers, automotive electronics, storage, and other products, and the nature and timing of technological advances in fabrication processes, and as a result is subject to variable industry conditions. development efforts are focused on solving customers' key technical challenges in transistor, interconnect, patterning and packaging performance.

recent accounting pronouncements for a description of recent accounting pronouncements, including the expected dates of adoption and estimated effects, if any, on applied's consolidated financial statements, see note 1, "summary of significant accounting policies," of the notes to consolidated financial statements.
financial condition, liquidity and capital resources applied's cash, cash equivalents and investments consist of the following:
sources and uses of cash a summary of cash provided by (used in) operating, investing, and financing activities is as follows:
cash provided by operating activities        $5,399                    $5,442                    $3,804
operating activities cash from operating activities for fiscal 2022 was $5.4 billion, which reflects net income adjusted for the effect of non-cash charges and changes in working capital components. non-cash charges included depreciation, amortization, severance and related charges, share-based compensation and deferred income taxes. cash provided by operating activities remained relatively flat in fiscal 2022 compared to fiscal 2021 primarily due to higher inventory and income tax payments, partially offset by higher net income and lower year over year increase in accounts receivable. cash provided by operating activities increased in fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020 primarily due to higher net income, partially offset by an increase in the accounts receivable balance.
applied has agreements with various financial institutions to sell accounts receivable and discount promissory notes from selected customers. applied sells its accounts receivable generally without recourse. applied, from time to time, also discounts letters of credit issued by customers through various financial institutions. the discounting of letters of credit depends on many factors, including the willingness of financial institutions to discount the letters of credit and the cost of such arrangements. applied sold $1.0 billion, $1.3 billion and $1.2 billion of accounts receivable during fiscal 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. applied did not discount letters of credit issued by customers in fiscal 2022 and 2021. applied discounted letters of credit issued by customers of $105 million in fiscal 2020. there was no discounting of promissory notes in each of fiscal 2022, 2021 and 2020. financing charges on the sale of receivables and discounting of letters of credit are included in interest expense in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations and were not material for all years presented.
applied's working capital was $8.5 billion at october 30, 2022 and $9.8 billion at october 31, 2021.
days sales outstanding at the end of fiscal 2022, 2021 and 2020 was 82 days, 74 days, and 57 days, respectively. days sales outstanding varies due to the timing of shipments and payment terms. the increase in days sales outstanding at the end of fiscal 2022 was primarily due to higher accounts receivable balance as a result of the timing of customer payments and lower accounts receivables factoring compared to the end of fiscal 2021. the increase in days sales outstanding at the end of fiscal 2021 was primarily due to unfavorable revenue linearity and lower account receivable factoring compared to the end of fiscal 2020.
investing activities applied used $1.4 billion, $1.2 billion and $130 million of cash in investing activities in fiscal 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. capital expenditures in fiscal 2022, 2021 and 2020 were $787 million, $668 million and $422 million, respectively. capital expenditures were primarily for investments in demonstration and testing equipment, real property acquisitions and improvements, and network equipment. net cash paid for acquisitions in fiscal 2022, 2021 and 2020 were $441 million, $12 million and $107 million, respectively. purchases of investments, net of proceeds from sales and maturities of investments, for 2022 and 2021 was $129 million and $536 million, respectively. proceeds from sales and maturities of investments, net of purchase of investments were $399 million for fiscal 2020. investing activities also included investments in technology to allow applied to access new market opportunities or emerging technologies.
applied's investment portfolio consists principally of investment grade money market mutual funds, u.s. treasury and agency securities, municipal bonds, corporate bonds and mortgage-backed and asset-backed securities, as well as equity securities. applied regularly monitors the credit risk in its investment portfolio and takes appropriate measures, which may include the sale of certain securities, to manage such risks prudently in accordance with its investment policies.
financing activities applied used $7.0 billion of cash in financing activities in fiscal 2022, consisting primarily of repurchases of common stock of $6.1 billion, cash dividends to stockholders of $873 million and tax withholding payments for vested equity awards of $266 million, offset by proceeds received from common stock issuances of $199 million.
applied used $4.6 billion of cash in financing activities in fiscal 2021, consisting primarily of repurchases of common stock of $3.8 billion, cash dividends to stockholders of $838 million and tax withholding payments for vested equity awards of $178 million, offset by proceeds received from common stock issuances of $175 million.
applied used $1.3 billion of cash in financing activities in fiscal 2020, consisting primarily of the repayment of $1.4 billion senior notes, repurchases of common stock of $649 million, cash dividends to stockholders of $787 million and tax withholding payments for vested equity awards of $172 million, offset by net proceeds received from the issuance of senior unsecured notes of $1.5 billion and proceeds from common stock issuances of $174 million.
in march 2022, applied's board of directors approved a common stock repurchase program authorizing $6.0 billion in repurchases, which supplemented the previously existing $7.5 billion authorization approved in march 2021. at october 30, 2022, approximately $4.9 billion remained available for future stock repurchases under the repurchase program.
during fiscal 2022, applied's board of directors declared one quarterly cash dividend of $0.24 per share and three quarterly cash dividends of $0.26 per share. during fiscal 2021, applied's board of directors declared one quarterly cash dividend of $0.22 per share and three quarterly cash dividends of $0.24 per share. during fiscal 2020, applied's board of directors declared one quarterly cash dividend of $0.21 per share and three quarterly cash dividends of $0.22 per share. dividends paid during fiscal 2022, 2021 and 2020 amounted to $873 million, $838 million and $787 million, respectively. applied currently anticipates that cash dividends will continue to be paid on a quarterly basis, although the declaration of any future cash dividend is at the discretion of the board of directors and will depend on applied's financial condition, results of operations, capital requirements, business conditions and other factors, as well as a determination by the board of directors that cash dividends are in the best interests of applied's stockholders.
applied has credit facilities for unsecured borrowings in various currencies of up to $1.6 billion, of which $1.5 billion is comprised of a committed revolving credit agreement (revolving credit agreement) with a group of banks. the revolving credit agreement includes a provision under which applied may request an increase in the amount of the facility of up to $500 million for a total commitment of no more than $2.0 billion, subject to the receipt of commitments from one or more lenders for any such increase and other customary conditions. the revolving credit agreement is scheduled to expire in february 2025, unless extended as permitted under the revolving credit agreement. the revolving credit agreement provides for borrowings in united states dollars that bear interest for each advance at one of two rates selected by applied, plus an applicable margin, which varies according to applied's public debt credit ratings. in july 2022, applied entered into an amendment to the revolving credit agreement which replaced the london interbank offered rate (libor) as a reference rate for borrowings with the secured overnight financing rate (sofr). the revolving credit agreement includes financial and other covenants with which applied was in compliance as of october 30, 2022.
remaining credit facilities in the amount of approximately $54 million are with japanese banks. applied's ability to borrow under these facilities is subject to bank approval at the time of the borrowing request, and any advances will be at rates indexed to the banks' prime reference rate denominated in japanese yen.
applied has a short-term commercial paper program under which applied may issue unsecured commercial paper notes of up to a total amount of $1.5 billion. as of october 30, 2022, applied did not have any commercial paper outstanding but may issue commercial paper notes under this program from time to time in the future. subsequent to the end of fiscal 2022, applied issued $200 million of short-term commercial paper with a weighted-average interest rate of 4.30% and maturities ranging from 43 days to 71 days. the commercial paper program is backstopped by the revolving credit agreement and borrowings under the revolving credit agreement reduce the amount of commercial paper notes applied can issue.
applied had senior unsecured notes in the aggregate principal amount of $5.5 billion outstanding as of october 30, 2022. see note 10 of the notes to the consolidated condensed financial statements for additional discussion of existing debt. applied may seek to refinance its existing debt and may incur additional indebtedness depending on applied's capital requirements and the availability of financing.
others on december 22, 2017, the u.s. government enacted the tax cuts and jobs act (tax act). the tax act requires a one-time transition tax on certain unrepatriated earnings of foreign subsidiaries. the transition tax expense is payable in installments over eight years, with eight percent due in each of the first five years starting with fiscal 2018. as of october 30, 2022, applied had $694 million of total payments remaining, payable in installments in the next four years.
beginning in fiscal 2023, the tax act eliminates the option to deduct research and development expenditures currently and requires taxpayers to capitalize and amortize them over five or fifteen years. although congress is considering legislation that would defer the capitalization and amortization requirement, there is no assurance that the provision will be repealed or otherwise modified. if the requirement is not modified, it may reduce our cash flows beginning in fiscal 2023.
although cash requirements will fluctuate based on the timing and extent of factors such as those discussed above, applied's management believes that cash generated from operations, together with the liquidity provided by existing cash balances and borrowing capability, will be sufficient to satisfy applied's liquidity requirements for the next 12 months. for further details regarding applied's operating, investing and financing activities, see the consolidated statements of cash flows in this report.
for details on standby letters of credit, guarantee instruments and other agreements with banks, see off-balance sheet arrangements below.
contractual obligations and off-balance sheet arrangements applied has certain on-balance sheet and off-balance sheet obligation arrangements to make future payments under various contracts. certain contractual arrangements which are recorded on applied's balance sheet include borrowing facilities and debts and operating leases obligations.
borrowing facilities and debt obligations as of october 30, 2022, applied has $5.5 billion in aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes with varying maturities. future interest payments associated with these unsecured notes were $3.0 billion, of which $205 million is due within 12 months and the remaining interest payments are due beyond 12 months. see note 10, borrowing facilities and debt, of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion related to applied's borrowing facilities and debt obligations.
operating lease obligations as of october 30, 2022, applied's operating lease obligation was $407 million related to various operating lease arrangements for certain facilities and equipment. see note 11, lease, of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion relating to these operating lease obligations.
purchase obligations as of october 30, 2022, applied has $7.3 billion of purchase obligations for goods and services, of which $7.0 billion is payable within 12 months and the remaining amount is payable beyond 12 months.
deemed repatriation tax payable as of october 30, 2022, applied has $694 million of transition tax liability, of which $82 million is payable within 12 months and the remaining amount is payable beyond 12 months. this transition tax liability is associated with the deemed repatriation of accumulated foreign earnings as a result of the enactment of the tax cuts and jobs act into law on december 22, 2017.
other long-term liabilities applied also has the obligation to fund its pension, postretirement and deferred compensation plans. applied evaluates the need to make contributions to its pension and postretirement benefit plans after considering the funded status of the plans, movements in the discount rate, performance of the plan assets and related tax consequences. payments to the plans would be dependent on these factors and could vary across a wide range of amounts and time periods. payments for deferred compensation plans are dependent on activity by participants, making the timing of payments uncertain. information on applied's pension, postretirement benefit and deferred compensation plans is presented in note 14, employee benefit plans, of the notes to the consolidated financial statements.
as of october 30, 2022, the gross liability for unrecognized tax benefits that was not expected to result in payment of cash within one year was $489 million. interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions that were not expected to result in payment of cash within one year of october 30, 2022 was $103 million. at this time, applied is unable to reliably estimate the timing of payments due to uncertainties in the timing of tax audit outcomes.
off-balance sheet arrangements in the ordinary course of business, applied provides standby letters of credit or other guarantee instruments to third parties as required for certain transactions initiated by either applied or its subsidiaries. these include agreements with various banks to facilitate subsidiary banking operations worldwide, including overdraft arrangements. applied also has agreements with various banks to facilitate subsidiary banking operations worldwide, including overdraft arrangements, issuance of bank guarantees, and letters of credit. see note 16, warranty, guarantees, commitments and contingencies, of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion relating to these arrangements.
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of consolidated financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make judgments, assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported. note 1 of notes to consolidated financial statements describes the significant accounting policies used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements. certain of these significant accounting policies are considered to be critical accounting policies.
a critical accounting policy is defined as one that is both material to the presentation of applied's consolidated financial statements and that requires management to make difficult, subjective or complex judgments that could have a material effect on applied's financial condition or results of operations. specifically, these policies have the following attributes: (1) applied is required to make assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time of the estimate; and (2) different estimates applied could reasonably have used, or changes in the estimate that are reasonably likely to occur, would have a material effect on applied's financial condition or results of operations.
estimates and assumptions about future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty. applied bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions believed to be applicable and reasonable under the circumstances. these estimates may change as new events occur, as additional information is obtained and as applied's operating environment changes. these changes have historically been minor and have been included in the consolidated financial statements as soon as they became known. in addition, management is periodically faced with uncertainties, the outcomes of which are not within its control and will not be known for prolonged periods of time. these uncertainties include those discussed in part i, item 1a, "risk factors." based on a critical assessment of its accounting policies and the underlying judgments and uncertainties affecting the application of those policies, management believes that applied's consolidated financial statements are fairly stated in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america, and provide a meaningful presentation of applied's financial condition and results of operations.
management believes that the following are critical accounting policies and estimates:
revenue recognition applied recognizes revenue when promised goods or services (performance obligations) are transferred to a customer in an amount that reflects the consideration to which applied expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. applied performs the following five steps to determine when to recognize revenue: (1) identification of the contract(s) with customers, (2) identification of the performance obligations in the contract, (3) determination of the transaction price, (4) allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract, and (5) recognition of revenue when, or as, a performance obligation is satisfied. management uses judgment to identify performance obligations within a contract and to determine whether multiple promised goods or services in a contract should be accounted for separately or as a group. judgment is also used in interpreting commercial terms and determining when transfer of control occurs. moreover, judgment is used to estimate the contract's transaction price and allocate it to each performance obligation. any material changes in the identification of performance obligations, determination and allocation of the transaction price to performance obligations, and determination of when transfer of control occurs to the customer, could impact the timing and amount of revenue recognition, which could have a material effect on applied's financial condition and results of operations.
warranty costs applied provides for the estimated cost of warranty when revenue is recognized. estimated warranty costs are determined by analyzing specific product, current and historical configuration statistics and regional warranty support costs. applied's warranty obligation is affected by product and component failure rates, material usage and labor costs incurred in correcting product failures during the warranty period. as applied's customer engineers and process support engineers are highly trained and deployed globally, labor availability is a significant factor in determining labor costs. the quantity and availability of critical replacement parts is another significant factor in estimating warranty costs. unforeseen component failures or exceptional component performance can also result in changes to warranty costs. if actual warranty costs differ substantially from applied's estimates, revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be required, which could have a material effect on applied's business, financial condition and results of operations.
allowance for credit losses applied maintains an allowance for credit losses for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments. this allowance is based on historical experience, credit evaluations, specific customer collection history and any customer-specific issues applied has identified. changes in circumstances, such as an unexpected material adverse change in a major customer's ability to meet its financial obligation to applied or its payment trends, may require applied to further adjust its estimates of the recoverability of amounts due to applied, which could have a material adverse effect on applied's business, financial condition and results of operations.
inventory valuation inventories are generally stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value, with cost determined on a first-in, first-out (fifo) basis. the carrying value of inventory is reduced for estimated obsolescence by the difference between its cost and the estimated net realizable value based upon assumptions about future demand. applied evaluates the inventory carrying value for potential excess and obsolete inventory exposures by analyzing historical and anticipated demand. in addition, inventories are evaluated for potential obsolescence due to the effect of known and anticipated engineering change orders and new products. if actual demand were to be substantially lower than estimated, additional adjustments for excess or obsolete inventory may be required, which could have a material adverse effect on applied's business, financial condition and results of operations.
goodwill and intangible assets applied reviews goodwill and intangible assets for impairment annually during the fourth quarter of each fiscal year and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable. the process of evaluating the potential impairment of goodwill and intangible assets requires significant judgment, especially in emerging markets. when reviewing goodwill for impairment, applied first performs a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value.
in performing a qualitative assessment, applied considers business conditions and other factors including, but not limited to (i) adverse industry or economic trends, (ii) restructuring actions and lower projections that may impact future operating results, (iii) sustained decline in share price, and (iv) overall financial performance and other events affecting the reporting units. if applied concludes that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, then a quantitative impairment test is performed by estimating the fair value of the reporting unit and comparing it to its carrying value. if the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, applied would record an impairment charge equal to the excess of the carrying value of the reporting unit over its fair value.
applied determines the fair value of each reporting unit based on a weighting of an income and a market approach. applied bases the fair value estimates on assumptions that it believes to be reasonable but that are unpredictable and inherently uncertain. under the income approach, applied estimates the fair value based on discounted cash flow method.
the estimates used in the impairment testing are consistent with the discrete forecasts that applied uses to manage its business, and considers any significant developments during the period. under the discounted cash flow method, cash flows beyond the discrete forecasts are estimated using a terminal growth rate, which considers the long-term earnings growth rate specific to the reporting units. the estimated future cash flows are discounted to present value using each reporting unit's weighted average cost of capital. the weighted average cost of capital measures a reporting unit's cost of debt and equity financing weighted by the percentage of debt and equity in a reporting unit's target capital structure. in addition, the weighted average cost of capital is derived using both known and estimated market metrics, and is adjusted to reflect both the timing and risks associated with the estimated cash flows. the tax rate used in the discounted cash flow method is the median tax rate of comparable companies and reflects applied's current international structure, which is consistent with the market participant perspective. under the market approach, applied uses the guideline company method which applies market multiples to forecasted revenues and earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization. applied uses market multiples that are consistent with comparable publicly-traded companies and considers each reporting unit's size, growth and profitability relative to its comparable companies.
intangible assets, such as purchased technology, are generally recorded in connection with a business acquisition. the value assigned to intangible assets is usually based on estimates and judgments regarding expectations for the success and life cycle of products and technology acquired. if actual product acceptance differs significantly from the estimates, applied may be required to record an impairment charge to reduce the carrying value of the reporting unit to its estimated fair value.
income taxes applied's provision for income taxes and effective tax rate are affected by the geographical composition of pre-tax income which includes jurisdictions with differing tax rates, conditional reduced tax rates and other income tax incentives. it is also affected by events that are not consistent from period to period, such as changes to income tax laws and the resolution of prior years' income tax filings.
applied recognizes a current tax liability for the estimated amount of income tax payable on tax returns for the current fiscal year. deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax effects of temporary differences between the book and tax bases of assets and liabilities. deferred tax assets are also recognized for net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. deferred tax assets are offset by a valuation allowance to the extent it is more likely than not that they are not expected to be realized.
applied recognizes tax benefits from uncertain tax positions only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained upon examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position. the tax benefits recognized from such positions are estimated based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. any changes in judgment related to uncertain tax positions are recognized in applied's provision for income taxes in the quarter in which such change occurs. interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions are recognized in applied's provision for income taxes.
the calculation of applied's provision for income taxes and effective tax rate involves significant judgment in estimating the impact of uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws. resolution of these uncertainties in a manner inconsistent with applied's expectations could have a material impact on applied's results of operations and financial condition.
non-gaap adjusted financial results management uses non-gaap adjusted financial measures to evaluate the company's operating and financial performance and for planning purposes, and as performance measures in its executive compensation program. applied believes these measures enhance an overall understanding of its performance and investors' ability to review the company's business from the same perspective as the company's management and facilitate comparisons of this period's results with prior periods on a consistent basis by excluding items that management does not believe are indicative of applied's ongoing operating performance.
the non-gaap adjusted financial measures presented below are adjusted to exclude the impact of certain costs, expenses, gains and losses, including certain items related to mergers and acquisitions; restructuring and severance charges and any associated adjustments; certain incremental expenses related to covid-19; impairments of assets; gain or loss on strategic investments; loss on early extinguishment of debt; certain income tax items and other discrete adjustments. reconciliations of these non-gaap measures to the most directly comparable financial measures calculated and presented in accordance with gaap are provided in the financial tables presented below. there are limitations in using non-gaap financial measures because the non-gaap financial measures are not prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, may be different from non-gaap financial measures used by other companies, and may exclude certain items that may have a material impact upon our reported financial results. the presentation of this additional information is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the directly comparable financial measures prepared in accordance with gaap.

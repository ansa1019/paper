key challenges truist's business is dynamic and complex. consequently, management annually evaluates and, as necessary, adjusts the company's business strategy in the context of the current operating environment. during this process, management considers the current financial condition and performance of the company and its expectations for future economic activity from both a national and local market perspective. achieving key strategic objectives and established long-term financial goals is subject to many uncertainties and challenges. in the opinion of management, the following challenges are the most likely to impact truist's near to medium term performance:
•activating the company's culture of striving to make life better for clients, teammates and stakeholders;
•achieving the benefits from the merger, including anticipated synergies and cost savings;
•managing the integration of systems and operations, while safeguarding the company against external threats;
•executing the company's "t3 strategy" by focusing on personal touch and technology to engender trust and provide distinctive, secure and successful client experiences;
•driving innovation and remaining attuned to evolving client preferences to succeed in an intensely competitive environment;
•onboarding and retaining key personnel while maintaining safety protocols to protect clients, teammates and communities; and
•navigating economic risks and actively managing credit exposures impacted by the covid-19 pandemic.
in addition, certain other challenges and unforeseen events could have a near term impact on truist's financial condition and results of operations. see the sections titled "forward-looking statements" and "risk factors" for additional examples of such challenges.
analysis of results of operations net interest income and nim
2020 compared to 2019
the net interest margin was 3.22% for the year ended december 31, 2020, down 20 basis points compared to the earlier period. average earning assets increased $217.2 billion, which primarily reflects a $152.9 billion increase in average total loans and leases, a $32.6 billion increase in average securities, a $28.4 billion increase in average other earning assets and a $3.4 billion increase in interest earning trading assets. average interest-bearing liabilities increased $153.7 billion. average interest-bearing deposits increased $131.0 billion, average long-term debt increased $21.0 billion and average short-term borrowings increased $1.7 billion. the significant increases in earnings assets and liabilities are primarily due to the merger, as well as impacts from the covid-19 pandemic and the resulting government stimulus programs.
the yield on the total loan portfolio for the year ended december 31, 2020 was 4.33%, down 66 basis points compared to the earlier period, reflecting the impact of rate decreases and deferred interest for loans granted an accommodation in connection with covid-19, partially offset by purchase accounting accretion from merged loans. the yield on the average securities portfolio for the year ended december 31, 2020 was 2.09%, down 53 basis points compared to the earlier period primarily due to lower yields on new purchases and higher premium amortization. the average cost of total deposits was 0.22%, down 42 basis points compared to the earlier period. the average cost of interest-bearing deposits was 0.32%, down 61 basis points compared to the earlier period. the average rate on short-term borrowings was 1.35%, down 99 basis points compared to the earlier period. the average rate on long-term debt was 1.75%, down 147 basis points compared to the earlier period. the lower rates on interest-bearing liabilities reflect the lower rate environment. the lower rates on long-term debt also reflect the amortization of the fair value mark on the assumed debt and the issuance of new long-term debt.
as of december 31, 2020, the remaining unamortized fair value marks on the loan and lease portfolio, deposits and long-term debt were $2.4 billion, $19 million and $216 million, respectively. the remaining unamortized fair value mark on loans and leases consists of $1.1 billion for commercial loans and leases and $1.3 billion for consumer loans and leases. these amounts will be recognized over the remaining contractual lives of the underlying instruments or as paydowns occur.
the major components of net interest income and the related annualized yields as well as the variances between the periods caused by changes in interest rates versus changes in volumes are summarized below.

truist financial corporation 45
provision for credit losses
2020 compared to 2019
the provision for credit losses was $2.3 billion, compared to $615 million for the earlier period. the increase in the provision for credit losses reflects the significant builds to the allowance for credit losses in the first and second quarters of the year due to increased economic stress associated with the pandemic and specific consideration of its impact on certain industries, as well as uncertainty related to performance after the expiration of relief packages and covid-19, increased loan balances arising from the merger and the effect of applying the cecl methodology in the current period compared to the incurred loss methodology in the earlier period.
net charge-offs for the year ended december 31, 2020 were $1.1 billion, compared to $634 million for the earlier period. higher net charge-offs also contributed to the increase in the provision for credit losses and primarily reflect increases as a result of the merger. the net charge-off rate of 0.36% for the year ended december 31, 2020 was down four basis points compared to the earlier period.
noninterest income noninterest income is a significant contributor to truist's financial results. management focuses on diversifying its sources of revenue to reduce truist's reliance on traditional spread-based interest income, as certain fee-based activities are a relatively stable revenue source during periods of changing interest rates.

2020 compared to 2019
noninterest income for the year ended december 31, 2020 increased $3.6 billion compared to the earlier period. the current period includes $402 million of net securities gains primarily from the sale of non-agency mbs in the second quarter of 2020 and agency mbs in the third quarter of 2020. the prior period includes $116 million of net securities losses from the sale of agency mbs. excluding the net securities gains and losses, noninterest income increased $3.1 billion, with nearly all categories of noninterest income being impacted by the merger. in addition to the impacts from the merger, insurance income increased $121 million due to strong production and acquisitions. service charges on deposits were up despite reduced overdraft incident rates and increased refunds and waivers to support clients impacted by the covid-19 pandemic. residential mortgage banking income was up due to strong production and refinance activity driven by the lower rate environment, partially offset by lower valuations of the mortgage servicing rights and increased amortization driven by higher prepayments speeds. investment banking and trading income was up, but was negatively impacted by credit valuation adjustments on the derivatives portfolio primarily related to the decline in interest rates and widening of credit spreads.

commercial loan and lease portfolio commercial loans and leases represent the largest category of the company's loan and lease portfolio. commercial community banking generally targets small-to-middle market businesses with annual sales between $2 million and $500 million, while cib provides lending solutions to large commercial clients. the commercial loan and lease portfolio consists of lending to public and private business clients and is composed of commercial and industrial, owner occupied, equipment leasing and financing and commercial real estate, as well as government and institutional financing.

in accordance with the company's lending policy, each commercial loan undergoes a detailed underwriting process. commercial loans are typically priced with an interest rate tied to market indices, such as the prime rate, libor, or sofr and are individually monitored and reviewed for deterioration in the ability of the client to repay the loan. the majority of truist's commercial loans are secured by real estate, business equipment, inventories and other types of collateral.
residential mortgage loan portfolio truist bank offers various types of fixed and adjustable-rate loans for the purpose of constructing, purchasing or refinancing residential properties. truist primarily originates conforming mortgage loans and higher quality jumbo and construction-to-permanent loans for owner-occupied properties. conforming loans are loans that are underwritten in accordance with the underwriting standards set forth by fnma and fhlmc. they are generally collateralized by one-to-four-family residential real estate, typically have loan-to-collateral value ratios of 80% or less at origination, or have mortgage insurance as required by investors and are made to borrowers in good credit standing.
risks associated with mortgage lending include interest rate risk, which is mitigated through the sale of a substantial portion of conforming fixed-rate loans in the secondary mortgage market and an effective msr hedging process. credit risk is managed through rigorous underwriting procedures and mortgage insurance. the right to service the loans and receive servicing income is generally retained when conforming loans are sold. management believes that the retention of mortgage servicing is a relationship driver in retail banking and a part of management's strategy to establish long-term client relationships and offer high quality client service. truist also purchases residential mortgage loans from correspondent originators. the loans purchased from third party originators are subject to substantially the same underwriting and risk-management criteria as loans originated internally.
residential home equity and direct loan portfolio the residential home equity and direct loan portfolio is composed of a wide variety of secured and unsecured loans offered through truist's branch network, as well as loans originated by lightstream, truist's national online consumer lending division. loans originated through the truist branch network include revolving home equity lines of credit secured by first or second liens on residential real estate and certain other secured and unsecured lending marketed to qualifying clients and other creditworthy candidates in truist's market areas. lightstream provides fixed-rate, unsecured lending to consumers with strong credit through its proprietary online loan origination system.
indirect auto loan portfolio the indirect auto portfolio primarily includes secured indirect installment loans to consumers for the purchase of new and used automobiles. the indirect auto portfolio also includes nonprime and near prime automobile finance. such loans are originated through approved franchised and independent dealers throughout the truist market area and nationally through regional acceptance corporation. these loans are relatively homogeneous and no single loan is individually significant in terms of its size and potential risk of loss. indirect auto loans are subject to rigorous lending policies and procedures and are underwritten with note amounts and credit limits that are consistent with the company's risk philosophy. in addition to its normal underwriting due diligence, truist uses application systems and scoring systems to help underwrite and manage the credit risk in its indirect auto portfolio.
indirect other loan portfolio the indirect other portfolio includes secured indirect installment loans to consumers for the purchase of new and used boats and recreational vehicles. the indirect other portfolio also includes small ticket consumer lending related to the purchase of power sports equipment. these loans are relatively homogeneous and no single loan is individually significant in terms of its size and potential risk of loss. these loans are subject to similar rigorous lending policies and procedures as the indirect auto loan portfolio. the indirect other loan portfolio also includes other indirect lending to consumers to finance home improvements, furniture purchases, and certain elective health-care services. these loans are originated in accordance with strict underwriting criteria as determined by truist.
student loan portfolio the student loan portfolio is composed of government guaranteed student loans and certain private student loans originated by third parties. the government guarantee mitigates substantially all of the risk related to principal and interest repayment for this component of the portfolio. private student loans were purchased from third party originators with credit enhancements that partially mitigate the company's credit exposure.
52 truist financial corporation credit card loan portfolio the credit card portfolio consists of the outstanding balances on credit cards. truist markets credit cards to its existing client base and does not solicit cardholders through nationwide programs or other forms of mass marketing. such balances are generally unsecured and actively managed.
pci prior to the adoption of cecl, the pci balance included loans acquired with credit deterioration subsequent to origination as well as loans that were formerly covered by loss sharing agreements. in connection with the adoption of cecl, all loans previously in the pci portfolio became pcd loans and were transferred to their respective portfolios.

loans and leases hfi were $299.7 billion at december 31, 2020, down $108 million compared to 2019.
commercial loans increased $7.3 billion during 2020. the growth in the commercial portfolio was primarily in commercial and industrial loans and reflects ppp loan originations, which was partially offset by lower utilization of commercial lines. truist served as the fourth largest ppp lender in 2020. the carrying value of ppp loans was $11.0 billion as of december 31, 2020. additionally, within the commercial and industrial portfolio, truist experienced growth in loans from mortgage warehouse lending due to the decline in rates and increased refinance activity. growth in commercial portfolios was partially offset by a decline in dealer floor plan lending and the transfer of $1.0 billion of certain loans and leases to held for sale related to the decision to exit a small ticket loan and lease portfolio.
consumer loans decreased $3.2 billion during 2020 primarily due to refinance activity resulting in a decline in residential mortgages and residential home equity and direct loans. this was partially offset by an increase in indirect auto due to expanded client offerings and an improving credit environment.
credit card loans decreased $780 million during 2020 due to lower business and consumer spending as a result of covid-19.
lhfs decreased $2.3 billion during 2020 primarily due to the sale of loans that had been placed in lhfs after the close of the merger and the branch divestiture in connection with the merger, partially offset by the transfer of $1.0 billion to lhfs due to the decision to exit a small ticket loan and lease portfolio.

the following table presents a summary of the commercial loan portfolio, segregated by contractual maturities and interest rate terms. determinations of maturities are based on contractual terms. truist's credit policy typically does not permit automatic renewal of loans. at the scheduled maturity date (including balloon payment date), the client generally must request a new loan to replace the matured loan and execute either a new note or note modification with rate, terms and conditions negotiated at that time.

(1)the past due status of loans that received a deferral under the cares act is generally frozen during the deferral period.
56 truist financial corporation nonperforming assets totaled $1.4 billion at december 31, 2020, up $703 million compared to december 31, 2019 primarily from the adoption of cecl, which resulted in the discontinuation of the pool-level accounting for pci loans and replaced that with a loan-level evaluation for nonaccrual status. as of december 31, 2019, there was approximately $500 million of pci loans that would have been classified as nonperforming had the company evaluated accrual status on a loan level basis. the remaining increase in nonperforming loans held for investment is primarily in commercial and industrial loans and an increase in nonperforming mortgage loans due to loans exiting certain accommodation programs related to the cares act. nonperforming loans and leases represented 0.44% of total loans and leases, up 26 basis points compared to december 31, 2019.
performing tdrs were up $381 million compared to the prior year primarily in residential mortgage, lease financing and indirect auto loans. this increase primarily reflects the application of acquisition accounting related to the merger, which resulted in the removal of the tdr designation on all loans that were restructured by suntrust prior to the merger date.
loans 90 days or more past due and still accruing totaled $2.0 billion at december 31, 2020, relatively flat compared to the prior year. in connection with the discontinuation of pool level accounting for pci loans, loans 90 days or more past due and still accruing decreased as loan-level evaluations resulted in certain loans being placed in nonaccrual status. this decrease was partially offset by an increase in government guaranteed student loans. additionally, residential mortgage loans 90 days or more past due increased primarily due to the repurchase of delinquent government guaranteed loans. the ratio of loans 90 days or more past due and still accruing as a percentage of loans and leases was 0.67% at december 31, 2020, an increase of 1 basis point from the prior year. excluding government guaranteed and pci loans, the ratio of loans 90 days or more past due and still accruing as a percentage of loans and leases was 0.04% at december 31, 2020, up 1 basis point from december 31, 2019.
loans 30-89 days past due and still accruing totaled $2.2 billion at december 31, 2020, relatively flat compared to the prior year. loans 30-89 days past due reflects a decrease in pci loans, offset by a corresponding increase in the portfolios where these loans were transferred in connection with the implementation of cecl. the ratio of loans 30-89 days or more past due and still accruing as a percentage of loans and leases was 0.74% at december 31, 2020, flat compared to the prior year.
problem loans include npls and loans that are 90 days or more past due and still accruing as disclosed in table 22. in addition, for the commercial portfolio segment, loans that are rated special mention or substandard performing are closely monitored by management as potential problem loans. refer to "note 5. loans and acl" for additional disclosures related to these potential problem loans.

tdrs occur when a borrower is experiencing, or is expected to experience, financial difficulties in the near term and a concession has been granted to the borrower. as a result, truist works with borrowers to prevent further difficulties and to improve the likelihood of recovery on a loan. to facilitate this process, a concessionary modification that would not otherwise be considered may be granted, resulting in classification of the loan as a tdr. in accordance with the cares act, truist implemented loan modification programs in response to the covid-19 pandemic in order to provide borrowers with flexibility with respect to repayment terms. payment relief assistance provided by truist includes forbearance, deferrals, extension and re-aging programs, along with certain other modification strategies. the company adopted certain provisions of the cares act and other regulatory guidance that provide relief from the requirement to apply tdr accounting to (1) certain modifications of federally backed mortgages upon request from the borrower, and (2) certain modifications of other non-federally backed mortgages for borrowers impacted by the covid-19 pandemic that were less than 30 days past due at december 31, 2019. refer to "note 1. basis of presentation" for truist's policy related to tdrs and covid-19 loan modifications.
tdrs identified by suntrust prior to the merger date are not included in truist's tdr disclosure because all such loans were recorded at fair value and a new accounting basis was established as of the merger date. subsequent modifications are evaluated for potential treatment as tdrs in accordance with truist's accounting policies.

(2)represent loans that no longer meet the requirements necessary to reflect the loan in accruing status.
tdr classification may be removed due to the passage of time if the loan: (i) did not include a forgiveness of principal or interest, (ii) has performed in accordance with the modified terms (generally a minimum of six months), (iii) was reported as a tdr over a year-end reporting period, and (iv) reflected an interest rate on the modified loan that was no less than a market rate at the date of modification. tdr classification may also be removed for an accruing loan upon the occurrence of a subsequent non-concessionary modification granted at market terms and within current underwriting guidelines. in connection with consumer tdrs, a npl will be returned to accruing status when (i) the borrower has resumed paying the full amount of the scheduled contractual interest and principal payments, (ii) management concludes that all principal and interest amounts contractually due (including arrearages) are reasonably assured of repayment, and (iii) there is a sustained period of repayment performance, generally a minimum of six months.

the acl totaled $6.2 billion at december 31, 2020, compared to $1.9 billion at december 31, 2019. the increase in the allowance for credit losses was primarily due to the adoption of cecl. upon adoption, the company recorded a $3.1 billion increase in the allowance for credit losses, including $2.8 billion that was charged to retained earnings before tax, and $378 million related to the gross up for pcd loans. the remaining increase in the allowance for credit losses primarily reflects deteriorated economic conditions. as of december 31, 2020, the allowance for loan and lease losses was 1.95% of loans and leases held for investment. the allowance for credit losses includes $5.8 billion for loans and leases and $364 million for the reserve for unfunded commitments.
at december 31, 2020, the allowance for loan and lease losses was 4.39 times nonperforming loans and leases held for investment, compared to 3.41 times at december 31, 2019. at december 31, 2020, the allowance for loan and lease losses was 5.21 times annualized net charge-offs, compared to 2.44 times at december 31, 2019.
60 truist financial corporation net charge-offs during 2020 totaled $1.1 billion, up $485 million compared to the prior year. the increase in net charge-offs primarily reflects the merger. as a percentage of average loans and leases, annualized net charge-offs were 0.36%, down four basis points compared to the prior year. current year net charge-offs include $97 million of charge-offs related to the implementation of cecl, which required a gross-up of loan carrying values in connection with the establishment of an allowance on pcd loans. management performed a comprehensive review of pcd assets during the year and concluded in certain situations that a charge-off was required. excluding these additional charge-offs, net charge-offs would have been an annualized 0.33% of average loans and leases for 2020, down seven basis points compared to the prior year.
the following table presents an allocation of the alll. the entire amount of the allowance is available to absorb losses occurring in any category of loans and leases.

truist monitors the performance of its home equity loans and lines secured by second liens similarly to other consumer loans and utilizes assumptions specific to these loans in determining the necessary alll. truist also receives notification when the first lien holder, whether truist or another financial institution, has initiated foreclosure proceedings against the borrower. when notified that the first lien is in the process of foreclosure, truist obtains valuations to determine if any additional charge-offs or reserves are warranted. these valuations are updated at least annually thereafter.
truist has limited ability to monitor the delinquency status of the first lien, unless the first lien is held or serviced by truist. as a result, using migration assumptions that are based on historical experience and adjusted for current trends, truist estimates the volume of second lien positions where the first lien is delinquent and adjusts the alll to reflect the increased risk of loss on these credits. finally, truist also provides additional reserves for second lien positions when the estimated combined current loan to value ratio for the credit exceeds 100%. as of december 31, 2020, truist held or serviced the first lien on 30.6% of its second lien positions.

funding activities deposits are the primary source of funds for the company's lending and investing activities. scheduled payments and maturities from portfolios of loans and investment securities also provide a stable source of funds. fhlb advances, other secured borrowings, federal funds purchased and other short-term borrowed funds, as well as long-term debt issued through the capital markets, all provide supplemental liquidity sources. funding activities are monitored and governed through truist's overall alm process under the governance and oversight of the mrlcc, which is further discussed in the "market risk management" section in md&a. the following section provides a brief description of the various sources of funds.
deposits deposits are obtained principally from individuals and businesses within truist's branch network and include noninterest-bearing checking accounts, interest-bearing checking accounts, savings accounts, money market deposit accounts, cds and iras. deposit account terms vary with respect to the minimum balance required, the time period the funds must remain on deposit and service charge schedules. interest rates paid on specific deposit types are determined based on (i) competitor deposit rates, (ii) the anticipated amount and timing of funding needs, (iii) the availability and cost of alternative sources of funding, and (iv) anticipated future economic conditions and interest rates. deposits are attractive sources of funding because of their stability and relative cost.
the following table presents deposits for each of the last five years:

at december 31, 2020, short-term borrowings totaled $6.1 billion, a decrease of $12.1 billion compared to december 31, 2019, due primarily to a decrease of $10.8 billion in short-term fhlb advances. these borrowing sources were replaced with deposit funding.
truist financial corporation 63
average short-term borrowings were $10.1 billion, or 2.4% of total funding for 2020, as compared to $8.5 billion, or 4.1% for the prior year. the increase in the average amount was due to the merger. average short-term borrowings decreased as a percentage of funding sources due to strong deposit growth.
long-term debt provides funding and, to a lesser extent, regulatory capital, and primarily consists of senior and subordinated notes issued by truist and truist bank. long-term debt totaled $39.6 billion at december 31, 2020, a decrease of $1.7 billion compared to december 31, 2019. during 2020, the company issued $4.8 billion of senior notes with interest rates from 1.125% to 1.95% maturing in 2023 to 2030, $500 million in floating rate senior notes maturing in 2023 and $1.3 billion of subordinated notes with an interest rate of 2.25% maturing in 2030. these issuances were partially offset by the redemption of $4.6 billion of senior notes during 2020 and a decrease of $3.3 billion in long-term fhlb advances. fhlb advances represented 2.2% of total outstanding long-term debt at december 31, 2020, compared to 10.0% at december 31, 2019. the average cost of long-term debt was 1.75% for the year ended december 31, 2020, down 147 basis points compared to the same period in 2019. truist entered into $20 billion of fhlb advances during 2020 to build liquidity and ensure the company was able to meet the funding needs of its clients. as market conditions stabilized and deposits increased, these advances were repaid and the company recognized a loss of $235 million on the early extinguishment of debt. the repayment of these advances improved net interest income, the net interest margin and the leverage ratios.
shareholders' equity total shareholders' equity was $70.9 billion at december 31, 2020, an increase of $4.4 billion from december 31, 2019. this increase includes the gross issuance of $3.5 billion of preferred stock during the year, $4.5 billion in net income available to common shareholders and an increase of $1.6 billion in aoci, which was partially offset by $2.1 billion related to the adoption of cecl and $2.7 billion for common and preferred dividends. in addition, truist redeemed $500 million of its series k preferred stock during 2020. truist's book value per common share at december 31, 2020 was $46.52, compared to $45.66 at december 31, 2019.

risk management truist maintains a comprehensive risk management framework supported by people, processes and systems to identify, measure, monitor, manage and report significant risks arising from its exposures and business activities. effective risk management involves optimizing risk and return while operating in a safe and sound manner and promoting compliance with applicable laws and regulations. the company's risk management framework promotes the execution of business strategies and objectives in alignment with its risk appetite.
truist has developed and employs a risk taxonomy that further guides business functions in identifying, measuring, responding to, monitoring and reporting on possible exposures to the organization. the risk taxonomy drives internal risk conversations and enables truist to clearly and transparently communicate to stakeholders the level of potential risk the company faces, both presently and in the future, and the company's position on managing it to acceptable levels.
truist is committed to fostering a culture that supports identification and escalation of risks across the organization. all teammates are responsible for upholding the company's purpose, mission, and values, and are encouraged to speak up if there is any activity or behavior that is inconsistent with the company's culture. the truist code of ethics guides the company's decision making and informs teammates on how to act in the absence of specific guidance.
truist seeks an appropriate return for the risk taken in its business operations. risk-taking activities are evaluated and prioritized to identify those that present attractive risk-adjusted returns, while preserving asset value and capital.
compensation decisions take into account a teammate's adherence to, and successful implementation of, truist's risk values and associated policies and procedures. the company's compensation structure supports its core values and sound risk management practices in an effort to promote judicious risk-taking behavior.
truist employs a comprehensive change management program to manage the risks associated with integrating heritage bb&t and heritage suntrust. the board and executive leadership oversee the change management program, which is designed to ensure key decisions are reviewed and that there is appropriate oversight of integration activities.
truist's purpose, mission and values are the foundation for the risk management framework utilized at truist and therefore serve as the basis on which the risk appetite and risk strategy are built. truist's rmo provides independent oversight and guidance for risk-taking across the enterprise. in keeping with the belief that consistent values drive long-term behaviors, truist's rmo has established the following risk values which guide teammates' day-to-day activities:
64 truist financial corporation
•managing risk is the responsibility of every teammate.
•proactively identifying risk and managing the inherent risks of their businesses is the responsibility of the business units.
•managing risk with a balanced approach which includes quality, profitability, and growth.
•measuring what is managed and managing what is measured.
•utilizing sound and consistent risk management practices.
•thoroughly analyzing risk quantitatively and qualitatively.
•realizing lower cost of capital from high quality risk management.
truist places significant emphasis on risk management oversight and maintains a separate board-level risk committee, which assists the board in its oversight of the company's risk management function. the committee is responsible for approving and periodically reviewing the company's risk management framework and risk management policies as well as monitoring the company's risk profile, approving risk appetite statements, and providing input to management regarding truist's risk appetite and risk profile.
the rmo is led by the cro and is responsible for overseeing the identification, measurement, monitoring, management and reporting of risk. the cro has direct access to the board to communicate any risk issues (current or emerging) as well as the performance of the risk management activities throughout the enterprise.
as illustrated below, the risk management framework is supported by three lines of defense. the following figure describes the roles of the three lines of defense:
truist's risk governance framework is designed to provide comprehensive board and executive leadership risk oversight, maintaining a committee governance structure that is designed to ensure alignment and execution of the risk management framework. the committee structure provides a mechanism to allow for efficient aggregation and escalation of risk information from the bus up to the risk programs, executive leadership and ultimately the board.
truist financial corporation 65
the executive level committees include the erc, ecrpmc, mrlcc, ebpcc, tmc and dc, each of which is chaired by a member of executive leadership. these committees provide oversight of each of the primary risk types.
the erc establishes a fully integrated view of risks across the company, provides broad strategic oversight of all risk types, and oversees corporate-wide strategies for identifying, assessing, controlling, measuring, monitoring and reporting risk at the enterprise level.
the erc is responsible for maintaining an effective risk management framework and monitoring its adoption and execution across the enterprise. the erc is chaired by the cro and its membership includes all members of executive leadership and the general auditor.
the principal types of inherent risk include market, credit, liquidity, compliance, strategic, reputational, operational and technology risks. the following is a discussion of these risks.
market risk market risk is the risk to current or anticipated earnings, capital or economic value arising from changes in the market value of portfolios, securities, or other financial instruments. market risk results from changes in the level, volatility or correlations among financial market risk factors or prices, including interest rates, credit spreads, foreign exchange rates, equity, and commodity prices.
effective management of market risk is essential to achieving truist's strategic financial objectives. truist's most significant market risk exposure is to interest rate risk in its balance sheet; however, market risk also results from underlying product liquidity risk, price risk and volatility risk in truist's bus. interest rate risk results from differences between the timing of rate changes and the timing of cash flows associated with assets and liabilities (re-pricing risk); from changing rate relationships among different yield curves affecting bank activities (basis risk); from changing rate relationships across the spectrum of maturities (yield curve risk); and from interest-related options inherently embedded in bank products (options risk).
the primary objectives of effective market risk management are to minimize adverse effects from changes in market risk factors on net interest income, net income and capital and to offset the risk of price changes for certain assets and liabilities recorded at fair value. at truist, market risk management also includes the enterprise-wide ipv function.
66 truist financial corporation interest rate market risk as a financial institution, truist is exposed to interest rate risk both on its assets and on its liabilities. since interest rate changes are out of the control of any private sector institution, truist actively manages its interest rate risk exposure through the strategic repricing of its assets and liabilities, taking into account the volumes, maturities and mix, with the goal of keeping net interest margin as stable as possible. truist primarily uses three methods to measure and monitor its interest rate risk: (i) simulations of possible changes to net interest income over the next two years based on gradual changes in interest rates; (ii) analysis of interest rate shock scenarios; and (iii) analysis of economic value of equity based on changes in interest rates.
the company's simulation model takes into account assumptions related to prepayment trends, using a combination of market data and internal historical experiences for deposits and loans, as well as scheduled maturities and payments and the expected outlook for the economy and interest rates. these assumptions are reviewed and adjusted monthly to reflect changes in current interest rates compared to the rates applicable to truist's assets and liabilities. the model also considers truist's current and prospective liquidity position, current balance sheet volumes and projected growth and/or contractions, accessibility of funds for short-term needs and capital maintenance.
deposit betas are an important assumption in the interest rate risk modeling process. truist applies an average deposit beta (the sensitivity of deposit rate changes relative to market rate changes) of approximately 50% to its non-maturity interest-bearing deposit accounts when determining its interest rate sensitivity. non-maturity, interest-bearing deposit accounts include interest checking accounts, savings accounts and money market accounts that do not have a contractual maturity. truist also regularly conducts sensitivity analyses on other key variables, including noninterest-bearing deposits, to determine the impact these variables could have on the company's interest rate risk position. the predictive value of the simulation model depends upon the accuracy of the assumptions, but management believes that it provides helpful information for the management of interest rate risk.
the following table shows the effect that the indicated changes in interest rates would have on net interest income as projected for the next 12 months assuming a gradual change in interest rates as described below.

truist has established parameters related to interest rate sensitivity measures that prescribe a maximum impact on net interest income under different interest rate scenarios that would result in an escalation to the board. the following parameters and interest rate scenarios are considered truist's primary measures of interest rate risk:
•maximum impact on net interest income of 7.5% for the next 12 months assuming a 25 basis point change in interest rates each quarter for four quarters; and a
•maximum impact on net interest income of 10% for an immediate 100 basis point parallel change in rates.
this interest rate shock analysis is designed to create an outer bound of acceptable interest rate risk.
management considers how the interest rate risk position could be impacted by changes in balance sheet mix. liquidity in the banking industry has been very strong during the current economic cycle. much of this liquidity increase has resulted in growth in noninterest-bearing demand deposits. consistent with the industry, truist has seen a significant increase in this funding source. the behavior of these deposits is one of the most important assumptions used in determining the interest rate risk position of truist. a decrease in the amount of these deposits in the future would reduce the asset sensitivity of truist's balance sheet because the company would increase interest-bearing funds to offset the loss of this advantageous funding source.
the following table shows the results of truist's interest-rate sensitivity position assuming the loss of demand deposits and an associated increase in managed rate deposits under various scenarios. for purposes of this analysis, truist modeled the incremental beta of managed rate deposits for the replacement of the demand deposits at 100%.

(1)the base scenario is equal to the annualized hypothetical percentage change in net interest income at december 31, 2020 as presented in the preceding table.
truist also uses an eve analysis to focus on longer-term projected changes in asset and liability values given potential changes in interest rates. this measure allows truist to analyze interest rate risk that falls outside the net interest income simulation period. the eve model is a discounted cash flow of the portfolio of assets, liabilities and derivative instruments. the difference in the present value of assets minus the present value of liabilities is defined as eve.
the following table shows the effect that the indicated changes in interest rates would have on eve:

truist uses financial instruments including derivatives to manage interest rate risk related to securities, commercial loans, msrs and mortgage banking operations, long-term debt and other funding sources. during october 2020, truist initiated a new investment securities fair value hedging program, using fixed interest rate swaps to hedge prepayable securities. truist also uses derivatives to facilitate transactions on behalf of its clients and as part of associated hedging activities. as of december 31, 2020, truist had derivative financial instruments outstanding with notional amounts totaling $322.9 billion, with an associated net fair value of $3.3 billion. see "note 19. derivative financial instruments" for additional disclosures.
libor in its current form was anticipated to no longer be available after 2021. for most tenors of u.s. dollar libor, subject to the results of a consultation period ending january 2021, the administrator of libor is considering extending publication until june 30, 2023. tenors used infrequently by truist, including one week and two month u.s. dollar libor, are still anticipated to cease publication at december 31, 2021, based on this new guidance. truist has u.s. dollar libor-based contracts that extend beyond june 30, 2023. to prepare for the transition to an alternative reference rate, management has formed a cross-functional project team to address the libor transition. the project team has performed an assessment to identify the potential risks related to the transition from libor to a new index. the project team provides updates to executive leadership and the board.
contract fallback language for existing loans and leases is under review and certain contracts will need updated provisions for the transition. current fallback language used for new, renewed, and modified contracts is generally consistent with arrc recommendations. updates to current fallback language will be evaluated according to new regulatory guidance for the extension of timelines for the transition and expectations for production of u.s. dollar libor contracts during 2021. truist continues to manage the impact of these contracts and other financial instruments, systems implications, hedging strategies, and related operational and market risks on established project plans for business and operational readiness for the transition. market risks associated with this change are dependent on the alternative reference rates available and market conditions at transition. for a further discussion of the various risks associated with the potential cessation of libor and the transition to alternative reference rates, refer to the section titled "item1a. risk factors." in 2020, truist began offering sofr-based lending solutions to wholesale and consumer clients, and entered into sofr-based derivative contracts. truist expects sofr to become a more commonly-used pricing benchmark across the industry. truist continues to evaluate sofr for additional product offerings and other alternative reference rates as replacements for libor.
market risk from trading activities as a financial intermediary, truist provides its clients access to derivatives, foreign exchange and securities markets, which generate market risks. trading market risk is managed using a comprehensive risk management approach, which includes measuring risk using var, stress testing and sensitivity analysis. risk metrics are monitored against a suite of limits on a daily basis at both the trading desk level and at the aggregate portfolio level, which is intended to ensure that exposures are in line with truist's risk appetite.
truist is also subject to risk-based capital guidelines for market risk under the market risk rule.
68 truist financial corporation covered trading positions covered positions subject to the market risk rule include trading assets and liabilities, specifically those held for the purpose of short-term resale or with the intent of benefiting from actual or expected short-term price movements, or to lock in arbitrage profits. truist's trading portfolio of covered positions results primarily from market making and underwriting services for the company's clients, as well as associated risk mitigating hedging activity. the trading portfolio, measured in terms of var, consists primarily of four sub-portfolios of covered positions: (i) credit trading, (ii) fixed income securities, (iii) interest rate derivatives and (iv) equity derivatives. as a market maker across different asset classes, truist's trading portfolio also contains other sub-portfolios, including foreign exchange, loan trading, and commodity derivatives; however, these portfolios do not generate material trading risk exposures.
valuation policies, procedures, and methodologies exist for all covered positions. additionally, trading positions are subject to independent price verification. see "note 19. derivative financial instruments," "note 18. fair value disclosures," and "critical accounting policies" herein for discussion of valuation policies, procedures and methodologies.
securitizations as of december 31, 2020, the aggregate market value of on-balance sheet securitization positions subject to the market risk rule was not material. consistent with the market risk rule requirements, the company performs pre-purchase due diligence on each securitization position to identify the characteristics including, but not limited to, deal structure and the asset quality of the underlying assets, that materially affect valuation and performance. securitization positions are subject to truist's comprehensive risk management framework, which includes daily monitoring against a suite of limits. there were no off-balance sheet securitization positions during the reporting period.
correlation trading positions the trading portfolio of covered positions did not contain any correlation trading positions as of december 31, 2020.
var-based measures var measures the potential loss of a given position or portfolio of positions at a specified confidence level and time horizon. truist utilizes a historical var methodology to measure and aggregate risks across its covered trading positions. prior to the integration of the two institutional broker dealer businesses to form truist securities in the third quarter of 2020, truist operated two historical var models and the aggregate company-wide var across the systems was determined additively with no benefit of diversification. the heritage bb&t var model was retired following the formation of truist securities. following the formation of truist securities, var is calculated on a consolidated basis using the truist var engine. for risk management purposes, the var calculation is based on a historical simulation approach and measures the potential trading losses using a one-day holding period at a one-tail, 99% confidence level. for market risk rule purposes, the company calculates var using a 10-day holding period and a 99% confidence level. due to inherent limitations of the var methodology, such as the assumption that past market behavior is indicative of future market performance, var is only one of several tools used to measure and manage market risk. other tools used to actively manage market risk include stress testing, profit and loss attribution, and stop loss limits.
the trading portfolio's var profile is influenced by a variety of factors, including the size and composition of the portfolio, market volatility and the correlation between different positions. a portfolio of trading positions is typically less risky than the sum of the risk from each of the individual sub-portfolios, because, under normal market conditions, risk within each category partially offsets the exposure to other risk categories. the following table summarizes certain var-based measures for both the three and twelve months ended december 31, 2020 and 2019. the increase from the prior year was mainly due to the integration of the heritage suntrust trading business and the market volatility due to the covid-19 pandemic. as illustrated in the tables below, the inclusion of volatility levels observed in march 2020 in the 12-month var historic look-back window led to a convergence between var and stressed var measures.

the increase from the prior year in stressed var-based measures was due to the integration of heritage suntrust trading business after the merger and the market volatility due to the covid-19 pandemic.
specific risk measures specific risk is a measure of idiosyncratic risk that could result from risk factors other than broad market movements (e.g. default, event risks). the market risk rule provides fixed risk weights under a standardized measurement method while also allowing a model-based approach, subject to regulatory approval. truist utilizes the standardized measurement method to calculate the specific risk component of market risk regulatory capital. as such, incremental risk capital requirements do not apply.
var model backtesting in accordance with the market risk rule, the company evaluates the accuracy of its var model through daily backtesting by comparing aggregate daily trading gains and losses (excluding fees, commissions, reserves, net interest income, and intraday trading) from covered positions with the corresponding daily var-based measures generated by the model.
there were seven company-wide var backtesting exceptions during the twelve months ended december 31, 2020, primarily driven by the covid-19 pandemic, which led to a sudden and significant repricing of instruments in financial markets during the first and second quarters of 2020, as well as an increase in market volatility and deterioration in overall market liquidity. in accordance with established policy and procedure, all company-wide var backtesting exceptions are thoroughly reviewed in the context of var model use and performance. following such reviews, truist determined that the var model performed in line with expectations and that the significant moves in underlying market risk factors caused by the covid-19 pandemic would not typically have been captured within the 1-day var measure.
70 truist financial corporation model risk management mrm is responsible for the independent model validation of all decision tools and models including trading market risk models. the validation activities are conducted in accordance with mrm policy, which incorporates regulatory guidance related to the evaluation of model conceptual soundness, ongoing monitoring and outcomes analysis. as part of ongoing monitoring efforts, the performance of all trading risk models are reviewed regularly to preemptively address emerging developments in financial markets, assess evolving modeling approaches, and to identify potential model enhancement.
stress testing the company uses a comprehensive range of stress testing techniques to help monitor risks across trading desks and to augment standard daily var and other risk limits reporting. the stress testing framework is designed to quantify the impact of extreme, but plausible, stress scenarios that could lead to large unexpected losses. stress tests include simulations for historical repeats and hypothetical risk factor shocks. all trading positions within each applicable market risk category (interest rate risk, equity risk, foreign exchange rate risk, credit spread risk, and commodity price risk) are included in the company's comprehensive stress testing framework. management reviews stress testing scenarios on an ongoing basis and makes updates, as necessary, which is intended to ensure that both current and emerging risks are captured appropriately. management also utilizes stress analyses to support the company's capital adequacy assessment standards. see the "capital" section of this md&a for additional discussion of capital adequacy.
credit risk credit risk is the risk to current or anticipated earnings or capital arising from the default, inability or unwillingness of a borrower, obligor, or counterparty to meet the terms of any financial obligation to truist or otherwise perform as agreed. credit risk exists in all activities where success depends on the performance of a borrower, obligor, or counterparty. credit risk arises when truist funds are extended, committed, invested, or otherwise exposed through actual or implied contractual agreements, whether on or off-balance sheet. credit risk increases when the credit quality of an issuer whose securities or other instruments the bank holds deteriorates.
truist has established the following general practices to manage credit risk:
•limiting the amount of credit that individual lenders may extend to a borrower;
•establishing a process for credit approval accountability;
•careful initial underwriting and analysis of borrower, transaction, market and collateral risks;
•ongoing servicing and monitoring of individual loans and lending relationships;
•continuous monitoring of the portfolio, market dynamics and the economy; and
•periodically reevaluating the company's strategy and overall exposure as economic, market and other relevant conditions change.

the following discussion describes the underwriting procedures and overall risk management of truist's lending function.
underwriting approach the loan portfolio is a primary source of profitability and risk; therefore, proper loan underwriting is critical to truist's long-term financial success. truist's underwriting approach is designed to define acceptable combinations of specific risk-mitigating features that promote credit relationships that conform to truist's risk philosophy. provided below is a summary of the most significant underwriting criteria used to evaluate new loans and loan renewals:
•cash flow and debt service coverage - cash flow adequacy is a necessary condition of creditworthiness, meaning that loans must either be clearly supported by a borrower's cash flow or, if not, must be justified by secondary repayment sources.
•secondary sources of repayment - alternative repayment funds are a significant risk-mitigating factor as long as they are liquid, can be easily accessed, and provide adequate resources to supplement the primary cash flow source.
•value of any underlying collateral - loans are generally secured by the asset being financed. because an analysis of the primary and secondary sources of repayment is the most important factor, collateral, unless it is liquid, does not justify loans that cannot be serviced by the borrower's normal cash flows.
•overall creditworthiness of the client, taking into account the client's relationships, both past and current, with truist and other lenders - truist's success depends on building lasting and mutually beneficial relationships with clients, which involves assessing their financial position and background.
•level of equity invested in the transaction - in general, borrowers are required to contribute or invest a portion of their own funds prior to any loan advances.
refer to the "lending activities" section in this md&a for a discussion of each loan and lease portfolio.
liquidity risk liquidity risk is the risk that (i) truist will be unable to meet its obligations as they come due because of an inability to obtain adequate funding (funding liquidity risk), or (ii) truist cannot easily unwind or offset specific exposures without significantly lowering market prices because of inadequate market depth or market disruptions (market liquidity risk).
compliance risk compliance risk is the risk to current or anticipated earnings or capital arising from violations of laws, rules or regulations, or from non-conformance with prescribed practices, internal policies and procedures or ethical standards. this risk exposes truist to fines, civil monetary penalties, payment of damages and the voiding of contracts. compliance risk can result in diminished reputation, reduced franchise or enterprise value, limited business opportunities and lessened expansion potential.
strategic risk strategic risk is the risk of financial loss, diminished stakeholder confidence, or negative impact to human capital resulting from ineffective strategy setting and execution, adverse business decisions, or lack of responsiveness to changes in the banking industry and operating environment. truist is committed to fulfilling its overall strategic objectives by selecting business strategies and operating businesses in a manner consistent with achieving profitability/earnings growth and maintaining strong confidence and trust with its key stakeholder constituencies.
reputation risk reputation risk is the risk to current or anticipated earnings, capital, enterprise value, the truist brand, and public confidence arising from negative publicity or public opinion, whether real or perceived, regarding truist's business practices, products, services, transactions, or other activities undertaken by truist, its representatives, or its partners. a negative reputation may impair truist's relationship with clients, teammates, communities or shareholders, and it is often a residual risk that arises when other risks are not managed properly.
operational risk operational risk is the risk to current or anticipated earnings or capital arising from inadequate or failed internal processes, people and systems or from external events. it includes legal risk, which is the risk of loss arising from defective transactions, litigation or claims made, or the failure to adequately protect company-owned assets. an operational loss occurs when an event results in a loss or reserve originating from operational risk.
72 truist financial corporation model risk model risk is the risk to current or anticipated earnings or capital from decisions based on incorrect or misused model outputs. truist uses models for many purposes, including the valuation of financial positions, estimation of credit losses, and the measurement of risk. valuation models are used to value certain financial instruments for which quoted prices may not be readily available. valuation models are also used as inputs for var, the estimation of var itself, regulatory capital, stress testing and the acl. models are owned by the applicable bus, who are responsible for the development, implementation and use of their models. oversight of these functions is performed by the mrm, which is a component of the rmo. once models have been approved, model owners are responsible for the maintenance of an appropriate operating environment and must monitor and evaluate the performance of the models on a recurring basis. models are updated in response to changes in portfolio composition, industry and economic conditions, technological capabilities and other developments.
mrm manages model risk in a holistic manner through a suite of model governance and model validation activities. the risk of each model is assessed and classified into various risk tiers. additionally, mrm maintains an enterprise-wide model inventory containing relevant model information. regarding model validation, mrm utilizes internal validation analysts and managers with skill sets in predictive modeling to perform detailed reviews of model development, implementation and conceptual soundness. on certain occasions, the mrm will also engage external parties to assist with validation efforts. once in a production environment, mrm assesses a model's performance on a periodic basis through ongoing monitoring reviews. mrm tracks issues that have been identified during model validation or through ongoing monitoring, and engages with model owners to ensure their timely remediation. mrm gauges model risk utilizing a collection of key risk indicators, which are periodically reported to relevant committees, including but not limited to, the model risk management committee as well as the board risk committee. mrm will also present model risk topics to the board risk committee as necessary.
merger integration risk the truist merger program was designed to ensure successful integration following the merger through strong governance practices and controls, with processes, metrics and reporting exemplifying a strong risk culture. the core truist merger program structure consists of key stakeholders from each line of business. integration activities and risk mitigation are monitored through established workgroups and truist merger program leadership, with oversight and escalation into the merger oversight committee (as the primary committee), tmc and board technology committee.
technology risk technology risk is the business risk associated with the use, ownership, operation, involvement, influence and adoption of information technology across the company. truist has defined and adopted a technology risk framework that provides the foundation for technology risk strategy, program and oversight and defines key objectives, operating model components, risk domains and capabilities to manage this risk.
digital technology is constantly evolving, and new and unforeseen threats and actions by others may disrupt operations or result in losses beyond truist's risk control thresholds. truist maintains a comprehensive risk-based information security / cybersecurity framework implemented through people, processes, and technology whereby truist actively monitors and evaluates threats, events, and the performance of its business operations and continually adapts its risk mitigation activities accordingly.
truist's framework aligns with those of the national institute of standards and technology, the international standards organization 27000 series, the it governance institute, and the control objectives for information and related technology, as well as conforms with the requirements and guidance from applicable regulatory authorities, including the federal financial institutions examination council. in addition, truist's framework, which includes internally and externally focused capabilities, drives the development and implementation of truist's holistic data security strategy that is designed to reduce risk while enabling truist's corporate business objectives.
truist has built an organization with dedicated, skilled talent to operationalize truist's cybersecurity strategy. the cybersecurity strategy is enabled by continuous enhancement of truist's multilayered defenses including advanced capabilities for early and rapid cyber threat identification, detection, protection, response, and recovery. truist participates in the federally recognized financial sector information sharing organization structure, known as the financial services information sharing and analysis center as a key part of the company's cyber threat intelligence and response programs, as well as other industry organizations and initiatives that promote industry best practices such as harmonized cybersecurity standards, cyber readiness, and secure consumer financial data sharing.
to further mitigate the risks presented by an evolving cyber threat landscape, truist provides data protection guidance to clients and promotes data protection awareness and accountability through mandatory teammate training. truist conducts scenario-driven test exercises simulating impacts and consequences developed through analysis of real-world technology incidents as well as known and anticipated cyber threats. these exercises are designed to assess the viability of truist's crisis response and management programs and provide the basis for continuous improvement.

truist's cybersecurity risk program is overseen by executive leadership and the board. regular updates on the status of the cybersecurity risk program, including information security risks and incidents, emerging threats, and control environment, are aggregated and escalated to executive leadership and the board. additionally, truist has a cyber incident response team that manages significant cyber-specific events with escalation up to executive leadership and the board. truist's framework requires annual exercises at a minimum to test truist's preparedness. the board devotes significant time and attention to its oversight of cyber security risk and approves related information security policies. although truist has invested substantial resources to manage and reduce cybersecurity risk, it is not possible to completely eliminate this risk. truist obtains insurance that protects against certain losses, expenses, and damages associated with cybersecurity risk. see item 1a, "risk factors," for additional information regarding cybersecurity risk.
liquidity liquidity represents the continuing ability to meet funding needs, including deposit withdrawals, repayment of borrowings and other liabilities, and funding of loan commitments. in addition to the level of liquid assets, such as cash, cash equivalents and afs securities, other factors affect the ability to meet liquidity needs, including access to a variety of funding sources, maintaining borrowing capacity, growing core deposits, loan repayment and the ability to securitize or package loans for sale.
truist monitors the ability to meet client demand for funds under both normal and stressed market conditions. in considering its liquidity position, management evaluates truist's funding mix based on client core funding, client rate-sensitive funding and national markets funding. in addition, management evaluates exposure to rate-sensitive funding sources that mature in one year or less. management also measures liquidity needs against 30 days of stressed cash outflows for truist and truist bank. to ensure a strong liquidity position and compliance with regulatory requirements, management maintains a liquid asset buffer of cash on hand and highly liquid unencumbered securities. as of december 31, 2020 and december 31, 2019, truist's liquid asset buffer, as a percent of total assets, was 20.2% and 16.5%, respectively.
the lcr rule directs large u.s. banking organizations to hold unencumbered high-quality liquid assets sufficient to withstand projected 30-day total net cash outflows, each as defined under the lcr rule. as of january 1, 2020, truist is subject to the category iii reduced lcr requirements. truist's average lcr was 113% for the three months ended december 31, 2020, well above the regulatory minimum of 100%.
parent company the parent company serves as the primary source of capital for the operating subsidiaries. the parent company's assets consist primarily of cash on deposit with truist bank, equity investments in subsidiaries, advances to subsidiaries, and notes receivable from subsidiaries. the principal obligations of the parent company are payments on long-term debt. the main sources of funds for the parent company are dividends and management fees from subsidiaries, repayments of advances to subsidiaries, and proceeds from the issuance of equity and long-term debt. the primary uses of funds by the parent company are investments in subsidiaries, advances to subsidiaries, dividend payments to common and preferred shareholders, retirement of common stock, and payments on long-term debt.
see "note 22. parent company financial information" for additional information regarding dividends from subsidiaries and debt transactions.
access to funding at the parent company is more sensitive to market disruptions. therefore, truist prudently manages cash levels at the parent company to cover a minimum of one year of projected cash outflows which includes unfunded external commitments, debt service, common and preferred dividends and scheduled debt maturities, without the benefit of any new cash inflows. truist maintains a significant buffer above the projected one year of cash outflows. in determining the buffer, truist considers cash requirements for common and preferred dividends, unfunded commitments to affiliates, serving as a source of strength to truist bank, and being able to withstand sustained market disruptions that could limit access to the capital markets. at december 31, 2020 and december 31, 2019, the parent company had 43 months and 29 months, respectively, of cash on hand to satisfy projected cash outflows, and 22 months and 20 months, respectively, when including the payment of common stock dividends.
truist bank truist carefully manages liquidity risk at truist bank. truist bank's primary source of funding is client deposits. continued access to client deposits is highly dependent on public confidence in the stability of truist bank and its ability to return funds to clients when requested.
truist bank maintains a number of diverse funding sources to meet its liquidity requirements. these sources include unsecured borrowings from the capital markets through the issuance of senior or subordinated bank notes, institutional cds, overnight and term federal funds markets, and retail brokered cds. truist bank also maintains access to secured borrowing sources including fhlb advances, repurchase agreements, and the frb discount window. at december 31, 2020, truist bank had approximately $198.7 billion of available secured borrowing capacity, which represents approximately 9.4 times the amount of wholesale funding maturities in one-year or less. in addition to secured borrowing sources, truist had excess eligible cash at the federal reserve bank of $13.4 billion at december 31, 2020.
74 truist financial corporation the ability to raise funding at competitive prices is affected by the rating agencies' views of the parent company's and truist bank's credit quality, liquidity, capital and earnings. management meets with the rating agencies on a regular basis to discuss current outlooks. in april 2020, dbrs revised its outlook for truist and truist bank from "positive" to "stable," citing economic deterioration related to covid-19. dbrs affirmed all other ratings for truist and truist bank. additionally, fitch revised its outlook for truist and truist bank from "stable" to "negative," also citing pandemic-related economic deterioration. fitch downgraded truist's subordinated debt to a-, and upgraded truist's preferred stock to bbb, in order to align these ratings to its recently revised bank rating methodology.
in july 2020, fitch completed the implementation of its revised bank rating methodology. as a result, fitch downgraded truist's senior unsecured debt to a and affirmed truist bank's senior unsecured and subordinated debt ratings. this rating action taken by fitch was solely a function of implementing its revised bank rating methodology and did not reflect a change in fitch's current or expected view of truist's or truist bank's credit fundamentals.

76 truist financial corporation capital the maintenance of appropriate levels of capital is a management priority and is monitored on a regular basis. truist's principal goals related to the maintenance of capital are to provide adequate capital to support truist's risk profile consistent with the board-approved risk appetite, provide financial flexibility to support future growth and client needs, comply with relevant laws, regulations, and supervisory guidance, achieve optimal credit ratings for truist and its subsidiaries and provide a competitive return to shareholders. risk-based capital ratios, which include cet1 capital, tier 1 capital and total capital are calculated based on regulatory guidance related to the measurement of capital and risk-weighted assets.
truist regularly performs stress testing on its capital levels and is required to periodically submit the company's capital plans and stress testing results to the banking regulators. management regularly monitors the capital position of truist on both a consolidated and bank-level basis. in this regard, management's overriding policy is to maintain capital at levels that are in excess of internal capital targets, which are above the regulatory "well capitalized" minimums. management has implemented stressed capital ratio minimum targets to evaluate whether capital ratios calculated after the effect of alternative capital actions are likely to remain above minimums specified by the frb for the annual ccar process. breaches of stressed minimum targets prompt a review of the planned capital actions included in truist's capital plan.

(1)the truist targets are subject to revision based on finalization of pending regulatory guidance and other strategic factors.
(2)truist's goal is to maintain capital levels above all regulatory minimums.
(3)reflects a scb of 270 basis points for truist.
during the first quarter of 2020, as market conditions evolved, truist received board approval to establish new interim operating targets that provide for sufficient capital levels while allowing the company to support clients through the economic downturn. these interim operating targets will be evaluated as economic conditions evolve.
while nonrecurring events or management decisions may result in the company temporarily falling below its operating targets for one or more of these ratios, it is management's intent to return to these operating targets within a reasonable period of time through capital planning. such temporary decreases below the operating minimums shown above are not considered an infringement of truist's overall capital policy, provided a return above the minimums is forecasted to occur within a reasonable time period.
in august 2020, the federal reserve informed truist of its scb of 270 basis points for risk-based capital ratios. this buffer was determined based on stress testing results developed by the federal reserve and is effective from october 1, 2020 through september 30, 2021, at which point a revised scb will be calculated and provided to truist. consistent with the federal reserve's mandate across the industry, truist resubmitted its capital plan in november 2020 to reflect changes in financial markets and the macroeconomic outlook. truist's review of the results of the 2020 ccar supervisory stress test notes that the modeled outcomes shown by the frb differ from those calculated by the company. truist believes those differences are attributable in part to the application of purchase accounting associated with the merger. purchase accounting adjustments could result in a reduction in provision expense and an increase in pre-provision net revenue. these differences could result in higher capital ratios than were reflected in the ccar results.
in december 2020, the board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to $2.0 billion of the company's common stock beginning in the first quarter of 2021, as well as certain other actions to optimize truist's capital position. management's intention is to maintain an approximate 10% common equity tier 1 ratio after considering strategic actions such as non-bank acquisitions or stock repurchases, as well as changes in risk-weighted assets. any stock repurchase activity will be informed by economic and regulatory considerations as well as truist's capital position, earnings outlook, and capital deployment priorities.
payments of cash dividends and repurchases of common shares are the methods used to manage any excess capital generated. in addition, management closely monitors the parent company's double leverage ratio (investments in subsidiaries as a percentage of shareholders' equity). the active management of the subsidiaries' equity capital, as described above, is the process used to manage this important driver of parent company liquidity and is a key element in the management of truist's capital position.
truist financial corporation 77
management intends to maintain capital at truist bank at levels that will result in classification as "well-capitalized" for regulatory purposes. secondarily, it is management's intent to maintain truist bank's capital at levels that result in regulatory risk-based capital ratios that are generally comparable with peers of similar size, complexity and risk profile. if the capital levels of truist bank increase above these guidelines, excess capital may be transferred to the parent company in the form of special dividend payments, subject to regulatory and other operating considerations.
management's capital deployment plan in order of preference is to focus on (i) organic growth, (ii) dividends, and (iii) strategic opportunities and/or share repurchases depending on opportunities in the marketplace and truist's interest and ability to proceed with acquisitions.
truist bank's capital ratios are presented in the following table:

(2)truist became subject to the supplementary leverage ratio as of january 1, 2020.
(3)tangible common equity and related measures are non-gaap measures that exclude the impact of intangible assets, net of deferred taxes, and their related amortization. these measures are useful for evaluating the performance of a business consistently, whether acquired or developed internally. truist's management uses these measures to assess the quality of capital and returns relative to balance sheet risk. these capital measures are not necessarily comparable to similar capital measures that may be presented by other companies.
capital ratios improved compared to year-end 2020, due to growth in cet1 capital, partially offset by higher risk-weighted assets. truist's capital levels remain strong compared to the regulatory levels for well capitalized banks at december 31, 2020. truist's other capital measures also improved as truist issued various capital instruments to strengthen its capital position. truist issued $3.5 billion of preferred stock and redeemed $500 million of series k preferred stock during 2020. in addition, truist issued $1.3 billion of subordinated debt. during 2020,truist paid $2.4 billion in common stock dividends or $1.80 per share, which resulted in a total payout ratio of 58.0% for the year.

fourth quarter 2020 results compared to fourth quarter 2019
total taxable-equivalent revenues were $5.7 billion for the fourth quarter of 2020, an increase of $2.0 billion compared to the earlier quarter, reflecting an increase of $1.1 billion in taxable-equivalent net interest income and an increase of $887 million in noninterest income.
net interest margin was 3.08%, down 33 basis points compared to the earlier quarter. average earning assets increased $175.6 billion. the increase in average earning assets reflects a $114.5 billion increase in average total loans and leases and a $41.4 billion increase in average securities. average other earning assets increased $17.5 billion primarily due to higher interest-earning balances at the federal reserve. average interest-bearing liabilities increased $107.3 billion compared to the earlier quarter. average interest-bearing deposits increased $101.9 billion, average long-term debt increased $10.4 billion and average short-term borrowings decreased $5.0 billion. the significant increases in earning assets and liabilities are primarily due to the merger, as well as impacts from the covid-19 pandemic and the resulting government stimulus programs.
the yield on the total loan portfolio for the fourth quarter of 2020 was 4.12%, down 79 basis points compared to the earlier quarter, reflecting the impact of rate decreases, partially offset by purchase accounting accretion from merged loans. the yield on the average securities portfolio was 1.60%, down 105 basis points compared to the earlier quarter primarily due to lower yields on new purchases.
the average cost of total deposits was 0.07%, down 50 basis points compared to the earlier quarter, and the average cost of interest-bearing deposits was 0.11%, down 71 basis points compared to the earlier quarter. the average rate on short-term borrowings was 0.77%, down 138 basis points compared to the earlier quarter. the average rate on long-term debt was 1.64%, down 128 basis points compared to the earlier quarter. the lower rates on interest-bearing liabilities reflect the lower rate environment. the lower rates on long-term debt also reflect the amortization of the fair value mark on the assumed debt and the issuance of new long-term debt.
the provision for credit losses was $177 million, compared to $171 million for the earlier quarter. net charge-offs for the fourth quarter of 2020 totaled $205 million compared to $192 million in the earlier quarter. the net charge-off rate for the current quarter of 0.27% was down 13 basis points compared to the fourth quarter of 2019.

noninterest income for the fourth quarter of 2020 increased $887 million compared to the earlier quarter. the earlier quarter included a loss of $116 million from the sale of securities. excluding the securities losses, noninterest income increased $771 million, with nearly all categories of noninterest income being impacted by the merger. insurance income increased $36 million due to strong production and premium growth, as well as acquisitions. investment banking and trading income, commercial real estate related income, wealth management income and residential mortgage banking income all had improved performance compared to the combined levels from the earlier quarter. service charges on deposits continued to rebound, but remained below 2019 combined levels due to reduced overdraft incident rates.
noninterest expense for the fourth quarter of 2020 was up $1.3 billion compared to the earlier quarter. merger-related and restructuring charges and other incremental operating expenses related to the merger increased $85 million and $78 million, respectively. excluding the merger-related items mentioned above and the impact of an increase of $101 million of amortization expense for intangibles, adjusted noninterest expense was up $994 million primarily reflecting the impact of the merger.
the provision for income taxes was $311 million for the fourth quarter of 2020, compared to $153 million for the earlier quarter. this produced an effective tax rate for the fourth quarter of 2020 of 19.0%, compared to 17.4% for the earlier quarter. the higher effective tax rate is primarily due to higher pre-tax income.

critical accounting policies the accounting and reporting policies of truist are in accordance with gaap and conform to the accounting and reporting guidelines prescribed by bank regulatory authorities. the financial position and results of operations are affected by management's application of accounting policies, including estimates, assumptions and judgments made to arrive at the carrying value of assets and liabilities and amounts reported for revenues and expenses. different assumptions in the application of these policies could result in material changes in the consolidated financial position and/or consolidated results of operations and related disclosures. understanding truist's accounting policies is fundamental to understanding the consolidated financial position and consolidated results of operations. accordingly, truist's significant accounting policies and effects of new accounting pronouncements are discussed in detail in "note 1. basis of presentation."
the following is a summary of truist's critical accounting policies that are highly dependent on estimates, assumptions and judgments. these critical accounting policies are reviewed with the audit committee of the board of directors on a periodic basis.
acl truist's policy is to maintain an acl, which represents management's best estimate of expected future credit losses related to the loan and lease portfolios and off-balance sheet lending commitments at the balance sheet date. estimates of expected future loan and lease losses are determined by using statistical models and management's judgement. the models are designed to forecast probability of default, exposure at default and loss given default by correlating certain macroeconomic forecast data to historical experience. the models are generally applied at the portfolio level to pools of loans with similar risk characteristics. the macroeconomic data used in the models is based on forecasted variables for the reasonable and supportable period of two years. beyond this forecast period the models gradually revert to long-term historical loss conditions over a one year period. expected losses are estimated through contractual maturity, giving appropriate consideration to expected prepayments unless the borrower has a right to renew that is not cancellable or it is reasonably expected that the loan will be modified as a tdr.
a qualitative allowance which incorporates management's judgement is also included in the estimation of expected future loan and lease losses, including qualitative adjustments in circumstances where the model output is inconsistent with management's expectations with respect to expected credit losses. this allowance is used to adjust for limitations in modeled results related to the current economic conditions and capture risks in the portfolio such as considerations with respect to the impact of current economic events, the outcomes of which are uncertain. these events may include, but are not limited to, political conditions, legislation that may directly or indirectly affect the banking industry and economic conditions affecting specific geographical areas and industries in which truist conducts business.
loans and leases that do not share similar risk characteristics and significant loans that are considered collateral-dependent are individually evaluated. for these loans, the alll is determined through review of data specific to the borrower and related collateral, if any. for tdrs, default expectations and estimated prepayment speeds that are specific to each of the restructured loan populations are incorporated in the determination of the alll.
80 truist financial corporation the methodology used to determine an estimate for the rufc is similar to that used to determine the funded component of the alll and is measured over the period there is a contractual obligation to extend credit that is not unconditionally cancellable. the rufc is adjusted for factors specific to binding commitments, including the probability of funding and exposure at default. a detailed discussion of the methodology used in determining the acl is included in "note 1. basis of presentation."
fair value of financial instruments the vast majority of assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis are based on either quoted market prices or market prices for similar instruments. refer to "note 18. fair value disclosures" for additional disclosures regarding the fair value of financial instruments and "note 2. business combinations" for additional disclosures regarding business combinations.
securities truist generally utilizes a third-party pricing service in determining the fair value of its afs investment securities, whereas trading securities are priced internally. fair value measurements for investment securities are derived from market-based pricing matrices that were developed using observable inputs that include benchmark yields, benchmark securities, reported trades, offers, bids, issuer spreads and broker quotes. management performs procedures to evaluate the fair values provided by the third-party service provider. these procedures, which are performed independent of the responsible bu, include comparison of pricing information received from the third party pricing service to other third-party pricing sources, review of additional information provided by the third-party pricing service and other third-party sources for selected securities and back-testing to compare the price realized on security sales to the daily pricing information received from the third-party pricing service. the enterprise valuation committee, which provides oversight to truist's enterprise-wide ipv function, is responsible for the comparison of pricing information received from the third-party pricing service or internally to other third-party pricing sources, approving tolerance limits determined by ipv for price comparison exceptions, reviewing significant changes to pricing and valuation policies and reviewing and approving the pricing decisions made on any illiquid and hard-to-price securities. when market observable data is not available, which generally occurs due to the lack of liquidity or inactive markets for certain securities, the valuation of the security is subjective and may involve substantial judgment by management to reflect unobservable input assumptions.
msrs truist's primary class of msrs for which it separately manages the economic risks relates to residential mortgages. residential msrs do not trade in an active, open market with readily observable prices. while sales of msrs do occur, the precise terms and conditions typically are not readily available. accordingly, truist estimates the fair value of residential msrs using a stochastic oas valuation model to project residential msr cash flows over multiple interest rate scenarios, which are then discounted at risk-adjusted rates. the oas model considers portfolio characteristics, contractually-specified servicing fees, prepayment assumptions, delinquency rates, late charges, other ancillary revenue, costs to service and other economic factors. truist reassesses and periodically adjusts the underlying inputs and assumptions in the oas model to reflect market conditions and assumptions that a market participant would consider in valuing the residential msr asset.
fair value estimates and assumptions are compared to industry surveys, recent market activity, actual portfolio experience and, when available, observable market data. due to the nature of the valuation inputs, residential msrs are classified within level 3 of the valuation hierarchy. the value of residential msrs is significantly affected by mortgage interest rates available in the marketplace, which influence mortgage loan prepayment speeds. in general, during periods of declining interest rates, the value of msrs declines due to increasing prepayments attributable to increased mortgage-refinance activity. conversely, during periods of rising interest rates, the value of residential msrs generally increases due to reduced refinance activity. truist typically hedges against market value changes in the residential msrs. refer to "note 8. loan servicing" for quantitative disclosures reflecting the effect that changes in management's assumptions would have on the fair value of residential msrs.
lhfs truist originates certain residential and commercial mortgage loans for sale to investors that are measured at fair value. the fair value is primarily based on quoted market prices for securities backed by similar types of loans. changes in the fair value are recorded as components of residential mortgage income and commercial real estate related income, while the related origination costs are generally recognized in personnel expense when incurred. the changes in fair value are largely driven by changes in interest rates subsequent to loan funding and changes in the fair value of servicing associated with the lhfs. truist uses various derivative instruments to mitigate the economic effect of changes in fair value of the underlying loans. lhfs also includes certain loans, generally carried at locom, where management has committed to a formal plan of sale and the loans are available for immediate sale. adjustments to reflect unrealized gains and losses resulting from changes in fair value, up to the original carrying amount, and realized gains and losses upon ultimate sale are classified as noninterest income. the fair value of these loans is estimated using observable market prices when available, although may also incorporate other unobservable inputs such as indicative bids or broker price opinions. refer to "note 1. basis of presentation" for further description of the company's accounting for lhfs.

trading loans truist elects to measure certain loans at fair value for financial reporting where fair value aligns with the underlying business purpose. specifically, loans included within this classification include trading loans that are (i) purchased in connection with the company's trs business, (ii) part of the loan sales and trading business within the c&cb segment, or (iii) backed by the sba. refer to "note 16. commitments and contingencies," and "note 19. derivative financial instruments," for further discussion of the company's trs business. the loans purchased in connection with the company's trs and sales and trading businesses are primarily commercial and corporate leveraged loans valued based on quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active by a third party pricing service. sba loans are fully guaranteed by the u.s. government as to contractual principal and interest and there is sufficient observable trading activity upon which to base the estimate of fair value.
derivative assets and liabilities truist uses derivatives to manage various financial risks and in a dealer capacity to facilitate client transactions. truist mitigates credit risk by subjecting counterparties to credit reviews and approvals similar to those used in making loans and other extensions of credit. in addition, certain counterparties are required to provide collateral to truist when their unsecured loss positions exceed certain negotiated limits. the fair values of derivative financial instruments are determined based on quoted market prices and internal pricing models that use market observable data for interest rates, foreign exchange, equity and credit. the fair value of interest rate lock commitments, which are related to mortgage loan commitments, is based on quoted market prices adjusted for commitments that truist does not expect to fund and includes the value attributable to the net servicing fee. refer to "note 19. derivative financial instruments" for further information on the company's derivatives.
purchased loans the fair value for purchased loans in a business combination is based on a discounted cash flow methodology that considers credit loss expectations, market interest rates and other market factors such as liquidity from the perspective of a market participant. loans are grouped together according to similar characteristics and are treated in the aggregate when applying various valuation techniques. the probability of default, loss given default and prepayment assumptions are key factors driving credit losses which are embedded into the estimated cash flows. these assumptions are informed by internal data on loan characteristics, historical loss experience, and current and forecasted economic conditions. the interest and liquidity component of the estimate is determined by discounting interest and principal cash flows through the expected life of each loan. the discount rates used for loans are based on current market rates for new originations of comparable loans and include adjustments for liquidity. the discount rate does not include a factor for credit losses as that has been included as a reduction to the estimated cash flows.
intangible assets the acquisition method of accounting requires that assets acquired and liabilities assumed in business combinations are recorded at their fair values. this often involves estimates based on third party valuations or internal valuations based on discounted cash flow analyses or other valuation techniques, which are inherently subjective. the amortization of definite-lived intangible assets is based upon the estimated economic benefits to be received, which is also subjective. business combinations also typically result in goodwill, which is subject to ongoing periodic impairment tests based on the fair values of the reporting units to which the acquired goodwill relates. refer to "note 1. basis of presentation" for a description of the impairment testing process.
at december 31, 2020, truist's reporting units with goodwill balances were cb&w, c&cb and ih. management reviews the goodwill of each reporting unit for impairment on an annual basis as of october 1 or more often if events or circumstances indicate that it is more-likely-than-not that the fair value of a reporting unit is below its carrying value. for its annual impairment review, truist elected to perform a quantitative test of each of its reporting units. the quantitative impairment test estimates the fair value of the reporting units using the income approach and the market approach, weighted 60% and 40%, respectively. the income approach utilizes a discounted cash flow analysis. the market approach utilizes comparable public company information, key valuation multiples and considers a market control premium associated with cost synergies and other cash flow benefits that arise from obtaining control over a reporting unit.
the inputs and assumptions specific to each reporting unit are incorporated in the valuations, including projections of future cash flows, discount rates, and applicable valuation multiples based on the comparable public company information. truist also assesses the reasonableness of the aggregate estimated fair value of the reporting units by comparison to its market capitalization over a reasonable period of time, including consideration of historic bank control premiums and the current market.
82 truist financial corporation multi-year financial forecasts are developed for each reporting unit by considering several inputs and assumptions such as net interest margin, expected credit losses, noninterest income, noninterest expense and required capital. of these inputs, the projection of net interest margin is the most significant to the financial projections of the cb&w and c&cb reporting units. the long-term growth rate used in determining the terminal value of each reporting unit was 2.5% as of october 1, 2020, based on management's assessment of the minimum expected terminal growth rate of each reporting unit. discount rates are estimated based on the capital asset pricing model, which considers the risk-free interest rate, market risk premium, beta, and unsystematic risk adjustments specific to a particular reporting unit. the discount rates are also calibrated based on risks related to the projected cash flows of each reporting unit. the discount rates utilized for the cb&w, c&cb and ih reporting units as of october 1, 2020 were 11%, 10%, and 9%, respectively.
based on the company's annual impairment analysis of goodwill as of october 1, it was determined for the cb&w, c&cb and ih reporting units that the respective reporting unit's fair value was in excess of its respective carrying value as of october 1, 2020; however, for the c&cb reporting unit the fair value of the reporting unit exceeded its carrying value by less than 10%, indicating that the goodwill of this reporting unit may be at risk of impairment. circumstances that could negatively impact the fair value for the c&cb reporting unit in the future include an increase in the applicable discount rate, an increase in required capital, or deterioration in the c&cb reporting unit's forecasts.
the estimated fair value of the reporting unit is highly sensitive to changes in these estimates and assumptions; therefore, in some instances, changes in these assumptions could impact whether the fair value of a reporting unit is greater than its carrying value. the company performs sensitivity analyses around these assumptions in order to assess the reasonableness of the assumptions, and the resulting estimated fair values. the analysis of the c&cb reporting unit at october 1, 2020, indicated that if the discount rate was increased 100 basis points, the reporting unit's fair value would be less than its carrying value, resulting in goodwill impairment. ultimately, future potential changes in these assumptions may impact the estimated fair value of a reporting unit and cause the fair value of the reporting unit to be below its carrying value. additionally, a reporting unit's carrying value could change based on market conditions, asset growth, or the risk profile of those reporting units, which could impact whether the fair value of a reporting unit is less than carrying value.
the company monitored events and circumstances during the fourth quarter of 2020, including the continuing effects of the covid-19 pandemic, concluding that it was not more-likely-than-not that the fair value of one or more of its reporting units is below its respective carrying amount as of december 31, 2020.
income taxes truist is subject to income tax laws of the u.s., its states, and the municipalities in which the company conducts business. in estimating the net amount due to or to be received from tax jurisdictions either currently or in the future, the company assesses the appropriate tax treatment of transactions and filing positions after considering statutes, regulations, judicial precedent, and other pertinent information. the income tax laws are complex and subject to different interpretations by the taxpayer and the relevant government taxing authorities. significant judgment is required in determining the tax accruals and in evaluating the company's tax positions, including evaluating uncertain tax positions. changes in the estimate of accrued taxes occur periodically due to changes in tax rates, interpretations of tax laws and new judicial guidance, the status of examinations by the tax authorities, and newly enacted statutory and regulatory guidance that could impact the relative merits and risks of tax positions. these changes, when they occur, impact tax expense and can materially affect operating results. truist reviews tax positions quarterly and adjusts accrued taxes as new information becomes available.
deferred income tax assets represent amounts available to reduce income taxes payable in future years. such assets arise due to temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities, as well as from nol and tax credit carryforwards. the company regularly evaluates the realizability of dtas, recognizing a valuation allowance if, based on the weight of available evidence, it is more-likely-than-not that some portion or all of the dta will not be realized. in determining whether a valuation allowance is necessary, the company considers the level of taxable income in prior years to the extent that carrybacks are permitted under current tax laws, as well as estimates of future pre-tax and taxable income and tax planning strategies that would, if necessary, be implemented. truist currently maintains a valuation allowance for certain state carryforwards and certain other state dtas. for additional income tax information, refer to "note 1. basis of presentation" and "note 14. income taxes."
pension and postretirement benefit obligations truist offers various pension plans and postretirement benefit plans to teammates. calculation of the obligations and related expenses under these plans requires the use of actuarial valuation methods and assumptions, which are subject to management judgment and may differ significantly if different assumptions are used. the discount rate assumption used to measure the postretirement benefit obligations is set by reference to a high-quality corporate bond yield curve and the individual characteristics of the plans such as projected cash flow patterns and payment durations. in 2020, in connection with the merger of the bb&t and suntrust pension plans truist refined the corporate bond yield curve used in determining the discount rate and moved to a aa above median yield curve from the previously used aa rated bond yield curve. the impact of this change was an increase of approximately 11 basis points in the discount rate as of december 31, 2020.
truist financial corporation 83
management also considered the sensitivity that changes in the expected return on plan assets and the discount rate would have on pension expense. for the company's qualified plans, a decrease of 25 basis points in the discount rate would result in additional pension expense of approximately $27 million for 2021, while a decrease of 100 basis points in the expected return on plan assets would result in an increase of approximately $149 million in pension expense for 2021. refer to "note 15. benefit plans" for disclosures related to the benefit plans.

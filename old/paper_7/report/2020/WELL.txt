the covid-19 pandemic has had and may continue to have material and adverse effects on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows in the future. the extent to which the covid-19 pandemic impacts our operations and those of our operators and tenants will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted with confidence, including the scope, severity and duration of the pandemic, the effectiveness and availability of vaccines and the success of ongoing vaccination deployment efforts in our facilities and the geographic areas in which we operate, the actions taken to contain the pandemic or mitigate its impact and the direct and indirect economic effects of the pandemic and containment measures, among others.
our seniors housing operating revenues are dependent on occupancy. while admission bans were lifted across our portfolio during the second and third quarter, with the ramp up of covid-19 cases in the general community in the fourth quarter, admissions bans, both government-imposed and voluntary bans adopted by operators, have been reinstated in many locations which have significantly affected occupancy rates. occupancy has consistently declined since the beginning of the pandemic to 76.2% as of december 31, 2020. through february 5, 2021, total occupancy declined an additional 180 basis points to 74.4%. occupancy metrics represents approximate spot occupancy as reported by our operators for properties in operation as of february 29, 2020, including unconsolidated properties but excluding acquisitions, executed dispositions and development conversions since such date.
we have incurred increased operational costs as a result of the introduction of public health measures and other regulations affecting our properties, as well as additional health and safety measures adopted by us and our operators related to the covid-19 pandemic, including increases in labor, personal protective equipment and sanitation. we expect total seniors housing operating expenses to remain elevated during the pandemic and potentially beyond as these additional health and safety measures become standard practice.
our triple-net operators are experiencing similar occupancy declines and operating costs as described above with respect to our seniors housing operating properties. however, long-term/post-acute care facilities are generally experiencing a higher degree of occupancy declines. these factors may continue to impact the ability of our triple-net operators to make contractual rent payments to us in the future. many of our triple-net operators received funds under the coronavirus aid relief, and economic security act ("cares act") paycheck protection program. in addition, operators of long-term/post-acute care facilities have generally received funds from phase 1 of the provider relief fund and operators of assisted living facilities have or are expected to receive funds from phase 2 of the provider relief fund. accordingly, collection of triple-net rent due during the covid-19 pandemic to date (from march to december) has generally been consistent with historical collection rates and no significant rent concessions or deferrals have been made.
item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations our outpatient medical tenants have experienced temporary medical practice closures or decreases in revenue due to government-imposed restrictions on elective medical procedures, stay at home orders or decisions by patients to delay treatments which may continue to adversely affect their ability to make contractual rent payments. these factors have and may continue to cause operators or tenants to seek modifications of such obligations, resulting in reductions in revenue and increases in uncollectible receivables. we will continue to evaluate each request on a case-by-case basis and determine if a form of rent relief is warranted following an examination of the tenant's financial health, rent coverage, current operating situation and other factors.
outpatient medical rent collections through march were generally consistent with pre covid-19 levels. during the second quarter we executed short term rent deferrals with certain outpatient medical tenants which in most cases were required to be repaid by year end. since then we have collected approximately 99% of outpatient medical rent due in the second half of the year, with uncollected amounts primarily attributable to local jurisdictions with covid-19 related ordinances providing temporary rent relief to tenants. furthermore, collections of deferred rent due under executed deferrals was over 99%. to the extent that deferred rent is not repaid as expected, or the prolonged impact of the covid-19 pandemic causes operators or tenants to seek further modifications of their lease agreements, we may recognize reductions in revenue and increases in uncollectible receivables.
as a result of uncertainty regarding the length and severity of the covid-19 pandemic and the impact of the pandemic on our business and related industries, our investments in and acquisitions of seniors housing and health care properties, as well as our ability to transition or sell properties with profitable results in the future, may be limited. in response to the covid-19 pandemic, acquisitions during the year ended december 31, 2020 declined compared to recent years. additionally, we undertook certain opportunistic disposals to enhance near-term liquidity. we have a significant development portfolio as of december 31, 2020. to date we have only experienced minor construction and licensing delays with respect to our development portfolio, but may experience more significant delays in the future. such disruptions to acquisition, disposition and development activity may negatively impact our long-term competitive position.
business strategy our primary objectives are to protect stockholder capital and enhance stockholder value. we seek to pay consistent cash dividends to stockholders and create opportunities to increase dividend payments to stockholders as a result of annual increases in noi and portfolio growth. to meet these objectives, we invest across the full spectrum of seniors housing and health care real estate and diversify our investment portfolio by property type, relationship and geographic location.
substantially all of our revenues are derived from operating lease rentals, resident fees and services and interest earned on outstanding loans receivable. these items represent our primary sources of liquidity to fund distributions and depend upon the continued ability of our obligors to make contractual rent and interest payments to us and the profitability of our operating properties. to the extent that our obligors/partners experience operating difficulties and become unable to generate sufficient cash to make payments or operating distributions to us, there could be a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations, liquidity and/or financial condition. to mitigate this risk, we monitor our investments through a variety of methods determined by the type of property. our asset management process for seniors housing properties generally includes review of monthly financial statements and other operating data for each property, review of obligor/partner creditworthiness, property inspections and review of covenant compliance relating to licensure, real estate taxes, letters of credit and other collateral. our internal property management division manages and monitors the outpatient medical portfolio with a comprehensive process including review of tenant relations, lease expirations, the mix of health service providers, hospital/health system relationships, property performance, capital improvement needs and market conditions among other things. we evaluate the operating environment in each property's market to determine the likely trend in operating performance of the facility. when we identify unacceptable trends, we seek to mitigate, eliminate or transfer the risk. through these efforts, we generally aim to intervene at an early stage to address any negative trends, and in so doing, support both the collectability of revenue and the value of our investment.
in addition to our asset management and research efforts, we also aim to structure our relevant investments to mitigate payment risk. operating leases and loans are normally credit enhanced by guarantees and/or letters of credit. in addition, operating leases are typically structured as master leases and loans are generally cross-defaulted and cross-collateralized with other real estate loans, operating leases or agreements between us and the obligor and its affiliates.
for the year ended december 31, 2020, resident fees and services and rental income represented 67% and 31%, respectively, of total revenues. substantially all of our operating leases are designed with escalating rent structures. leases with fixed annual rental escalators are generally recognized on a straight-line basis over the initial lease period, subject to a collectability assessment. rental income related to leases with contingent rental escalators is generally recorded based on the contractual cash rental payments due for the period. our yield on loans receivable depends upon a number of factors, including the stated interest rate, the average principal amount outstanding during the term of the loan and any interest rate adjustments.
our primary sources of cash include resident fees and services, rent and interest receipts, borrowings under our unsecured revolving credit facility and commercial paper program, public issuances of debt and equity securities, proceeds from investment dispositions and principal payments on loans receivable. our primary uses of cash include dividend distributions, item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations debt service payments (including principal and interest), real property investments (including acquisitions, capital expenditures, construction advances and transaction costs), loan advances, property operating expenses, general and administrative expenses and other expenses. depending upon the availability and cost of external capital, we believe our liquidity is sufficient to fund these uses of cash.
we also continuously evaluate opportunities to finance future investments. new investments are generally funded from temporary borrowings under our unsecured revolving credit facility and commercial paper program, internally generated cash and the proceeds from investment dispositions. our investments generate cash from noi and principal payments on loans receivable. permanent financing for future investments, which replaces funds drawn under our unsecured revolving credit facility and commercial paper program, has historically been provided through a combination of the issuance of public debt and equity securities and the incurrence or assumption of secured debt.
depending upon market conditions, we believe that new investments will be available in the future with spreads over our cost of capital that will generate appropriate returns to our stockholders. it is also likely that investment dispositions may occur in the future. to the extent that investment dispositions exceed new investments, our revenues and cash flows from operations could be adversely affected. we expect to reinvest the proceeds from any investment dispositions in new investments. to the extent that new investment requirements exceed our available cash on-hand, we expect to borrow under our unsecured revolving credit facility and commercial paper program. during 2020, in response to the covid-19 pandemic, we were strategic and opportunistic in disposing of certain real estate which provided significant near term liquidity. at december 31, 2020, we had $1,545,046,000 of cash and cash equivalents, $475,997,000 of restricted cash and $3,000,000,000 of available borrowing capacity under our unsecured revolving credit facility.
key transactions capital  the following summarizes key capital transactions that occurred during the year ended december 31, 2020:
•in april 2020, we closed on a $1.0 billion two-year unsecured term loan. the term loan bears interest at a rate of 1-month libor + 1.20%, based on our credit rating.
•in june 2020, we completed the issuance of $600,000,000 senior unsecured notes bearing interest at 2.75% with a maturity date of january 2031. net proceeds were used to fund tender offers for $426,248,000 of our 3.75% senior unsecured notes due 2023 and our 3.95% senior unsecured notes due 2023 which settled on july 1, 2020. the remaining proceeds were used to reduce borrowings under our term loan by $140,000,000.
•we sold 2,128,000 shares of common stock under our atm and drip programs, primarily in the first quarter, via both cash settle and forward sale agreements, generating gross proceeds of approximately $175,484,000. the sale of these shares and settlement of previously outstanding forward sales resulted in gross proceeds of approximately $607,177,000 which were used to reduce borrowings under our unsecured revolving credit facility.
•we extinguished $632,288,000 of secured debt at a blended average interest rate of 2.21% throughout 2020.

item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations dividends  on february 9, 2021, the board of directors declared a cash dividend for the quarter ended december 31, 2020 of $0.61 per share, consistent with the cash dividends for the quarters ended september 30, june 30 and march 31, 2020, representing a 30% decrease from the $0.87 per share dividend for the quarter ended december 31, 2019. the dividend declaration represents the 199th consecutive quarterly dividend payment.
key performance indicators, trends and uncertainties we utilize several key performance indicators to evaluate the various aspects of our business. these indicators are discussed below and relate to operating performance, credit strength and concentration risk. management uses these key performance indicators to facilitate internal and external comparisons to our historical operating results, in making operating decisions, and for budget planning purposes.
operating performance we believe that net income and net income attributable to common stockholders ("nics") per the statement of comprehensive income are the most appropriate earnings measures. other useful supplemental measures of our operating performance include funds from operations attributable to common stockholders ("ffo") and consolidated net operating income ("noi"); however, these supplemental measures are not defined by u.s. gaap. please refer to the section entitled "non-gaap financial measures" for further discussion and reconciliations. these earnings measures are widely used by investors and analysts in the valuation, comparison and investment recommendations of companies. the following table reflects the recent historical trends of our operating performance measures for the periods presented (in thousands):

credit strength  we measure our credit strength both in terms of leverage ratios and coverage ratios. the leverage ratios indicate how much of our balance sheet capitalization is related to long-term debt, net of cash and internal revenue code ("irc") section 1031 deposits. the coverage ratios indicate our ability to service interest and fixed charges (interest, secured debt principal amortization and preferred dividends). we expect to maintain capitalization ratios and coverage ratios sufficient to maintain a capital structure consistent with our current profile. the coverage ratios are based on adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization ("adjusted ebitda"). please refer to the section entitled "non-gaap financial measures" for further discussion and reconciliation of these measures. leverage ratios and coverage ratios are widely used by investors, analysts and rating agencies in the valuation, comparison, investment recommendations and rating of companies. the following table reflects the recent historical trends for our credit strength measures for the periods presented:

operating activities  the changes in net cash provided from operating activities are primarily attributable to declines in revenue and increases in property operating expenses, as well as the impact of short-term deferrals granted as a result of the covid-19 pandemic in 2020. please see "results of operations" for discussion of net income fluctuations. for the years ended december 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, cash flows from operations exceeded cash distributions to stockholders.

the change in new development is primarily due to the number and size of construction projects on-going during the relevant periods. renovations, redevelopments and other capital improvements include expenditures to maximize property value, increase net operating income, maintain a market-competitive position and/or achieve property stabilization.
financing activities  the changes in net cash provided from/used in financing activities are primarily attributable to changes related to our long-term debt arrangements, the issuances of common stock and dividend payments which are summarized above in "key transactions." please refer to notes 10, 11 and 14 of our consolidated financial statements for additional information.
on april 1, 2020, in response to uncertain financial market conditions arising from the covid-19 pandemic, we undertook steps to strengthen our balance sheet and to enhance our liquidity by entering into a $1.0 billion two-year unsecured term loan. additionally, on june 30, 2020, we completed the issuance of $600,000,000 senior unsecured notes with a maturity date of january 2031. net proceeds were used to fund tender offers for $426,248,000 of our 3.75% senior unsecured notes due 2023 and our 3.95% senior unsecured notes due 2023, which settled on july 1, 2020. the remaining proceeds were used to reduce borrowings under the term loan by $140,000,000. as of december 31, 2020, we have total near-term available liquidity of approximately $4.5 billion. however, we are unable to accurately predict the full impact that the pandemic will have on our results from operations, financial condition, liquidity and cash flows due to numerous factors discussed in part i item 1a. risk factors.
off-balance sheet arrangements at december 31, 2020, we had investments in unconsolidated entities with our ownership generally ranging from 10% to 65%. we use financial derivative instruments to hedge interest rate and foreign currency exchange rate exposure. at december 31, 2020, we had nine outstanding letter of credit obligations. please see notes 8, 12 and 13 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information.

capital structure please refer to "credit strength" above for a discussion of our leverage and coverage ratio trends. our debt agreements contain various covenants, restrictions and events of default. certain agreements require us to maintain financial ratios and minimum net worth and impose certain limits on our ability to incur indebtedness, create liens and make investments or acquisitions. as of december 31, 2020, we were in compliance with all of the covenants under our debt agreements. none of our debt agreements contain provisions for acceleration which could be triggered by our debt ratings. however, under our primary unsecured credit facility, the ratings on our senior unsecured notes are used to determine the fees and interest charged. we plan to manage the company to maintain compliance with our debt covenants and with a capital structure consistent with our current profile. any downgrades in terms of ratings or outlook by any or all of the rating agencies could have a material adverse impact on our cost and availability of capital, which could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations, liquidity and/or financial condition.

during the past three years, inflation has not significantly affected our earnings because of the moderate inflation rate. additionally, a portion of our earnings are derived primarily from long-term investments with predictable rates of return. these investments are mainly financed with a combination of equity, senior unsecured notes, secured debt and borrowings under our primary unsecured credit facility. during inflationary periods, which generally are accompanied by rising interest rates, our ability to grow may be adversely affected because the yield on new investments may increase at a slower rate than new borrowing costs. presuming the current inflation rate remains moderate and long-term interest rates do not increase significantly, we believe that inflation will not impact the availability of equity and debt financing for us.

decreases in resident fees and services and property operating expenses are primarily a result of property dispositions and decreases in occupancy across the portfolio due to the covid-19 pandemic. occupancy within our seniors housing operating portfolio has declined as follows:

(1) spot occupancy represents approximate month end occupancy for properties in operation as of february 29, 2020, including unconsolidated properties but excluding acquisitions, dispositions and development conversions since this date.
in addition, we have experienced increased operational costs, net of reimbursements, of $78,792,000 during the year ended december 31, 2020, included in property operating expenses relating to our consolidated properties. these expenses were incurred as a result of the introduction of public health measures and other regulations affecting our properties, as well as additional health and safety measures adopted by us and our operators related to the covid-19 pandemic, including increases in labor and property cleaning expenses and expenditures related to our efforts to procure ppe and supplies, net of reimbursements. we expect total portfolio expenses to be elevated during the pandemic and potentially beyond as these additional health and safety measures become standard practice.
item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in 2020 applications were made for amounts under phase 2 and phase 3 of the provider relief fund following the announcement from the department of health and human services that it expanded the eligibility of the cares act provider relief fund to include assisted living facilities. during the fourth quarter, we received provider relief funds of approximately $9 million which was recognized as a reduction to property operating expenses. to date in 2021, we have received approximately $34 million of provider relief funds.
during the year ended december 31, 2020, we recorded impairment charges of $100,741,000 related to 15 held for sale or sold properties and six held for use properties. during the year ended december 31, 2019, we recorded impairment charges of $2,145,000 related to four held for use properties. transaction costs related to asset acquisitions are capitalized as a component of the purchase price. changes in the gain on sale of properties are due to the volume of property sales and sales prices. during the year ended december 31, 2020, we recognized a gain on real estate disposition of $313 million related to an 11 property u.s. portfolio. during the year ended december 31, 2019, we recognized a gain on real estate disposition of $520 million related to the benchmark senior living portfolio. the fluctuation in other expenses is primarily due to the timing of noncapitalizable transaction costs associated with acquisitions and operator transitions.
depreciation and amortization fluctuates as a result of acquisitions, disposition and transitions. to the extent we acquire or dispose of additional properties in the future, our provision for depreciation and amortization will change accordingly.
during the year ended december 31, 2020, we completed three seniors housing operating construction projects representing $93,188,000 or $300,606 per unit. the following is a summary of our consolidated seniors housing operating construction projects, excluding expansions, pending as of december 31, 2020 (dollars in thousands):

item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the majority of our seniors housing operating properties are formed through partnership interests. losses from unconsolidated entities during the year ended december 31, 2020 are largely attributable to depreciation and amortization of short-lived intangible assets related to certain investments in unconsolidated joint ventures. the gains from unconsolidated entities during the year ended december 31, 2019 are largely due to a gain on the disposition of an unconsolidated entity. net income attributable to noncontrolling interests represents our partners' share of net income (loss) related to joint ventures. the increase during the years ended december 31, 2020 and 2019 relates primarily to our partner's share of the gains recognized on the sale of the 11 property u.s. portfolio and the benchmark senior living portfolio, respectively.

the decrease in rental income is primarily attributable to the write-off of straight-line rent receivable balances of $146,508,000 during the year ended december 31, 2020, relating to leases for which collection of substantially all contractual lease payments was no longer deemed probable. included in such amounts was $91,025,000 relating to genesis healthcare whom noted substantial doubt as to their ability to continue as a going concern in august. certain of our leases contain annual rental escalators that are contingent upon changes in the consumer price index and/or changes in the gross operating revenues of the tenant's properties. these escalators are not fixed, so no straight-line rent is recorded; however, rental income is recorded based on the contractual cash rental payments due for the period. if gross operating revenues at our facilities and/or the consumer price index do not increase, a portion of our revenues may not continue to increase. for the three months ended item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations december 31, 2020, we had 18 leases with rental rate increasers ranging from 0.07% to 0.34% in our triple-net portfolio. our triple-net operators are experiencing similar impacts on occupancy and operating costs due to the covid-19 pandemic as described above with respect to our seniors housing operating properties. however, long-term/post-acute facilities are generally experiencing a higher degree of occupancy declines which may impact the ability of our triple-net operators to make contractual rent payments to us in the future. many of our triple-net operators received funds under the cares act paycheck protection program. in addition, operators of long-term/post-acute facilities have generally received funds from phase 1 of the provider relief fund and operators of assisted living facilities have or are expected to receive funds from phase 2 of the provider relief fund. accordingly, collection of rent due during the covid-19 pandemic to date (march through december) has generally been consistent with historical collection rates and no significant rent concessions or deferrals have been made.
depreciation and amortization fluctuates as a result of acquisitions, disposition and transitions of triple-net properties. to the extent we acquire or dispose of additional properties in the future, our provision for depreciation and amortization will change accordingly.
during the year ended december 31, 2020, we recognized a provision for loan losses of $90,563,000, of which $80,873,000 represents additional reserves as a result of the current collateral estimate related to the genesis healthcare outstanding loans. during the year ended december 31, 2019, we recognized a provision for loan losses of $18,690,000 to fully reserve for certain real estate loans receivable that were no longer deemed collectible. during the year ended december 31, 2020, we recorded impairment charges of $34,867,000 related to one held for sale and four held for use properties. during the year ended december 31, 2019, we recorded impairment charges of $11,374,000 related to two properties. changes in the gain on sales of properties are related to the volume and timing of property sales and the sales prices. the fluctuation in other expense is primarily due to noncapitalizable transaction costs from acquisitions and segment transitions.
during the year ended december 31, 2020, we completed three triple-net construction projects representing $75,149,000 or $224,997 per unit. the following is a summary of our consolidated triple-net construction projects, excluding expansions, pending as of december 31, 2020 (dollars in thousands):

loss (gain) on derivatives and financial instruments, net is primarily attributable to the mark-to-market adjustments recorded on our genesis healthcare available-for-sale investment. interest expense represents secured debt interest expense and related fees. the change in secured debt interest expense is due to the net effect and timing of assumptions, segment transitions, fluctuations in foreign currency rates, extinguishments and principal amortizations. the following is a summary of our triple-net secured debt principal activity for the periods presented (dollars in thousands):

increases in rental income are primarily attributable to the acquisitions of new properties and the conversion of newly constructed outpatient medical properties, particularly the $1.25 billion cnl healthcare properties portfolio acquisition that closed in may 2019, partially offset by 2020 dispositions. certain of our leases contain annual rental escalators that are contingent upon changes in the consumer price index. these escalators are not fixed, so no straight-line rent is recorded; however, rental income is recorded based on the contractual cash rental payments due for the period. if the consumer price index does not increase, a portion of our revenues may not continue to increase. our leases could renew above or below current rental rates, resulting in an increase or decrease in rental income. for the three months ended december 31, 2020, our consolidated outpatient medical portfolio signed 133,859 square feet of new leases and 282,719 square feet of renewals. the weighted-average term of these leases was six years, with a rate of $26.55 per square foot and tenant improvement and lease commission costs of $15.23 per square foot. substantially all of these leases contain an annual fixed or contingent escalation rent structure ranging from 2.0% to 3.5%.
in addition, our outpatient medical tenants are experiencing temporary medical practice closures or decreases in revenue due to government imposed restrictions on elective medical procedures or decisions by patients to delay treatments which may adversely affect their ability to make contractual rent payments. outpatient medical rent collections through march were generally consistent with pre covid-19 levels. during the second quarter we executed short term rent deferrals with certain outpatient medical tenants which in most cases were required to be repaid by year end. since then we have collected approximately 99% of outpatient medical rent due in the second half of the year, with uncollected amounts primarily attributable to local jurisdictions with covid-19 related ordinances providing temporary rent relief to tenants. furthermore, item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations collections of deferred rent due under executed deferrals was over 99%. to the extent that deferred rent is not repaid as expected, or the prolonged impact of the covid-19 pandemic causes operators or tenants to seek further modifications of their lease agreements, we may recognize reductions in revenue and increases in uncollectible receivables.
the fluctuation in property operating expenses and depreciation and amortization are primarily attributable to acquisitions and construction conversions of outpatient medical facilities, offset by dispositions. to the extent that we acquire or dispose of additional properties in the future, these amounts will change accordingly. during the year ended december 31, 2019, we recognized impairment charges of $14,062,000 related to three held for sale properties as the carrying values exceeded the estimated fair values less costs to sell. changes in gains/losses on sales of properties are related to volume of property sales and the sales prices. the increase in other expense during the year ended december 31, 2020 is primarily due to noncapitalizable transaction costs from acquisitions no longer expected to be consummated.
during the year ended december 31, 2020, we completed three outpatient medical construction projects representing $43,493,000 or $306 per square foot. the following is a summary of our consolidated outpatient medical construction projects pending as of december 31, 2020 (dollars in thousands):

general and administrative expenses as a percentage of consolidated revenues for the years ended december 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 were 2.79%, 2.47% and 2.69%, respectively. other expenses for all years include severance-related costs associated with the departure of certain executive officers and key employees.
income tax expense primarily relates to state taxes, foreign taxes and taxes based on income generated by entities that are structured as trss.
item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations other non-gaap financial measures we believe that net income and net income attributable to common stockholders ("nics"), as defined by u.s. gaap, are the most appropriate earnings measurements. however, we consider ffo, noi, ssnoi, ebitda and adjusted ebitda to be useful supplemental measures of our operating performance. historical cost accounting for real estate assets in accordance with u.s. gaap implicitly assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time as evidenced by the provision for depreciation. however, since real estate values have historically risen or fallen with market conditions, many industry investors and analysts have considered presentations of operating results for real estate companies that use historical cost accounting to be insufficient. in response, the national association of real estate investment trusts ("nareit") created funds from operations attributable to common stockholders ("ffo") as a supplemental measure of operating performance for reits that excludes historical cost depreciation from net income. ffo, as defined by nareit, means nics, computed in accordance with u.s. gaap, excluding gains (or losses) from sales of real estate and impairment of depreciable assets, plus depreciation and amortization, and after adjustments for unconsolidated entities and noncontrolling interests.
consolidated net operating income ("noi") is used to evaluate the operating performance of our properties. we define noi as total revenues, including tenant reimbursements, less property operating expenses. property operating expenses represent costs associated with managing, maintaining and servicing tenants for our properties. these expenses include, but are not limited to, property-related payroll and benefits, property management fees paid to operators, marketing, housekeeping, food service, maintenance, utilities, property taxes and insurance. general and administrative expenses represent costs unrelated to property operations. these expenses include, but are not limited to, payroll and benefits, professional services, office expenses and depreciation of corporate fixed assets. same store noi ("ssnoi") is used to evaluate the operating performance of our properties using a consistent population which controls for changes in the composition of our portfolio. we believe the drivers of property level noi for both consolidated properties and unconsolidated properties are generally the same and therefore, we evaluate ssnoi based on our ownership interest in each property ("welltower share"). to arrive at welltower's share, noi is adjusted by adding our minority ownership share related to unconsolidated properties and by subtracting the minority partners' noncontrolling ownership interests for consolidated properties. we do not control investments in unconsolidated properties and while we consider disclosures at welltower share to be useful, they may not accurately depict the legal and economic implications of our joint venture arrangements and should be used with caution. as used herein, same store is generally defined as those revenue-generating properties in the portfolio for the relevant year-over-year reporting periods. acquisitions and development conversions are included in ssnoi five full quarters or eight full quarters after acquisition or being placed into service for the qtd pool and the ytd pool, respectively. land parcels, loans and sub-leases, as well as any properties sold or classified as held for sale during the respective periods are excluded from ssnoi. redeveloped properties (including major refurbishments of a seniors housing operating property where 20% or more of units are simultaneously taken out of commission for 30 days or more or outpatient medical properties undergoing a change in intended use) are excluded from ssnoi until five full quarters or eight full quarters post completion of the redevelopment for the qtd pool and ytd pool, respectively. properties undergoing operator transitions and/or segment transitions are also excluded from ssnoi until five full quarters or eight full quarters post completion of the transition for the qtd pool and ytd pool, respectively. in addition, properties significantly impacted by force majeure, acts of god, or other extraordinary adverse events are excluded from ssnoi until five full quarters or eight full quarters after the properties are placed back into service for the qtd pool and ytd pool, respectively. ssnoi excludes non-cash noi and includes adjustments to present consistent ownership percentages and to translate canadian properties and u.k. properties using a consistent exchange rate. we believe noi and ssnoi provide investors relevant and useful information because they measure the operating performance of our properties at the property level on an unleveraged basis. we use noi and ssnoi to make decisions about resource allocations and to assess the property level performance of our properties.
ebitda is defined as earnings (net income) before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization. adjusted ebitda is defined as ebitda excluding unconsolidated entities and including adjustments for stock-based compensation expense, provision for loan losses, gains/losses on extinguishment of debt, gains/loss/impairments on properties, gains/losses on derivatives and financial instruments, other expense, additional other income and other impairment charges. we believe that ebitda and adjusted ebitda, along with net income, are important supplemental measures because they provide additional information to assess and evaluate the performance of our operations. we primarily use these measures to determine our interest coverage ratio, which represents ebitda and adjusted ebitda divided by total interest, and our fixed charge coverage ratio, which represents ebitda and adjusted ebitda divided by fixed charges. fixed charges include total interest, secured debt principal amortization, and preferred dividends. covenants in our unsecured senior notes and primary credit facility contain financial ratios based on a definition of ebitda and adjusted ebitda that is specific to those agreements. our leverage ratios are defined as the proportion of net debt to total capitalization and include book capitalization, undepreciated book capitalization and market capitalization. book capitalization represents the sum of net debt (defined as total long-term debt, excluding operating lease liabilities, less cash and cash equivalents and any irc section 1031 deposits), total equity and redeemable noncontrolling interests. undepreciated book capitalization represents book capitalization adjusted for accumulated item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations depreciation and amortization. market capitalization represents book capitalization adjusted for the fair market value of our common stock.
our supplemental reporting measures and similarly entitled financial measures are widely used by investors, equity and debt analysts and rating agencies in the valuation, comparison, rating and investment recommendations of companies. management uses these financial measures to facilitate internal and external comparisons to our historical operating results and in making operating decisions. additionally, these measures are utilized by the board of directors to evaluate management. none of our supplemental measures represent net income or cash flow provided from operating activities as determined in accordance with u.s. gaap and should not be considered as alternative measures of profitability or liquidity. finally, the supplemental measures, as defined by us, may not be comparable to similarly entitled items reported by other real estate investment trusts or other companies.
the table below reflects the reconciliation of ffo to nics, the most directly comparable u.s. gaap measure, for the periods presented. noncontrolling interest and unconsolidated entity amounts represent adjustments to reflect our share of depreciation and amortization, gains/losses on real estate dispositions and impairments of assets. amounts are in thousands except for per share data.

critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with u.s. gaap, which requires us to make estimates and assumptions. management considers an accounting estimate or assumption critical if:
•the nature of the estimates or assumptions is material due to the levels of subjectivity and judgment necessary to account for highly uncertain matters or the susceptibility of such matters to change; and
•the impact of the estimates and assumptions on financial condition or operating performance is material.
management has discussed the development and selection of its critical accounting policies with the audit committee of the board of directors. management believes the current assumptions and other considerations used to estimate amounts reflected in our consolidated financial statements are appropriate and are not reasonably likely to change in the future. however, since these estimates require assumptions to be made that were uncertain at the time the estimate was made, they bear the risk of change. if actual experience differs from the assumptions and other considerations used in estimating amounts reflected in our consolidated financial statements, the resulting changes could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations, liquidity and/or financial condition. please refer to note 2 to our consolidated financial statements for further information on significant accounting policies that impact us and for the impact of new accounting standards, including accounting pronouncements that were issued but not yet adopted by us.
the following table presents information about our critical accounting policies, as well as the material assumptions used to develop each estimate:

assessing impairment of real property involves subjectivity in determining if indicators of impairment are present and in estimating the future undiscounted cash flows or estimated fair value of an asset. in estimating the undiscounted cash flows or fair value, key assumptions that would be made are the estimation of future rental revenues, operating expenses, capitalization rates and the ability and intent to hold the respective asset, all of which are affected by our expectations of future market or economic conditions. these estimates can have a significant impact on the undiscounted cash flows or estimated fair value of an asset.

we believe that substantially all of our real estate acquisitions are considered asset acquisitions for which we record the related real estate acquired (tangible assets and identifiable intangible assets and liabilities) at cost on a relative fair value basis. liabilities assumed and any associated noncontrolling interests are reflected at fair value. tangible assets consist primarily of land, building and improvements. identifiable intangible assets and liabilities primarily consist of the above or below market component of in-place leases and the value of in-place leases. the total amount of other intangible assets acquired is further allocated to in-place lease values and customer relationship values based on management's evaluation of the specific characteristics of each tenant's lease and our overall relationship with respect to that tenant.

the consolidated financial statements include our accounts, the accounts of our wholly-owned subsidiaries, and the accounts of joint venture entities in which we own a majority voting interest with the ability to control operations and where no substantive participating rights or substantive kick out rights have been granted to the noncontrolling interests. in addition, we consolidate those entities deemed to be variable interest entities ("vies") in which we are determined to be the primary beneficiary. all material intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation.

the allowance for credit losses is maintained at a level believed adequate to absorb potential losses in our loans receivable. the determination of the credit allowance is based on a quarterly evaluation of all outstanding loans, including general economic conditions and estimated collectability of loan payments.

management's discussion and analysis of the changes in medical margin is discussed below under "financial performance."
see notes to consolidated financial statements, note 16, "segments," for more information.

health plans as of december 31, 2020, the health plans segment consisted of health plans operating in 15 states, and served approximately 4.0 million members eligible for medicaid, medicare, and other government-sponsored healthcare programs for low-income families and individuals, including marketplace members, most of whom receive government premium subsidies. in addition, in connection with our acquisition of magellan complete care on december 31, 2020, we added approximately 200,000 members, and now operate health plans in 18 states.
the health plans reportable segment includes our regulated health plan operating segments, along with the recently acquired magellan complete care health plans operating segment. because this acquisition closed on december 31, 2020, magellan complete care's operating results were insignificant to our consolidated results of operations for the year ended december 31, 2020.
trends and uncertainties for a discussion of the health plans segment's trends, uncertainties and other developments, refer to "item 1. business-our business," "-covid-19 pandemic," and "-legislative and political environment."

as discussed above, the combination of all the covid-19 pandemic-related impacts decreased pretax income in 2020 and increased our consolidated mcr in 2020 by approximately 50 basis points. some of these items increased earnings, such as lower than expected medical costs from the curtailment of utilization that benefited all our state health plans, and a meaningful increase in medicaid membership, while others served to decrease earnings, such as the temporary, retroactive medicaid premium refunds and related actions enacted by certain states.
comments relating to the performance of our health plans in california, ohio, texas and washington, which represent our largest health plans from a premium revenue standpoint, follow:
california. for the year ended december 31, 2020, medical margin declined when compared with 2019, as the lower medical care costs from the curtailment of utilization were more than offset by retroactive medicaid premium refunds and underperformance in the marketplace program.

net effects of covid-19 had an unfavorable impact on medical margins in all programs in 2020, as the retroactive premium refunds exceeded the benefit from lower medical costs due to the curtailment of utilization.
texas. for the year ended december 31, 2020, premium revenues and medical margin were both slightly higher when compared with 2019. medical margin increased due to higher premium revenues and a lower mcr in medicaid, mostly driven by curtailment of utilization related to covid-19 premiums, partially offset by underperformance in marketplace. the decline in marketplace resulted mainly from lower premiums and higher acuity mix for the new members we served.
washington. for the year ended december 31, 2020, medical margin was higher when compared with 2019, mainly due to improved results in medicaid. medicaid premium revenues increased in the year ended december 31, 2020, due to membership growth. in addition, results in the year ended december 31, 2020, benefited modestly from lower medical costs due to the curtailment of utilization driven by covid-19, which was partially offset by covid-related provider payments mandated by the state in the second quarter of 2020.

medicaid medicaid premium revenue increased $1,799 million in 2020, when compared with 2019, mainly due to membership growth and premium increases in several states, and the impact from suspension of redeterminations due to covid-19. excluding acquisitions and our planned exit from puerto rico, we have added approximately 415,000 new medicaid members since march 31, 2020, when we first began to report on the impacts of the pandemic. we believe this membership increase was mainly due to the suspension of redeterminations. these premium increases were partially offset by premium refunds and related actions enacted in several states in response to the lower utilization of medical services stemming from covid-19.
the medical margin of our medicaid program increased $307 million, or 21%, in 2020 when compared with 2019. the increase was driven by increased premium revenues and margin associated with the membership growth discussed above, and from a reduction in the mcr.
the medicaid mcr decreased to 87.4% in 2020, from 88.0% in 2019, or 60 basis points. the decrease in the medicaid mcr in 2020 was due to improvements across all programs. the mcr benefited from operational improvements and premium increases in several states, but was partially offset by unfavorable effects of covid-19, including the impact of the premium refunds and related actions, net of lower medical costs due to the curtailment of utilization.
in the third quarter of 2020, we recognized a $10 million premium deficiency reserve ("pdr") associated with the puerto rico medicaid business. we exited this business on october 31, 2020. the pdr represents the estimated remaining claims and administrative costs that exceed the estimated remaining premiums associated with the contract.
these improvements were partially offset by unfavorable year-over-year changes in prior year reserve development. prior year reserve development in 2020 was not material; however, 2019 was positively impacted by 100 basis points of favorable reserve development.
medicare medicare premium revenue increased $269 million in 2020, when compared with 2019, primarily due to increases in premium revenue pmpm and member months. pmpms improved due to increased revenue resulting from risk scores that are more commensurate with the acuity of our population and increases in quality incentive premium revenues. these increases were partially offset by premium refunds, mainly in mmp, enacted in response to the lower utilization of medical services stemming from covid-19.

the medical margin for medicare increased $21 million, or 6%, in 2020 when compared with 2019, primarily due to the increase in premium revenue discussed above, partially offset by increases in medical costs pmpm.
the medicare mcr increased from 85.3% in 2019 to 86.0% in 2020, or 70 basis points. the increase was primarily driven by an increase in medical care costs pmpm, which was mainly attributed to unfavorable changes in member mix, including higher acuity populations. the medical cost pmpm also reflected modestly lower utilization of medical services stemming from covid-19. the impact of increased medical costs on the mcr was partially offset by the increase in the premium revenue pmpm discussed above.
marketplace marketplace premium revenue increased $23 million in 2020, when compared with 2019, mainly due to increased membership, partially offset by a decrease in premium revenue pmpm. the decrease in premium revenue pmpm was mainly driven by lower pricing, in an effort to be more competitive and generate membership growth, and the impact of more health plans being subject to minimum medical loss ratio rebates when compared with the prior year. the factors decreasing premium revenue pmpm were partially offset by the impact of higher risk adjustment premiums, resulting from higher acuity of our membership.
the marketplace medical margin decreased $152 million in 2020, despite the increase in premium revenues, due to an increase in the mcr compared to 2019.
the marketplace mcr increased to 78.7% in 2020, compared to 68.2% in 2019. the increase in mcr was driven by the impact of the decrease in premium revenue pmpm discussed above, combined with an increase in medical cost pmpm when compared with 2019. the higher medical cost pmpm was primarily due to a higher member acuity mix and increased medical costs related to covid-19. the rebound in utilization for marketplace, following the curtailment from covid-19, has been much more pronounced than our medicaid and medicare programs. additionally, our risk scores, though increased compared to 2019, continue to lag the acuity of our membership.
other the other segment includes certain corporate amounts not allocated to the health plans segment. in 2020 and 2019, such amounts were immaterial to our consolidated results of operations.
liquidity and financial condition liquidity we manage our cash, investments, and capital structure to meet the short- and long-term obligations of our business while maintaining liquidity and financial flexibility. we forecast, analyze, and monitor our cash flows to enable prudent investment management and financing within the confines of our financial strategy.
we maintain liquidity at two levels: 1) the regulated health plan subsidiaries; and 2) the parent company. our regulated health plan subsidiaries generate significant cash flows from premium revenue and net income. such cash flows are our primary source of liquidity. thus, any future decline in our profitability may have a negative impact on our liquidity. we generally receive premium revenue a short time before we pay for the related healthcare services. the majority of the assets held by our regulated health plan subsidiaries is in the form of cash, cash equivalents, and investments.
when available and as permitted by applicable regulations, cash in excess of the capital needs of our regulated health plan subsidiaries is generally paid in the form of dividends to our parent company to be used for general corporate purposes. the regulated health plan subsidiaries paid dividends to the parent company amounting to $635 million in 2020, and $1,373 million in 2019, respectively. the parent company contributed capital of $107 million and $43 million in 2020 and 2019, respectively, to our regulated health plan subsidiaries to satisfy statutory capital and surplus requirements.
cash, cash equivalents and investments at the parent company amounted to $644 million and $997 million as of december 31, 2020, and 2019, respectively. the decrease in 2020 was mainly due to cash used for magellan complete care and other acquisitions, and common stock repurchases. these outflows were partially offset by inflows from net debt financing transactions, and dividends received from regulated health plan subsidiaries, net of contributions, as described above. see further discussion below, in "investing activities," and "financing activities."

investments after considering expected cash flows from operating activities, we generally invest cash of regulated subsidiaries that exceeds our expected short-term obligations in longer term, investment-grade, and marketable debt securities to improve our overall investment return. these investments are made pursuant to board-approved investment policies which conform to applicable state laws and regulations.
our investment policies are designed to provide liquidity, preserve capital, and maximize total return on invested assets, all in a manner consistent with state requirements that prescribe the types of instruments in which our subsidiaries may invest. these investment policies require that our investments have final maturities of less than 10 years, or less than 10 years average life for structured securities. professional portfolio managers operating under documented guidelines manage our investments and a portion of our cash equivalents. our portfolio managers must obtain our prior approval before selling investments where the loss position of those investments exceeds certain levels.
we believe that the risks of the covid-19 pandemic, as they relate to our investments, are minimal. the overall rating of our portfolio remains strong and is rated aa. our investment policy has directives in conjunction with state guidelines to minimize risks and exposures in volatile markets. additionally, our portfolio managers assist us in navigating the current volatility in the capital markets.
our restricted investments are invested principally in cash, cash equivalents, and u.s. treasury securities; we have the ability to hold such restricted investments until maturity. all of our unrestricted investments are classified as current assets.
cash flow activities our cash flows are summarized as follows:

operating activities we typically receive capitation payments monthly, in advance of payments for medical claims; however, government payors may adjust their payment schedules, positively or negatively impacting our reported cash flows from operating activities in any given period. for example, government payors may delay our premium payments, or they may prepay the following month's premium payment.
net cash provided by operations was $1,890 million in 2020, compared with $427 million of net cash provided in 2019. the $1,463 million increase in year-over-year cash flow was due to cash flow timing benefits from the growth in membership in 2020, and the net impact of timing differences in governmental receivables and payables.
investing activities net cash used in investing activities was $400 million in 2020, compared with $293 million of net cash used in 2019, a decrease in year-over-year cash flow of $107 million. the decrease was mainly attributable to net cash paid in the yourcare, passport and magellan complete care acquisitions, partially offset by decreased purchases of investments in 2020.
financing activities net cash provided by financing activities was $225 million in 2020, compared with $552 million of net cash used in 2019, an increase in year-over-year cash flow of $777 million. in 2020, cash inflows included $1,429 million from the issuance of the 4.375% and 3.875% notes and $380 million borrowed under the term loan facility. cash outflows included the $600 million repayment of the term loan facility, common stock purchases of $606 million, which included $7 million to settle shares purchased in late december 2019, and net cash paid for the aggregate convertible senior notes‐related transactions amounting to $42 million. in 2019, cash outflows included net cash paid for the aggregate convertible senior notes-related transactions of $754 million, and $47 million paid for common stock purchases, partially offset by proceeds of $220 million borrowed under the term loan facility.

financial condition we believe that our cash resources, borrowing capacity available under our credit agreement as discussed further below in "future sources and uses of liquidity-future sources," and internally generated funds will be sufficient to support our operations, regulatory requirements, debt repayment obligations and capital expenditures for at least the next 12 months.
on a consolidated basis, as of december 31, 2020, our working capital was $2,911 million compared with $2,698 million as of december 31, 2019. at december 31, 2020, our cash and investments amounted to $6,165 million, compared with $4,477 million of cash and investments at december 31, 2019.
because of the statutory restrictions that inhibit the ability of our health plans to transfer net assets to us, the amount of retained earnings readily available to pay dividends to our stockholders is generally limited to cash, cash equivalents and investments held by our unregulated parent. for more information, see the "liquidity" discussion presented above.
regulatory capital and dividend restrictions each of our regulated, wholly owned subsidiaries must maintain a minimum amount of statutory capital determined by statute or regulations. such statutes, regulations and capital requirements also restrict the timing, payment and amount of dividends and other distributions, loans or advances that may be paid to us as the sole stockholder. to the extent our subsidiaries must comply with these regulations, they may not have the financial flexibility to transfer funds to us. based upon current statutes and regulations, the minimum capital and surplus requirement for these subsidiaries (not including the magellan complete care subsidiaries) was estimated to be approximately $1,310 million at december 31, 2020, compared with $1,110 million at december 31, 2019. we estimate the magellan complete care subsidiaries' minimum capital and surplus requirement amounted to approximately $230 million at december 31, 2020. the aggregate capital and surplus of our wholly owned subsidiaries was in excess of these minimum capital requirements as of both dates.
under applicable regulatory requirements, the amount of dividends that may be paid by our wholly owned subsidiaries without prior approval by regulatory authorities as of december 31, 2020, was approximately $60 million in the aggregate. the subsidiaries may pay dividends over this amount, but only after approval is granted by the regulatory authorities.
based on our cash and investments balances as of december 31, 2020, management believes that its regulated wholly owned subsidiaries remain well capitalized and exceed their regulatory minimum requirements. we have the ability, and have committed to provide, additional capital to each of our health plans as necessary to ensure compliance with statutory capital and surplus requirements.
debt ratings each of our high-yield senior notes is rated "bb-" by standard & poor's, and "ba3" by moody's investor service, inc. a downgrade in our ratings could adversely affect our borrowing capacity and increase our borrowing costs.
financial covenants the credit agreement contains customary non-financial and financial covenants, including a net leverage ratio and an interest coverage ratio. such ratios are computed as defined by the terms of the credit agreement.
in addition, the indentures governing each of our outstanding high-yield senior notes contain cross-default provisions that are triggered upon default by us or any of our subsidiaries on any indebtedness in excess of the amount specified in the applicable indenture. as of december 31, 2020, we were in compliance with all financial and non-financial covenants under the credit agreement and other long-term debt.
future sources and uses of liquidity future sources our health plans segment regulated subsidiaries generate significant cash flows from premium revenue, which is generally received a short time before related healthcare services are paid. premium revenue is our primary source of liquidity. thus, any decline in the receipt of premium revenue, and our profitability, could have a negative impact on our liquidity.

potential impact of covid-19 pandemic. excluding acquisitions and our planned exit from puerto rico, we have added approximately 415,000 new medicaid members since march 31, 2020, when we first began to report on the impacts of the pandemic. we believe this membership increase was mainly due to the suspension of redeterminations.
it remains unclear how high the covid-related membership peak will be, how quickly it will fall as the economy recovers, and where it will ultimately settle. however it does now appear that since unemployment nationally has fallen to 6.3% as of january 2021, the initial industry estimates of unemployment-related medicaid membership increases were somewhat overstated. on a related note, the declaration of the extension of the public health emergency period to april 2021, with a potential extension from the biden administration for the public health emergency to remain in place for all of 2021, will also likely have an impact. therefore, we are currently unable to predict the timing or amount of the expected increases in enrollment. increased membership would increase our premium revenue, but would also likely result in a significant increase in medical care claims and related costs. we believe that we have the scalability necessary to both serve new members, and ably partner with our state customers for increases in membership.
dividends from subsidiaries. when available and as permitted by applicable regulations, cash in excess of the capital needs of our regulated health plans is generally paid in the form of dividends to our unregulated parent company to be used for general corporate purposes. as a result of the covid-19 pandemic, state regulators could restrict the ability of our regulated health plan subsidiaries to pay dividends to the parent company, which could reduce the liquidity of the parent company. for more information on our regulatory capital requirements and dividend restrictions, refer to notes to consolidated financial statements, note 15, "commitments and contingencies-regulatory capital requirements and dividend restrictions," and note 17, "condensed financial information of registrant-note c - dividends and capital contributions."
credit agreement borrowing capacity. as of december 31, 2020, we had available borrowing capacity of $1 billion under the revolving credit facility of our credit agreement. in addition, the credit agreement provides for a $15 million swingline sub-facility and a $100 million letter of credit sub-facility, as well as incremental term loans available to finance certain acquisitions up to $500 million, plus an unlimited amount of such term loans as long as we maintain a minimum consolidated net leverage ratio. see further discussion in the notes to consolidated financial statements, note 11, "debt."
future uses common stock purchases. in september 2020, our board of directors authorized the purchase of up to $500 million, in the aggregate, of our common stock. this program is funded with cash on hand and extends through december 31, 2021. the exact timing and amount of any repurchase is determined by management based on market conditions and share price, in addition to other factors, and subject to the restrictions relating to volume, price, and timing under applicable law. following the purchases completed under a rule 10b5-1 trading plan from november 2020 through february 11, 2021, there is approximately $219 million remaining available to purchase our common stock through december 31, 2021. see further information in the notes to consolidated financial statements, note 13, "stockholders' equity."
acquisitions. we have a disciplined and steady approach to growth. organic growth, which includes leveraging our existing health plan portfolio and winning new territories, is our highest priority. in addition to organic growth, we will consider targeted acquisitions that are a strategic fit that we believe will leverage operational synergies, and lead to incremental earnings accretion. for further information on our acquisitions, refer to the notes to consolidated financial statements, note 4, "business combinations."
in september 2020, we entered into a definitive agreement to acquire substantially all the assets of affinity health plan, inc. the net purchase price for the transaction is approximately $380 million, subject to various adjustments at closing, which we intend to fund with cash on hand. we currently expect the transaction to close as early as the second quarter of 2021.
in september 2020, we completed the acquisition of certain assets of passport health plan, inc. the purchase consideration included estimated contingent consideration of approximately $46 million as of december 31, 2020. half this amount is payable later in 2021, with the remainder payable in early 2022, subject to review and agreement among us and the seller. the second half payment is contingent upon the outcome of certain legal challenges.

outcome of aca litigation. as described above in "health plans segment-trends and uncertainties," the u.s. supreme court has accepted the appeal of the fifth circuit court's decision regarding the constitutionality and severability of the individual mandate. the aca remains in effect pending the issuance of the supreme court's opinion. a decision by the supreme court that the entirety of the aca is unconstitutional could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, cash flows, or results of operations.
potential impact of covid-19 pandemic. beginning in early 2020 the pandemic, along with the related quarantine and social distancing measures, reduced demand for certain routine and non-critical medical services, while at the same time increased demand for other medical services, such as covid-19 testing and emergency services. in 2020, utilization was curtailed, but could rebound to more normal levels in 2021. increased demand for medical services, which we are presently unable to predict the timing or magnitude, could result in a significant increase in medical care costs and related provider claims payments.
also, as described above in "item 1. business-covid-19 pandemic," we have been subject to premium refunds and related actions as a result of the pandemic. in 2020, various states enacted temporary premium refunds and related actions in response to the reduced demand for medical services stemming from covid-19, which resulted in a reduction of our medical margin. in some cases, these premium actions were retroactive to earlier periods in 2020, or as early as the beginning of the states' fiscal years in 2019. beginning in the second quarter of 2020, we have recognized retroactive premium actions that we believe to be probable, and where the ultimate premium amount is reasonably estimable. we recognized $564 million related to these retroactive premium actions, in the aggregate, in 2020.
it is possible that certain states could increase the level of existing premium refunds, and it is also possible that other states could implement some form of retroactive premium refund in the future. due to these uncertainties, the ultimate outcomes could differ materially from our estimates as a result of changes in facts or further developments, which could have an adverse effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.
regulatory capital requirements and dividend restrictions. we have the ability, and have committed to provide, additional capital to each of our health plans as necessary to ensure compliance with minimum statutory capital requirements.
the molina healthcare charitable foundation. in august 2020, we announced our commitment of $150 million to fund the molina healthcare charitable foundation (the "foundation"), an independent not-for-profit charitable foundation. we contributed $15 million to the foundation in the fourth quarter of 2020.
critical accounting estimates when we prepare our consolidated financial statements, we use estimates and assumptions that may affect reported amounts and disclosures. actual results could differ from these estimates, and some differences could be material. our most significant accounting estimates, which include a higher degree of judgment and/or complexity, include the following:
•medical claims and benefits payable. see discussion below, and refer to the notes to consolidated financial statements, notes 2, "significant accounting policies," and 10, "medical claims and benefits payable" for more information.
•contractual provisions that may adjust or limit revenue or profit. for a discussion of this topic, including amounts recorded in our consolidated financial statements, refer to the notes to consolidated financial statements, note 2, "significant accounting policies."
•quality incentives. for a discussion of this topic, refer to the notes to consolidated financial statements, note 2, "significant accounting policies."
•business combinations, and goodwill and intangible assets, net. at december 31, 2020, goodwill and intangible assets, net, represented approximately 10% of total assets and 45% of total stockholders' equity, compared with 3% and 9%, respectively, at december 31, 2019. for a comprehensive discussion of this topic, including amounts recorded in our consolidated financial statements, refer to the notes to consolidated financial statements, note 2, "significant accounting policies," note 4, "business combinations," and note 9, "goodwill and intangible assets, net."

medical care costs, medical claims and benefits payable medical care costs are recognized in the period in which services are provided and include fee-for-service claims, pharmacy benefits, capitation payments to providers, and various other medically-related costs. under fee-for-service claims arrangements with providers, we retain the financial responsibility for medical care provided and incur costs based on actual utilization of hospital and physician services. such medical care costs include amounts paid by us as well as estimated medical claims and benefits payable for costs that were incurred but not paid as of the reporting date ("ibnp"). pharmacy benefits represent payments for members' prescription drug costs, net of rebates from drug manufacturers. we estimate pharmacy rebates based on historical and current utilization of prescription drugs and contractual provisions. capitation payments represent monthly contractual fees paid to providers, who are responsible for providing medical care to members, which could include medical or ancillary costs like dental, vision and other supplemental health benefits. such capitation costs are fixed in advance of the periods covered and are not subject to significant accounting estimates. other medical care costs include all medically-related administrative costs, amounts due to providers pursuant to risk-sharing or other incentive arrangements, provider claims, and other healthcare expenses. examples of medically-related administrative costs include expenses relating to health education, quality assurance, case management, care coordination, disease management, and 24-hour on-call nurses. additionally, we include an estimate for the cost of settling claims incurred through the reporting date in our medical claims and benefits payable liability.
medical claims and benefits payable consist mainly of fee-for-service ibnp, unpaid pharmacy claims, capitation costs, other medical costs, including amounts payable to providers pursuant to risk-sharing or other incentive arrangements and amounts payable to providers on behalf of certain state agencies for certain state assessments in which we assume no financial risk. ibnp includes the costs of claims incurred as of the balance sheet date which have been reported to us, and our best estimate of the cost of claims incurred but not yet reported to us. we also include an additional reserve to ensure that our overall ibnp liability is sufficient under moderately adverse conditions. we reflect changes in these estimates in the consolidated results of operations in the period in which they are determined.
the estimation of the ibnp liability requires a significant degree of judgment in applying actuarial methods, determining the appropriate assumptions and considering numerous factors. of those factors, we consider estimated completion factors (measures the cumulative percentage of claims expense that will ultimately be paid for a given month of service based on historical payment patterns) and the assumed healthcare cost trend (the year-over-year change in per-member per-month medical care costs) to be the most critical assumptions. other relevant factors also include, but are not limited to, healthcare service utilization trends, claim inventory levels, changes in membership, product mix, seasonality, benefit changes or changes in medicaid fee schedules, provider contract changes, prior authorizations and the incidence of catastrophic or pandemic cases.
for claims incurred more than three months before the financial statement date, we mainly use estimated completion factors to estimate the ultimate cost of those claims. completion factors measure the cumulative percentage of claims expense that will ultimately be paid for a given month of service based on historical claims payment patterns. we analyze historical claims payment patterns by comparing claim incurred dates to claim payment dates to estimate completion factors. the estimated completion factors are then applied to claims paid through the financial statement date to estimate the ultimate claims cost for a given month's incurred claim activity. the difference between the estimated ultimate claims cost and the claims paid through the financial statement date represents our estimate of claims remaining to be paid as of the financial statement date and is included in our ibnp liability.
for claims incurred within three months before the financial statement date, actual claims paid are a less reliable measure of our ultimate cost since a large portion of medical claims are not submitted to us until several months after services have been submitted. accordingly, we estimate our ibnp liability for claims incurred during these months based on a blend of estimated completion factors and assumed medical care cost trend. the assumed medical care cost trend represents the year-over-year change in per-member per-month medical care costs, which can be affected by many factors including, but not limited to, our ability and practices to manage medical and pharmaceutical costs, changes in level and mix of services utilized, mix of benefits offered, including the impact of co-pays and deductibles, changes in medical practices, changes in member demographics, catastrophes and epidemics, and other relevant factors.

magnitude or severity of claims, uncertainties related to our entry into new geographical markets or provision of services to new populations, changes in state-controlled fee schedules, and modifications or upgrades to our claims processing systems and practices. therefore, in many situations, the claim amounts ultimately settled will be less than the estimate that satisfies the actuarial standards of practice.
when subsequent actual claims payments are less than we estimated, we recognize a benefit for favorable prior period development that is reported as part of "components of medical care costs related to: "prior years" in the table presented in note 10, "medical claims and benefits payable." our reserving practice is to consistently recognize the actuarial best estimate including a provision for moderately adverse conditions for each current period. this provision is reported as part of "components of medical care costs related to: current year" in the table presented in note 10. assuming stability in the size of our membership, the use of this consistent methodology, during any given period, usually results in the replenishment of reserves at a level that generally offsets the benefit of favorable prior period development in that period. in the case of material growth or decline of membership, replenishment can exceed or fall short of the favorable development, assuming all other factors remain unchanged.
because of the significant degree of judgment involved in estimation of our ibnp liability, there is considerable variability and uncertainty inherent in such estimates. the following table reflects the hypothetical change in our estimate of claims liability as of december 31, 2020 that would result if we change our completion factors for the fourth through the twelfth months preceding december 31, 2020, by the percentages indicated. a reduction in the completion factor results in an increase in medical claims liabilities. the following tables do not include amounts relating to our recent acquisitions of magellan complete care and passport. dollar amounts are in millions.

there are many related factors working in conjunction with one another that determine the accuracy of our estimates, some of which are qualitative in nature rather than quantitative. therefore, we are seldom able to quantify the impact that any single factor has on a change in estimate. given the variability inherent in the reserving process, we will only be able to identify specific factors if they represent a significant departure from expectations. as a result, we do not expect to be able to fully quantify the impact of individual factors on changes in estimates.
recently issued accounting standards refer to the notes to consolidated financial statements, note 2, "significant accounting policies," for a discussion of recent accounting pronouncements that affect us.

contractual obligations in the table below, we present our contractual obligations as of december 31, 2020. some of the amounts included in this table are based on management's estimates and assumptions about these obligations, including their duration, the possibility of renewal, anticipated actions by third parties, and other factors. because these estimates and assumptions are necessarily subjective, the contractual obligations we will actually pay in future periods may vary from those reflected in the table.
additionally, we have a variety of other contractual agreements related to acquiring services used in our operations. however, we believe these other agreements do not contain material non-cancelable commitments. we are not a party to off-balance sheet financing arrangements.

inflation we use various strategies to mitigate the negative effects of healthcare cost inflation. specifically, our health plans try to control medical care costs through contracts with independent providers of healthcare services. through these contracted providers, our health plans emphasize preventive healthcare and appropriate use of specialty and hospital services. there can be no assurance, however, that our strategies to mitigate medical care cost inflation will be successful. competitive pressures, new healthcare and pharmaceutical product introductions, demands from healthcare providers and customers, applicable regulations, or other factors may affect our ability to control medical care costs.
compliance costs our health plans are regulated by both state and federal government agencies. regulation of managed care products and healthcare services is an evolving area of law that varies from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. regulatory agencies generally have discretion to issue regulations and interpret and enforce laws and rules. changes in applicable laws and rules occur frequently. compliance with such laws and rules may lead to additional costs related to the implementation of additional systems, procedures and programs that we have not yet identified.

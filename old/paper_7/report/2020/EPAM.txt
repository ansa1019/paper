business update regarding covid-19
the covid-19 pandemic continued to cause substantial global public health and economic challenges during the fourth quarter of 2020 and our employees, communities and business operations, as well as the global economy and financial markets all continue to be affected. we cannot accurately predict the extent to which the covid-19 pandemic will continue to directly and indirectly impact our business, results of operations and financial condition. future developments and actions to contain the public health and economic impact of the covid-19 pandemic on the markets we serve are rapidly evolving and highly uncertain.
to the extent that the remainder of this management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations ("md&a") refers to a financial or performance metric that has been affected by a trend or activity, that reference is in addition to any impact of the covid-19 pandemic disclosed in and supplemented by this section. the information contained in this section is accurate as of the date hereof, but may become outdated due to changing circumstances beyond our present awareness or control.
our covid-19 pandemic response since the beginning of the covid-19 pandemic, we have made the safety and well-being of our employees our top priority. as governments lift and re-impose restrictions on group gatherings, commercial operations, and travel, and as vaccines and therapeutics become available, we have applied those changing requirements to our business to maintain the health and safety of our employees and serve our customers consistent with appropriate public health considerations. our business continuity plans are designed to ensure the safety and well-being of approximately 41,000 epam professionals while supporting the operations of hundreds of customers around the world.
our employees the vast majority of our employees are able to productively and securely work from a remote location and our remaining personnel are providing services to us or our customers from our offices or our customers' facilities. we therefore do not expect that covid-19 related restrictions on group gatherings and non-essential businesses will have a material adverse effect on our ability to operate our business or productively deliver services to our customers, nor on our financial reporting systems, internal control over financial reporting, or disclosure controls and procedures. with the increase in remote access to our systems and networks, we have accelerated some ongoing security initiatives and programs.
many of the countries where our personnel regularly conduct business have extended or expanded restrictions on travel and immigration from other countries, including a suspension of most immigration and non-immigration visas issued by the united states. further extensions or tightening of these travel and immigration restrictions may continue to impact our operations. however, we do not believe that the current travel and immigration restrictions will have a material adverse effect on our business or financial condition.
our customers our adaptive global delivery model enables us to deliver our services and solutions to our customers from remote locations, so we continue to provide our customers with the products, services, and solutions they seek to deliver their business results. we continually assess our customers' current and future needs for epam personnel to work at their facilities and our global delivery centers, so that we can deploy resources safely and in accordance with covid-19 mitigation efforts.
the prolonged deterioration of economic conditions for some of our customers could materially reduce our sales and profitability. reduced demand from our customers and their customers, persistent financial distress in our customer base, and the continued volatility in macroeconomic conditions has and could continue to adversely impact revenues and decrease the collectability of our trade receivables. any or all of these factors could negatively impact our results of operations. depending on the duration of the covid-19 pandemic and the timing and speed of economic recovery, reduced revenue growth relative to prior years could extend beyond the fourth quarter of 2020.

our community epam supports the communities where we live and work and we assisted our global and local communities by providing solutions to transform the ways people live and work during the covid-19 pandemic, including:
•epam continuum introduced the gentltm mask, an open source solution for manufacturers designed to address the supply shortage of protective masks that medical professionals need amid the coronavirus outbreak.
•epam used its implementation services to help curogram scale its two-way texting and video chat telemedicine platform to help address the covid-19 pandemic by enabling healthcare institutions to quickly deploy mass screening and testing services.
•epam developed covid resistance and covid resistance for business, which are open source mobile applications that can be customized for specific countries or regions when used by governments and non-governmental organizations, or adapted by business for their digital contact-tracing needs so they can anonymously track covid-19 exposure risk.
•epam continuum introduced guide lines: markings for social distancing, a toolkit for retailers and other business owners to adhere to physical distancing guidelines by creating visual cues with readily-available tools and materials to direct foot traffic.
•epam's made real lab released an open source design to accelerate the production of reusable face shields that do not require 3d printing and use commercially available materials.
•epam continuum introduced an open source project for parents and children to build a timer to encourage healthy handwashing habits, teach electronics and creative prototyping skills, and basic coding skills.
•epam and the united nations children's fund/europe and central asia regional office partnered to build a covid-19 information chatbot app that was combined with epam's covid resistance app to provide national authorities, public health institutions, social service agencies, families and individuals access to trusted information while promoting protective and preventive behaviors at the individual and community levels.
moving forward we expect continued uncertainty around the impacts the pandemic will have on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. we actively monitor our business and the needs of our employees, customers, and communities to determine the appropriate actions to protect the health and safety of our employees and our ongoing operations. this includes actions informed by the requirements and recommendations of public health authorities. economic and demand uncertainty in the current environment may impact our future results. we continue to monitor the demand for our services including the duration and degree to which we see declines or delays in new customer projects and payment for services performed. we continue to assess how the effects of covid-19 on the economy may impact human capital allocation, revenues, profitability, and operating expenses.

the key highlights of our consolidated results for 2020 were as follows:
•we recorded revenues of $2.7 billion, or a 15.9% increase from $2.3 billion in the previous year, negatively impacted by $0.8 million or 0.1% due to changes in certain foreign currency exchange rates as compared to the corresponding period in the previous year.
•income from operations grew 25.3% to $379.3 million from $302.9 million in 2019. expressed as a percentage of revenues, income from operations was 14.3% compared to 13.2%. the increase in income from operations as a percentage of revenues during the year ended december 31, 2020 was primarily driven by a reduction in travel-related expenses reported in cost of revenues and a reduction in travel-related, recruitment, and facilities expenses reported in selling, general and administrative expenses which was partially offset by an increase in cost of revenues as a percentage of revenues attributable to temporary discounts provided to certain customers experiencing challenging economic conditions due to the impact of the covid-19 pandemic.
•our effective tax rate was 13.6% compared to 12.8% in the previous year. the provision for income taxes was impacted primarily by the excess tax benefits recorded upon vesting or exercise of stock-based awards in 2020 and 2019.
•net income increased 25.3% to $327.2 million compared to $261.1 million in 2019. expressed as a percentage of revenues, net income increased 0.9% compared to last year, which was largely driven by the improvement in income from operations and partially offset by an increase in our effective tax rate.
•diluted earnings per share increased 23.6% to $5.60 for the year ended december 31, 2020 from $4.53 in 2019.
•cash provided by operations increased $257.0 million, or 89.4%, to $544.4 million during 2020 as compared to last year. this increase is largely driven by the increase in net income, improvements in collections from customers, and reduced income tax payments compared to 2019.
the operating results in any period are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for any future period.
28
critical accounting policies we prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with u.s. generally accepted accounting principles ("gaap"), which require us to make judgments, estimates and assumptions that affect: (i) the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, (ii) the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the end of each reporting period and (iii) the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during each reporting period. we evaluate these estimates and assumptions based on historical experience, knowledge and assessment of current business and other conditions, and expectations regarding the future based on available information and reasonable assumptions, which together form a basis for making judgments about matters not readily apparent from other sources. since the use of estimates is an integral component of the financial reporting process, actual results could differ from those estimates. some of our accounting policies require higher degrees of judgment than others in their application. when reviewing our audited consolidated financial statements, you should consider (i) our selection of critical accounting policies, (ii) the judgment and other uncertainties affecting the application of such policies and (iii) the sensitivity of reported results to changes in conditions and assumptions. we consider the policies discussed below to be critical to an understanding of our consolidated financial statements as their application places significant demands on the judgment of our management.
an accounting policy is considered critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made, and if different estimates that reasonably could have been used, or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely to occur periodically, could materially impact the consolidated financial statements. we believe that the following critical accounting policies are the most sensitive and require more significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. you should read the following descriptions of critical accounting policies, judgments and estimates in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements and other disclosures included elsewhere in this annual report. additional information on our policies is in note 1 "business and summary of significant accounting policies" in the notes to our consolidated financial statements in this annual report on form 10-k.
revenues - we recognize revenues when control of goods or services is passed to a customer in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services. such control may be transferred over time or at a point in time depending on satisfaction of obligations stipulated by the contract. consideration expected to be received may consist of both fixed and variable components and is allocated to each separately identifiable performance obligation based on the performance obligation's relative standalone selling price. variable consideration usually takes the form of volume-based discounts, service level credits, price concessions or incentives. determining the estimated amount of such variable consideration involves assumptions and judgment that can have an impact on the amount of revenues reported.
we derive revenues from a variety of service arrangements, which have been evolving to provide more customized and integrated solutions to customers by combining software engineering with customer experience design, business consulting and technology innovation services. fees for these contracts may be in the form of time-and-materials or fixed-price arrangements. we generate the majority of our revenues under time-and-material contracts, which are billed using hourly, daily or monthly rates to determine the amounts to be charged directly to the customer. we apply a practical expedient and revenues related to time-and-material contracts are recognized based on the right to invoice for services performed.
fixed-price contracts include maintenance and support arrangements, which may exceed one year in duration. maintenance and support arrangements generally relate to the provision of ongoing services and revenues for such contracts are recognized ratably over the expected service period. fixed-price contracts also include application development arrangements, where progress towards satisfaction of the performance obligation is measured using input or output methods and input methods are used only when there is a direct correlation between hours incurred and the end product delivered. assumptions, risks and uncertainties inherent in the estimates used to measure progress could affect the amount of revenues, receivables and deferred revenues at each reporting period.
revenues from licenses which have significant stand-alone functionality are recognized at a point in time when control of the license is transferred to the customer. revenues from licenses which do not have stand-alone functionality are recognized over time. if there is an uncertainty about the receipt of payment for the services, revenue recognition is deferred until the uncertainty is sufficiently resolved. we apply a practical expedient and do not assess the existence of a significant financing component if the period between transfer of the service to a customer and when the customer pays for that service is one year or less.
we report gross reimbursable "out-of-pocket" expenses incurred as both revenues and cost of revenues in the consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income.
29
business combinations - we account for business combinations using the acquisition method which requires us to estimate the fair value of identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed, including any contingent consideration, to properly allocate purchase price to the individual assets acquired and liabilities assumed. the allocation of the purchase price utilizes significant estimates in determining the fair values of identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed, especially with respect to intangible assets. the significant estimates and assumptions used include the timing and amount of forecasted revenues and cash flows, anticipated growth rates, customer attrition rates, the discount rate reflecting the risk inherent in future cash flows and the determination of useful lives for finite-lived assets. there are different valuation models for each component, the selection of which requires considerable judgment. these determinations will affect the amount of amortization expense recognized in future periods. we base our fair value estimates on assumptions we believe are reasonable, but recognize that the assumptions are inherently uncertain. the acquired assets typically include customer relationships, software, trade names, non-competition agreements, and assembled workforce and as a result, a substantial portion of the purchase price is typically allocated to goodwill and other intangible assets.
if the initial accounting for the business combination has not been completed by the end of the reporting period in which the business combination occurs, provisional amounts are reported to present information about facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date. once the measurement period ends, which in no case extends beyond one year from the acquisition date, revisions to the accounting for the business combination are recorded in earnings.
leases - we determine if an arrangement is a lease or contains a lease at inception. we perform an assessment and classify the lease as either an operating lease or a financing lease at the lease commencement date with a right-of-use asset ("rou asset") and a lease liability recognized in the consolidated balance sheet under both classifications.
lease liabilities are initially measured at the present value of lease payments not yet paid. the present value is determined by applying the readily determinable rate implicit in the lease or, if not available, the incremental borrowing rate of the lessee. we determine the incremental borrowing rate of the lessee on a lease-by-lease basis by developing an estimated centralized u.s. dollar borrowing rate for a fully collateralized obligation with a term similar to the lease term and adjust the rate to reflect the incremental risk associated with the currency in which the lease is denominated. the development of this estimate includes the use of recovery rates, u.s. risk-free rates, foreign currency/country base rate yields, and a synthetic corporate credit rating of the company developed using regression analysis. our lease agreements may include options to extend or terminate the lease. we include such options in the lease term when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise that option. rou assets are recognized based on the initial measurement of the lease liabilities plus initial direct costs less lease incentives. lease expense for operating leases is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. rou assets are subject to periodic impairment tests.
we have elected a practical expedient to account for lease and non-lease components together as a single lease component. in addition, we elected the short-term lease recognition exemption for all classes of lease assets.

revenues we continue to expand our presence across multiple geographies and verticals, both organically and through strategic acquisitions. during the year ended december 31, 2020, our total revenues grew 15.9% over the previous year to $2.7 billion. this growth resulted from our ability to retain existing customers and increase the level of services we provide to them and our ability to produce revenues from new customer relationships. during the year ended december 31, 2020 we experienced an increase in customer concentration as compared to the previous year, with revenues from our top five, top ten and top twenty customer groups increasing as a percentage of total revenues as we met higher demand from our larger customers. revenues have been positively impacted by our acquisitions in 2020, which contributed 0.3% to our revenue growth, and negatively impacted by the fluctuations in foreign currency which decreased our revenue growth by 0.1% during the year ended december 31, 2020 as compared to the previous year.
we discuss below the breakdown of our revenues by vertical, customer location, service arrangement type, and customer concentration.
revenues by vertical we assign our customers into one of our five main vertical markets or a group of various industries where we are increasing our presence, which we label as "emerging verticals", including energy, utilities, manufacturing, automotive, telecommunications and several others.

business information & media became our largest vertical during 2020, growing 33.2% as compared to 2019, largely driven by growth in one of our top 5 customers and the expansion of services to a customer which was previously in our top 50 customers and is now in our top 10 customers. financial services grew at a slower rate of 10.9% in 2020 over the prior year largely due to a change in certain customers' business models associated with low-cost trading platforms. travel & consumer also grew at a slower rate of 4.4% during 2020 as compared to the prior year primarily attributable to declining demand from certain customers adversely affected by the decline in global travel due to worldwide travel restrictions as a result of the covid-19 pandemic.
revenues by customer location our revenues are sourced from four geographic markets: north america, europe, cis and apac. we present and discuss our revenues by customer location based on the location of the specific customer site that we serve, irrespective of the location of the headquarters of the customer or the location of the delivery center where the work is performed. revenues by customer location is different from revenues by reportable segment in our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report. segments are not based on the geographic location of the customers, but instead they are based on the location of the company's management responsible for a particular customer or market.

during the year ended december 31, 2020, revenues in our largest geography, north america, were $1,595.1 million growing $205.1 million, or 14.8%, from $1,390.0 million reported for the year ended december 31, 2019. revenues from this geography accounted for 60.0% of total revenues in 2020, a decrease from 60.6% in the prior year. the united states continued to be our largest customer location contributing revenues of $1,523.7 million in 2020 compared to $1,321.7 million in 2019.
revenues in our europe geography were $879.8 million, an increase of $133.0 million, or 17.8%, over $746.9 million in the previous year. revenues in this geography accounted for 33.1% of consolidated revenues in 2020 as compared to 32.6% in the previous year. the top three revenue contributing customer location countries in europe were the united kingdom, switzerland and the netherlands generating revenues of $331.2 million, $203.4 million and $114.7 million in 2020, respectively, compared to $290.0 million, $152.7 million and $88.5 million in 2019, respectively. fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates with the u.s. dollar, particularly the euro and the british pound, during 2020 compared to the same period in the prior year positively impacted revenue growth in the european geography by 1.9%.
during 2020, revenues in the cis geography increased $14.2 million, or 14.2%, from the previous year. the increase in cis revenues came from customers in russia, contributing $14.9 million of revenue growth in 2020 compared to the previous year partially offset by decreases in revenues in other cis countries.
revenues from customers in locations in the apac region comprised 2.6% of total revenues in 2020, a level consistent with the prior year.
discussion of revenues from 2019 as compared to 2018 is included in "part ii. item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations - results of operations" of our annual report on form 10-k for the year ended december 31, 2019.
revenues by customer concentration we have long-standing relationships with many of our customers and we seek to grow revenues from our existing customers by continually expanding the scope and size of our engagements. revenues derived from these customers may fluctuate as these accounts mature or upon beginning or completion of multi-year projects. we believe there is a significant potential for future growth as we expand our capabilities and offerings within existing customers. in addition, we remain committed to diversifying our client base and adding more customers to our client mix; however, the covid-19 pandemic disrupted the economic landscape during 2020 and influenced business decisions of our existing and potential customers. we were able to capitalize on demand for our services at our larger customers whereas we realized less revenue growth from our smaller customers. however, over the long-term, we expect revenue concentration from our top customers to decrease.

cost of revenues (exclusive of depreciation and amortization)
the principal components of our cost of revenues (exclusive of depreciation and amortization) are salaries, bonuses, fringe benefits, stock-based compensation, project-related travel costs and fees for subcontractors who are assigned to customer projects. salaries and other compensation expenses of our delivery professionals are reported as cost of revenues regardless of whether the employees are actually performing customer services during a given period. our employees are a critical asset, necessary for our continued success and therefore we expect to continue hiring talented employees and providing them with competitive compensation programs.
we manage the utilization levels of our delivery professionals through strategic hiring and efficient staffing of projects. some of these professionals are hired and trained to work for specific customers or on specific projects and some of our offshore development centers are dedicated to specific customers or projects. our staff utilization also depends on the general economy and its effect on our customers and their business decisions regarding the use of our services.
during the year ended december 31, 2020, cost of revenues (exclusive of depreciation and amortization) was $1,732.5 million, representing an increase of 16.4% from $1,488.2 million reported last year. the increase was primarily due to an increase in compensation costs as a result of a 16.8% growth in the average number of production headcount for the year, partially offset by a lower level of accrued variable compensation in 2020 as compared to the previous year.
expressed as a percentage of revenues, cost of revenues (exclusive of depreciation and amortization) was 65.1% and 64.9% during the years ended december 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. the year-over-year increase is primarily due to declining profitability on certain accounts due to temporary discounts provided to certain customers experiencing challenging economic conditions due to the impact of the covid-19 pandemic, partially offset by a reduction in travel-related expenses due to the restrictions of travel attributable to the covid-19 pandemic.
discussion of cost of revenues (exclusive of depreciation and amortization) from 2019 as compared to 2018 is included in "part ii. item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations - results of operations" of our annual report on form 10-k for the year ended december 31, 2019.
selling, general and administrative expenses selling, general and administrative expenses represent expenses associated with promoting and selling our services and general and administrative functions of our business. these expenses include the costs of salaries, bonuses, fringe benefits, stock-based compensation, severance, bad debt, travel, legal and accounting services, insurance, facilities including operating leases, advertising and other promotional activities. in addition, we pay a membership fee of 1% of revenues generated in belarus to the administrative organization of the belarus high-technologies park.

our selling, general and administrative expenses have increased due to our continuously expanding operations, strategic business acquisitions, and the hiring of necessary personnel to support our growth. during the year ended december 31, 2020, selling, general and administrative expenses were $484.8 million, representing an increase of 6.0% as compared to $457.4 million reported last year. the increase in selling, general and administrative expenses in 2020 was primarily due to a $44.0 million increase in personnel-related costs, which include stock-based compensation expense, primarily driven by an increase in headcount and partially offset by a reduction in talent acquisition and development expenses and a $3.5 million decrease in costs for software licenses.
expressed as a percentage of revenues, selling, general and administrative expenses decreased 1.7% to 18.2% for the year ended december 31, 2020. the decrease was primarily attributable to a 0.7% decrease in travel and entertainment expenses as a percentage of revenues resulting from the worldwide restriction on travel due to covid-19, a 0.6% decrease in facility-related expenses as a percentage of revenues, reduced talent acquisition and development expenses attributable to reduced hiring efforts in the first half of the year in response to the covid-19 pandemic as well as reduced costs for software licenses partially offset by an increase in personnel-related costs including stock-based compensation expense.
discussion of selling, general and administrative expenses from 2019 as compared to 2018 is included in "part ii. item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations - results of operations" of our annual report on form 10-k for the year ended december 31, 2019.
depreciation and amortization expense during the year ended december 31, 2020, depreciation and amortization expense was $62.9 million, representing an increase of $17.6 million from $45.3 million reported last year. the increase in depreciation and amortization expense was primarily due to an increase in computer equipment to support headcount growth and the purchase of certain longer-term software licenses. depreciation and amortization expense includes amortization of acquired finite-lived intangible assets. expressed as a percentage of revenues, depreciation and amortization expense increased to 2.4% during the year ended december 31, 2020 as compared to 2.0% in 2019.

interest and other income, net interest and other income, net includes interest earned on cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments and employee housing loans, gains and losses from certain financial instruments, interest expense related to our revolving credit facility and changes in the fair value of contingent consideration. there were no material changes in interest and other income, net in 2020 as compared to 2019 and 2018.
provision for income taxes determining the consolidated provision for income tax expense, deferred income tax assets and liabilities and any potential related valuation allowances involves judgment. we consider factors that may contribute, favorably or unfavorably, to the overall annual effective tax rate in the current year as well as the future. these factors include statutory tax rates and tax law changes in the countries where we operate and excess tax benefits upon vesting or exercise of equity awards as well as consideration of any significant or unusual items.
as a global company, we are required to calculate and provide for income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate. during 2020, 2019 and 2018, we had $278.1 million, $234.2 million and $205.2 million, respectively, in income before provision for income taxes attributed to our foreign jurisdictions. changes in the geographic mix or level of annual pre-tax income can also affect our overall effective income tax rate.
our provision for income taxes also includes the impact of provisions established for uncertain income tax positions, as well as the related net interest and penalty expense. tax exposures can involve complex issues and may require an extended period to resolve. although we believe we have adequately reserved for our uncertain tax positions, we cannot provide assurance that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be different from our current estimates. we adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the closing of a tax audit, statute of limitation lapse or the refinement of an estimate. to the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters differs from the amounts recorded, such differences will impact the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made.

in belarus, member technology companies of high-technologies park, including our local subsidiary, have a full exemption from belarus income tax on qualifying income through january 2049. however, beginning february 1, 2018, the earnings of the company's belarus local subsidiary became subject to u.s. income taxation due to the company's decision to change the tax status of the subsidiary. consequently, there was less income tax benefit from the belarus tax exemption during 2018 compared to the previous year. there was no aggregate dollar benefit derived from this tax holiday for the years ended december 31, 2020, and 2019 and the aggregate dollar benefits derived from this tax holiday approximated $1.4 million for the year ended december 31, 2018. there was no impact on diluted net income per share for the years ended december 31, 2020 and 2019. the benefit the tax holiday had on diluted net income per share approximated $0.02 for the year ended december 31, 2018.
the provision for income taxes was $51.3 million in 2020 and $38.5 million in 2019. the increase was primarily driven by the increase in pre-tax income year over year partially offset by an increase in excess tax benefits recorded upon vesting or exercise of stock-based awards which were $36.6 million in 2020 compared to $28.4 million in 2019. the effective tax rate increased from 12.8% in 2019 to 13.6% in 2020 primarily due to mix in profitability in jurisdictions with different statutory tax rates and the tax treatment of certain acquisition-related costs.
discussion of the provision for income taxes from 2019 as compared to 2018 is included in "part ii. item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations - results of operations" of our annual report on form 10-k for the year ended december 31, 2019.

results by business segment our operations consist of three reportable segments: north america, europe, and russia. the segments represent components of epam for which separate financial information is available and used on a regular basis by our chief executive officer, who is also our chief operating decision maker ("codm"), to determine how to allocate resources and evaluate performance. our codm makes business decisions based on segment revenues and segment operating profits. segment operating profit is defined as income from operations before unallocated costs. expenses included in segment operating profit consist principally of direct selling and delivery costs as well as an allocation of certain shared services expenses. certain corporate expenses are not allocated to specific segments as these expenses are not controllable at the segment level. such expenses include certain types of professional fees, certain taxes included in operating expenses including the belarus high-technologies park membership fee, compensation to non-employee directors and certain other general and administrative expenses, including compensation of specific groups of non-production employees. in addition, the company does not allocate amortization of intangible assets acquired through business combinations, goodwill and other asset impairment charges, stock-based compensation expenses, acquisition-related costs and certain other one-time charges. these unallocated amounts are combined with total segment operating profit to arrive at consolidated income from operations.
we manage our business primarily based on the managerial responsibility for the client base and market. as managerial responsibility for a particular customer relationship generally correlates with the customer's geographic location, there is a high degree of similarity between customer locations and the geographic boundaries of our reportable segments. in some cases, managerial responsibility for a particular customer is assigned to a management team in another region and is usually based on the strength of the relationship between customer executives and particular members of epam's senior management team. in such cases, the customer's activity would be reported through the respective management team member's reportable segment. our europe segment includes our business in the apac region, which is managed by the same management team.

software & hi-tech remained the largest industry vertical in the north america segment during the year ended december 31, 2020, growing 18.6% as compared to the prior year, which was a result of the continued focus on working with our technology customers. revenues from the business information & media vertical grew 27.3% during the year ended december 31, 2020, as compared to the prior year and largely benefited from expansion of services to a single customer which was previously one of our top 50 customers and is now one of our top 10 customers. financial services grew at a slower rate of 8.2% in 2020 compared to the prior year primarily due to a change in certain customers' business models associated with low-cost trading platforms. emerging verticals experienced slower growth during 2020 compared to the prior year largely due to slower growth from energy customers in the u.s. who were adversely impacted by deteriorating economic conditions.

europe segment during 2020, europe segment revenues were $947.3 million, reflecting an increase of $126.6 million, or 15.4%, from last year. revenues were positively impacted by changes in foreign currency exchange rates during 2020. had our europe segment revenues been expressed in constant currency terms using the exchange rates in effect during 2019, we would have reported revenue growth of 13.6%. revenues from our europe segment represent 35.6% and 35.8% of total segment revenues during 2020 and 2019, respectively. during 2020, this segment's operating profits increased $38.0 million, or 33.1% as compared to last year, to $152.9 million. europe's operating profit represented 16.1% of europe segment revenues as compared to 14.0% in 2019. segment operating profit was positively impacted by changes in foreign currency exchange rates during 2020 and reduced selling, general and administrative expenses partially offset by temporary discounts provided to certain customers experiencing challenging economic conditions due to the impact of the covid-19 pandemic.

the europe segment benefited from strong growth in the business information & media vertical of 42.5% for the year ended december 31, 2020 as compared to 2019, largely driven by growth in revenues from one of our top five customers. financial services remained the largest industry vertical in the europe segment during the year ended december 31, 2020. revenues in travel & consumer decreased during the year ended december 31, 2020 as compared to 2019 primarily due to declining demand from certain customers adversely impacted by the decline in global travel due to worldwide travel restrictions as a result of the covid-19 pandemic. revenues in software & hi-tech also decreased during the year ended december 31, 2020 as compared to 2019 primarily due to a change in the estimate of variable consideration associated with a single customer.
russia segment during 2020, revenues from our russia segment increased $18.2 million relative to 2019 and represent 4.2% of total segment revenues during 2020 compared with 4.0% in 2019. operating profits of our russia segment decreased $11.5 million as compared to 2019. expressed as a percentage of russia segment revenues, the segment's operating profits were 5.3% and 18.8% in 2020 and 2019, respectively. this decrease is primarily attributable to costs incurred without recognizing corresponding revenues due to the delays in the timing of execution of contracts during 2020.

revenues in the russia segment are generally subject to fluctuations and there have been no significant changes in the individual verticals during 2020 as compared to 2019. russia segment revenues were mainly impacted by the timing of revenue recognition associated with the execution of contracts and the devaluation of the russian ruble relative to the u.s. dollar. had our russia segment revenues been expressed in constant currency terms using the exchange rates in effect during 2019, we would have reported revenue growth of 36.1%.
currency fluctuations of the russian ruble typically impact the results in the russia segment. ongoing economic and geopolitical uncertainty in the region and the volatility of the russian ruble can significantly impact reported revenues and profitability in this segment. we continue to monitor geopolitical forces, economic and trade sanctions, and other issues involving this region.
discussion of segment results from 2019 as compared to 2018 is included in "part ii. item 7. results of operations" of our annual report on form 10-k for the year ended december 31, 2019.
effects of inflation economies in some countries where we operate, particularly belarus, russia, kazakhstan, uzbekistan, ukraine and india have periodically experienced high rates of inflation. periods of higher inflation may affect various economic sectors in those countries and increase our cost of doing business there. inflation may increase some of our expenses such as wages. while inflation may impact our results of operations and financial condition and it is difficult to accurately measure the impact of inflation, we believe the effects of inflation on our results of operations and financial condition are not significant.
liquidity and capital resources capital resources our cash generated from operations has been our primary source of liquidity to fund operations and investments to support the growth of our business. as of december 31, 2020, our principal sources of liquidity were cash and cash equivalents totaling $1,322.1 million, short-term investments of $60.0 million as well as $275.0 million of available borrowings under our revolving credit facility.
we have cash in banks in belarus, russia, ukraine, kazakhstan, armenia, georgia and uzbekistan, where the banking sector remains subject to periodic instability, banking and other financial systems generally do not meet the banking standards of more developed markets, and bank deposits made by corporate entities are not insured. as of december 31, 2020, the total amount of cash held in these countries was $146.2 million and of this amount, $52.9 million was located in belarus. the company regularly monitors cash held in these countries and, to the extent the cash held exceeds amounts required to support our operations in these countries, the company distributes the excess funds into markets with more developed banking sectors.
as of december 31, 2020, we had $275.0 million available for borrowing under our revolving credit facility and had outstanding debt of $25.0 million. as of december 31, 2020, we were in compliance with all covenants specified under the credit facility and anticipate being in compliance for the foreseeable future. see note 9 "long-term debt" in the notes to our consolidated financial statements in this annual report on form 10-k for information regarding our long-term debt.
our ability to expand and grow our business in accordance with current plans and to meet our long-term capital requirements will depend on many factors, including the rate at which our cash flows increase or decrease and the availability of public and private debt and equity financing. we may require additional cash resources due to changed business conditions or other future developments, including any investments or acquisitions we may decide to pursue. if our resources are insufficient to satisfy our cash requirements, we may seek to sell additional equity or debt securities or obtain another credit facility.
based on currently available information and management's current expectations, we anticipate that we have sufficient cash on hand and sufficient access to capital to continue to fund our operations for a significant period of time. however, covid-19 and related measures to contain its impact have caused material disruptions in both national and global financial markets and economies. the future impact of covid-19 and the covid-19 containment measures cannot be predicted with certainty and may increase our borrowing costs and other costs of capital and otherwise adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.

operating activities net cash provided by operating activities during the year ended december 31, 2020 increased $257.0 million, or 89.4%, to $544.4 million, as compared to 2019 primarily driven by the increase in net income and a larger improvement in days sales outstanding during 2020 compared to 2019 which resulted in higher cash collections during 2020 as compared to 2019.
investing activities net cash used in investing activities during the year ended december 31, 2020 was $167.2 million compared to $145.4 million used in the same period in 2019. the increase was primarily attributable to $60.0 million of net cash invested into time deposits classified as short-term investments partially offset by a decrease in capital expenditures of $30.5 million.
financing activities during the year ended december 31, 2020, net cash used in financing activities was $0.8 million, compared to $20.4 million net cash provided by financing activities in 2019. during 2020, we received $10.6 million less cash from exercises of stock options issued under our long-term incentive plans, we paid $5.9 million more in contingent consideration related to acquisitions of businesses and we paid $4.6 million more of withholding taxes related to net share settlements of restricted stock units compared to 2019.
discussion of the comparison of the cash flows between 2019 and 2018 is included in "part ii. item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations - liquidity and capital resources" of our annual report on form 10-k for the year ended december 31, 2019.

(3)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            we estimate our future obligations for long-term incentive plan payouts by assuming the closing price per share of our common stock at december 31, 2020 remains constant into the future. this is an estimate as actual prices will vary over time.
(4)       our future obligations related to the 2017 credit facility consist of principal, interest and fees for the unused balance. we assume the floating interest rate in effect at december 31, 2020 will remain constant into the future. this is an estimate, as actual rates will vary over time. in addition, for the 2017 credit facility, we assume that the balance outstanding and the unused balance as of december 31, 2020 remain the same through the remaining term of the agreement. the actual respective balances under our 2017 credit facility may fluctuate significantly in future periods depending on the business decisions of management.
(5)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         as of december 31, 2020, we have entered into agreements to purchase office space in ukraine intended to support the global delivery centers in that country. see note 15 "commitments and contingencies" in the notes to our consolidated financial statements in this annual report on form 10-k. in addition, we have incurred obligations to acquire other fixed assets which have not yet been paid.
as of december 31, 2020 we had $3.3 million of unrecognized tax benefits for which we are unable to make a reliable estimate of the eventual cash flows by period that may be required to settle these matters. in addition, we had recorded $7.5 million of contingent consideration liabilities as of december 31, 2020 related to the acquisitions of businesses that are not included in the table above due to the uncertainty involved with the potential payments.
see note 15 "commitments and contingencies" in the notes to our consolidated financial statements in this annual report on form 10-k for the year ended december 31, 2020 for information regarding contractual obligations.
future capital requirements we believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents combined with our expected cash flow from operations will be sufficient to meet our projected operating and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next twelve months and that we possess the financial flexibility to execute our strategic objectives, including the ability to make acquisitions and strategic investments in the foreseeable future. however, our ability to generate cash is subject to our performance, general economic conditions, industry trends and other factors including the impact of the covid-19 pandemic as described elsewhere in this md&a. to the extent that existing cash and cash equivalents and operating cash flow are insufficient to fund our future activities and requirements, we may need to raise additional funds through public or private equity or debt financing. if we issue equity securities in order to raise additional funds, substantial dilution to existing stockholders may occur. if we raise cash through the issuance of additional indebtedness, we may be subject to additional contractual restrictions on our business. there is no assurance that we would be able to raise additional funds on favorable terms or at all.
off-balance sheet commitments and arrangements we do not have any material obligations under guarantee contracts or other contractual arrangements other than as disclosed in note 15 "commitments and contingencies" in the notes to our consolidated financial statements in this annual report on form 10-k. we have not entered into any transactions with unconsolidated entities where we have financial guarantees, subordinated retained interests, derivative instruments, or other contingent arrangements that expose us to material continuing risks, contingent liabilities, or any other obligation under a variable interest in an unconsolidated entity that provides financing, liquidity, market risk, or credit risk support to us, or engages in leasing, hedging, or research and development services with us.

item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview the objectives of our management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations ("md&a") are to provide users of our consolidated financial statements with the following:
•a narrative explanation from the perspective of management of our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, liquidity and certain other factors that may affect future results;
•context to the financial statements; and
•information that allows assessment of the likelihood that past performance is indicative of future performance.
our md&a is performed on a consolidated basis and is inclusive of the results and operations of sprint prospectively from the close of our merger on april 1, 2020. the merger enhanced our spectrum portfolio, increased our customer base, altered our product mix by increasing the portion of customers who finance their devices with leasing programs and created opportunity for synergies in our operations. we anticipate an initial increase in our combined operating costs which we expect to decrease as we realize synergies. we expect the trends and results of operations of the combined company to be materially different than those of the standalone entities.
our md&a is provided as a supplement to, and should be read together with, our audited consolidated financial statements as of december 31, 2020 and 2019, and for each of the three years in the period ended december 31, 2020, included in part ii, item 8 of this form 10-k. except as expressly stated, the financial condition and results of operations discussed throughout our md&a are those of t-mobile us, inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries.
beginning with the second quarter of 2020, we have discontinued the use of "branded" to describe the results and metrics associated with our flagship brands including t-mobile and metro by t-mobile.
sprint merger transaction overview on april 1, 2020, we completed our merger with sprint, a communications company offering a comprehensive range of wireless and wireline communications products and services. as a result, sprint and its subsidiaries became wholly owned consolidated subsidiaries of t-mobile.
the merger has altered the size and scope of our operations, impacting our assets, liabilities, obligations, capital requirements and performance measures. we expect the trends and results of operations of the combined company to be materially different than those of the standalone entities. as a combined company, we expect to be able to enhance the breadth and depth of our nationwide 5g network, accelerate innovation, increase competition in the u.s. wireless, video and broadband industries and achieve significant synergies and cost reductions by eliminating redundancies within the combined network as well as other business processes and operations.
for more information regarding the merger, see note 2 - business combination of the notes to the consolidated financial statements.
on june 22, 2020, we entered into a master framework agreement and related transactions with softbank to facilitate the softbank monetization as described in note 14 - softbank equity transaction of the notes to the consolidated financial statements.
table of contents brand and retail unification on august 2, 2020, we combined the sprint and t-mobile operations under the t-mobile brand nationwide. we combined our retail operations and rebranded thousands of sprint stores to t-mobile stores while implementing the tools and systems across our distribution footprint to serve all customers in all stores.
sale of boost mobile and sprint prepaid brands in connection with obtaining regulatory approval for the merger, on july 1, 2020, dish acquired the prepaid wireless business operated under the boost mobile and sprint prepaid brands (excluding the assurance brand lifeline customers and the prepaid wireless customers of shentel and swiftel communications, inc.), including customer accounts, inventory, contracts, intellectual property and certain other specified assets (the "prepaid business"), and assumed certain related liabilities (the "prepaid transaction"). for more information, see note 12 - discontinued operations of the notes to the consolidated financial statements.
upon the closing of the prepaid transaction, we entered into a master network services agreement (the "mvno agreement") providing for the provisioning of network services to customers of the prepaid business for a period of up to seven years following the closing of the prepaid transaction. the revenue generated through this agreement is presented within wholesale revenues in our consolidated statements of comprehensive income following the close of the prepaid transaction on july 1, 2020.
we included the pre-tax results of our discontinued operations in our determination of adjusted ebitda, a non-gaap measure, to reflect contributions of the prepaid business that was replaced by the mvno agreement beginning on july 1, 2020. see "adjusted ebitda" in the "performance measures" section of this md&a.
merger-related costs merger-related costs generally include:
•integration costs to achieve efficiencies in network, retail, information technology and back office operations;
•restructuring costs, including severance, store rationalization and network decommissioning; and
•transaction costs, including legal and professional services related to the completion of the merger.
transaction and restructuring costs are disclosed in note 2 - business combination and note 19 - restructuring costs, respectively. merger-related costs have been excluded from our calculation of adjusted ebitda, a non-gaap financial measure, as we do not consider these costs to be reflective of our ongoing operating performance. see "adjusted ebitda" in the "performance measures" section of this md&a. cash payments for merger-related costs, including payments related to our restructuring plan, are included in net cash provided by operating activities in our consolidated statements of cash flows.
merger-related costs during the years ended december 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 are presented below:

nm - not meaningful merger-related costs will be impacted by restructuring and integration activities expected to occur over the next three years as we implement initiatives to realize cost efficiencies from the merger. transaction costs, including legal and professional service fees related to the completion of the merger, are expected to decrease in periods subsequent to the close of the merger.
table of contents restructuring upon the close of the merger, we began implementing restructuring initiatives to realize cost efficiencies from the merger. the major activities associated with the restructuring initiatives to date include:
•contract termination costs associated with rationalization of retail stores, distribution channels, duplicative network and backhaul services and other agreements;
•severance costs associated with the reduction of redundant processes and functions; and
•the decommissioning of certain small cell sites and distributed antenna systems to achieve synergies in network costs.
anticipated impacts our restructuring activities are expected to occur over the next three years with substantially all costs incurred by the end of fiscal year 2023. we are evaluating additional restructuring initiatives which are dependent on consultations and negotiation with certain counterparties and the expected impact on our business operations, which could affect the amount or timing of the restructuring costs and related payments. we expect our principal sources of funding to be sufficient to meet our liquidity requirements and anticipated payments associated with the restructuring initiatives.
as a result of our ongoing restructuring activities, we expect to realize cost efficiencies by eliminating redundancies within our combined network as well as other business processes and operations. we expect these activities to result in a reduction of expenses within cost of services and selling, general and administrative in our consolidated statements of comprehensive income.
covid-19 pandemic the covid-19 pandemic has resulted in a widespread health crisis that has adversely affected businesses, economies, and financial markets worldwide, and has caused significant volatility in the u.s. and international debt and equity markets. the impact of the pandemic has been wide-ranging, including, but not limited to, the temporary closures of many businesses and schools, "shelter in place" orders, travel restrictions, social distancing guidelines and other governmental, business and individual actions taken in response to the pandemic. these restrictions have impacted, and will continue to impact, our business, including the demand for our products and services and the ways in which our customers purchase and use them. in addition, the pandemic has resulted in economic uncertainty and a significant increase in unemployment in the united states, which could affect our customers' purchasing decisions and ability to make timely payments. throughout the year, the pandemic has peaked, subsided and seen a resurgence, leading to phased re-openings, as well as continuing or renewed containment measures.
as a critical communications infrastructure provider as designated by the government, our focus has been on providing crucial connectivity to our customers and impacted communities while ensuring the safety and well-being of our employees.
our response we have taken a variety of steps to help mitigate the impact of the pandemic on our customers and to protect the health and well-being of our workforce and communities:
to protect and support our employees and communities
•before the merger, in mid-march, approximately 80% of t-mobile and 70% of sprint company-owned store locations, as well as many third-party retailer locations that sell our t-mobile, metro by t-mobile and sprint brands were temporarily closed. in compliance with the regulations of various states, we have since reopened substantially all of our previously closed stores.
•at the onset of the pandemic, we supplemented pay for certain of our employees and commissions for third-party dealers and provided access to incremental paid time off for employees experiencing symptoms, taking care of children who were home due to school closures or caring for individuals impacted by the pandemic.

•we implemented remote working arrangements for many employees with a significant portion of our internal and global care employees transitioned to a work-from-home environment. we also encouraged our corporate and administrative employees to work remotely, if possible.
•we also continue to encourage healthy practices such as social distancing and hand washing and have increased cleaning and sanitation in all our facilities and stores.
to keep our customers connected
•in march, we committed to the fcc's keep americans connected pledge, and at the fcc's request, later extended our commitment to june 30, 2020. during this period, we pledged to:
•not terminate service to any residential or small business customers because of their inability to pay their bills due to disruptions caused by the pandemic; and
•waive any late fees that any residential or small business customers incurred because of their economic circumstances related to the pandemic.
•after the pledge extension ended, we continued to work with our customers to help them maintain service and become current on their accounts, while avoiding financial hardship.
•we also took additional temporary steps in march to ensure that all current t-mobile customers with smartphone data plans were provided connectivity to learn and work remotely through june 30, 2020, including:
•providing unlimited high-speed smartphone data to current customers as of march 13, 2020 who had legacy plans without unlimited high-speed data (excluding roaming);
•giving t-mobile postpaid and metro by t-mobile customers on smartphone plans with mobile hotspot data the ability to add 10gb of smartphone mobile hotspot each month (20gb total);
•working with our lifeline partners to provide customers up to 5gb per month of free data;
•increasing the data allowance, at no extra charge, to schools and students using our empowered digital learning program to ensure each participant had access to at least 20gb of data per month; and
•providing free international calling to landlines (and, in many cases, mobile numbers) to countries that were significantly impacted by the pandemic through may 13, 2020.
•in addition:
•we are offering our customers creative, new covid-safe solutions such as virtual selling and curbside pickup;
•we partnered with multiple spectrum holders and the fcc to successfully deploy additional 600 mhz spectrum on a temporary basis (through june 30, 2020), effectively doubling total 600 mhz lte capacity across the nation to help ensure customers can stay connected during this critical time; and
•we are working to keep our network fully operational as an essential service to first responders, 911 communications and our customers and continue to expand our 5g network, while adhering to governmental guidelines.
we continue to monitor the pandemic and its impacts and may adjust our actions as needed to continue to provide our products and services to our communities and employees.
impact on results of operations and performance measures for the year ended december 31, 2020
for the year ended december 31, 2020, we incurred $458 million, before taxes, in supplemental employee payroll, third-party commissions and cleaning-related covid-19 costs, which are included in selling, general and administrative expenses in our consolidated statements of comprehensive income. these costs have been excluded from the calculation of adjusted ebitda, a non-gaap financial measure, as they represent direct, incremental costs as a result of our response to the pandemic. see "adjusted ebitda" in the "performance measures" section of this md&a.
expected continued impact on results of operations and performance measures we continue to monitor developments regarding the pandemic and evaluate the appropriate steps needed to align with guidelines from state, local and federal government agencies and do what is best for our employees and customers. the extent to which the pandemic impacts our business, operations and financial results will depend on numerous future developments that we are not able to predict at this time, including the duration and scope of the pandemic, the success of governmental, business table of contents and individual actions that have been and continue to be taken in response to the pandemic, and the impact on economic activity from the pandemic and actions taken in response. such impacts may include:
•lower net customer additions due to lower switching activity in the industry from reduced store traffic due to temporary retail store closures and reduced consumer spending caused by widespread unemployment and other adverse economic effects, partially offset by lower churn;
•lower equipment revenues and lower cost of equipment sales from lower device sales due to lower switching activity in the industry from reduced store traffic due to temporary retail store closures, which may impact our ability to sell devices;
•higher bad debt expense on our service and eip receivable portfolios due to adverse macro-economic conditions. should these adverse conditions worsen, our operating and financial results could be negatively impacted;
•continued costs to protect and support our employees and customers; and
•potential disruptions in our supply chains.
in addition, we have reevaluated, and continue to assess, our spending, including for marketing purposes like advertising, capital projects like build-out of our stores, travel, third-party services and certain operating expenses. we have taken actions to adjust our spending given the significant uncertainty around the magnitude and duration of any recessionary impacts arising from the pandemic.
for additional risks to our business and industry, see item 1a. risk factors.

total revenues increased $23.4 billion, or 52%. the components of this change are discussed below.
postpaid revenues increased $13.6 billion, or 60%, primarily from:
•higher average postpaid phone customers, primarily from customers acquired in the merger and the success of new customer segments and rate plans, as well as continued growth in existing and new markets;
•higher average postpaid other customers, primarily from customers acquired in the merger and growth in other connected devices (tablets and wearable products) and growth in public and educational sector customers; and
•higher postpaid phone arpu, primarily as a result of customers acquired in the merger. see "postpaid phone arpu" in the "performance measures" section of this md&a.
prepaid revenues were essentially flat.
wholesale revenues increased $1.3 billion, or 103%, primarily from:
•our master network service agreement with dish, which went into effect on july 1, 2020; and
•customers acquired in the merger.
roaming and other service revenues increased $1.1 billion, or 107%, primarily from:
•inclusion of wireline operations acquired in the merger; and
•higher lifeline, advertising and affiliate revenues primarily due to operations acquired in the merger; partially offset by
•lower international roaming due to the impact of the pandemic, and lower domestic roaming due to revenue generated from sprint customers roaming on the t-mobile network in periods before the merger.
equipment revenues increased $7.5 billion, or 76%, primarily from:
•an increase of $3.6 billion in lease revenues due to a higher number of customer devices under lease, primarily from leases acquired in the merger;
•an increase of $2.5 billion in device sales revenue, excluding purchased leased devices, primarily from:
•an increase in the number of devices sold, excluding purchased leased devices, due to an increase in our customer base primarily due to the merger; and
•higher average revenue per device sold, excluding purchased leased devices, due to an increase in the high-end device mix due to the merger;
•an increase of $625 million in sales of leased devices, primarily due to an increase in purchased leased devices as a result of the merger; and
•an increase of $622 million in revenues primarily related to the liquidation of a higher volume of returned devices primarily as a result of the merger.
operating expenses increased $22.5 billion, or 57%. the components of this change are discussed below.
cost of services, exclusive of depreciation and amortization, increased $5.3 billion, or 79%, primarily from:
•an increase in expenses associated with leases, backhaul agreements and other network expenses, such as roaming, table of contents acquired in the merger and the continued build-out of our nationwide 5g network;
•an increase of $646 million for the year ended december 31, 2020, in merger-related costs including incremental costs associated with accelerating amortization of right-of-use assets for terminated cell sites leases and the decommissioning of certain small cell sites and distributed antenna systems;
•higher employee-related and benefit-related costs primarily due to increased headcount as a result of the merger;
•an increase in repair and maintenance costs, primarily due to the merger; and
•an increase in regulatory and roaming costs primarily due to the merger.
cost of equipment sales, exclusive of depreciation and amortization, increased $4.5 billion, or 38%, primarily from:
•an increase of $2.8 billion in device cost of equipment sales, excluding purchased leased devices, primarily from:
•an increase in the number of devices sold, excluding purchased leased devices, due to an increase in our customer base primarily due to the merger; and
•higher average costs per device sold, excluding purchased leased devices, due to an increase in the high-end device mix due to the merger;
•an increase of $759 million in leased device cost of equipment sales, primarily due to an increase in purchased leased devices as a result of the merger; and
•an increase of $511 million in costs related to the liquidation of a higher volume of returned devices primarily as a result of the merger.
selling, general and administrative expenses increased $4.8 billion, or 34%, primarily from:

•higher external labor and professional services, lease and advertising expense from the merger;
•$1.3 billion of merger-related costs, including transaction costs associated with legal and professional services and restructuring costs including severance and store rationalization, compared to $620 million of merger-related costs in the year ended december 31, 2019;
•higher commission expense, primarily due to:
•higher gross customer additions primarily due to the increased size of the company as a result of the merger, partially offset by lower switching activity in the industry from reduced store traffic due to retail store closures arising from the pandemic; partially offset by
•lower commissions expense due to lower prepaid gross additions and compensation structure changes;
•higher bad debt expense, primarily due to customers acquired as a result of the merger and the recording of estimated losses associated with the new credit loss standard, including incremental bad debt for the estimated macro-economic impacts of the pandemic; and
•higher legal-related expenses from recording an estimated accrual associated with the fcc notice of apparent liability and commitments associated with the merger.
•selling, general and administrative expenses for the year ended december 31, 2020 included $458 million of supplemental employee payroll, third-party commissions and cleaning-related covid-19 costs.

guarantor financial information on march 2, 2020, the sec adopted amendments to the financial disclosure requirements for guarantors and issuers of guaranteed securities, as well for affiliates whose securities collateralize a registrant's securities. we early adopted the requirements of the amendments on january 1, 2020, which included replacing guarantor condensed consolidating financial information with summarized financial information for the consolidated obligor group (parent, issuer, and guarantor subsidiaries) and no longer requiring guarantor cash flow information, financial information for non-guarantor subsidiaries, or a reconciliation to the consolidated results.
on april 1, 2020, in connection with the closing of the merger, we assumed certain registered debt to third parties issued by sprint, sprint communications, inc. and sprint capital corporation (collectively, the "sprint issuers"). amounts previously disclosed for the estimated values of certain acquired assets and liabilities assumed have been adjusted based on additional information arising subsequent to the initial valuation. these revisions to the estimated values did not have a significant impact on our summarized financial information for the consolidated obligor group.
pursuant to the applicable indentures and supplemental indentures, the long-term debt to affiliates and third parties issued by t-mobile usa, inc. and the sprint issuers (collectively, the "issuers") is fully and unconditionally guaranteed, jointly and severally, on a senior unsecured basis by t-mobile ("parent") and certain of parent's 100% owned subsidiaries ("guarantor subsidiaries").
the guarantees of the guarantor subsidiaries are subject to release in limited circumstances only upon the occurrence of certain customary conditions. the indentures, supplemental indentures and credit agreements governing the long-term debt contain covenants that, among other things, limit the ability of the issuers or borrowers and the guarantor subsidiaries to incur more debt, pay dividends and make distributions, make certain investments, repurchase stock, create liens or other encumbrances, enter into transactions with affiliates, enter into transactions that restrict dividends or distributions from subsidiaries, and merge, consolidate or sell, or otherwise dispose of, substantially all of their assets. certain provisions of each of the credit agreements, indentures and supplemental indentures relating to the long-term debt restrict the ability of the issuers or borrowers to loan funds or make payments to parent. however, the issuers or borrowers and guarantor subsidiaries are allowed to make certain permitted payments to parent under the terms of the indentures, supplemental indentures and credit agreements.
in december 2019, the fasb issued asu 2019-12, "income taxes (topic 740): simplifying the accounting for income taxes." the standard simplifies the accounting for income taxes by removing certain exceptions to the general principles in topic 740. we early adopted the standard on january 1, 2020 and have applied the standard retrospectively to all periods presented. upon the adoption of the standard, deferred tax assets of non-guarantor entities in aggregate of $163 million were reclassified and netted with the deferred tax liabilities of the guarantor obligor group of the debt issued by t-mobile usa, inc. the adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements for the year ended december 31, 2020.
in march 2020, certain guarantor subsidiaries became non-guarantor subsidiaries. certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current period's presentation.
in connection with the preparation of our guarantor financial information for the year ended december 31, 2020, we determined that the summarized balance sheet information and summarized results of operations for the consolidated obligor group of debt issued by t-mobile usa, inc., as presented in our quarterly reports on form 10-q for the quarterly periods ended march 31, 2020, june 30, 2020, and september 30, 2020, should be adjusted to exclude investments in non-guarantor subsidiaries and the related equity method income from non-guarantor subsidiaries as of and for the year-to-date periods ending december 31, 2019, march 31, 2020, june 30, 2020 and september 30, 2020. we also determined the summarized balance sheet information table of contents and summarized results of operations for the consolidated obligor groups of debt issued by sprint, sprint communications, inc. and sprint capital corporation, as presented in our quarterly reports on form 10-q for the quarterly periods ended june 30, 2020, and september 30, 2020, should be adjusted as well to exclude investments in their respective non-guarantor subsidiaries for the year-to-date periods ending june 30, 2020 and september 30, 2020. therefore, we have updated the historical summarized financial information for these periods and obligor groups as set forth below. this adjustment does not impact the consolidated financial statements for any quarterly or annual periods and does not impact guarantor financial information filed prior to our adoption of the new disclosure requirements for guarantors and issuers of guaranteed securities on january 1, 2020.
basis of presentation the following tables include summarized financial information of the obligor groups of debt issued by t-mobile usa, inc., sprint, sprint communications, inc., and sprint capital corporation. the summarized financial information of each obligor group is presented on a combined basis with balances and transactions within the obligor group eliminated. investments in and the equity in earnings of non-guarantor subsidiaries which would otherwise be consolidated in accordance with u.s. gaap are excluded from the below summarized financial information pursuant to sec regulation s-x rule 13-01.

(2) on july 18, 2019, we entered into an agreement whereby certain t-mobile prepaid products will now be offered and distributed by a current mvno partner. as a result, we included a base adjustment in the third quarter of 2019 to reduce prepaid customers by 616,000.
total customers increased 34,170,000, or 50%, primarily from:
•higher postpaid phone customers, primarily due to customers acquired in the merger and the success of new customer segments and rate plans and continued growth in existing and new markets, along with promotional activities; and
•higher postpaid other customers, primarily due to customers acquired in the merger and growth in other connected devices primarily related to public and educational sector customers and wearable products; partially offset by
•lower prepaid customers, primarily due to the customer base adjustments made to align the customer reporting policies of t-mobile and sprint, partially offset by the continued success of our prepaid business due to promotional activities and rate plan offers.

(1) in connection with the closing of the merger, we refined our definition of wholesale customers resulting in the reclassification of certain postpaid and prepaid reseller customers to wholesale customers. starting with the three months ended march 31, 2020, we discontinued reporting wholesale customers to focus on postpaid and prepaid customers and wholesale revenues, which we consider more relevant than the number of wholesale customers given the expansion of m2m and iot products.
(2) prepaid customers with a device installment billing plan historically included as sprint postpaid customers have been reclassified to prepaid customers to align with t-mobile policy.
(3) customers associated with the sprint wireless prepaid and boost mobile brands that were divested on july 1, 2020, have been excluded from our reported customers.
(4) customers who have rate plans with monthly recurring charges which are considered insignificant have been excluded from our reported customers.

(5) customers with postpaid phone rate plans without a phone (e.g., non-phone devices) have been reclassified from postpaid phone to postpaid other customers to align with t-mobile policy.
(6) certain sprint customers subject to collection activity for an extended period of time have been excluded from our reported customers to align with t-mobile policy.

total net customer additions increased 777,000, or 16%, primarily from:
•higher postpaid other net customer additions, primarily due to higher gross additions from connected devices, primarily due to public and educational sector additions and lower churn, partially offset by lower switching activity in the industry from reduced store traffic due to retail store closures arising from the pandemic; partially offset by
•lower postpaid phone net customer additions, primarily due to higher churn from customers acquired in the merger and lower switching activity in the industry from reduced store traffic due to retail store closures arising from the pandemic; and
•lower prepaid gross customer additions, partially offset by lower churn, both primarily due to lower switching activity in the industry from reduced store traffic due to retail store closures arising from the pandemic.
churn churn represents the number of customers whose service was disconnected as a percentage of the average number of customers during the specified period. the number of customers whose service was disconnected is presented net of customers that subsequently have their service restored within a certain period of time. we believe that churn provides management, investors and analysts with useful information to evaluate customer retention and loyalty.

(1) in connection with the closing of the merger, we refined our definition of wholesale accounts resulting in the reclassification of certain postpaid and prepaid reseller accounts to wholesale accounts.
(2) prepaid accounts with a customer with a device installment billing plan historically included as sprint postpaid accounts have been reclassified to prepaid accounts to align with t-mobile policy.
(3) accounts with customers who have rate plans with monthly recurring charges which are considered insignificant have been excluded from our reported accounts.
(4) certain sprint accounts subject to collection activity for an extended period of time have been excluded from our reported accounts to align with t-mobile policy.
(5) miscellaneous insignificant adjustments to align with t-mobile policy.
average revenue per user arpu represents the average monthly service revenue earned from customers. we believe arpu provides management, investors and analysts with useful information to assess and evaluate our service revenue per customer and assist in forecasting our future service revenues generated from our customer base. postpaid phone arpu excludes postpaid other customers and related revenues, which include wearables, digits and other connected devices such as tablets and syncup products.

postpaid phone arpu postpaid phone arpu increased $1.70, or 4%, primarily due to:
•the net impact of customers acquired in the merger, which have higher arpu (net of changes arising from the reduction in base due to policy adjustments and reclassification of certain arpu components from the acquired customers being moved to other revenue lines); and
•higher premium service revenues; partially offset by
•an increase in our promotional activities.
prepaid arpu prepaid arpu was essentially flat and was primarily impacted by:
•the impacts of certain adjustments to our customer base, including the removal of certain prepaid customers associated with products now offered and distributed by a current mvno partner as those customers had lower arpu; offset by
•dilution from promotional rate plans; and
•a reduction in certain non-recurring charges.
average revenue per account average revenue per account ("arpa") represents the average monthly postpaid service revenue earned per account. we believe postpaid arpa provides management, investors and analysts with useful information to assess and evaluate our postpaid service revenue realization and assist in forecasting our future postpaid service revenues on a per account basis. we consider postpaid arpa to be indicative of our revenue growth potential given the increase in the average number of postpaid phone customers per account and increases in postpaid other customers, including wearables, digits or other connected devices, which include tablets and syncup products.

adjusted ebitda adjusted ebitda represents earnings before interest expense, net of interest income, income tax expense, depreciation and amortization, non-cash stock-based compensation and certain income and expenses not reflective of our ongoing operating performance. net income margin represents net income divided by service revenues. adjusted ebitda margin represents adjusted ebitda divided by service revenues.
adjusted ebitda is a non-gaap financial measure utilized by our management to monitor the financial performance of our operations. we use adjusted ebitda internally as a measure to evaluate and compensate our personnel and management for their performance, and as a benchmark to evaluate our operating performance in comparison to our competitors. management believes analysts and investors use adjusted ebitda as a supplemental measure to evaluate overall operating performance and facilitate comparisons with other wireless communications services companies because it is indicative of our ongoing operating performance and trends by excluding the impact of interest expense from financing, non-cash depreciation and amortization from capital investments, non-cash stock-based compensation, merger-related costs including network decommissioning costs, incremental costs directly attributable to covid-19 and impairment expense, as they are not indicative of our ongoing operating performance, as well as certain other nonrecurring income and expenses. adjusted ebitda has limitations as an analytical tool and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for income from operations, net income or any other measure of financial performance reported in accordance with u.s. generally accepted accounting principles ("gaap").

(1)following the prepaid transaction, starting on july 1, 2020, we provide mvno services to dish. we have included the operating income from discontinued operations from april 1, 2020 through june 30, 2020, in our determination of adjusted ebitda to reflect contributions of the prepaid business that were replaced by the mvno agreement beginning on july 1, 2020 in order to enable management, analysts and investors to better assess ongoing operating performance and trends.
(2)stock-based compensation includes payroll tax impacts and may not agree to stock-based compensation expense in the consolidated financial statements. additionally, certain stock-based compensation expenses associated with the transactions have been included in merger-related costs.
(3)other, net may not agree to the consolidated statements of comprehensive income primarily due to certain non-routine operating activities, such as other special items that would not be expected to reoccur or are not reflective of t-mobile's ongoing operating performance, and are therefore excluded in adjusted ebitda.
adjusted ebitda increased $11.2 billion, or 83%. the components comprising adjusted ebitda are discussed further above. the increase was primarily due to:
•higher total service revenues; and
•higher equipment revenues; partially offset by
•higher cost of services expenses, excluding merger-related costs;
•higher cost of equipment sales; and
•higher selling, general and administrative expenses, excluding merger-related costs and supplemental employee payroll, third-party commissions and cleaning-related covid-19 costs.
liquidity and capital resources our principal sources of liquidity are our cash and cash equivalents and cash generated from operations, proceeds from issuance of long-term debt and common stock, financing leases, the sale of certain receivables, financing arrangements of vendor payables which effectively extend payment terms and the new revolving credit facility (as defined below). in connection with the closing of the merger on april 1, 2020, we incurred a substantial amount of additional third-party indebtedness which increased our future financial commitments, including aggregate interest payments. further, the incurrence of additional indebtedness may inhibit our ability to incur new debt under the terms governing our existing and future indebtedness, which table of contents may make it more difficult for us to incur new debt in the future to finance our business strategy. see "risk factors - risks related to our indebtedness."

operating activities net cash provided by operating activities increased $1.8 billion, or 27%, primarily from:
•higher net income, excluding non-cash income and expenses; partially offset by
•a $6.3 billion increase in net cash outflows from changes in working capital, primarily due to the one-time impact of $2.3 billion in gross payments for the settlement of interest rate swaps related to merger financing for the year ended december 31, 2020, included in the use of cash from other current and long-term liabilities, as well as higher use of cash from accounts payable and accrued liabilities and inventories.
•net cash provided by operating activities includes $1.5 billion and $442 million in payments for merger-related costs for the years ended december 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.
•net cash provided by operating activities includes $458 million in payments for supplemental employee payroll, third-party commissions and cleaning-related covid-19 costs for the year ended december 31, 2020.
investing activities net cash used in investing activities increased $8.6 billion, or 208%. the use of cash was primarily from:
•$11.0 billion in purchases of property and equipment, including capitalized interest, from network integration related to the merger and the continued build-out of our nationwide 5g network;
•$5.0 billion in cash paid for the acquisition of sprint, net of cash and restricted cash acquired; and
•$1.3 billion in purchases of spectrum licenses and other intangible assets, including deposits; partially offset by
•$3.1 billion in proceeds related to beneficial interests in securitization transactions;
•$1.2 billion in proceeds from the divestiture of prepaid business; and
•$632 million related to derivative contracts under collateral exchange arrangements, for more information regarding these contracts, see note 7 - fair value measurements of the notes to the consolidated financial statements.
financing activities net cash provided by (used in) financing activities increased $15.4 billion. the source of cash was primarily from:
•$35.3 billion in proceeds from the issuance of long-term debt, net of discounts and issuance costs, driven primarily by the issuance of $31.8 billion in senior secured notes and a draw of $4.0 billion on the new secured term loan facility;
•$18.7 billion in proceeds from the issuance of short-term debt, net of discounts and issuance costs, driven by a $19.0 billion draw on the new secured bridge loan facility in connection with the closing of the merger; and
•$304 million in net proceeds from the softbank equity transaction, see note 14 - softbank equity transaction of the notes to the consolidated financial statements; partially offset by
•$20.4 billion in repayments of long-term debt driven by the repayment of $5.3 billion aggregate principal amount of senior notes held by dt, our $4.0 billion incremental term loan facility with dt, our $4.0 billion new secured term loan facility, $2.3 billion of outstanding principal for the termination of the accounts receivable facility assumed in the merger, $4.2 billion aggregate principal amount of senior notes held by third parties and $656 million table of contents aggregate principal amount of our 3.360% senior secured series 2016-1 a-1 notes due 2021;
•$18.9 billion in repayments of short-term debt, net of refunds for issuance costs, for the repayment of the $19.0 billion draw on the new secured bridge loan facility; and
•$1.0 billion in repayments of financing lease obligations.
cash and cash equivalents as of december 31, 2020, our cash and cash equivalents were $10.4 billion compared to $1.5 billion at december 31, 2019.
free cash flow free cash flow represents net cash provided by operating activities less cash payments for purchases of property and equipment, including proceeds from sales of tower sites and proceeds related to beneficial interests in securitization transactions, less cash payments for debt prepayment or debt extinguishment. free cash flow and free cash flow, excluding gross payments for the settlement of interest rate swaps, are non-gaap financial measures utilized by our management, investors and analysts of our financial information to evaluate cash available to pay debt and provide further investment in the business.

•higher cash purchases of property and equipment, including capitalized interest of $440 million and $473 million for the years ended december 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, from network integration related to the merger and the continued build-out of our nationwide 5g network; and
•lower proceeds related to our deferred purchase price from securitization transactions; partially offset by
•higher net cash provided by operating activities, as described above. net cash provided by operating activities was impacted by the following:
•$1.5 billion and $442 million in payments for merger-related costs for the years ended december 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.
•$458 million in payments for supplemental employee payroll, third-party commissions and cleaning-related covid-19 costs for the year ended december 31, 2020.
•the calculation of free cash flow, excluding gross payments for the settlement of interest rate swaps, excludes the one-time impact of gross payments for the settlement of interest rate swaps related to merger financing of $2.3 billion.
table of contents borrowing capacity we maintain a financing arrangement with deutsche bank ag, which allows for up to $108 million in borrowings. under the financing arrangement, we can effectively extend payment terms for invoices payable to certain vendors. as of december 31, 2020, there were no outstanding balances under such financing arrangement.
we also maintain vendor financing arrangements primarily with our main network equipment suppliers. under the respective agreements, we can obtain extended financing terms. additionally, we assumed financial liabilities with certain vendors in connection with the closing of the merger and incurred additional financial liabilities with dish at the closing of the prepaid transaction. during the year ended december 31, 2020, we repaid $481 million associated with the vendor financing arrangements and other financial liabilities, of which $342 million was associated with financial liabilities assumed in connection with the closing of the merger. these payments are included in repayments of short-term debt for purchases of inventory, property and equipment and other financial liabilities, in our consolidated statements of cash flows. as of december 31, 2020 and 2019, the outstanding balance under the vendor financing arrangements and other financial liabilities was $240 million and $25 million, respectively.

spectrum auction in march 2020, the fcc announced that we were the winning bidder of 2,384 licenses in auction 103 (37/39 ghz and 47 ghz spectrum bands) for an aggregate price of $873 million, net of an incentive payment of $59 million. at the inception of auction 103 in october 2019, we deposited $82 million with the fcc. upon conclusion of auction 103 in march 2020, we made a down payment of $93 million for the purchase price of the licenses won in the auction. on april 8, 2020, we paid the fcc the remaining $698 million of the purchase price for the licenses won in the auction. prior to the merger, the fcc announced that sprint was the winning bidder of 127 licenses in auction 103 (37/39 ghz and 47 ghz spectrum bands). all payments related to the licenses won were made by sprint prior the merger.

for more information regarding the termination of our interest rate lock derivative, see note 7 - fair value measurements of the notes to the consolidated financial statements.
future sources and uses of liquidity we may seek additional sources of liquidity, including through the issuance of additional long-term debt in 2021, to continue to opportunistically acquire spectrum licenses or other assets in private party transactions or for the refinancing of existing long-term debt on an opportunistic basis. excluding liquidity that could be needed for spectrum acquisitions, or for other assets, we expect our principal sources of funding to be sufficient to meet our anticipated liquidity needs for business operations for the next 12 months as well as our longer-term liquidity needs. our intended use of any such funds is for general corporate purposes, including for capital expenditures, spectrum purchases, opportunistic investments and acquisitions, redemption of high yield callable debt and the execution of our integration plan.
we determine future liquidity requirements, for both operations and capital expenditures, based in large part upon projected financial and operating performance, and opportunities to acquire additional spectrum. we regularly review and update these projections for changes in current and projected financial and operating results, general economic conditions, the competitive landscape and other factors. we have incurred, and will incur, substantial expenses as a result of completing the transactions, the divestiture transaction and compliance with the government commitments, and we are also expected to incur substantial restructuring expenses in connection with integrating and coordinating t-mobile's and sprint's businesses, operations, policies and procedures. while we have assumed that a certain level of merger-related expenses will be incurred, factors beyond our control, including required consultation and negotiation with certain counterparties, could affect the total amount or the timing of these expenses. these expenses could exceed the costs historically borne by us and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. there are a number of additional risks and uncertainties, including those due to the impact of the pandemic, that could cause our financial and operating results and capital requirements to differ materially from our projections, which could cause future liquidity to differ materially from our assessment. see "risk factors - risk related to our table of contents business and wireless industry - the pandemic has adversely affected, and will continue to adversely affect, our business, liquidity, financial condition, and operating results."
the indentures, supplemental indentures and credit agreements governing our long-term debt to affiliates and third parties, excluding financing leases, contain covenants that, among other things, limit the ability of the issuers or borrowers and the guarantor subsidiaries to incur more debt, pay dividends and make distributions on our common stock, make certain investments, repurchase stock, create liens or other encumbrances, enter into transactions with affiliates, enter into transactions that restrict dividends or distributions from subsidiaries, and merge, consolidate or sell, or otherwise dispose of, substantially all of their assets. certain provisions of each of the credit agreements, indentures and supplemental indentures relating to the long-term debt to affiliates and third parties restrict the ability of the issuers or borrowers to loan funds or make payments to parent. however, the issuers or borrowers are allowed to make certain permitted payments to parent under the terms of each of the credit agreements, indentures and supplemental indentures relating to the long-term debt to affiliates and third parties. we were in compliance with all restrictive debt covenants as of december 31, 2020.

for more information regarding the merger, see note 2 - business combination of the notes to the consolidated financial statements.
shentel wireless asset acquisition sprint pcs (specifically sprint spectrum l.p.) is party to a variety of publicly filed agreements with shenandoah personal communications company llc ("shentel"), pursuant to which shentel is the exclusive provider of sprint pcs's wireless mobility communications network products in certain parts of maryland, north carolina, virginia, west virginia, kentucky, ohio and pennsylvania. pursuant to one such agreement, the sprint pcs management agreement, dated november 5, 1999 (as amended, supplemented and modified from time to time, the "management agreement"), sprint pcs was granted an option to purchase shentel's wireless telecommunications assets used to provide services pursuant to the management agreement. on august 26, 2020, sprint, now our indirect subsidiary, on behalf of and as the direct or indirect owner of sprint pcs, exercised its option by delivering a binding notice of exercise to shentel. t-mobile's exercise of its option triggered a requirement for the parties to engage three independent valuation providers (the "valuation providers") to calculate the "entire business value" (the "entire business value") of such wireless telecommunications assets, pursuant to a formula and valuation process prescribed in the management agreement.
subsequent to december 31, 2020, on february 1, 2021, in accordance with the management agreement and other agreed-upon terms, the valuation providers determined and calculated the entire business value of shentel's wireless telecommunications assets used to provide services pursuant to the management agreement to be $2.1 billion, and correspondingly, the base purchase price for such wireless telecommunications assets shall be ninety percent (90%) of that entire business value amount ($1.9 billion), subject to certain other purchase price adjustments prescribed by the management agreement and such additional purchase price adjustments agreed by the parties. the parties are negotiating the remaining outstanding terms of a definitive agreement to govern the purchase of shentel's wireless telecommunication assets and expect the transaction to close in the second quarter of 2021 after satisfying customary conditions to closing.
financing lease facilities we have entered into uncommitted financing lease facilities with certain partners that provide us with the ability to enter into financing leases for network equipment and services. as of december 31, 2020, we have committed to $5.1 billion of financing leases under these financing lease facilities, of which $1.2 billion was executed during the year ended december 31, 2020. we expect to enter into up to an additional $1.2 billion in financing lease commitments during the year ending december 31, 2021.
capital expenditures our liquidity requirements have been driven primarily by capital expenditures for spectrum licenses, the construction, expansion and upgrading of our network infrastructure and the integration of the networks, spectrum, technology, personnel, customer base and business practices of t-mobile and sprint. property and equipment capital expenditures primarily relate to the integration of our acquired sprint 2.5 ghz spectrum licenses and existing 600 mhz spectrum licenses as we build out our table of contents nationwide 5g network. we expect the majority of our remaining capital expenditures related to these efforts to occur in 2021 and 2022, after which we expect capital expenditure requirements to reduce.
we expect cash purchases of property and equipment to range from $11.7 billion to $12.0 billion in 2021.
for more information regarding our property and equipment and spectrum licenses, see note 5 - property and equipment and note 6 - goodwill, spectrum license transactions and other intangible assets of the notes to the consolidated financial statements, respectively.
dividends we have never paid or declared any cash dividends on our common stock, and we do not intend to declare or pay any cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future. our credit facilities and the indentures and supplemental indentures governing our long-term debt to affiliates and third parties, excluding financing leases, contain covenants that, among other things, restrict our ability to declare or pay dividends on our common stock.
contractual obligations in connection with the regulatory approvals of the transactions, we made commitments to various state and federal agencies, including the u.s. department of justice's (the "doj") and fcc.
for more information regarding these commitments, see note 18 - commitments and contingencies of the notes to the consolidated financial statements.

critical accounting policies and estimates our significant accounting policies are fundamental to understanding our results of operations and financial condition as they require that we use estimates and assumptions that may affect the value of our assets or liabilities and financial results. see note 1 - summary of significant accounting policies of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for further information.
three of these policies, discussed below, are critical because they require management to make difficult, subjective and complex judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain and because it is likely that materially different amounts would be reported under different conditions or using different assumptions. actual results could differ from those estimates.
management and the audit committee of the board of directors have reviewed and approved these critical accounting policies.
depreciation our property and equipment balance represents a significant component of our consolidated assets. we record property and equipment at cost, and we generally depreciate property and equipment on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the assets. if all other factors were to remain unchanged, we expect that a one-year increase in the useful lives of our in-service property and equipment, exclusive of leased devices, would have resulted in a decrease of approximately $2.9 billion in our 2020 depreciation expense and that a one-year decrease in the useful life would have resulted in an increase of approximately $3.5 billion in our 2020 depreciation expense.
see note 1 - summary of significant accounting policies and note 5 - property and equipment of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for information regarding depreciation of assets, including management's underlying estimates of useful lives.
evaluation of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets, such as our spectrum licenses, are not amortized but tested for potential impairment annually, as of december 31, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate such assets might be impaired.
we test goodwill on a reporting unit basis by comparing the estimated fair value of each reporting unit to its book value. if the fair value exceeds the book value, then no impairment is measured. we have identified two reporting units for which discrete financial information is available and results are regularly reviewed by management: wireless and layer3. the layer3 reporting unit consists of the assets and liabilities of layer3 tv, inc., which was acquired in january 2018. the services provided by the layer3 reporting unit are branded tvisiontm. the wireless reporting unit consists of the remaining assets and liabilities of t-mobile us, inc., excluding layer3 tv, inc. we separately evaluate these reporting units for impairment.
when assessing goodwill for impairment we may elect to first perform a qualitative assessment for a reporting unit to determine if the quantitative impairment test is necessary. if we do not perform a qualitative assessment, or if the qualitative assessment indicates it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, we perform a quantitative test. we recognize an impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the reporting unit's fair value; however, the loss recognized would not exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. we employed a qualitative approach to assess the wireless reporting unit. the fair value of the wireless reporting unit is determined using a market approach, which is based on market capitalization. we recognize market capitalization is subject to volatility and will monitor changes in market capitalization to determine whether declines, if any, necessitate an interim impairment review. in the event market capitalization does decline below its book value, we will consider the length, severity and reasons for the decline when assessing whether potential impairment exists, including considering whether a control premium should be added to the market capitalization. we believe short-term fluctuations in share price may not necessarily reflect the underlying table of contents aggregate fair value. no events or change in circumstances have occurred that indicate the fair value of the wireless reporting unit may be below its carrying amount at december 31, 2020.
concurrent with the consummation of the merger, management also revisited the plans for our tvisiontm services offering and the integration of this offering with the sprint customer base. additionally, we expect our significantly enhanced spectrum position following the merger will allow us to accelerate our in-home broadband internet service strategy. the enhanced in-home broadband opportunity, along with the acquisition of certain content rights, created a strategic shift in our tvisiontm services offering allowing us the ability to develop a video product which will be complementary to the in-home broadband offering. based on these events and changes in circumstances, we determined that recoverability of the carrying amount of goodwill for the layer3 reporting unit should be evaluated for impairment. we employed a quantitative approach to assess the layer3 reporting unit. the fair value of the layer3 reporting unit was determined using an income approach, which was based on estimated discounted future cash flows.
we made estimates and assumptions regarding future cash flows, discount rates and long-term growth rates to determine the reporting unit's estimated fair value. the key assumptions used were as follows:
•expected cash flows underlying the tvisiontm business plan for the periods 2020 through 2025, which took into account assumptions for a delayed launch, estimates of subscribers for tvisiontm services, average revenue and content cost per subscriber, operating costs and capital expenditures;
•cash flows beyond 2025 were projected to grow at a long-term growth rate estimated at 3%. estimating a long-term growth rate requires significant judgment about future business strategies as well as micro- and macro-economic environments that are inherently uncertain; and
•we used a discount rate of 30% to risk adjust the cash flow projections in determining the estimated fair value.
the carrying value of the layer3 reporting unit exceeded its estimated fair value as of june 30, 2020. accordingly, during the year ended december 31, 2020, we recorded an impairment loss of $218 million, which is included in impairment expense in our consolidated statements of comprehensive income. this impairment reduced the goodwill assigned to the layer3 reporting unit to zero.
we test spectrum licenses for impairment on an aggregate basis, consistent with our management of the overall business at a national level. we may elect to first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of an intangible asset is less than its carrying value. if we do not perform the qualitative assessment, or if the qualitative assessment indicates it is more likely than not that the fair value of the intangible asset is less than its carrying amount, we calculate the estimated fair value of the intangible asset. if the estimated fair value of the spectrum licenses is lower than their carrying amount, an impairment loss is recognized. we estimate fair value using the greenfield methodology, which is an income approach, to estimate the price at which an orderly transaction to sell the asset would take place between market participants at the measurement date under current market conditions. the greenfield methodology values the spectrum licenses by calculating the cash flow generating potential of a hypothetical start-up company that goes into business with no assets except the asset to be valued (in this case, spectrum licenses) and makes investments required to build an operation comparable to current use. the value of the spectrum licenses can be considered as equal to the present value of the cash flows of this hypothetical start-up company. we base the assumptions underlying the greenfield methodology on a combination of market participant data and our historical results, trends and business plans. future cash flows in the greenfield methodology are based on estimates and assumptions of market participant revenues, ebitda margin, network build-out period and a long-term growth rate for a market participant. the cash flows are discounted using a weighted average cost of capital.
the valuation approaches utilized to estimate fair value for the purposes of the impairment tests of goodwill and spectrum licenses require the use of assumptions and estimates, which involve a degree of uncertainty. if actual results or future expectations are not consistent with the assumptions, this may result in the recording of significant impairment charges on goodwill or spectrum licenses. the most significant assumptions within the valuation models are the discount rate, revenues, ebitda margins, capital expenditures and long-term growth rate.

table of contents income taxes deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized based on temporary differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates expected to be in effect when these differences are realized. a valuation allowance is recorded when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of a deferred tax asset will not be realized. the ultimate realization of a deferred tax asset depends on the ability to generate sufficient taxable income of the appropriate character and in the appropriate taxing jurisdictions within the carryforward periods available.
we account for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in the financial statements in accordance with the accounting guidance for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. we assess whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon examination based on the technical merits of the position and adjust the unrecognized tax benefits in light of changes in facts and circumstances, such as changes in tax law, interactions with taxing authorities and developments in case law.

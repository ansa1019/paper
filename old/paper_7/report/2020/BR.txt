basis of presentation the consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with gaap in the u.s. and in accordance with the sec requirements for annual reports on form 10-k. these financial statements present the consolidated position of the company and include the entities in which the company directly or indirectly has a controlling financial interest as well as various entities in which the company has investments recorded under the equity method of accounting as well as certain marketable and non-marketable securities. intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated. amounts presented may not sum due to rounding. certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation where applicable, except as it relates to (i) asu no. 2016-02, as amended "leases" ("asu no. 2016-02"), (ii) asu no. 2014-09, "revenue from contracts with customers" ("asu no. 2014-09"), (iii) asu no. 2016-01, "recognition and measurement of financial assets and financial liabilities" ("asu no. 2016-01"), and (iv) asu no. 2018-02, "reclassification of certain tax effects from accumulated other comprehensive income" ("asu no. 2018-02"), as described further below.
in presenting the consolidated financial statements, management makes estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported and related disclosures. management continually evaluates the accounting policies and estimates used to prepare the consolidated financial statements. the estimates, by their nature, are based on judgment, available information, and historical experience and are believed to be reasonable. however, actual amounts and results could differ from those estimates made by management. in management's opinion, the consolidated financial statements contain all normal recurring adjustments necessary for a fair presentation of results reported. the results of operations reported for the periods presented are not necessarily indicative of the results of operations for subsequent periods.
effective july 1, 2019, the company adopted asu no. 2016-02, "leases" and its related amendments (collectively referred to as "asu 2016-02, as amended") by recognizing a rou asset and corresponding lease liability, along with a cumulative-effect adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings, in the period of adoption. under this method of adoption, the company has not restated the prior period consolidated financial statements presented to the current period presentation. additional information about the impact of the company's adoption of asu no. 2016-02, as amended is included in note 2, "summary of significant accounting policies" and note 8, "leases" to the consolidated financial statements.
effective july 1, 2018, we adopted asu no. 2014-09 using the modified retrospective transition approach applied to all contracts. under this transition approach, we have not restated the prior period consolidated financial statements presented to the current period presentation. additional information about the company's revenue recognition policies and the related impact of the adoption of asu no. 2014-09 is included in note 2, "summary of significant accounting policies" and note 3, "revenue recognition".
effective july 1, 2018, we adopted asu no. 2016-01, which requires changes in the fair value of publicly traded equity securities for which we do not have significant influence to be recorded as part of net earnings rather than as other comprehensive income (loss), net. in addition, equity investments that do not have a readily determinable fair value will be recorded at cost less impairment as further adjusted for observable price changes in orderly transactions for identical or similar investments of the issuer. we adopted asu no. 2016-01 using the modified-retrospective transition approach by recording the cumulative effect of previously unrecognized gains or losses on publicly traded equity securities to retained earnings as of july 1, 2018. the provisions of asu no. 2016-01 relative to equity investments that do not have a readily determinable fair value have been applied prospectively. the consolidated financial statements have not been revised for periods prior to july 1, 2018. the impact of adopting asu no. 2016-01 resulted in a reclassification of less than $0.1 million in unrealized gains, net from accumulated other comprehensive loss to retained earnings as of july 1, 2018.
effective july 1, 2018, we adopted asu no. 2018-02, which allows a reclassification from accumulated other comprehensive income to retained earnings for stranded tax effects associated with the change in the u.s. federal corporate tax rate resulting from the u.s. tax cuts and jobs act (the "tax act") enacted in december 2017. the adoption of asu no. 2018-02 resulted in an increase to retained earnings of $1.5 million.
effective july 1, 2018, we adopted asu no. 2017-07, "improving the presentation of net periodic pension cost and net periodic postretirement benefit cost" ("asu no. 2017-07") whereby we revised its presentation in the consolidated statements of earnings to reflect the non-service cost components of net benefit cost as part of other non-operating income (expenses), net, which were previously recorded as part of total operating expenses. all prior period information has been conformed to the current period presentation.
critical accounting policies we continually evaluate the accounting policies and estimates used to prepare the consolidated financial statements. the estimates, by their nature, are based on judgment, available information, and historical experience and are believed to be reasonable. however, actual amounts and results could differ from these estimates made by management. certain accounting policies that require significant management estimates and are deemed critical to our results of operations or financial position are discussed below.
goodwill. we review the carrying value of all our goodwill by comparing the carrying value of our reporting units to their fair values. we are required to perform this comparison at least annually or more frequently if circumstances indicate a possible impairment. when determining fair value of a reporting unit, we utilize the income approach which considers a discounted future cash flow analysis using various assumptions, including projections of revenues based on assumed long-term growth rates, estimated costs and appropriate discount rates based on the particular reporting unit's weighted-average cost of capital. the principal factors used in the discounted cash flow analysis requiring judgment are the projected future operating cash flows based on forecasted earnings before interest and taxes, and the selection of the terminal value growth rate and discount rate assumptions. the weighted-average cost of capital takes into account the relative weight of each component of our consolidated capital structure (equity and long-term debt). our estimates of long-term growth and costs are based on historical data, various internal estimates and a variety of external sources, and are developed as part of our routine, long-range planning process.
changes in economic and operating conditions impacting these assumptions could result in goodwill impairments in future periods. if the carrying amount of reporting unit goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill, an impairment loss shall be recognized in an amount equal to that excess. the implied fair value of goodwill is determined in the same manner as the amount of goodwill recognized in a business combination is determined. we had $1,674.5 million of goodwill as of june 30, 2020. given the significance of our goodwill, an adverse change to the fair value of one of our reporting units could result in an impairment charge, which could be material to our earnings.
the company performs a sensitivity analysis under step 1 of the goodwill impairment test assuming hypothetical reductions in the fair values of our reporting units. a 10% change in our estimates of projected future operating cash flows, discount rates, or terminal value growth rates used in our calculations of the fair values of the reporting units would not result in an impairment of our goodwill.
income taxes. the objectives of accounting for income taxes are to recognize the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in an entity's financial statements or tax returns. judgment is required in addressing the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our consolidated financial statements or tax returns (e.g., realization of deferred tax assets, changes in tax laws or interpretations thereof). the company is subject to regular examination of its income tax returns by the u.s. federal, state and foreign tax authorities. a change in the assessment of the outcomes of such matters could materially impact our consolidated financial statements. the company has estimated foreign net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $13.1 million as of june 30, 2020 of which $1.5 million are subject to expiration in the june 30, 2020 through june 30, 2028 period. the remaining $11.6 million of carryforwards has an indefinite utilization period. in addition, the company has estimated u.s. federal net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $37.0 million of which $16.9 million can be utilized through june 30, 2030 with the balance of $20.2 million having an indefinite utilization period. u.s. federal net operating loss carryforwards resulting from tax losses beginning with the fiscal year ended june 30, 2019 have an indefinite carryforward under the tax act. the company did not realize any federal net operating losses for the fiscal year ended june 30, 2020.
valuation allowances are recognized to reduce deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that the company will not be able to utilize the deferred tax assets attributable to net operating and capital loss carryforwards of certain subsidiaries to offset future taxable earnings. the company has recorded valuation allowances of $6.7 million and $3.3 million at june 30, 2020 and 2019, respectively. the determination as to whether a deferred tax asset will be recognized is made on a jurisdictional basis and is based on the evaluation of historical taxable income or loss, projected future taxable income, carryforward periods, scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities and tax planning strategies. projected future taxable income is based on expected results and assumptions as to the jurisdiction in which the income will be earned. the assumptions used to project future taxable income requires significant judgment and are consistent with the plans and estimates used to manage the underlying businesses.
on the same date that the tax act was enacted, december 22, 2017, the sec issued staff accounting bulletin no. 118 ("sab 118") which provided the company with up to one year to finalize accounting for the impacts of the tax act. under sab 118, the company finalized the prior year estimate of the net tax impact to the company arising from the enactment of the tax act, and recognized a tax benefit of approximately $0.5 million in the fiscal year ended june 30, 2019.
share-based payments. accounting for stock-based compensation requires the measurement of stock-based compensation expense based on the fair value of the award on the date of grant. we determine the fair value of stock options issued by using a binomial option-pricing model. the binomial option-pricing model considers a range of assumptions related to volatility, dividend yield, risk-free interest rate and employee exercise behavior. expected volatilities utilized in the binomial option-pricing model are based on a combination of implied market volatilities, historical volatility of our stock price and other factors. similarly, the dividend yield is based on historical experience and expected future changes. the risk-free rate is derived from the u.s. treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant. the binomial option-pricing model also incorporates exercise and forfeiture assumptions based on an analysis of historical data. the expected life of the stock option grants is derived from the output of the binomial model and represents the period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding. determining these assumptions are subjective and complex, and therefore, a change in the assumptions utilized could impact the calculation of the fair value of our stock options. a hypothetical change of five percentage points applied to the volatility assumption used to determine the fair value of the fiscal year 2020 stock option grants would result in approximately a $2.4 million change in total pre-tax stock-based compensation expense for the fiscal year 2020 grants, which would be amortized over the vesting period. a hypothetical change of one year in the expected life assumption used to determine the fair value of the fiscal year 2020 stock option grants would result in approximately a $0.8 million change in the total pre-tax stock-based compensation expense for the fiscal year 2020 grants, which would be amortized over the vesting period. a hypothetical change of one percentage point in the forfeiture rate assumption used for the fiscal year 2020 stock option grants would result in approximately a $0.1 million change in the total pre-tax stock-based compensation expense for the fiscal year 2020 grants, which would be amortized over the vesting period. a hypothetical one-half percentage point change in the dividend yield assumption used to determine the fair value of the fiscal year 2020 stock option grants would result in approximately a $0.9 million change in the total pre-tax stock-based compensation expense for the fiscal year 2020 grants, which would be amortized over the vesting period.
key performance indicators management focuses on a variety of key indicators to plan, measure and evaluate the company's business and financial performance. these performance indicators include revenue and recurring fee revenue as well as not generally accepted accounting principles measures ("non-gaap") of adjusted operating income, adjusted net earnings, adjusted diluted earnings per share, free cash flow, and closed sales. in addition, management focuses on select operating metrics specific to broadridge of record growth and internal trade growth, as defined below.
refer to the section "explanation and reconciliation of the company's use of non-gaap financial measures" for a reconciliation of adjusted operating income, adjusted net earnings, adjusted diluted earnings per share, and free cash flow to the most directly comparable generally accepted accounting principles ("gaap") measures, and an explanation for why these non-gaap metrics provide useful information to investors and how management uses these non-gaap metrics for operational and financial decision-making. refer to the section "results of operations" for a description of closed sales and an explanation of why closed sales is a useful performance metric for management and investors.
revenues revenues are primarily generated from fees for processing and distributing investor communications and fees for technology-enabled services and solutions. the company monitors revenue in each of our two reportable segments as a key measure of success in addressing our clients' needs. fee revenues are derived from both recurring and event-driven activity. the level of recurring and event-driven activity the company processes directly impacts distribution revenues. while event-driven activity is highly repeatable, it may not recur on an annual basis. event-driven fee revenues are based on the number of special events and corporate transactions the company processes. event-driven activity is impacted by financial market conditions and changes in regulatory compliance requirements, resulting in fluctuations in the timing and levels of event-driven fee revenues. distribution revenues primarily include revenues related to the physical mailing of proxy materials, interim communications, transaction reporting, customer communications and fulfillment services as well as matrix administrative services.
recurring fee revenue growth represents the company's total annual fee revenue growth, less growth from event-driven fee revenues. we distinguish recurring fee revenue growth between organic and acquired:
•organic - we define organic revenue as the recurring fee revenue generated from net new business and internal growth.
•acquired - we define acquired revenue as the recurring fee revenue generated from acquired services in the first twelve months following the date of acquisition. this type of growth comes as a result of our strategy to purchase, integrate, and leverage the value of assets we acquire.
revenues and recurring fee revenue are useful metrics for investors in understanding how management measures and evaluates the company's ongoing operational performance. see "results of operations" as well as note 2 "summary of significant accounting policies" and note 3, "revenue recognition" to our consolidated financial statements under item 8 of part ii of this annual report on form 10-k.
record growth and internal trade growth the company uses select operating metrics specific to broadridge of record growth and internal trade growth in evaluating its business results and identifying trends affecting its business. record growth is defined as stock record growth and interim record growth which measure the estimated annual change in total positions eligible for equity proxy materials and mutual fund and exchange traded fund interim communications, respectively, for equities and mutual fund position data reported to broadridge in both the current and prior year periods. internal trade growth represents the estimated change in trade volumes for broadridge securities processing clients whose contracts are linked to trade volumes and who were on broadridge's trading platforms in both the current and prior year periods. record growth and internal trade growth are useful non-financial metrics for investors in understanding how management measures and evaluates broadridge's ongoing operational performance within its investor communication solutions and global technology and operations reportable segments, respectively.
the key performance indicators for the fiscal years ended june 30, 2020, and 2019, are as follows:

results of operations the following discussions of analysis of consolidated statements of earnings and analysis of reportable segments refer to the fiscal year ended june 30, 2020 compared to the fiscal year ended june 30, 2019. the analysis of consolidated statements of earnings should be read in conjunction with the analysis of reportable segments, which provides more detailed discussions concerning certain components of the consolidated statements of earnings. discussions of analysis of consolidated statements of earnings and analysis of reportable segments for the fiscal year ended june 30, 2019 compared to the fiscal year ended june 30, 2018 is disclosed in part ii, "item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations" of the 2019 annual report.
the following references are utilized in the discussions of analysis of consolidated statements of earnings and analysis of reportable segments:
"amortization of acquired intangibles and purchased intellectual property" and "acquisition and integration costs" represent certain non-cash amortization expenses associated with acquired intangible assets and purchased intellectual property assets, as well as certain transaction and integration costs associated with the company's acquisition activities, respectively.
"ibm private cloud charges" represent a charge on the hardware assets to be transferred to ibm and other charges related to the ibm private cloud agreement.
"gain on sale of a joint venture investment" represents a non-operating, cash gain on the sale of one of the company's joint venture investments.
"covid-19 related expenses" represents certain non-recurring expenses associated with the covid-19 pandemic.
"net new business" refers to recurring revenue from closed sales less recurring revenue from client losses.
the following definitions describe the company's revenues:
fee revenues in the investor communication solutions segment are derived from both recurring and event-driven activity. in addition, the level of recurring and event-driven activity we process directly impacts distribution revenues. while event-driven activity is highly repeatable, it may not recur on an annual basis. the types of services we provide that comprise event-driven activity are:
•mutual fund proxy: the proxy and related services we provide to mutual funds when certain events occur requiring a shareholder vote including changes in directors, sub-advisors, fee structures, investment restrictions, and mergers of funds.
•mutual fund communications: mutual fund communications services consist primarily of the distribution on behalf of mutual funds of supplemental information required to be provided to the annual mutual fund prospectus as a result of certain triggering events such as a change in portfolio managers. in addition, mutual fund communications consist of notices and marketing materials such as newsletters.
•proxy contests and specials, corporate actions, and other: the proxy services we provide in connection with shareholder meetings driven by special events such as proxy contests, mergers and acquisitions, and tender/exchange offers.
event-driven fee revenues are based on the number of special events and corporate transactions we process. event-driven activity is impacted by financial market conditions and changes in regulatory compliance requirements, resulting in fluctuations in the timing and levels of event-driven fee revenues. as such, the timing and level of event-driven activity and its potential impact on revenues and earnings are difficult to forecast.
generally, mutual fund proxy activity has been subject to a greater level of volatility than the other components of event-driven activity. during fiscal year 2020, mutual fund proxy fee revenues were 35% lower than the prior fiscal year while during fiscal year 2019 mutual fund proxy revenues were 14% lower than the prior fiscal year. although it is difficult to forecast the levels of event-driven activity, we expect that the portion of fee revenues derived from mutual fund proxy activity may continue to experience volatility in the future.
distribution revenues primarily include revenues related to the physical mailing of proxy materials, interim communications, transaction reporting, customer communications and fulfillment services as well as matrix administrative services.
distribution cost of revenues consists primarily of postage-related expenses incurred in connection with our investor communication solutions segment, as well as matrix administrative services expenses. these costs are reflected in cost of revenues.
closed sales represent an estimate of the expected annual recurring fee revenue for new client contracts that were signed by broadridge in the current reporting period. closed sales does not include event-driven or distribution activity. we consider contract terms, expected client volumes or activity, knowledge of the marketplace and experience with our clients, among other factors, when determining the estimate. management uses closed sales to measure the effectiveness of our sales and marketing programs, as an indicator of expected future revenues and as a performance metric in determining incentive compensation.
closed sales is not a measure of financial performance under gaap and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for revenue or other income statement data prepared in accordance with gaap. closed sales is a useful metric for investors in understanding how management measures and evaluates our ongoing operational performance.
the inherent variability of transaction volumes and activity levels can result in some variability of amounts reported as actual achieved closed sales. larger closed sales can take up to 12 to 24 months or longer to convert to revenues, particularly for the services provided by our global technology and operations segment. for fiscal years ended june 30, 2020 and 2019, we are reporting closed sales net of a 4.0% allowance adjustment. consequently, our reported closed sales amounts are not adjusted for actual revenues achieved because these adjustments are estimated in the period the sale is reported. we assess the allowance amount at the end of each fiscal year to establish the appropriate allowance for the subsequent year using trailing five years actual data as the starting point, normalized for outlying factors, if any, to enhance the accuracy of the allowance.
for the fiscal years ended june 30, 2020 and 2019, closed sales were $238.9 million and $233.3 million, respectively. the fiscal years ended june 30, 2020 and 2019, are net of an allowance adjustment of $10.0 million and $9.7 million, respectively.
recent developments in march 2020, the world health organization declared the outbreak of covid-19 as a pandemic, which continues to spread throughout the world including the u.s., india, canada, europe and other locations where we operate. developments have occurred rapidly with respect to the spread of covid-19 and its impact on human health and businesses. to date, the covid-19 pandemic has negatively impacted the global economy, created significant financial market volatility, disrupted global supply chains, and resulted in a significant number of deaths and infections worldwide. in response, several countries worldwide enacted fiscal stimulus packages while central banks increased monetary stimulus, both designed to help mitigate the negative macroeconomic effects of covid-19. in addition, several national, state and local governments have placed restrictions on people from gathering in groups or interacting within a certain physical distance (i.e. social distancing) and in certain cases, have ordered businesses to close, limit operations or mandate that people stay at home.
the company's operations, both our investor communication solutions and global technology and operations segments, are critical components of the overall financial markets infrastructure in the u.s. and globally. as a result, we have been permitted to continue operating in all jurisdictions in which we conduct business (in most cases remotely), including in jurisdictions that have mandated the closure of certain businesses. accordingly, the company has taken several measures designed to protect the health of our employees and to minimize our operational disruption and resulting provision of services to our clients from the covid-19 pandemic, including adopting strict social distancing and cleaning measures in our production facilities, taking the temperature of production-related employees in affected areas on a daily basis as a prerequisite to entering our facilities, load balancing of client jobs between various facilities, and instituting work from home protocols for employees not involved in production operations, amongst other measures.
to date, there has not been a material impact as a result of covid-19 on our consolidated revenues and pre-tax income. the company processed above average levels of equity and fixed income trades in the third and fourth quarters of fiscal 2020 for our financial services clients, many of whom themselves have experienced higher levels of trading activity from market volatility caused by the covid-19 pandemic, partially offset by lower internal growth in certain aspects of our investor communication solutions business. in addition, all of our production-related facilities remain operational and are continuing to provide ongoing services to our clients. further, we have not experienced any significant supply-chain issues as our critical vendors have also remained operational and continue to meet their on-going service level requirements. we continue to actively engage with our clients to assist with their service demands, including our clients' needs for any supplemental operational services and/or changes to existing service requirements in response to the covid-19 pandemic.
notwithstanding the foregoing, we are unable to precisely predict the impact that covid-19 will have in the future due to numerous uncertainties, including the severity of the disease, the duration of the outbreak, actions that may be taken by governmental authorities, the impact to the business of our clients, and other factors identified in part i, item 1a. "risk factors" in this form 10-k. given these uncertainties, covid-19 could disrupt the business of certain of our clients, decrease our clients' demand for our services, impact our business operations and our ability to execute on our associated business strategies and initiatives, and adversely impact our consolidated results of operations and/or our financial condition in the future. we will continue to closely monitor and evaluate the nature and extent of the impact of covid-19 to our business, consolidated results of operations, and financial condition.
on august 5, 2020, the sec proposed modifications to the mutual fund and exchange-traded fund disclosure framework (the "fund disclosure proposal"). the fund disclosure proposal is intended to provide a disclosure framework that would better serve the needs of retail investors.  among the modifications proposed are the requirement for streamlined shareholder reports with concise and visually engaging content which would replace prospectus updates, and improvements to prospectus disclosure. adoption and implementation of the fund disclosure proposal amendments as proposed could have an impact on our services, business and financial results. we will closely monitor and evaluate the progress of the fund disclosure proposal and its potential impact on our business. please see our "risk factors" in part i, item 1a. of this form 10-k for more information.

•selling, general and administrative expenses - the increase of $61.5 million in selling, general, and administrative expenses primarily reflected the impact of acquisitions and higher compensation expense.
•currencies positively impacted total operating expenses by $31.3 million due to a combination of foreign acquisitions, the strengthening of the u.s. dollar against other currencies, and continued international operating expense growth.
operating income margin of 13.8% for the fiscal year ended june 30, 2020 declined 120 bps from 15.0% for the fiscal year ended june 30, 2019 partly due to charges associated with the ibm private cloud agreement. however, adjusted operating income margin of 17.5% for the fiscal year ended june 30, 2020 increased 40 bps on higher recurring revenues from 17.1% for the fiscal year ended june 30, 2019, which excludes certain charges associated with the ibm private cloud agreement and certain other non-gaap adjustments. see "explanation and reconciliation of the company's use of non-gaap financial measures."
interest expense, net. interest expenses, net, was $58.8 million, an increase of $17.0 million from $41.8 million in the fiscal year ended june 30, 2019. the increase of $17.0 million was primarily due to an increase in interest expense from higher borrowings primarily related to acquisitions.
other non-operating income (expenses), net. other non-operating income, net for the fiscal year ended june 30, 2020 was $13.4 million, an increase of $17.1 million, compared to $3.7 million of other non-operating expenses, net for the fiscal year ended june 30, 2019. the increase of $17.1 million was primarily due to higher investment gains as compared to the prior year period.
provision for income taxes.
•effective tax rate for the fiscal year ended june 30, 2020 - 20.2%.
•effective tax rate for the fiscal year ended june 30, 2019 - 20.6%.
the decrease in the effective tax rate for the fiscal year ended june 30, 2020 compared to the fiscal year ended june 30, 2019 was primarily driven by higher discrete tax benefits, partially offset by lower excess tax benefits of $15.6 million for the fiscal year ended june 30, 2020 compared to $19.3 million for the fiscal year ended june 30, 2019.
analysis of reportable segments broadridge has two reportable business segments: (1) investor communication solutions and (2) global technology and operations.
the primary component of "other" are certain gains, losses, corporate overhead expenses and non-operating expenses that have not been allocated to the reportable segments, such as interest expense. foreign currency exchange is a reconciling item between the actual foreign currency exchange rates and the constant foreign currency exchange rates used for internal management reporting.
certain corporate expenses, as well as certain centrally managed expenses, are allocated based upon budgeted amounts in a reasonable manner. because the company compensates the management of its various businesses on, among other factors, segment profit, the company may elect to record certain segment-related operating and non-operating expense items in other rather than reflect such items in segment profit.
in connection with an organizational change made in the first quarter of fiscal year 2020, in order to further align and enhance our portfolio of services, the results for the company's wealth management advisor solutions services that were previously reported in our investor communication solutions reportable segment are now reported within the global technology and operations reportable segment. as a result, our prior period segment results for the fiscal year ended june 30, 2019 have been revised to reflect this change, which resulted in transferring $42.8 million of revenues and $2.2 million of earnings before income taxes between reportable segments, respectively.

explanation and reconciliation of the company's use of non-gaap financial measures the company's results in this annual report on form 10-k are presented in accordance with u.s. gaap except where otherwise noted. in certain circumstances, results have been presented in non-gaap measures. these non-gaap measures are adjusted operating income, adjusted operating income margin, adjusted net earnings, adjusted earnings per share, and free cash flow. these non-gaap financial measures should be viewed in addition to, and not as a substitute for, the company's reported results.
the company believes our non-gaap financial measures help investors understand how management plans, measures and evaluates the company's business performance. management believes that non-gaap measures provide consistency in its financial reporting and facilitates investors' understanding of the company's operating results and trends by providing an additional basis for comparison. management uses these non-gaap financial measures to, among other things, evaluate our ongoing operations, for internal planning and forecasting purposes and in the calculation of performance-based compensation. in addition, and as a consequence of the importance of these non-gaap financial measures in managing our business, the company's compensation committee of the board of directors incorporates non-gaap financial measures in the evaluation process for determining management compensation.
adjusted operating income, adjusted operating income margin, adjusted net earnings and adjusted earnings per share these non-gaap measures reflect operating income, operating income margin, net earnings, and diluted earnings per share, as adjusted to exclude the impact of certain costs, expenses, gains and losses and other specified items that management believes are not indicative of our ongoing operating performance. these adjusted measures exclude the impact of: (i) amortization of acquired intangibles and purchased intellectual property, (ii) acquisition and integration costs, (iii) ibm private cloud charges, (iv) the gain on sale of a joint venture investment, and (v) covid-19 related expenses. amortization of acquired intangibles and purchased intellectual property represents non-cash amortization expenses associated with the company's acquisition activities. acquisition and integration costs represent certain transaction and integration costs associated with the company's acquisition activities. ibm private cloud charges represent a charge on the hardware assets to be transferred to ibm and other charges related to the ibm private cloud agreement. the gain on sale of a joint venture investment represents a non-operating, cash gain on the sale of one of the company's joint venture investments. covid-19 related expenses represents certain non-recurring expenses associated with the covid-19 pandemic.
we exclude ibm private cloud charges, gain on sale of a joint venture investment, and covid-19 related expenses from our adjusted operating income and other earnings measures because excluding such information provides us with an understanding of the results from the primary operations of our business and these items do not reflect ordinary operations or earnings. we also exclude the impact of amortization of acquired intangibles and purchased intellectual property, as these non-cash amounts are significantly impacted by the timing and size of individual acquisitions and do not factor into the company's capital allocation decisions, management compensation metrics or multi-year objectives. furthermore, management believes that this adjustment enables better comparison of our results as amortization of acquired intangibles and purchased intellectual property will not recur in future periods once such intangible assets have been fully amortized. although we exclude amortization of acquired intangibles and purchased intellectual property from our adjusted earnings measures, our management believes that it is important for investors to understand that these intangible assets contribute to revenue generation. amortization of intangible assets that relate to past acquisitions will recur in future periods until such intangible assets have been fully amortized. any future acquisitions may result in the amortization of additional intangible assets.
free cash flows in addition to the non-gaap financial measures discussed above, we provide free cash flow information because we consider free cash flow to be a liquidity measure that provides useful information to management and investors about the amount of cash generated that could be used for dividends, share repurchases, strategic acquisitions, other investments, as well as debt servicing. free cash flow is a non-gaap financial measure and is defined by the company as net cash flows provided by operating activities less capital expenditures as well as software purchases and capitalized internal use software.
set forth below is a reconciliation of such non-gaap measures to the most directly comparable gaap measures (unaudited):

at june 30, 2020 and 2019, cash and cash equivalents were $476.6 million and $273.2 million, respectively. total stockholders' equity was $1,346.5 million and $1,127.5 million at june 30, 2020 and 2019, respectively. at the current time, and in future periods, we expect cash generated by our operations, together with existing cash, cash equivalents, and borrowings from the capital markets, to be sufficient to cover cash needs for working capital, capital expenditures, strategic acquisitions, dividends and common stock repurchases. given the volatility in the rapidly changing market and economic conditions related to the covid-19 pandemic, we will continue to evaluate the nature and extent of the impact of the covid-19 pandemic on our business and financial position.
we expect existing domestic cash, cash equivalents, cash flows from operations and borrowing capacity to continue to be sufficient to fund our domestic operating activities and cash commitments for investing and financing activities, such as regular quarterly dividends, debt repayment schedules, and material capital expenditures, for at least the next 12 months and thereafter for the foreseeable future. in addition, we expect existing foreign cash, cash equivalents, cash flows from operations and borrowing capacity to continue to be sufficient to fund our foreign operating activities and cash commitments for investing activities, such as material capital expenditures, for at least the next 12 months and thereafter for the foreseeable future. if these funds are needed for our operations in the u.s., we may be required to pay additional foreign taxes to repatriate these funds. however, while we may do so at a future date, the company does not need to repatriate future foreign earnings to fund u.s. operations.
outstanding borrowings and available capacity under the company's borrowing arrangements were as follows:

the company has a $1.5 billion five-year revolving credit facility (the "fiscal 2019 revolving credit facility"), which is comprised of a $1.1 billion u.s. dollar tranche and a $400.0 million multicurrency tranche. borrowings under the fiscal 2019 revolving credit facility bear interest at libor plus 101.5 basis points. in addition, the fiscal 2019 revolving credit facility has an annual facility fee equal to 11.0 basis points on the entire facility.
the fiscal 2019 revolving credit facility and senior notes are senior unsecured obligations of the company and are ranked equally in right of payment. interest on the senior notes due 2020 is payable semiannually on march 1st and september 1st of each year based on a fixed per annum rate equal to 3.95%. interest on the senior notes due june 2026 is payable semiannually on june 27th and december 27th of each year based on a fixed per annum rate equal to 3.40%. interest on the senior notes due 2029 is payable semiannually on june 1st and december 1st each year based on a fixed per annum rate equal to 2.90%.
our liquidity position may be negatively affected by changes in general economic conditions, regulatory requirements and access to the capital markets, which may be limited if we were to fail to renew any of the credit facilities on their renewal dates or if we were to fail to meet certain ratios.
please refer to note 13, "borrowings" to our consolidated financial statements under item 8 of part ii of this annual report on form 10-k for a more detailed discussion.

the decrease in cash provided by operating activities of $18.7 million primarily reflects increased scaling of client-related platform implementation and development, partially offset by cash flows from higher revenues, cash collections and working capital.
the increase in cash used in investing activities of $8.1 million primarily reflects an increase in capital expenditures and software purchases, partially offset by lower acquisition spend in fiscal year 2020.
the increase in cash provided by financing activities of $224.3 million primarily reflects a decrease in the repurchase of common stock, partially offset by a decrease in net proceeds from borrowings and an increase in dividends paid.
income taxes the company, headquartered in the u.s., is routinely examined by the irs and is also routinely examined by the tax authorities in the u.s. states and foreign countries in which it conducts business. the tax years under audit examination vary by tax jurisdiction. the company regularly considers the likelihood of assessments in each of the jurisdictions resulting from examinations. to the extent the company determines it has potential tax assessments in particular tax jurisdictions, the company has established tax reserves which it believes are adequate in relation to the potential assessments. once established, reserves are adjusted when there is more information available, when an event occurs necessitating a change to the reserves or the statute of limitations for the relevant taxing authority to examine the tax position has expired. the resolution of tax matters should not have a material effect on the financial condition of the company or on the company's consolidated statements of earnings for a particular future period.
defined benefit pension plans the company sponsors a supplemental officer retirement plan (the "sorp"). the sorp is a nonqualified erisa defined benefit plan pursuant to which the company will pay supplemental pension benefits to certain key officers upon retirement based upon the officers' years of service and compensation. the sorp was closed to new participants beginning in fiscal year 2015. the company also sponsors a supplemental executive retirement plan (the "serp"). the serp is also a nonqualified erisa defined benefit plan pursuant to which the company will pay supplemental pension benefits to certain key executives upon retirement based upon the executives' years of service and compensation. the serp was closed to new participants beginning in fiscal year 2015.
the sorp and serp are effectively funded with assets held in a rabbi trust. the assets invested in the rabbi trust are to be used in part to fund benefit payments to participants under the terms of the plans. the rabbi trust is irrevocable and no portion of the trust funds may be used for any purpose other than the delivery of those assets to the participants, except that assets held in the rabbi trust would be subject to the claims of the company's general creditors in the event of bankruptcy or insolvency of the company. the sorp and serp are nonqualified plans for federal tax purposes and for purposes of title i of erisa. the rabbi trust assets had a value of $54.5 million at june 30, 2020 and $41.9 million at june 30, 2019 and are included in other non-current assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.

other post-employment benefit obligations in accordance with the payment of gratuity act of 1972, the company sponsors a post-employment defined benefit plan (the "gratuity plan") covering all employees in india who are eligible under the terms of their employment. the gratuity plan is required by local law and provides a lump sum payment to vested employees upon retirement, death, incapacitation, or termination of employment based on the respective employee's salary and the tenure of employment. the gratuity plan is currently unfunded.

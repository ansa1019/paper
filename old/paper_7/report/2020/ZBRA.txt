overview zebra technologies corporation and its subsidiaries ("zebra" or the "company") is a global leader respected for innovative enterprise asset intelligence ("eai") solutions in the automatic identification and data capture solutions industry. we design, manufacture, and sell a broad range of products and solutions, including cloud-based subscriptions, that capture and move data, including: mobile computers; barcode scanners and imagers; radio frequency identification device ("rfid") readers; specialty printers for barcode labeling and personal identification; real-time location systems ("rtls"); related accessories and supplies, such as self-adhesive labels and other consumables; and software applications. we also provide a full range of services, including maintenance, technical support, and repair, managed and professional services. end-users of our products, solutions and services include those in the retail and e-commerce, transportation and logistics, manufacturing, healthcare, hospitality, warehouse and distribution, energy and utilities, government, education, and banking enterprises around the world.  we provide products, solutions, and services in approximately 180 countries, with 128 facilities and approximately 8,800 employees worldwide.
our customers have traditionally benefited from proven solutions that increase productivity and improve asset efficiency and utilization. the company is poised to drive, and capitalize on, the evolution of the data capture industry into the broader eai industry, based on important technology trends like the internet of things ("iot"), ubiquitous mobility, automation and cloud computing. eai solutions offer additional benefits to our customers including real-time, data-driven insights that improve operational visibility and drive workflow optimization.
the company's operations consist of two reportable segments: asset intelligence & tracking ("ait") and enterprise visibility & mobility ("evm").
•the ait segment is an industry leader in barcode printing and asset tracking technologies. its major product lines include barcode and card printers, supplies, services, location solutions, and retail solutions. industries served include retail and e-commerce, transportation and logistics, manufacturing, healthcare, and other end markets within the following regions: north america; europe, middle east, and africa ("emea"); asia-pacific; and latin america.
•the evm segment is an industry leader in automatic information and data capture solutions. its major product lines include mobile computing, data capture, rfid, services, and workflow optimization solutions. industries served include retail and e-commerce, transportation and logistics, manufacturing, healthcare, and other end markets within the following regions: north america; emea; asia-pacific; and latin america.
beginning in the first quarter of 2021, we will move the retail solutions product line from our ait segment into our evm segment contemporaneous with a change in our organizational structure and management of the business. we will begin reporting our results reflecting this change in the first quarter of 2021 and will present historical periods on a comparable basis. the impact of this change does not have an impact to the consolidated financial statements and is immaterial to our current and historical reportable segment results.
recent developments covid-19 outbreak in 2020, the coronavirus ("covid-19") spread rapidly worldwide, resulting in a broad number of governmental and commercial efforts to contain it, such as travel bans and restrictions, quarantines, shelter in place orders, and shutdowns. these events have resulted in significant declines in global economic activity and significant volatility in financial market valuations, the duration and extent of which continues to be highly uncertain. the company's 2020 net sales and profitability were negatively impacted by the direct and indirect effects of the pandemic which were most pronounced in the second quarter.
we serve a diverse mix of customers. some of our customers have experienced significant declines or suspensions to their operations, whereas others have experienced increases in their business volume. while many of our supply chain partners in china temporarily suspended or modified their business operations in early 2020 as a consequence of covid-19, we have substantially mitigated the impact of these disruptions by taking exceptional actions, including alternative modes of product delivery and fulfillment, as well as providing protective equipment and hazard pay premiums for our front-line employees.
the federal, state, and local governments as well as foreign governments, to varying degrees, have imposed, and continue to impose, several protocols and regulations restricting the physical movement or other activities of individuals in an effort to limit the spread of covid-19. we have implemented a number of measures in an effort to protect our employees' health and well-being, including having the majority of office workers work remotely, limiting employee travel, and withdrawing from in-person industry events. in addition, as governments continue to ease their restrictions and we continue to allow our employees to come back to work in our offices in a controlled approach, we have modified our business practices, including implementing social distancing protocols, office capacity restrictions, health screening, provision of personal protective equipment, tracking and tracing protocols, and extensively and frequently disinfecting our workspaces. throughout the pandemic, distribution centers and repair centers have remained open at varying capacity levels to ensure continued support to our customers, many of whom provide essential goods and services to communities.
during the past year, we considered the potential impacts of the global pandemic in qualitative impairment assessments of our long-lived assets, including goodwill and intangible assets, property, plant and equipment and right-of-use lease assets. we concluded that it is not more likely than not that any of our long-lived assets are impaired. our analysis considered, among other factors:
•the nature of our products, solutions, and services as well as our position within our industry;
•our highly variable cost structure;
•the assumption that the negative impacts from covid-19 will be temporary; and that
•the company will continue generating strong positive operating cash flows over the long-term.
we have also considered the adequacy of our capital resources, inclusive of available borrowing capacity and other financing facilities; the results of our most recent quantitative goodwill impairment assessment, which was last completed in the fourth quarter of 2020 and further discussed in note 6, goodwill and other intangibles in the notes to consolidated financial statements; and that our market capitalization has continued to far exceed total net assets. finally, while we may experience a temporary increase in working capital levels, we do not anticipate a material impact to the realizability of current assets, such as accounts receivable or inventories, at this time.
the situation related to the pandemic continues to be complex and rapidly evolving. in late 2020, certain vaccines were authorized by major regulatory bodies to help fight the infection of covid-19, and certain other vaccines are in the late stages of development to provide such treatment. at this time, however, the availability of authorized vaccines is highly limited, and the time required to make these vaccines available to all members of the public remains uncertain. if covid-19 persists or worsens before a safe and effective vaccine or other treatment is made widely available, there may be further external developments, such as restrictions imposed by government authorities or guidance issued by public health authorities, that are beyond our control and may impact our operating plans. parts of our business have experienced, and may continue to experience, operational disruption and customer demand impacts. since the onset of the pandemic, we have taken certain cost reduction actions to mitigate the impact to profitability and cash flow. we cannot reasonably estimate the duration of the pandemic or fully ascertain its long-term impact to our business.

2020 compared to 2019
total net sales decreased $37 million or 0.8% compared with the prior year primarily due to customer demand declines resulting from the covid-19 pandemic which had an overall negative effect on both of our segments and broadly across all regions. the negative effect of the pandemic was most pronounced within our ait segment, particularly in the second quarter of 2020. ait sales declines were partially offset by growth in our evm segment, reflecting higher services and software revenues, due in part from recent business acquisitions, as well as increased product purchases, particularly in the transportation and logistics and retail end markets, in response to the need to digitize and automate workflows in an increasingly on-demand economy. excluding the effects of acquisitions and unfavorable currency changes, the decrease in consolidated organic net sales was 0.9%.
gross margin decreased to 45.0% for the current year compared to 46.8% in the prior year. gross margins were lower in both the ait and evm segments, reflecting unfavorable business mix, including larger deal size, and premium freight costs. these declines were partially offset by productivity gains within our services offerings and a partial recovery of 2019 chinese import tariffs in the fourth quarter of 2020.
operating expenses for the years ended december 31, 2020 and 2019 were $1,352 million and $1,408 million, or 30.4% and 31.4% of net sales, respectively. as a percentage of net sales, operating costs continue to trend favorably. the decrease in operating expenses over the prior year was primarily due to lower discretionary spending, employee incentive-based compensation, and intangible asset amortization expense. these reductions were partially offset by the inclusion of operating expenses associated with acquired businesses and costs associated with the diversification of the company's product sourcing footprint.
operating income was $651 million for the current year compared to $692 million for the prior year. the decrease was primarily due to lower net sales and gross profit, partially offset by the benefit of lower operating expenses.
net income decreased 7.4% compared to the prior year due to lower operating income and higher income tax expense, which were partially offset by a decrease in other expenses, net, detailed as follows:
•the company's effective tax rates for the years ended december 31, 2020 and december 31, 2019 were 10.0% and 9.0%, respectively. the company's effective tax rate was higher in the current year as compared to the prior year, primarily due to higher benefits of uncertain tax positions in the prior year, partially offset by higher income in foreign jurisdictions with lower tax rates in the current year.
•other expenses, net was $91 million for the current year, compared to $94 million for the prior year. the increase in interest rate swap and foreign exchange losses in the current year were more than offset by the favorable impacts of lower interest rates and average outstanding debt levels. additionally, the prior year included $7 million of debt refinancing costs.
diluted earnings per share decreased to $9.35 as compared to $9.97 in the prior year primarily due to lower operating income and a higher effective income tax rate, which were partially offset by the benefit of lower weighted average shares outstanding.
results of operations by segment the following commentary should be read in conjunction with the financial results of each operating business segment as detailed in note 20, segment information & geographic data in the notes to consolidated financial statements. to the extent applicable, segment results exclude purchase accounting adjustments, amortization of intangible assets, acquisition and integration costs, impairment of goodwill and other intangibles, exit and restructuring costs, and product sourcing diversification costs.

gross margin decreased to 47.3% in the current year compared to 49.8% for the prior year primarily due to unfavorable product mix, lower sales volumes, and premium freight costs, which were partially offset by recoveries of certain 2019 chinese import tariffs in the fourth quarter of 2020.
operating income decreased 9.3% in the current year compared to the prior year. the decrease was due to lower net sales and gross profit, partially offset by the benefit of lower operating expenses.

2020 compared to 2019
total net sales for evm increased $23 million or 0.8% compared to the prior year primarily due to higher sales of support services, mobile computing products, and our recent acquisitions. these increases were partially offset by lower sales of data capture products in most regions associated with continued covid-19 induced customer demand declines, the impact of which was most pronounced in the second quarter of 2020, and unfavorable currency changes. excluding the impacts of acquisitions and foreign currency changes, evm organic net sales growth was 0.5%.
gross margin decreased to 44.3% in the current year compared to 45.6% in the prior year, primarily due to unfavorable business mix, including larger deal size, and premium freight costs. these declines were partially offset by productivity gains within our support service offerings, recoveries of certain 2019 chinese import tariffs in the fourth quarter of 2020, and the contributions from our higher margin acquisitions.
operating income for the current year decreased 3.5% due to lower gross profit despite higher net sales, partially offset by the benefit of lower operating expenses.

•net cash used in investing activities included the company's acquisition of reflexis in the current year, which consisted of $548 million cash paid, net of cash acquired, as well as $32 million in cash paid for additional long-term investments. the prior year's cash used in investing activities included cash paid for the acquisitions of temptime, profitect and cortexica totaling $262 million, as well as $22 million in cash paid for long-term investments.
•net cash used in financing activities during the current year included common stock repurchases of $200 million, net debt repayments of $40 million and net payments related to share-based compensation plans of $25 million, partially offset by the favorable timing of unremitted cash collections from the servicing of factored receivables of $109 million. net cash used in financing activities during the prior year included to net debt repayments of $312 million, net payments related to share-based compensation plans of $32 million and common stock repurchases of $47 million.

(1)includes leases of manufacturing facilities, distribution centers, sales and administrative offices, equipment and vehicles that are classified as operating leases. the contractual obligations above include future minimum payments, including payments for those periods where renewal options are reasonably certain to be exercised.
(2)includes payments related to obligations under our deferred compensation plan. the deferred compensation plan allows certain members of management and other highly-compensated employees to defer receipt of a portion of their compensation. the amount in "more than 5 years" includes the obligations under the deferred compensation plan to be paid to participants who have not terminated employment, since we cannot estimate the timings of those terminations and withdrawals.
(3)includes payments related to interest on the company's debt, as well as related settlements of interest rate swap agreements. these payments are estimated based on applicable interest rates and margins along with the balance of outstanding debt as of december 31, 2020. future interest payments may increase or decrease based upon fluctuations in market rates and/or the company's borrowing levels.
(4)purchase obligations are for purchases made in the normal course of business to meet operational requirements, primarily raw materials and finished goods. purchase obligations included in the table above are based on quarterly forecasted component and manufacturing requirements and typically provide for fulfillment within agreed upon lead-times and/or commercially standard lead-times for products. the company does not have contractual obligations related to take-or-pay arrangements.
uncertain tax positions of $8 million have been excluded from the table above because we cannot reliably estimate the period of cash settlement, if any, with the respective taxing authorities. see note 16, income taxes in the notes to consolidated financial statements for further information.
critical accounting policies and estimates management prepared the consolidated financial statements of the company under accounting principles generally accepted in the u.s. the application of these principles requires the use of estimates, judgments, and assumptions which affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements. we believe that our estimates, judgments, and assumptions are reasonable based upon available information. our more significant estimates and assumptions include those related to the recognition and measurement of income tax assets and liabilities, development of fair value estimates when measuring the identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed in business combinations, development of reporting unit fair values as part of our annual goodwill impairment testing, and measurement of variable consideration and allocation of transaction price to performance obligations in revenue transactions. see note 2, significant accounting policies in the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional discussion of these items as well as other accounting policies.
new accounting pronouncements on january 1, 2020, the company adopted accounting standards update 2016-13, financial instruments-credit losses (topic 326) - measurement of credit losses on financial instruments, which did not have a significant impact to the company's consolidated financial statements. see note 2, significant accounting policies in the notes to consolidated financial statements for further information related to the company's adoption of this new accounting pronouncement.
non-gaap measures the company has provided reconciliations of the supplemental non-gaap financial measures, as defined under the rules of the securities and exchange commission, presented herein to the most directly comparable financial measures calculated and presented in accordance with gaap.
these supplemental non-gaap financial measures - consolidated organic net sales growth, ait organic net sales growth, and evm organic net sales growth - are presented because our management evaluates our financial results both including and excluding the effects of business acquisitions and foreign currency translation, as applicable. management believes that the supplemental non-gaap financial measures presented provide additional perspective and insights when analyzing the core operating performance of our business from period to period and trends in our historical operating results. these supplemental non-gaap financial measures should not be considered superior to, as a substitute for, or as an alternative to, and should be considered in conjunction with the gaap financial measures presented.

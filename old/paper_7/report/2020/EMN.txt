management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations - critical accounting estimates - impairment of long-lived assets - goodwill" in part ii, item 7 of this annual report, the carrying values of certain assets from acquisitions may, as has been the case for certain acquired assets primarily in the afp segment, be impaired resulting in charges to future earnings; that significant additional indebtedness may constrain the company's ability to access the credit and capital markets at attractive interest rates and favorable terms, which may negatively impact the company's liquidity or ability to pursue certain growth initiatives; that the company may not be able to achieve the cost, revenue, tax, or other "synergies" expected from any acquisition, or that there may be delays in achieving any such synergies; that management's time and effort may be dedicated to the new business resulting in a loss of focus on the successful operation of the company's existing businesses; and that the company may be required to expend significant additional resources in order to integrate any acquired business into eastman or that the integration efforts will not achieve the expected benefits.
risks related to regulatory changes and compliance legislative, regulatory, or voluntary actions could increase the company's future health, safety, and environmental compliance costs.
eastman, its facilities, and its businesses are subject to complex health, safety, and environmental laws, regulations, and related voluntary actions, both in the u.s. and internationally, which require and will continue to require significant expenditures to remain in compliance with such laws, regulations, and voluntary actions. the company's accruals for such costs and associated liabilities are subject to changes in estimates on which the accruals are based. for example, any amount accrued for environmental matters reflects the company's assumptions about remediation requirements at the contaminated site, the nature of the remedy, the outcome of discussions with regulatory agencies and other potentially responsible parties at multi-party sites, and the number of and financial viability of other potentially responsible parties. changes in the estimates on which the accruals are based, unanticipated government enforcement action, or changes in health, safety, environmental, chemical control regulations and actions, and testing requirements could result in higher costs. specifically, future changes in legislation and regulation and related voluntary actions associated with physical impacts of climate change may increase the likelihood that the company's manufacturing facilities will in the future be impacted by carbon requirements, regulation of greenhouse gas emissions, and energy policy, and may result in capital expenditures, increases in costs for raw materials and energy, limitations on raw material and energy source and supply choices, and other direct compliance costs. see "business - eastman chemical company general information - compliance with environmental and other government regulations" in part i, item 1 of this annual report.

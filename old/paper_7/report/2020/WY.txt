management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (md&a) related to the year ended december 31, 2018, refer to this same section in our 2019 annual report on form 10-k as filed with the securities and exchange commission on february 14, 2020.
economic and market conditions affecting our operations overview in mid-march, covid-19 was officially declared a global pandemic by the world health organization and a national emergency was declared by the united states. states and municipalities subsequently began to issue shelter-in-place orders and similar mandates requiring those not engaged in essential activities to remain home. the u.s. department of homeland security designated the forest products industry as an "essential critical infrastructure workforce," which recognizes the importance of timber and wood products operations in supporting critical infrastructure and construction projects and the manufacture of important personal hygiene items. in response to the pandemic, we began taking proactive steps in early march to safeguard the health of our employees. these actions include detailed cleaning and disinfecting procedures, strict processes around social distancing and personal hygiene, clear communication with our employees, contractors, vendors and visitors about our safety protocols, comprehensive guidance for response to any covid-19 diagnoses or exposures in our operations, suspension of all air travel and non-essential meetings, and a directive that employees work from home if feasible.
based on the timing of the outbreak, the economic effects of the pandemic were less pronounced in the first quarter with a drop in u.s. gross domestic product (gdp) of 5 percent. the effects in the second quarter were more acute, with u.s. gdp declining 31 percent. in april, the national unemployment rate soared to a record-high of nearly 15 percent driven by the restrictions imposed in response to the pandemic. unemployment gradually decreased over the following two months to 13 percent in may and 11 percent in june as several states began to reopen their economies and loosen restrictions on certain sectors. the rate continued to decline over the course of the third quarter, ultimately falling below 8 percent in september. u.s. gdp also rebounded significantly in the third quarter with an increase of 33 percent offsetting the record decline in the prior quarter. more recently, economic recovery has leveled off in the fourth quarter, with the unemployment rate plateauing at just below 7 percent for all three months of the quarter. u.s. gdp increased 4 percent in the fourth quarter based on the advance estimate released by the u.s. bureau of economic analysis.
market conditions across our businesses deteriorated rapidly in late first quarter and early second quarter 2020 but quickly rebounded as demand for housing and wood products proved resilient. as the summer progressed, growth in repair and remodel demand and new residential construction activity resulted in demand for wood products that significantly outpaced available supply, and benchmark pricing for our commodity wood products reached record levels. strong demand and pricing for our wood products continued through the back half of 2020. looking ahead to 2021, our market conditions and the strength of the broader u.s. economy will continue to be influenced by the trajectory of u.s. housing activity, covid-19 infections and the nature and extent of future government stimulus.
business outlook the demand for sawlogs within our timberlands segment is directly affected by domestic production of wood-based building products. the strength of the u.s. housing market, especially new residential construction, strongly affects demand in our wood products segment, as does repair and remodeling activity. our timberlands segment, specifically the western region, is also affected by export demand and trade policy.
weyerhaeuser company > 2020 annual report and form 10-k japanese housing starts are a key driver of export log demand in japan. the demand for pulpwood from our timberlands segment is directly affected by the production of pulp, paper and oriented strand board as well as the demand for biofuels, such as pellets made from pulpwood.
full year 2020 new residential construction activity increased moderately compared with the prior year. an estimated 1.38 million housing units were started in 2020, which is 7 percent above the 2019 total of 1.29 million as reported by the u.s. census bureau. single family starts totaled approximately 991 thousand units, a 12 percent improvement over the 2019 total of 888 thousand. multi-family starts totaled approximately 389 thousand units for 2020, which was 3 percent lower than 2019. during 2020, sales of newly built, single family homes increased approximately 19 percent compared to 2019. for 2021, we anticipate approximately 1.45 million housing starts, with the improvement driven by additional single family activity.
in repair and remodel markets, stay at home behavior has bolstered do-it-yourself activity, contributing to increased sales at building supply stores and overall repair and remodeling demand. according to the census bureau advance retail spending report, building material and garden supply store sales increased 13 percent in 2020 compared to 2019, evidencing the strength of the remodeling market over the course of the year.
in u.s. wood product markets, demand and pricing for commodity products increased sharply over the second half of the year, and benchmark pricing for lumber and oriented strand board reached record highs. the random lengths framing lumber composite price averaged $558/mbf in 2020, a 57 percent increase from the 2019 average. the oriented strand board composite indicator price also increased significantly, averaging $467/msf in 2020, a 96 percent increase from the 2019 average.
in western log markets, douglas fir sawlog prices increased 7 percent in 2020 compared with 2019 as reported by risi log lines. in the south, delivered sawlog prices increased slightly compared with 2019 with a 1 percent change in price as reported by timbermart-south. our full year southern timber harvest volumes were 12 percent below 2019 harvest levels, as we reduced 2020 harvest volumes in light of the economic effects of the covid-19 pandemic.
exchange rates, available supply from other countries and trade policy affect our export businesses. in japan, total housing starts year to date through november 2020 declined 10 percent compared to the same period in 2019. a comparable decline was observed for the key post and beam segment. the decline in year over year housing starts is influenced by an increase in the consumption tax which came into effect in october 2019, as well as the impacts of the covid-19 pandemic.
export log prices to china increased by 1 percent on average in 2020 over 2019, as reported by risi log lines. after some initial disruption in the first quarter of the year resulting from covid-19 restrictions, chinese economic activity and log demand grew steadily over the remainder of the year. the volume of logs imported to china from europe increased significantly in 2020 compared to 2019, which negatively affected demand for logs imported from other countries including the u.s.

comparing 2020 with 2019
net sales net sales increased $978 million - 15 percent - primarily due to a $1,167 million increase in wood products net sales to unaffiliated customers, primarily attributable to increased sales realizations across most product lines.
this increase was partially offset by a $152 million decrease in timberlands net sales to unaffiliated customers, primarily due to decreased sales volumes across all regions, as well as a $37 million decrease in real estate & enr net sales to unaffiliated customers, primarily due to a decrease in price per acre sold.
costs of sales costs of sales increased $35 million - 1 percent - primarily due to increased sales volumes across most product lines within our wood products segment and increased basis per real estate acre sold within our real estate & enr segment. these increases were partially offset by decreased log sales volumes within our timberlands segment. refer to additional analysis of fluctuations within our timberlands, real estate, energy and natural resources and wood products discussions below.
operating income operating income increased $1,059 million - 163 percent - primarily due to:
weyerhaeuser company > 2020 annual report and form 10-k

net earnings net earnings increased $873 million - 1,149 percent - primarily due to:
•                                              a $1,059 million increase in operating income, as discussed above, and

•   a $226 million decrease in non-operating pension and other post-employment benefit costs (refer to note 9: pension and other post-employment benefit plans).

net charge to earnings decreased by $223 million - 33 percent - primarily due to:
•   a $226 million decrease in non-operating pension and other post-employment benefit costs primarily attributable to a $202 million decrease in pension settlement charges (refer to note 9: pension and other post-employment benefit plans) and

•   a $63 million decrease in other, primarily due to a reduction in legal charges.
these decreases were partially offset by a $29 million increase in unallocated corporate function and variable compensation expense, a $25 million decrease in interest income and other, as well as a $12 million increase in elimination of intersegment profit in inventory and lifo.
interest expense our net interest expense incurred for the last two years was:
•   $443 million in 2020 and

•      $378 million in 2019.
interest expense increased by $65 million compared to 2019 primarily due to an $80 million increase in charges related to the early extinguishment of debt (refer to note 12: long-term debt, net). this increase was partially offset by $12 million of expense on spe notes recorded during 2019, with no similar activity in 2020 (refer to note 8: related parties).
income taxes as a reit, we generally are not subject to federal corporate level income taxes on reit taxable income that is distributed to shareholders. historical distributions to shareholders, including amounts and tax characteristics, are summarized in the table below.

weyerhaeuser company > 2020 annual report and form 10-k our provision (benefit) for income taxes the last two years was:
•   $185 million in 2020 and

•   $(137) million in 2019.
during 2020, we recorded a $60 million tax benefit related to the noncash pretax settlement charge recorded in connection with our u.s. pension plan.
during 2019, we recorded a $109 million tax benefit related to the noncash pretax settlement charge recorded in connection with our u.s. pension plan and a $17 million tax expense related to an insurance recovery received in connection with prior product remediation efforts.
refer to note 20: income taxes and note 9: pension and other post-employment plans for further information.
liquidity and capital resources we are committed to maintaining an appropriate capital structure that provides flexibility and enables us to protect the interests of our shareholders and meet our obligations to our lenders, while also maintaining access to all major financial markets. as of december 31, 2020, we had $495 million in cash and cash equivalents and $1.5 billion of availability on our line of credit, which expires in january 2025. we believe we have sufficient liquidity to meet our cash requirements for the foreseeable future.
in light of the significant uncertainty regarding the duration and magnitude of the effects of the covid-19 pandemic on our business and our customers, in may 2020, as part of several steps taken to enhance and preserve liquidity and financial flexibility, the board of directors temporarily suspended the quarterly cash dividend.
the board continued to evaluate the company's cash flow, liquidity, leverage, customer demand, market conditions, the broader macroeconomic environment, and other factors in assessing opportunities to reinitiate the quarterly cash dividend. based upon its evaluation of these factors, the board approved the reinitiation of the company's quarterly cash dividend within a new implementation framework in fourth quarter 2020. under this new framework, the company pays a quarterly base cash dividend that began in fourth quarter 2020 that is supported by cash flows from the timberlands and real estate, energy and natural resources segments. the company expects to supplement this base dividend, as appropriate, with a variable return of cash to achieve the company's targeted annual total return of cash to shareholders. we expect this additional return of cash will occur primarily through a variable supplemental cash dividend. in certain circumstances, the company may also utilize opportunistic share repurchase. for fourth quarter 2020, the base cash dividend declared by the board was $0.17 per share. the board will continue to evaluate the cash dividend on a quarterly basis based on this framework and the other factors outlined above.
cash from operations consolidated net cash from operations was:
•   $1,529 million in 2020 and

•        $966 million in 2019.
comparing 2020 with 2019
net cash from operations increased by $563 million, primarily due to increased cash inflows from our business segments. this increase was partially offset by a $178 million increase in cash paid for income taxes.
pension contributions and benefit payments made and expected during 2020, we contributed a total of $30 million to our pension and post-employment plans, compared to a total of $45 million during 2019.
for 2021, we expect to contribute approximately $25 million to our pension and post-employment benefit plans. refer to note 9: pension and other post-employment benefit plans for further information.
investing in our business cash from investing activities includes items such as:
•   acquisitions of property, equipment, timberlands and reforestation and

•   proceeds from sales of assets and operations.
consolidated net cash from investing activities was:
•   $185 million in 2020 and

•      $187 million in 2019.
weyerhaeuser company > 2020 annual report and form 10-k comparing 2020 with 2019
net cash from investing activities decreased by $2 million, primarily due to a $425 million increase in cash paid for timberlands acquisitions (refer to note 4: timberland acquisitions and divestitures). this increase was largely offset by:
•          a $229 million increase in proceeds from the sale of timberlands;

•   a $109 million increase in proceeds received from variable interest entities and
•   a $102 million decrease in capital expenditures for property and equipment.

we expect our capital expenditures for 2021 to be approximately $420 million. the amount we spend on capital expenditures could change due to:
•                future economic conditions,

•   environmental regulations,
•   changes in the composition of our business,
•   weather,
•   timing of equipment purchases and
•   capital needs related to other business opportunities.
financing cash from financing activities includes items such as:
•               issuances and payments of debt,

•   borrowings and payments on our revolving line of credit,
•   proceeds from option exercises and
•   payments for cash dividends and repurchasing stock.
consolidated net cash from financing activities was:
•   $(1,358) million in 2020 and

•   $(1,348) million in 2019.
comparing 2020 with 2019
net cash from financing activities decreased $10 million in 2020, primarily due to:
•       a $987 million increase in net cash used for payments on long-term debt and

•   a $35 million increase in net cash paid related to borrowings on our line of credit.
these changes were largely offset by the following:
•             a $632 million decrease in cash paid for dividends,

•   a $302 million decrease in cash paid related to our monetized spes,
•   a $60 million decrease in cash used for share repurchases and
•   a $20 million increase in cash received from exercise of stock options.
long-term debt our consolidated long-term debt (including current portion) was:
•   $5.5 billion as of december 31, 2020 and

•      $6.1 billion as of december 31, 2019.
the decrease in our long-term debt during 2020 is attributable to the repayment of our $569 million 4.70 percent notes, $325 million 3.25 percent notes and $500 million 4.625 percent notes, partially offset by the issuance of our $750 million 4.00 percent notes due in april 2030.
weyerhaeuser company > 2020 annual report and form 10-k the weighted average interest rate and the weighted average maturity on our long-term debt (excluding line of credit) as of december 31, 2020 were 5.97 percent and 7.5 years, respectively.
see note 12: long-term debt, net for more information.
line of credit in january 2020, we refinanced and extended our $1.5 billion five-year senior unsecured revolving credit facility, which expires in january 2025. as of december 31, 2020, we had no outstanding borrowings on the revolving credit facility. as of december 31, 2019, we had $230 million of outstanding borrowings on the revolving credit facility. we were in compliance with the revolving credit facility covenants as of december 31, 2020 and december 31, 2019.
our revolving credit agreement and our term loan agreement utilize the london inter-bank offered rate (libor) as a basis for one of the interest rate options available to the company to apply to outstanding borrowings. publication of usd libor is expected to cease between january 1, 2022 and july 1, 2023, and we are closely monitoring ongoing market developments in the identification or creation of a widely accepted replacement rate. we have included provisions in our revolving credit agreement that specifically contemplate the transition from libor to a replacement benchmark rate. in july 2020, we amended our term loan agreement primarily to include provisions that address the future discontinuance of libor and set forth the process for transition to an alternate benchmark rate.
as of december 31, 2020, of our $5.5 billion long-term debt, only $225 million in borrowings are governed by debt agreements that utilize libor as one of the alternative applicable rates. we therefore do not believe that the discontinuation of libor as a reference rate in our debt agreements will have a material adverse effect on our financial position or materially affect our interest expense.
our covenants our key covenants include the requirement to maintain:
•   a minimum total adjusted shareholders' equity of $3.0 billion and

•   a defined debt-to-total-capital ratio of 65 percent or less.
our total adjusted shareholders' equity is comprised of:
•                 total shareholders' equity,

•   excluding accumulated other comprehensive income (loss),
•   minus our investment in our unrestricted subsidiaries.
our capitalization is comprised of:
•                  total debt,

•   plus total adjusted shareholders' equity.
as of december 31, 2020, we had:
•   total adjusted shareholders' equity of $9.6 billion and

•   a defined debt-to-total-capital ratio of 36.4 percent.
when calculating compliance in accordance with financial debt covenants as of december 31, 2020 and december 31, 2019, we excluded the full amount of accumulated other comprehensive loss of $822 million and $904 million, respectively. see note 15: shareholders' interest for further information on accumulated other comprehensive loss.
there are no other significant financial debt covenants related to our third-party debt.
credit ratings as of december 31, 2020, our long-term issuer credit rating was bbb and baa2 from s&p and moody's, respectively.
option exercises our cash proceeds from the exercise of stock options were:
•   $33 million in 2020 and

•      $13 million in 2019.
our average stock price was $26.04 and $26.45 in 2020 and 2019, respectively.
dividends we paid cash dividends on common shares of:
•   $381 million in 2020 and

•    $1,013 million in 2019.
the decrease in dividends paid is primarily due to the temporary suspension of our quarterly dividend payments in the second and third quarter of 2020.
weyerhaeuser company > 2020 annual report and form 10-k 48
share repurchases on february 7, 2019, our board of directors approved and announced a new share repurchase program (the 2019 repurchase program) under which we are authorized to repurchase up to $500 million of outstanding shares. we did not repurchase any shares during the year ended december 31, 2020. we repurchased over 2.3 million shares for approximately $60 million (including transaction fees) during the year ended december 31, 2019, under the 2019 repurchase program. there were no unsettled repurchases as of december 31, 2020, or december 31, 2019. for further information on share repurchases see note 15: shareholders' interest.

off-balance sheet arrangements off-balance sheet arrangements have not had - and are not reasonably likely to have - a material effect on our current or future financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. note 8: related parties and note 11: line of credit contain our disclosures of:
•                     surety bonds,

•   letters of credit and
•   information regarding variable interest entities.
environmental matters, legal proceedings and other contingencies see note 14: legal proceedings, commitments and contingencies.
accounting matters critical accounting policies in the preparation of our financial statements we follow established accounting policies and make estimates that affect both the amounts and timing of the recording of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. some of these estimates require judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain. accounting policies whose application may have a significant effect on the reported results of operations and financial position are considered critical accounting policies.
weyerhaeuser company > 2020 annual report and form 10-k in accounting, we base our judgments and estimates on:
•                               historical experience and

•   assumptions we believe are appropriate and reasonable under current circumstances.
actual results, however, may differ from the estimated amounts we have recorded.
our most critical accounting policies relate to our:
•   discount rates for pension and post-employment benefit plans;

•   potential impairments of long-lived assets and
•   contingent liabilities.
details about our other significant accounting policies - what we use and how we estimate - are in note 1: summary of significant accounting policies.
discount rates for pension and post-employment benefit plans discount rates are used to estimate the net present value of our pension and other post-employment plan obligations. these rates are determined at the measurement date by matching current spot rates of high-quality corporate bonds with maturities similar to the timing of expected cash outflows for benefits. the selection of discount rates requires judgment as well as the involvement of actuarial specialists. these specialists assist with selecting yield curves based on published indices for high-quality corporate bonds and projecting the timing and amount of cash flows associated with our obligations to ultimately support our determination of an appropriate discount rate for each plan.
our discount rates as of december 31, 2020 are:
•         2.5 percent for our u.s. pension plans - compared with 3.4 percent at december 31, 2019;

•       2.1 percent for our u.s. post-employment plans - compared with 3.0 percent at december 31, 2019;
•        2.5 percent for our canadian pension plans - compared with 3.1 percent at december 31, 2019 and
•   2.4 percent for our canadian post-employment plans - compared with 3.0 percent at december 31, 2019.
pension expenses for 2021 will be based on the 2.5 percent assumed discount rate for the u.s. pension plan and the canadian pension plan, and the 2.1 percent and 2.4 percent assumed discount rates for the u.s. and canadian post-employment benefit plans, respectively.
our discount rates are important in determining the cost of our plans. a 50 basis point decrease in our discount rate would increase expense or reduce a credit by approximately:
•    $20 million for our u.s. qualified pension plans and

•   $6 million for our canadian registered pension plans.
impairment of long-lived assets we review the carrying value of long-lived assets whenever an event or a change in circumstance indicates that the carrying value of the asset or asset group may not be recoverable through future operations. the carrying value is the original cost, less accumulated depreciation and any past impairments recorded. refer to note 4: timberland acquisitions and divestitures for information on an impairment recognized in 2019.
if we evaluate recoverability, we are required to estimate future cash flows and residual values of the asset or asset group. key assumptions used in developing these estimates would include probability of alternative outcomes, product pricing, raw material cost and product sales.
an impairment occurs when the carrying value of a long-lived asset is greater than the amount that could be recovered from the estimated future cash flows of the asset and greater than fair market value (the amount we could receive if we were to sell the asset). key assumptions used in developing estimates of fair value would include the estimated future cash flows used to assess recoverability, discount rates and probability of alternative outcomes.
contingent liabilities we are subject to lawsuits, investigations and other claims related to environmental, product and other matters, and are required to assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to these matters, as well as the amount or range of potential loss.
weyerhaeuser company > 2020 annual report and form 10-k we record contingent liabilities when:
•   it becomes probable that a loss has been incurred and

•   the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated.
assessing probability of loss and estimating the amount of loss can require analysis of multiple factors, such as:
•                               historical experience,

•   evaluations of relevant legal and environmental authorities and regulations,
•   judgments about the potential actions of third-party claimants and courts and
•   consideration of potential environmental remediation methods.
in addition to contingent liabilities recorded for probable losses, we disclose contingent liabilities when there is a reasonable possibility that a loss may have been incurred.
recorded contingent liabilities are based on the best information available and actual losses in any future period are inherently uncertain. if estimated probable future losses or actual losses exceed our recorded liability for such claims, we record additional charges. these exposures and proceedings can be significant and the ultimate negative outcomes could be material to our operating results or cash flows in any given quarter or year. see note 14: legal proceedings, commitments and contingencies for more information.
prospective accounting pronouncements a summary of prospective accounting pronouncements is in note 1: summary of significant accounting policies.
performance measures we use adjusted ebitda as a key performance measure to evaluate the performance of the consolidated company and our business segments. this measure should not be considered in isolation from, and is not intended to represent an alternative to, our results reported in accordance with u.s. generally accepted accounting principles (u.s. gaap). however, we believe adjusted ebitda provides meaningful supplemental information for our investors about our operating performance, better facilitates period to period comparisons and is widely used by analysts, lenders, rating agencies and other interested parties. our definition of adjusted ebitda may be different from similarly titled measures reported by other companies. adjusted ebitda, as we define it, is operating income adjusted for depreciation, depletion, amortization, basis of real estate sold and special items.

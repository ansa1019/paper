item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview ross stores, inc. operates two brands of off-price retail apparel and home fashion stores-ross dress for less® ("ross") and dd's discounts®. ross is the largest off-price apparel and home fashion chain in the united states with 1,585 locations in 40 states, the district of columbia, and guam, as of january 30, 2021. ross offers first-quality, in-season, name brand and designer apparel, accessories, footwear, and home fashions for the entire family at savings of 20% to 60% off department and specialty store regular prices every day. we also operate 274 dd's discounts stores in 21 states as of january 30, 2021 that feature a more moderately-priced assortment of first-quality, in-season, name brand apparel, accessories, footwear, and home fashions for the entire family at savings of 20% to 70% off moderate department and discount store regular prices every day.
our primary objective is to pursue and refine our existing off-price strategies to maintain and improve both profitability and financial returns over the long term. in establishing appropriate growth targets for our business, and considering the pace and magnitude of the economic recovery post the covid-19 pandemic, we are closely monitoring market share trends for the off-price industry and believe our share gains will continue to be driven mainly by continued focus on value and convenience by consumers. our merchandise and operational strategies are designed to take advantage of the expanding market share of the off-price industry as well as the ongoing customer demand for name brand fashions for the family and home at compelling discounts every day.
we refer to our fiscal years ended january 30, 2021, february 1, 2020, and february 2, 2019 as fiscal 2020, fiscal 2019, and fiscal 2018, respectively.
effects of the covid-19 pandemic on our business the united states and other countries are experiencing an ongoing, major global health pandemic related to the outbreak of a novel strain of coronavirus, covid-19, that started at the beginning of 2020. governmental authorities in affected regions have taken, and continue to take, dramatic actions in an effort to slow down the spread of the disease. like other retailers across the country, we temporarily closed all our store locations, our distribution centers, and our buying and corporate offices for a significant part of our first and second fiscal quarters. we also instituted "work from home" measures for many of our associates. our closures took effect march 20, 2020.
all our distribution centers were reopened by the end of may 2020. the vast majority of our store locations were open and operating by the end of june 2020, and remained open throughout the remainder of fiscal 2020. while open, many of our stores were operating on shorter hours and under mandated occupancy restrictions for periods of time as compared to the prior year.
the covid-19 pandemic and the related economic disruption had a material adverse impact on our results of operations, financial position, and cash flows for fiscal 2020. the consolidated results presented in this report reflect the significant revenue decline and other impacts from our temporary store closures (for approximately half of the first quarter and 25 percent of the second quarter), mandated occupancy restrictions, and reduced operating hours. our core business results improved during the second half of fiscal 2020; however, upsurges of covid-19 in the fourth quarter, especially in california, our largest state, resulted in reduced customer traffic and slowed the pace of recovery. while vaccines have become available and a steadily increasing portion of the u.s. population is being vaccinated, it will take time for those efforts to reach levels that permit a relaxation of the social distancing restrictions. we expect the material adverse effects from the pandemic to continue through fiscal 2021 and potentially beyond.
the temporary closure of all our stores during much of the first two fiscal quarters significantly impacted our ability to sell the seasonal inventory then on hand in a timely manner. as we reopened our stores and resumed operations in the middle of the second quarter, a significant portion of the merchandise in our stores was aged and out of season. we took deep markdowns to sell through this inventory. during the initial reopenings, sales were ahead of our conservative plans, as we benefited from pent-up consumer demand and aggressive markdowns. in the weeks after reopening, sales trends were negatively affected by depleted store inventory levels while we were ramping up our buying and distribution capabilities. during the third quarter, sales improved substantially compared to the second quarter. this was driven by several factors, including an improvement in our merchandise assortments, a later back-to-school season, stronger performance in our larger markets, and our return to more normal store hours. our fourth quarter sales remained suppressed due to the negative impact from the upsurge in the virus that resulted in reduced customer traffic and more stringent occupancy and store operating hours restrictions.
the ongoing effect of the covid-19 pandemic on consumer behavior and spending patterns remains highly uncertain. despite the initial surge in customer demand as our stores first reopened, we expect customer demand to be generally suppressed for an extended period of time. in addition, there have been recent resurgences in the spread of covid-19 and new virus variants throughout the united states, which may also recur in the future, in one or more regions, and which have and could require our stores and distribution centers to temporarily close again nationally, regionally, or in specific locations. these closures would negatively impact our future revenue and operations.
in response to the covid-19 pandemic, we incurred various costs to reopen our stores and distribution centers, and we incurred additional operating costs for processes and procedures to facilitate social distancing, to enhance cleaning and sanitation activities, and to provide personal protective equipment to our associates. these actions, combined with various other actions taken to reduce costs, resulted in approximately $130 million of additional net costs in fiscal 2020. we expect our operating costs to remain elevated related to our continuing response to the covid-19 pandemic.
to preserve our financial liquidity and enhance our financial flexibility, we borrowed $800 million from our revolving credit facility in march 2020, completed a $2.0 billion senior notes offering in april 2020, and entered into a new $500 million 364-day senior revolving credit facility in may 2020. in the third quarter of fiscal 2020, we refinanced $775 million in aggregate principal amount of higher interest senior notes with the issuance of $1.0 billion in aggregate principal amount of lower interest rate senior notes. this action resulted in a refinancing charge of approximately $240 million in the third quarter, but will significantly reduce our annual interest expense and total cash outlays over the life of the debt. in addition to refinancing the senior notes, we took several other actions during the third quarter, to reduce our ongoing debt costs, including repayment of the $800 million revolving credit facility and termination of the undrawn $500 million 364-day senior revolving credit facility.
we suspended our stock repurchase program in march 2020 and temporarily suspended quarterly dividends in may 2020, and we took measures to reduce our expenses, inventory receipts, and capital expenditures. beginning april 5, 2020, we implemented temporary furloughs for a large portion of our hourly store and distribution center and other associates in our buying and corporate offices who could not work productively while our stores and distribution centers were closed. employee health benefits for eligible associates continued during the temporary furlough at no cost to the impacted associates. we also reduced payroll expenses through temporary salary reductions for senior executives and other personnel, which remained in effect until may 24, 2020, when more than half of our stores had reopened. in conjunction with these payroll expense reduction measures, effective april 1, 2020, the non-employee members of our board of directors suspended the cash elements of their director compensation, which remained in effect until august 2020.
in may 2020, in connection with the phased reopening of our store and distribution center locations, we began recalling many of our furloughed associates, as they were able to resume productive work. as of our third quarter, the majority of these associates had returned to work.
also in may 2020, we suspended rent payments associated with the leases for our temporarily closed stores. during fiscal 2020, we negotiated rent deferrals and/or rent abatements for a significant number of our stores. the repayment of the deferrals will be at later dates, primarily in fiscal 2021. we have recorded accruals for rent payment deferrals and have recorded rent abatements as a reduction of variable lease costs.
given the unprecedented impact the covid-19 pandemic has had on our business, and the continued uncertainty surrounding the covid-19 pandemic, including its unknown duration and future severity, the potential for resurgences and new virus variants, and the unknown overall impact on consumer demand and store productivity, we expect that impacts from the covid-19 pandemic and the related cost increases and economic disruption may have a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows in fiscal 2021 and potentially beyond.

given the temporary store closures resulting from the covid-19 pandemic, the comparable store sales metric for fiscal 2020 is not meaningful.
represents stores that have been open for more than 14 complete months.
stores. total stores open at the end of fiscal 2020, 2019, and 2018 were 1,859, 1,805, and 1,717, respectively. the number of stores at the end of fiscal 2020, 2019, and 2018 increased by 3%, 5%, and 6% from the respective prior years. in response to the impacts from the covid-19 pandemic, we reduced our pace of new store openings for fiscal 2020. our longer term strategy is to open additional stores based on market penetration, local demographic characteristics, competition, expected store profitability, and the ability to leverage overhead expenses. we continually evaluate opportunistic real estate acquisitions and opportunities for potential new store locations. we also evaluate our current store locations and determine store closures based on similar criteria.

sales. sales for fiscal 2020 decreased $3.5 billion, or 21.9%, compared to the prior year. this was primarily due to the negative impact from store closures during the march 2020 to june 2020 period, the negative impact on customer demand from the covid-19 pandemic, mandated occupancy restrictions, and reduced store operating hours during the remainder of fiscal 2020. we opened 54 net new stores during 2020. the sales from these new stores partially offset the overall sales decline.
sales for fiscal 2019 increased $1.1 billion, or 7.0%, compared to the prior year due to the opening of 88 net new stores during 2019 and a 3% increase in sales from comparable stores.

we intend to address the competitive climate for off-price apparel and home goods by pursuing and refining our existing strategies and by continuing to strengthen our merchant organization, diversify our merchandise mix, and more fully develop our systems to improve our merchandise offerings.
our historic strategies and store expansion program have contributed to our sales gains in the past. however, given the impacts from the covid-19 pandemic on our results for fiscal 2020, and the significant ongoing impacts and uncertainties, including the unknown overall impact on consumer demand and shopping behavior, the unknown duration of the pandemic, and potential responses to it (which may require stores and distribution centers to close again nationally, regionally, or in specific locations), we cannot be sure that our strategies and resumption of our store expansion program will result in a continuation of our historical sales growth or in a recovery of, or an increase in, net earnings.
cost of goods sold. cost of goods sold in fiscal 2020 decreased $1.7 billion compared to the prior year mainly due to the lower sales from the temporary closure of all store locations (starting on march 20, 2020 through a portion of the second quarter of fiscal 2020), and ensuing negative impact on customer demand from the covid-19 pandemic after our store reopenings, as well as lower costs from the temporary furlough of most hourly associates in our distribution centers and some associates in our buying offices. these decreases were partially offset by higher markdowns used to clear aged and seasonal inventory, higher distribution costs primarily due to increased wages and higher freight costs due to industry-wide supply chain congestion, added expenditures for covid-19 related measures, and higher occupancy costs from the opening of 54 net new stores during 2020. as we enter 2021, we expect higher supply chain costs from the industry-wide congestion to continue through fiscal 2021, along with higher costs from increases in wages we implemented in the second half of 2020.
cost of goods sold in fiscal 2019 increased $809.9 million compared to the prior year, mainly due to increased sales from the opening of 88 net new stores during the year and a 3% increase in sales from comparable stores.
cost of goods sold as a percentage of sales for fiscal 2019 increased approximately 35 basis points from the prior year, primarily due to a 35 basis point increase in distribution expenses and a 15 basis point increase in freight costs. these increases were partially offset by a 10 basis point improvement in merchandise gross margin and a five basis point reduction in buying costs.
selling, general and administrative expenses. for fiscal 2020, selling, general and administrative expenses ("sg&a") increased $146.6 million compared to the prior year, primarily due to approximately $240 million in long-term debt refinancing costs, covid-related expenses (including for supplies, cleaning, and payroll related to additional safety protocols), and payments to associates while our stores were closed (net of employee retention credits under the coronavirus aid, relief, and economic security act (the "cares act")), partially offset by payroll-related cost reduction measures in response to the covid-19 pandemic (including the temporary furlough of most hourly associates in our stores during closure periods, and some associates in our corporate offices), reductions in non-business critical operating expenses, and lower store operating expenses on lower sales. as we enter 2021, we expect our operating costs to continue to reflect ongoing covid-related expenses and also higher wages.
for fiscal 2019, sg&a increased $140.2 million compared to the prior year, mainly due to increased store operating costs reflecting the opening of 88 net new stores during the year. sg&a as a percentage of sales for fiscal 2019 decreased by approximately 10 basis points compared to the prior year primarily due to leverage on higher sales.
interest expense (income), net. in fiscal 2020, net interest expense increased by $101.5 million compared to 2019 primarily due to higher interest expense on long-term debt due to the issuance of senior notes in april 2020 and october 2020 (net of repurchase of senior notes), lower interest income due to lower interest rates, and higher interest expense on short-term debt due to the draw down on our $800 million revolving credit facility in march 2020 (which was subsequently repaid in october 2020), partially offset by higher capitalized interest primarily related to the construction of our brookshire, texas distribution center.
in fiscal 2019, net interest income improved by $7.9 million compared to 2018 primarily due to lower interest expense on long-term debt due to the repayment of the series a 6.38% unsecured senior notes in december 2018 and higher capitalized interest primarily related to the construction of our brookshire, texas distribution center.
the table below shows the components of interest expense and income for fiscal 2020, 2019, and 2018:

taxes on earnings. our effective tax rates for fiscal 2020, 2019, and 2018 were approximately 20%, 23%, and 23%, respectively. the effective tax rate represents the applicable combined federal and state statutory rates reduced by the federal benefit of state taxes deductible on federal returns. the effective rate is impacted by changes in tax law and accounting guidance, location of new stores, level of earnings, tax effects associated with share-based compensation, and the resolution of tax positions with various tax authorities.
in fiscal 2019, we resolved uncertain tax positions with a state tax authority. as a result, we recognized a tax benefit of approximately $10.0 million in the consolidated statement of earnings. in fiscal 2018, we resolved uncertain tax positions related to fiscal 2015 with the internal revenue service. as a result, we recognized a tax benefit of approximately $26.0 million in the consolidated statement of earnings.
on march 27, 2020, the cares act was signed into law. the cares act made several significant changes to business tax provisions including modifications for net operating losses, employee retention credits, and deferral of employer payroll tax payments. on december 27, 2020, the consolidated appropriations act of 2021 ("caa") was signed into law. the caa made several changes to business tax provisions including increasing and extending the employee retention credits through june 30, 2021 and extending certain employment-related tax credits through december 31, 2025.
net earnings. net earnings as a percentage of sales for fiscal 2020 were lower than in fiscal 2019, primarily due to higher cost of goods sold, higher sg&a expenses, and higher interest expense. net earnings as a percentage of sales for fiscal 2019 were lower compared to fiscal 2018, primarily due to higher cost of goods sold, partially offset by lower sg&a expenses and higher interest income.
earnings per share. diluted earnings per share in fiscal 2020 was $0.24, compared to $4.60 in the prior year. the lower diluted earnings per share in fiscal 2020 was primarily attributable to lower sales due to the closing of all our store locations starting on march 20, 2020 through a portion the second quarter of fiscal 2020 and the negative impact on customer demand from the covid-19 pandemic, higher markdowns to clear aged and seasonal inventory, long-term debt refinancing costs, payments to associates while our stores were closed (net of employee retention credits under the cares act), and higher expenditures for covid-19 related measures.
diluted earnings per share in fiscal 2019 was $4.60, which included a per share benefit of approximately $0.02 primarily related to the favorable resolution of a tax matter, compared to $4.26 in the prior year, which included a per share benefit of approximately $0.07 from the favorable resolution of a tax matter.
financial condition liquidity and capital resources as previously noted, the united states and other countries are experiencing a major global health pandemic related to the outbreak of a novel strain of coronavirus, covid-19 that started at the beginning of 2020. governmental authorities in affected regions have taken, and continue to take, dramatic actions in an effort to slow down the spread of the disease. similar to other retailers across the country, we temporarily closed all store locations, our distribution centers, and our buying and corporate offices, effective march 20, 2020 through may 14, 2020, when we began a phased process of resuming operations. all our distribution centers were reopened by the end of may 2020. the vast majority of our store locations were open and operating by the end of june 2020, and remained open throughout the remainder of fiscal 2020, though many of our stores were operating on shorter hours and under mandated occupancy restrictions for periods of time, compared to the prior year.
to preserve our financial liquidity and enhance our financial flexibility, we borrowed $800 million from our revolving credit facility in march 2020, completed a $2.0 billion senior notes offering in april 2020, and entered into a new $500 million 364-day senior revolving credit facility in may 2020. in the third quarter of fiscal 2020, we refinanced $775 million in aggregate principal amount of higher interest senior notes with the issuance of $1.0 billion in aggregate principal amount of lower interest rate senior notes. this action resulted in a refinancing charge of approximately $240 million in the third quarter, but will significantly reduce our annual interest expense and total cash outlays over the life of the debt. in addition to refinancing the senior notes refinancing, we took several other actions during the third quarter, to reduce our ongoing debt costs, including repayment of the $800 million revolving credit facility and termination of the undrawn $500 million 364-day senior revolving credit facility.
we suspended our stock repurchase program in march 2020 and temporarily suspended quarterly dividends in may 2020, and we took measures to reduce our expenses, inventory receipts, and capital expenditures. beginning april 5, 2020, we implemented temporary furloughs for a large portion of our hourly store and distribution center and other associates in our buying and corporate offices who could not work productively while our stores and distribution centers were closed. employee health benefits for eligible associates continued during the temporary furlough at no cost to the impacted associates. we also reduced payroll expenses through temporary salary reductions for senior executives and other personnel, which remained in effect until may 24, 2020, when more than half of our stores had reopened. in conjunction with these payroll expense reduction measures, effective april 1, 2020, the non-employee members of our board of directors suspended the cash elements of their director compensation, which remained in effect until august 2020.
also in may 2020, we suspended rent payments associated with the leases for our temporarily closed stores. during fiscal 2020, we negotiated rent deferrals and/or rent abatements for a significant number of our stores. the repayment of the deferrals will be at later dates, primarily in fiscal 2021. we recorded accruals for rent payment deferrals and recorded rent abatements as a reduction of variable lease costs.
we ended fiscal 2020 with over $5.6 billion in liquidity, which consists of $4.8 billion unrestricted cash balances and the $800 million available under our revolving credit facility.
historically, our primary sources of funds for our business activities have been cash flows from operations and short-term trade credit. our primary ongoing cash requirements are for merchandise inventory purchases, payroll, operating and variable lease costs, taxes, and for capital expenditures in connection with new and existing stores, and investments in distribution centers, information systems, and buying and corporate offices. we also use cash to pay dividends, to repay debt as it becomes due, and to repurchase stock under active stock repurchase programs.
due to the covid-19 pandemic and related economic disruptions, and with the possibility that some of our stores, distribution centers, and other facilities may need to temporarily close again, or continue on reduced operating hours and/or capacity restrictions, as a result of government mandates, we anticipate potential interruptions to our cash flows from operations. we anticipate that we will be required to rely more on our cash reserves and we expect to carefully monitor and manage our cash position in light of ongoing conditions and levels of operations.

operating activities net cash provided by operating activities was $2.2 billion in fiscal 2020. this was primarily driven by higher accounts payable due to extended payment terms, lower merchandise receipts as we closely managed inventory levels and used packaway inventory to replenish our stores, and net earnings excluding non-cash expenses for depreciation and amortization. this was partially offset by the lower net earnings due to lower sales from the temporary closing of all store locations starting on march 20, 2020 through a portion of the second quarter, and the negative impact on customer demand from the covid-19 pandemic. net cash provided by operating activities was $2.2 billion and $2.1 billion in fiscal 2019 and 2018, respectively, and was primarily driven by net earnings excluding non-cash expenses for depreciation and amortization and for deferred taxes.
the increase in cash flow from operating activities in fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019 was primarily driven by higher accounts payable leverage. the increase in cash flow from operating activities in fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018 was primarily driven by higher earnings and the timing of merchandise receipts and related payments versus the prior year. accounts payable leverage (defined as accounts payable divided by merchandise inventory) was 150%, 71%, and 67% as of january 30, 2021, february 1, 2020, and february 2, 2019, respectively. the increase in accounts payable leverage in fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019 was primarily driven by lower packaway and in-store inventory and extended payment terms. the increase in accounts payable leverage in fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018 was primarily driven by timing of merchandise receipts and related payments versus the prior year.
as a regular part of our business, packaway inventory levels will vary over time based on availability of compelling merchandise purchase opportunities in the marketplace and our decisions on the timing for release of that inventory. packaway merchandise is purchased with the intent that it will be stored in our warehouses until a later date. the timing of the release of packaway inventory to our stores is principally driven by the product mix and seasonality of the merchandise, and its relation to our store merchandise assortment plans. as such, the aging of packaway varies by merchandise category and seasonality of purchase, but in normal times and historically, packaway remains in storage less than six months. we expect to continue to take advantage of packaway inventory opportunities to maximize our ability to deliver bargains to our customers.
changes in packaway inventory levels impact our operating cash flow. at the end of fiscal 2020, packaway inventory was 38% of total inventory compared to 46% at the end of both fiscal 2019 and 2018.
investing activities net cash used in investing activities was $405.4 million, $555.0 million, and $410.4 million in fiscal 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively. the decrease in cash used for investing activities in fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019 was primarily due to a reduction in our capital expenditures. the increase in cash used for investing activities in fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018 was primarily due to an increase in our capital expenditures.
the decrease in capital expenditures in fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019 was primarily due to our actions to preserve our financial liquidity in response to the covid-19 pandemic and related economic disruptions. the increase in capital expenditures in fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018 was primarily due to investments in our distribution centers, and information technology infrastructure investments for our stores, buying, corporate offices, and transportation. we opened 66, 98, and 99 new stores in fiscal 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively.
in fiscal 2020, 2019, and 2018, our capital expenditures were $405.4 million, $555.5 million, and $413.9 million, respectively. our capital expenditures included costs to build, expand, and improve distribution centers (primarily related to the ongoing construction of our brookshire, texas distribution center); open new stores and improve existing stores; and for various other expenditures related to our information technology systems, buying, and corporate offices.
our capital expenditures over the last three years are set forth in the table below:
($ millions)                                                        2020                       2019                       2018

capital expenditures for fiscal 2021 are projected to be approximately $700 million. our planned capital expenditures for fiscal 2021 are expected to be used for continued construction of our brookshire, texas distribution center, costs for fixtures and leasehold improvements to open planned new ross and dd's discounts stores, investments in certain information technology systems, and for various other needed expenditures related to our stores, distribution centers, buying, and corporate offices. we expect to fund capital expenditures with available cash. the increase in our planned capital expenditures from fiscal 2020 are primarily driven by the continued construction of our brookshire, texas distribution center and the resumption of certain projects that were deferred from fiscal 2020.
financing activities net cash provided by financing activities was $1.7 billion in fiscal 2020. net cash used in financing activities was $1.7 billion and $1.5 billion in fiscal 2019 and 2018, respectively. the increase in cash provided by financing activities for fiscal 2020, compared to fiscal 2019, was primarily due to the completion of our public debt offerings, net of repurchase and refinancing costs, and the suspension of our share repurchases and dividends in the second quarter of 2020.
in july 2019, we entered into a new $800 million unsecured revolving credit facility, which replaced our previous $600 million unsecured revolving credit facility. this current credit facility expires in july 2024, and contains a $300 million sublimit for issuance of standby letters of credit. the facility also contains an option allowing us to increase the size of our revolving credit facility by up to an additional $300 million, with the agreement of the lenders. interest on borrowings under this facility is based on libor (or an alternate benchmark rate, if libor is no longer available) plus an applicable margin and is payable quarterly and upon maturity. the revolving credit facility may be extended, at our option, for up to two additional one-year periods, subject to customary conditions.
in march 2020, we borrowed $800 million under our revolving credit facility. interest on the loan was based on libor plus 0.875% (or 1.76%).
in may 2020, we amended the $800 million revolving credit facility (the "amended credit facility") to temporarily suspend for the second and third quarters of fiscal 2020 the consolidated adjusted debt to ebitdar ratio financial covenant, and to apply a transitional modification to that ratio effective in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020. the amended credit facility also established a new temporary minimum liquidity requirement effective for the first quarter of fiscal 2020 and through the end of april 2021. as of january 30, 2021, we were in compliance with these amended covenants.
in october 2020, we repaid in full the $800 million we borrowed under the unsecured revolving credit facility. as a result, we currently have no borrowings or standby letters of credit outstanding under this facility, and the $800 million credit facility remains in place and available.
in may 2020, we also entered into an additional $500 million 364-day senior revolving credit facility which was scheduled to expire in april 2021. in october 2020, we terminated this senior revolving credit facility. we had no borrowings under that credit facility at any time.
in april 2020, we issued an aggregate of $2.0 billion in unsecured senior notes in four tenors as follows: $700 million of 4.600% senior notes due april 2025, $400 million of 4.700% senior notes due april 2027, $400 million of 4.800% senior notes due april 2030, and $500 million of 5.450% senior notes due april 2050.
in october 2020, we accepted for purchase approximately $775 million in aggregate principal amount of senior notes pursuant to cash tender offers as follows: $351 million of the 2050 notes, $266 million of the 2030 notes, and $158 million of the 2027 notes. we paid approximately $1.003 billion in aggregate consideration (including transaction costs, and accrued and unpaid interest) and recorded an approximately $240 million loss on the early extinguishment for the accepted notes.
in october 2020, we also issued an aggregate of $1.0 billion in unsecured senior notes in two tenors as follows: 0.875% senior notes due april 2026 (the "2026 notes") with an aggregate principal amount of $500 million and 1.875% senior notes due april 2031 (the "2031 notes") with an aggregate principal amount of $500 million. cash proceeds, net of discounts and other issuance costs, were approximately $987.2 million. we used the net proceeds from the offering of the 2026 and 2031 notes to fund the purchase of the accepted notes from our tender offers.
in june 2020, we amended the covenants associated with the $65 million outstanding series b unsecured senior notes. the amended covenants are consistent with the corresponding covenants in our existing revolving credit facility. as of january 30, 2021, we were in compliance with these covenants.
on december 13, 2018, we repaid at maturity the $85 million principal amount of the series a 6.38% unsecured senior notes.
in march 2019, our board of directors approved a two-year $2.55 billion stock repurchase program through fiscal 2020. due to the economic uncertainty stemming from the severe impact of the covid-19 pandemic, we suspended our stock repurchase program in march 2020, at which time we had repurchased $1.407 billion under the $2.55 billion stock repurchase program. we do not plan on making additional purchases until further notice.
in february 2017, our board of directors approved a two-year $1.75 billion stock repurchase program through fiscal 2018. in march 2018, our board of directors approved an increase in the stock repurchase authorization for fiscal 2018 by $200 million to $1.075 billion, up from the previously available $875 million.
we repurchased 1.2 million, 12.3 million, and 12.5 million shares of common stock for aggregate purchase prices of approximately $132 million, $1,275 million, and $1,075 million in fiscal 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively. we also acquired 0.5 million, 0.6 million, and 0.7 million shares in fiscal 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively, of treasury stock from our employee stock equity compensation programs, for aggregate purchase prices of approximately $45.2 million, $60.7 million, and $54.4 million during fiscal 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively.
on march 2, 2021, our board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.285 per common share, payable on march 31, 2021, resuming our payment of quarterly dividends. our most recent prior quarterly dividend was a cash dividend of $0.285 per common share declared by our board of directors in march 2020. in may 2020, we temporarily suspended our quarterly dividends, due to the economic uncertainty stemming from the covid-19 pandemic. our board of directors declared cash dividends of $0.255 per common share in march, may, august, and november 2019, and cash dividends of $0.225 per common share in march, may, august, and november 2018.
during fiscal 2020, 2019, and 2018, we paid dividends of $101.4 million, $369.8 million, and $337.2 million, respectively.
short-term trade credit represents a significant source of financing for our merchandise inventory. trade credit arises from customary payment terms and trade practices with our vendors. we regularly review the adequacy of credit available to us from all sources. due to the covid-19 pandemic and related economic disruptions, we face added uncertainty about the levels of trade credit we can maintain and liquidity available from sales of merchandise.
during fiscal 2020, our liquidity and capital requirements were provided by available cash and cash flows from operations, and our long-term debt financing. during fiscal 2019 and 2018, our liquidity and capital requirements were provided by available cash and cash flows from operations.
the covid-19 pandemic and related economic disruptions, including the temporary closure of all of our store locations effective march 20, 2020 through a portion of the second quarter, continue to create significant uncertainty and challenges. we believe that existing cash balances, our bank credit facility, and trade credit are adequate to meet our operating, investing, and financing needs for at least the next 12 months.

standby letters of credit and collateral trust. we use standby letters of credit outside of our revolving credit facility in addition to a funded trust to collateralize some of our insurance obligations. we also use standby letters of credit outside of our revolving credit facility to collateralize some of our trade payable obligations. as of january 30, 2021 and february 1, 2020, we had $15.3 million and $4.2 million, respectively, in standby letters of credit outstanding, and $56.1 million and $56.0 million, respectively, in a collateral trust. the standby letters of credit are collateralized by restricted cash and the collateral trust consists of restricted cash, cash equivalents, and investments.
trade letters of credit. we had $16.3 million and $11.2 million in trade letters of credit outstanding at january 30, 2021 and february 1, 2020, respectively.
effects of inflation or deflation. we do not consider the effects of inflation or deflation to be material to our financial position and results of operations.
other critical accounting policies the preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires our management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts. these estimates and assumptions are evaluated on an ongoing basis and are based on historical experience and on various other factors that management believes to be reasonable. we believe the following critical accounting policies describe the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements and are not intended to be a comprehensive list of all of our accounting policies.
in many cases, the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by generally accepted accounting principles ("gaap"), with no need for management's judgment in their application. there are also areas in which management's judgment in selecting one alternative accounting principle over another would not produce a materially different result. see our audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto under item 8 in this annual report on form 10-k, which contain descriptions of our accounting policies and other disclosures required by gaap.
merchandise inventory. our merchandise inventory is stated at the lower of cost (determined using a weighted-average basis) or net realizable value. we purchase inventory that can either be shipped to stores or processed as packaway merchandise with the intent that it will be warehoused and released to stores at a later date. the timing of the release of packaway inventory to our stores is principally driven by the product mix and seasonality of the merchandise, and its relation to the company's store merchandise assortment plans. as such, the aging of packaway varies by merchandise category and seasonality of purchase, but typically packaway remains in storage less than six months. packaway inventory accounted for approximately 38%, 46%, and 46% of total inventories as of january 30, 2021, february 1, 2020, and february 2, 2019, respectively. merchandise inventory includes acquisition, processing, and storage costs related to packaway inventory.
included in the carrying value of our merchandise inventory is a provision for shortage. the shortage reserve is based on historical shortage rates as evaluated through our annual physical merchandise inventory counts and cycle counts. if actual market conditions, markdowns, or shortage are less favorable than those projected by us, or if sales of the merchandise inventory are more difficult than anticipated, additional merchandise inventory write-downs may be required.
lease accounting. as our leases generally do not provide an implicit discount rate; we use the estimated collateralized incremental borrowing rate based on information available at the lease commencement date in determining the present value of lease payments for use in the calculation of the operating lease liabilities and right-of-use assets. this rate is determined using a portfolio approach based on the risk-adjusted rate of interest and requires estimates and assumptions including credit rating, credit spread, and adjustments for the impact of collateral. we believe that this is the rate we would have to pay to borrow an amount equal to the lease payments on a collateralized basis over a similar lease term. operating lease liabilities and corresponding right-of-use assets include options to extend lease terms that are reasonably certain of being exercised. we do not record a lease liability and corresponding right-of-use asset for leases with terms of 12 months or less, and account for lease and non-lease components as a single lease component. our lease portfolio is comprised of operating leases with the lease cost recorded on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
prior to our adoption of accounting standards codification ("asc") 842 in the beginning of fiscal 2019, when a lease contained "rent holidays" or required fixed escalations of the minimum lease payments, we recorded rental expense on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease and the difference between the average rental amount was charged to expense and the amount payable under the lease was recorded as deferred rent. we began recording rent expense on the lease possession date. tenant improvement allowances were amortized over the lease term. changes in deferred rent and tenant improvement allowances were included as a component of operating activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows.
insurance obligations. we use a combination of insurance and self-insurance for a number of risk management activities, including workers' compensation, general liability, and employee-related health care benefits. our self-insurance and deductible liability is determined actuarially, based on claims filed and an estimate of claims incurred but not reported. should a greater amount of claims occur compared to what is estimated or the costs of medical care increase beyond what was anticipated, our recorded reserves may not be sufficient and additional charges could be required.

item 7.   management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations.
forward-looking statements the following discussion and analysis of the results of operations and financial condition of franklin resources, inc. ("franklin") and its subsidiaries (collectively, the "company") should be read in conjunction with the "forward-looking statements" disclosure set forth in part i and the "risk factors" set forth in item 1a of part i of this annual report on form 10‐k (this "annual report") and in any more recent filings with the u.s. securities and exchange commission (the "sec"), each of which describe our risks, uncertainties and other important factors in more detail.
overview we are a global investment management organization and derive our operating revenues and net income from providing investment management and related services in jurisdictions worldwide for investors in our investment products, which include our sponsored funds, as well as institutional and high-net-worth separate accounts, retail separately managed account programs, sub-advised products, and other investment vehicles. in addition to investment management, our services include fund administration, sales and distribution, and shareholder servicing. we may perform services directly or through third parties. we offer our services and products under our various distinct brand names, including, but not limited to, franklin®, templeton®, legg mason®, balanced equity management®, benefit street partners®, darby®, edinburgh partnerstm, fiduciary trusttm, franklin bissett®, franklin mutual series®, k2® and libertyshares®. in addition, pursuant to our acquisition of legg mason, inc. ("legg mason") on july 31, 2020, we acquired certain additional brand names including brandywine global investment management®, clarion partners®, clearbridge investments®, martin currie®, qs investors®, royce® investment partners and western asset management company®. we offer a broad product mix of fixed income, equity, multi-asset, alternative and cash management asset classes and solutions that meet a wide variety of specific investment goals and needs for individual and institutional investors. we also provide sub-advisory services to certain investment products sponsored by other companies which may be sold to investors under the brand names of those other companies or on a co-branded basis.
the level of our revenues depends largely on the level and relative mix of assets under management ("aum"). as noted in the "risk factors" section set forth above in item 1a of part i of this annual report, the amount and mix of our aum are subject to significant fluctuations and can negatively impact our revenues and income. the level of our revenues also depends on mutual fund sales, the number of shareholder transactions and accounts, and the fees charged for our services, which are based on contracts with our funds and our clients. these arrangements could change in the future.
as further noted in the "risk factors" section, the outbreak and spread of contagious diseases such as the coronavirus disease 2019 ("covid-19"), a highly transmissible and pathogenic disease, has adversely affected, and we expect will continue to adversely affect, our business, financial condition and results of operations. global health concerns, and uncertainty regarding the impact of covid-19, could lead to further and/or increased volatility in global capital and credit markets, adversely affect our key executives and other personnel, clients, investors, providers, suppliers, lessees, and other third parties, and negatively impact our aum, revenues, income, business and operations. as of the time of this filing, as the covid-19 pandemic continues to evolve, it is not possible to predict the full extent to which covid-19 will adversely impact our business, liquidity, capital resources, financial results and operations due to numerous developing factors that are highly uncertain and rapidly changing.
during the fiscal year ended september 30, 2020 ("fiscal year 2020"), the global equity markets experienced volatility reflecting, among other things, ongoing global concerns about the covid-19 pandemic, but provided overall strong positive returns. despite easing of shutdown measures and some signs of economic recovery following significant accommodative economic efforts by governments and central banks, concerns about the severe economic impact of the ongoing covid-19 pandemic persist. the s&p 500 index and msci world index increased 15.2% and 11.0% for the fiscal year.
our total aum was $1,418.9 billion at september 30, 2020, which was 105% higher than at september 30, 2019 reflecting an increase of $806.5 billion from acquisitions, partially offset by $61.6 billion of long-term net outflows, $9.9 billion of cash management net outflows and $8.7 billion from net market change, distributions and other. simple monthly average aum ("average aum") increased 19% during fiscal year 2020.
the business and regulatory environments in which we operate globally remain complex, uncertain and subject to change. we are subject to various laws, rules and regulations globally that impose restrictions, limitations, registration, reporting and disclosure requirements on our business, and add complexity to our global compliance operations.
35
uncertainties regarding the global economy remain for the foreseeable future. as we continue to confront the challenges of the current economic and regulatory environments, we remain focused on the investment performance of our products and on providing high quality service to our clients. we continuously perform reviews of our business model. while we remain focused on expense management, we will also seek to attract, retain and develop personnel and invest strategically in systems and technology that will provide a secure and stable environment. we will continue to seek to protect and further our brand recognition while developing and maintaining broker-dealer and client relationships. the success of these and other strategies may be influenced by the factors discussed in the "risk factors" section.

1   includes the impact of the company's acquisition of legg mason, inc. which was effective july 31, 2020. see note 3 - acquisitions in the notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 of part ii of this annual report for information.
2   in fiscal year 2020, the company changed the presentation of its consolidated statements of income to include dividend and interest income and other expenses from consolidated investment products in non-operating income (expense). amounts for the comparative prior fiscal years have been reclassified to conform to the current presentation. these reclassifications had no impact on previously reported net income attributable to franklin resources, inc.
3   defined as operating income divided by total operating revenues.
4   "adjusted operating income," "adjusted operating margin," "adjusted net income" and "adjusted diluted earnings per share" are based on methodologies other than generally accepted accounting principles. see "supplemental non-gaap financial measures" for definitions and reconciliations of these measures.
the company acquired legg mason effective july 31, 2020, and the results of operations for fiscal year 2020 include two months of legg mason's results. operating income decreased $418.0 million in fiscal year 2020 due to a 2% decrease in operating revenues and a 7% increase in operating expenses which reflected higher levels of compensation and benefits expense, including acquisition-related retention costs, other acquisition-related expenses, and amortization and impairments of intangible assets and goodwill. net income attributable to franklin resources, inc. decreased $396.8 million primarily due to the decrease in operating income, as the impact of declines in market valuations amid global concerns about the covid-19 pandemic resulted in net investment and other losses of $38.4 million, as compared to net gains of $141.4 million in the prior year, less the portion attributable to noncontrolling interests, was largely offset by lower taxes on income.
operating income decreased $561.3 million in the fiscal year ended september 30, 2019 ("fiscal year 2019") due to a 9% decrease in operating revenues and a 1% increase in operating expenses. net income attributable to franklin resources, inc. increased $431.3 million primarily due to a prior year estimated income tax charge of $968.8 million resulting from enactment of the tax cuts and jobs act of 2017 (the "tax act"), partially offset by the decrease in operating income.
diluted earnings per share decreased in fiscal year 2020 and increased in fiscal year 2019, consistent with the changes in net income and the impacts of 2% and 6% decreases in diluted average common shares outstanding primarily resulting from repurchases of shares of our common stock.
36
adjusted operating income decreased $163.1 million in fiscal year 2020 primarily due to a 10% increase in compensation and benefits expense, excluding non-gaap adjustments. adjusted net income decreased $20.3 million primarily due to the decrease in adjusted operating income substantially offset by lower taxes on income, excluding the net income tax expense of non-gaap adjustments.
adjusted operating income decreased $439.3 million in fiscal year 2019 primarily due to an 8% decrease in adjusted operating revenues and a 6% increase in compensation and benefits expense, excluding non-gaap adjustments. adjusted net income attributable to franklin resources, inc. increased $533.2 million primarily due to a prior-year estimated income tax charge of $968.8 million resulting from enactment of the tax act, partially offset by the decrease in adjusted operating income.
adjusted diluted earnings per share decreased in fiscal year 2020 and increased in fiscal year 2019, consistent with the changes in adjusted net income and the impacts of the decreases in diluted average common shares outstanding.
assets under management in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2020, we revised our presentation of aum to disclose aum by asset class and introduced a simplified presentation of long-term net flows to incorporate all client-driven flow activity, which is defined as long-term inflows net of long-term outflows. additionally, we report cash management net flows as a separate component of total net flows. these changes reflect the new breadth of our business and the expansion of our client base and investment vehicle offerings, both of which expanded significantly beyond retail mutual funds following the acquisition of legg mason.
aum by asset class was as follows:

aum at september 30, 2020 increased 105% from september 30, 2019 driven by $806.5 billion from acquisitions, partially offset by $61.6 billion of long-term net outflows, $9.9 billion of cash management net outflows and $8.7 billion from net market change, distributions and other.
aum at september 30, 2019 decreased 3% from september 30, 2018 as $31.8 billion of long-term net outflows and $20.0 billion of net market change, distributions and other, were partially offset by $26.4 billion from an acquisition and $0.9 billion of cash management net inflows.
changes in average aum are generally more indicative of trends in revenue for providing investment management services than the year-over-year change in ending aum.

market change, distributions and other primarily consists of $24.8 billion of long-term distributions, partially offset by $15.8 billion of market appreciation. the market appreciation occurred primarily in the equity asset class, and reflected positive returns in global equity markets as evidenced by increases of 15.2% and 11.0% in the s&p 500 index and msci world index.

investment performance overview a key driver of our overall success is the long-term investment performance of our investment products. a measure of the performance of these products is the percentage of aum exceeding peer group medians and benchmarks. we compare the relative performance of our mutual funds against peers, and our institutional products against benchmarks. approximately half of our mutual fund aum exceeded the peer group median comparisons for all periods presented. our institutional products generated strong long-term results with at least 63% of aum exceeding the benchmark comparisons for all periods presented, primarily driven by the performance of our fixed income products which had at least 73% of aum exceeding the benchmark comparisons.
the performance of our mutual fund products against peer group medians and of our institutional products against benchmarks is presented in the table below.

1   mutual fund performance is sourced from morningstar and measures the percent of ranked aum in the top two quartiles versus peers. total mutual fund aum measured for the 1-, 3-, 5- and 10-year periods represents 39%, 38%, 38% and 36% of our total aum as of september 30, 2020.
2   institutional performance measures the percent of institutional aum beating its benchmark. the benchmark comparisons are based on each account's/composite's (composites may include retail separately managed accounts and mutual fund assets managed as part of the same strategy) return as compared to a market index that has been selected to be generally consistent with the asset class of the account/composite. total institutional aum measured for the 1-, 3-, 5- and 10-year periods represents 55%, 54%, 52% and 48% of our total aum as of september 30, 2020.
3   total aum includes performance of our multi-asset and alternative aum, which each represent 9% of our total aum at september 30, 2020.
mutual fund performance data includes u.s. and cross-border domiciled mutual funds and exchange-traded funds, and excludes cash management and fund of funds. these results assume the reinvestment of dividends, are based on data available as of october 12, 2020 and are subject to revision. while we remain focused on achieving strong long-term performance, our future peer group and benchmark rankings may vary from our past performance.

investment management fees investment management fees are generally calculated under contractual arrangements with our investment products and the products for which we provide sub-advisory services as a percentage of aum. annual fee rates vary by asset class and type of services provided. fee rates for products sold outside of the u.s. are generally higher than for u.s. products.
investment management fees decreased $3.5 million in fiscal year 2020 primarily due to a 7% decrease in average aum, lower effective investment management fee rate and lower performance fees of the legacy franklin business, largely offset by $427.6 million of revenue earned by legg mason subsequent to the acquisition. the decrease in average aum of the legacy franklin business occurred primarily in the fixed income and equity asset classes, partially offset by an increase in the alternative asset class, and across all sales regions except europe, middle east and africa.
investment management fees decreased $382.3 million in fiscal year 2019 primarily due to a 6% decrease in average aum, a $59.6 million decrease from a change in presentation of certain fees from investment management fees to distribution fees upon adoption of new revenue recognition accounting guidance on october 1, 2018, and a lower effective investment management fee rate, partially offset by higher performance fees. the decrease in average aum occurred primarily in the equity, fixed income and multi-asset asset classes, partially offset by an increase in the alternative asset class, and across all sales regions, most significantly in the u.s. and europe, middle east and africa.
our effective investment management fee rate excluding performance fees (investment management fees excluding performance fees divided by average aum) was 47.3, 56.4 and 58.7 basis points for fiscal years 2020, 2019 and 2018. the rate decrease in fiscal year 2020 was primarily due to the legg mason acquisition, as legg mason generally has a lower overall effective fee rate due to a higher mix of institutional and fixed income aum. the fee rate decrease is also due to higher weighting of aum in lower-fee products, a shift from higher-fee products in the u.s. sales region to lower-fee products in europe, middle east and africa sales regions for the fixed income asset class, and certain sponsored funds in india with total aum of $3.4 billion at september 30, 2020, which are subject to the decision of the funds' trustees to wind up the funds (see note 16 - commitments and contingencies in the notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 of part ii of this annual report for further information), and for which the company no longer earns investment management fees.
performance-based investment management fees were $44.0 million, $52.9 million and $21.2 million for fiscal years 2020, 2019 and 2018. the decrease in fiscal year 2020 was primarily due to lower performance fees earned from a private debt fund, separate accounts, and a real estate fund, while the increase in fiscal year 2019 was primarily due to the higher fees earned from the same funds. the decrease in fiscal year 2020 was partially offset by $15.0 million of performance fees earned by legg mason subsequent to the acquisition.

1   u.s. industry asset-weighted average management fee rates were calculated using information available from lipper, a refinitiv company, as of september 30, 2020, 2019 and 2018 and include all u.s.-registered open-end funds that reported expense data to lipper as of the funds' most recent annual report date, and for which expenses were equal to or greater than zero. as defined by lipper, management fees include fees from providing advisory and fund administration services. the averages combine retail and institutional funds data and include all share classes and distribution channels, without exception. variable annuity and fund of fund products are not included.
2   the decreases in the average rate in fiscal years 2020 and 2019 reflect higher weightings of two large low-fee passive funds and lower weightings of two large higher-fee actively managed funds.
3   the decreases in the average rate in fiscal years 2020 and 2019 reflect higher weightings of two large low-fee passive funds.
4   the decreases in the average rate in fiscal years 2020 and 2019 reflect higher weightings of one large low-fee passive fund.
the declines in u.s. industry average management fee rates for long-term asset classes generally reflect increased investor demand for lower-fee passive funds. our actual effective investment management fee rates are generally higher than the u.s. industry average rates as we actively manage substantially all of our products and have a higher level of international aum, both of which generate higher fees. our fiscal year 2020 effective fee rates in the u.s. generally decreased to a greater extent than the average industry rates following the acquisition of legg mason on july 31, 2020 and are expected to decrease further in the fiscal year ending september 30, 2021 which will include a full year of legg mason results.
our product offerings and global operations are diverse. as such, the impact of future changes in aum on investment management fees will be affected by the relative mix of asset class, geographic region, distribution channel and investment vehicle of the assets.
sales and distribution fees sales and distribution fees primarily consist of upfront sales commissions and ongoing distribution fees. sales commissions are earned from the sale of certain classes of sponsored funds at the time of purchase ("commissionable sales") and may be reduced or eliminated depending on the amount invested and the type of investor. therefore, sales fees generally will change with the overall level of gross sales, the size of individual transactions, and the relative mix of sales between different share classes and types of investors.
our sponsored mutual funds generally pay us distribution fees in return for sales, marketing and distribution efforts on their behalf. the majority of our u.s. mutual funds, with the exception of certain money market funds and certain other funds specifically designed for purchase through separately managed account programs, have adopted distribution plans under rule 12b-1 (the "rule 12b-1 plans") promulgated under the investment company act of 1940. the rule 12b-1 plans permit the funds to pay us for marketing, marketing support, advertising, printing and sales promotion services relating to the distribution of their shares, subject to the rule 12b-1 plans' limitations on amounts based on daily average aum. we earn distribution fees from our non-u.s. funds based on daily average aum.
we pay substantially all of our sales and distribution fees to the financial advisers, broker-dealers and other intermediaries that sell our funds on our behalf. see the description of sales, distribution and marketing expenses below.

asset-based distribution fees decreased $91.9 million in fiscal year 2020 primarily due to decreases of $79.2 million from a 7% decrease in the related average aum and $38.6 million from a higher mix of lower-fee u.s. assets, partially offset by a $35.3 million increase from fees earned by legg mason subsequent to the acquisition. asset-based distribution fees decreased $126.1 million in fiscal year 2019 primarily due to decreases of $120.5 million from a 9% decrease in the related average aum and $67.6 million from a lower mix of u.s. class c assets which have higher fee rates than other share classes, partially offset by a $59.6 million increase from a change in presentation of certain fees to distribution fees from investment management fees upon adoption of new revenue recognition accounting guidance on october 1, 2018.
sales-based fees increased $1.9 million in fiscal year 2020 primarily due to increases of $9.8 million from fees earned by legg mason subsequent to the acquisition, $7.2 million from higher u.s. product commissionable sales and, $2.9 million from a higher mix of equity sales, which typically generate higher sales fees than fixed income products. the increases were substantially offset by a decrease of $18.7 million from lower non-u.s. product commissionable sales. sales-based fees decreased $26.3 million in fiscal year 2019 primarily due to decreases of $18.2 million from lower total commissionable sales and $5.3 million from a lower mix of u.s. product commissionable sales.
contingent sales charges are earned from investor redemptions within a contracted period of time. substantially all of these charges are levied on certain shares sold without a front-end sales charge, and vary with the mix of redemptions of these shares. contingent sales charges increased $7.4 million in fiscal year 2020 and decreased $2.8 million in fiscal year 2019 primarily due to changes in redemptions.
shareholder servicing fees substantially all shareholder servicing fees are earned from our sponsored funds for providing transfer agency services, which include providing shareholder statements, transaction processing, customer service and tax reporting. these fees are primarily determined based on a percentage of aum and either the number of transactions in shareholder accounts or the number of shareholder accounts, while fees from certain funds are based only on aum. in addition, fund reimbursements of expenses incurred while providing transfer agency services are recognized as revenue effective october 1, 2018 under new revenue recognition guidance.
shareholder servicing fees decreased $21.2 million in fiscal year 2020 primarily due to lower levels of related aum and transactions. shareholder servicing fees decreased $5.6 million in fiscal year 2019 primarily due to lower levels of related aum and transactions, partially offset by $8.6 million of fund expense reimbursement revenue.
other other revenue increased $4.4 million and $8.0 million in fiscal years 2020 and 2019 primarily due to higher miscellaneous fee revenues.

salaries, wages and benefits increased $97.2 million and $46.5 million in fiscal year 2020 and 2019, primarily due to increases of $56.9 million and $23.8 million from higher average staffing levels primarily resulting from acquisitions, and $19.3 million and $24.5 million for annual salary increases that were effective december 1 of each fiscal year, partially offset by decreases of $5.9 million and $12.5 million from favorable foreign currency impacts. the increase in fiscal year 2020 also included a $16.2 million increase in other termination benefits.
variable compensation increased $60.6 million and $36.3 million in fiscal year 2020 and 2019, primarily due to increases of $67.7 million and $52.4 million related to acquired firms' bonus plans and $10.0 million and $2.2 million related to private equity and other product performance fees, partially offset by decreases of $9.6 million and $18.0 million in bonus expense primarily due to lower expectations of our annual performance. variable compensation related to unvested mutual fund awards decreased $11.3 million in fiscal year 2020 and increased $3.8 million in fiscal year 2019. the increases in fiscal year 2019 were also partially offset by a $7.9 million decrease in stock and stock unit award amortization.
acquisition-related retention expenses increased $132.1 million in fiscal year 2020 primarily related to the acquisition of legg mason, and increased $55.8 million in fiscal year 2019 primarily related to the acquisition of benefit street partners, l.l.c. ("bsp").
special termination benefits relate to workforce optimization initiatives related to the acquisition of legg mason in fiscal year 2020, and voluntary separation and workforce reduction initiatives of 4.5% of our global workforce in fiscal year 2019.
we expect to incur acquisition-related retention expenses of approximately $150 million during the fiscal year ending september 30, 2021 ("fiscal year 2021"), and amounts that decrease by approximately $20 million per year in the following three fiscal years. at september 30, 2020, our global workforce had increased to approximately 11,800 employees from approximately 9,600 at september 30, 2019.
we continue to place a high emphasis on our pay for performance philosophy. as such, any changes in the underlying performance of our investment products or changes in the composition of our incentive compensation offerings could have an impact on compensation and benefits expenses going forward. however, in order to attract and retain talented individuals, our level of compensation and benefit expenses may increase more quickly or decrease more slowly than our revenue.

sales, distribution and marketing sales, distribution and marketing expenses primarily relate to services provided by financial advisers, broker-dealers and other intermediaries to our sponsored funds, including marketing support services. substantially all sales expenses are incurred from the same commissionable sales transactions that generate sales fee revenues and are determined as a percentage of sales. substantially all distribution expenses are incurred from assets that generate distribution fees and are determined as a percentage of aum. marketing support expenses are based on aum, sales or a combination thereof. also included is the amortization of deferred sales commissions related to upfront commissions on shares sold without a front-end sales charge. the deferred sales commissions are amortized over the periods in which commissions are generally recovered from related revenues.

sales, distribution and marketing                   $1,703.1              $1,819.6              $2,039.7           (6   %)             (11   %)
asset-based expenses decreased $107.0 million in fiscal year 2020 primarily due to decreases of $107.4 million from an 8% decrease in the related average aum and $53.4 million from a higher mix of lower-fee u.s. assets, partially offset by a $58.6 million increase in expenses incurred by legg mason subsequent to the acquisition. asset-based expenses decreased $227.9 million in fiscal year 2019 primarily due to decreases of $161.4 million from a 10% decrease in the related average aum, and $64.3 million from a lower mix of u.s. class c assets which have higher expense rates than other share classes. distribution expenses are generally not directly correlated with distribution fee revenues due to certain international fee structures that do not provide full recovery of distribution costs.
sales-based expenses decreased $4.0 million in fiscal year 2020 primarily due to a $20.3 million decrease from lower non-u.s. product commissionable sales, largely offset by an $8.6 million increase in expenses incurred by legg mason subsequent to the acquisition and a $7.5 million increase from higher u.s. product commissionable sales. u.s. products typically generate higher sales commissions than non-u.s. products. sales-based expenses increased $2.7 million in fiscal year 2019 primarily due to increases of $22.6 million from the recognition of sales commissions on u.s. class c shares as expense at the time of sale and $10.0 million from revised u.s. dealer commission pricing effective september 2018, partially offset by decreases of $14.2 million from lower total commissionable sales and $12.6 million in india primarily related to regulatory-driven changes in fee structure. the recognition of sales commissions on u.s. class c shares as expense at the time of sale is consistent with the treatment of contract costs with a useful life of one year or less under new revenue recognition accounting guidance adopted on october 1, 2018. the commissions relate to shares sold without a front-end sales charge and were deferred and amortized over one year in prior years.
amortization of deferred sales commissions decreased $5.5 million in fiscal year 2020, primarily due to a $15.0 million decrease from lower sales of non-u.s. shares sold without front-end sales charge, partially offset by an $8.6 million increase from higher sales of u.s. shares. amortization of deferred sales commissions increased $5.1 million in fiscal year 2019, as the impact of higher sales of shares sold without a front-end sales charge was largely offset by the change in accounting for u.s. class c shares discussed above, which resulted in no further deferral and amortization. the unamortized deferred class c commission balance of $9.1 million at september 30, 2018 was reversed against retained earnings upon adoption of the new accounting guidance.
information systems and technology information systems and technology expenses increased $29.9 million in fiscal year 2020 primarily due to expenses of legg mason subsequent to closing of the acquisition. information systems and technology expenses increased $14.6 million in fiscal year 2019 primarily due to higher external data service and software costs.
46
occupancy we conduct our worldwide operations using a combination of leased and owned facilities. occupancy expenses include rent and other facilities-related costs including depreciation and utilities.
occupancy expenses increased $14.3 million in fiscal year 2020 primarily due to expenses of legg mason subsequent to closing of the acquisition, and higher depreciation expense related to our buildings in san mateo, california and poznan, poland which we occupied beginning in the second half of fiscal year 2019, partially offset by lower levels of rent expense and building maintenance costs. occupancy expenses increased $5.0 million in fiscal year 2019 primarily due to higher levels of rent expense and building depreciation and maintenance costs, partially offset by a $6.3 million decrease in equipment impairment.
amortization of intangible assets amortization of intangible assets increased $39.3 million in fiscal year 2020 primarily related to the acquisition of legg mason, and increased $12.9 million in fiscal year 2019 primarily related to the acquisition of bsp. see note 9 - goodwill and other intangible assets in the notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 of part ii of this annual report for information on definite-lived intangible assets.
general, administrative and other general, administrative and other operating expenses primarily consist of professional fees, fund-related service fees payable to external parties, impairments of intangible assets and goodwill, advertising and promotion, travel and entertainment, and other miscellaneous expenses.
general, administrative and other operating expenses increased $58.9 million in fiscal year 2020, primarily due to increases of $48.0 million in acquisition-related professional fees and $19.3 million of post-acquisition general and administrative expenses, both related to legg mason. additionally, impairments of intangible assets and goodwill increased $42.1 million primarily related to assets recognized from the acquisitions of bsp and onsa, inc., (formally known as tokenvault, inc.). the increases were partially offset by decreases of $24.6 million in travel and entertainment expenses and $13.8 million in advertising and promotion expenses, both primarily due to lower activity levels, and by a prior year litigation settlement.
general, administrative and other operating expenses increased $19.7 million in fiscal year 2019 primarily due to a $13.9 million litigation settlement and higher third-party service fees and professional fees. third-party fees primarily for sub-advisory and fund administration services increased $13.7 million, including $8.6 million from the recognition of certain payments reimbursed by funds as expense upon adoption of new revenue recognition accounting guidance on october 1, 2018. professional fees increased $10.6 million primarily related to the acquisition of bsp. the increases were partially offset by decreases of $11.1 million in contingent consideration expense for the k2 advisors holdings, llc ("k2") acquisition and $8.6 million in advertising and promotion.

in fiscal year 2020, the company changed the presentation of its consolidated statements of income to include dividend and interest income and other expenses from consolidated investment products ("cips") in non-operating income (expense). amounts for the comparative prior fiscal years have been reclassified to conform to the current presentation. see note 1 - significant accounting policies in the notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 of part ii of this annual report for more information.
investment and other income (losses), net consists primarily of income (losses) from equity method investees, dividend and interest income, rental income from excess owned space in our san mateo, california corporate headquarters and other office buildings which we lease to third parties, foreign currency exchange gains (losses), and gains (losses) on investments held by the company.
investment and other income (losses), net decreased $179.8 million in fiscal year 2020 primarily due to the impact of steep declines in market valuations on investment income, lower dividend and interest income, and foreign exchange losses, partially offset by an increase in rental income. losses from equity method investees increased $87.7 million, primarily related to investments in two global equity funds. dividend income decreased $48.1 million primarily due to lower yields on money market funds. net foreign currency exchange losses were $22.3 million in fiscal year 2020 as compared to net gains of $13.1 million in the prior year. the decrease was primarily due to the impact of the weakening of the u.s. dollar against the euro on cash and cash equivalents denominated in u.s. dollars held in europe.
interest income decreased $16.7 million primarily due to lower levels of cash equivalents and debt securities and lower interest rates. the decreases were partially offset by a $10.2 million increase in rental income due to additional leases which took effect in fiscal year 2020.
investment and other income (losses), net decreased $58.9 million in fiscal year 2019 primarily due to losses from equity method investees, as compared to income in the prior year, lower interest income and losses on investments held by the company, as compared to gains in the prior year. these decreases were largely offset by higher dividend income and higher foreign exchange gains. equity method investees generated losses of $10.4 million as compared to income of $44.4 million in the prior year primarily due to changes in market valuations of investments held by two global equity funds. interest income decreased $45.5 million primarily due to lower levels of cash equivalents and debt securities, partially offset by higher interest rates. investments held by the company generated net losses of $9.7 million primarily due to $9.0 million of other-than-temporary impairment of an available-for-sale debt security, as compared to net gains of $6.0 million in the prior year. the decreases were partially offset by a $45.9 million increase in dividend income primarily due to higher yields on, and investments in, money market funds. net foreign currency exchange gains increased $12.5 million primarily from the impact of strengthening of the u.s. dollar against the euro on cash and cash equivalents denominated in u.s. dollars held in europe.
interest expense increased $11.0 million in fiscal year 2020 primarily due to interest expense recognized on debt of legg mason subsequent to the acquisition. interest expense decreased $23.9 million in fiscal year 2019 primarily due to $12.5 million of prior year costs related to early redemption of senior notes and lower debt balances.
investment and other income of consolidated investment products, net consists of dividend and interest income and investment gains (losses) on investments held by cips. expenses of consolidated investment products primarily consists of fund-related expenses, including professional fees and other administrative expenses, and interest expense. significant portions of the investment and other income of consolidated investment products, net and expenses of consolidated investment products are offset in noncontrolling interests in our consolidated statements of income.
48
investment and other income of consolidated investment products, net decreased $8.6 million in fiscal year 2020. net losses on investments held by cips increased $12.6 million primarily from holdings of various alternative funds partially offset by gains from holdings of various equity funds and a u.s. fixed income fund. this decrease was partially offset by a $4.0 million increase in dividend and interest income of cips.
investment and other income of consolidated investment products, net increased $19.2 million in fiscal year 2019. net losses on investments held by cips decreased $28.7 million primarily from holdings of various global/international funds and a u.s. fixed income fund. this increase was partially offset by a $9.5 million decrease in investment income of cips.
expenses of consolidated investment products increased $12.5 million in fiscal year 2020, primarily due to higher expenses incurred by two alternative funds. expenses of consolidated investment products decreased $9.7 million in fiscal year 2019, primarily due to lower expenses incurred by an equity fund and a fixed income fund.
our investments in sponsored funds include initial cash investments made in the course of launching mutual fund and other investment product offerings, as well as investments for other business reasons. the market conditions that impact our aum similarly affect the investment income earned or losses incurred on our investments in sponsored funds.

taxes on income the tax act, which was enacted into law in the u.s. in december 2017, includes various changes to the tax law, including a permanent reduction in the corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21% effective january 1, 2018 and assessment of a one-time transition tax on the deemed repatriation of post-1986 undistributed foreign subsidiaries' earnings. we completed our analysis of the tax act impact during the quarter ended december 31, 2018 with no significant adjustment to the provisional amounts previously recorded. the transition tax expense recognized in fiscal year 2018 was net of an $87.6 million tax benefit related to u.s. taxation of deemed foreign dividends. this benefit was reversed in fiscal year 2019 upon issuance of final regulations by the u.s. department of treasury.
our effective income tax rate for fiscal year 2020 was 22.7% as compared to 26.8% in fiscal year 2019 and 66.5% in fiscal year 2018. the rate decrease in fiscal year 2020 was primarily due to the prior-year reversal of the tax benefit included in the transition tax related to u.s. taxation of deemed foreign dividends upon issuance of final regulations by the u.s. department of treasury for the tax act, tax benefits from capital losses subsequent to the change in corporate tax structure of a foreign holding company to a u.s. branch, and a statutory rate reduction enacted in india in december 2019. these decreases were partially offset by an increase in the tax rate due to a lower mix of earnings in lower tax jurisdictions. the coronavirus aid, relief, and economic security act, which includes several corporate tax provisions and was signed into law on march 27, 2020, did not have a material impact on our income taxes. the rate decrease in fiscal year 2019 was primarily
49
due to the prior year impact of the transition tax, net of the tax benefit from the revaluation of net deferred tax liabilities at the lower statutory rate, and the current year impact of the lower 21% statutory rate as compared to the prior-year blended statutory rate of 24.5%, partially offset by the reversal of the tax benefit related to the u.s. taxation of deemed foreign dividends. our effective income tax rate excluding the one-time impacts of the tax act was 21.6% and 22.7% for fiscal years 2019 and 2018.
our effective income tax rate reflects the relative contributions of earnings in the jurisdictions in which we operate, which have varying tax rates. changes in our pre-tax income mix, tax rates or tax legislation in such jurisdictions may affect our effective income tax rate and net income.
supplemental non-gaap financial measures as supplemental information, we are providing performance measures for "adjusted operating income," "adjusted operating margin," "adjusted net income" and "adjusted diluted earnings per share," each of which is based on methodologies other than generally accepted accounting principles ("non-gaap measures"). management believes these non-gaap measures are useful indicators of our financial performance and may be helpful to investors in evaluating our relative performance against industry peers as these measures exclude the impact of cips and mitigate the margin variability related to sales and distribution revenues and expenses across multiple distribution channels globally. these measures also exclude performance-based investment management fees which are fully passed through as compensation and benefits expense per the terms of a previous acquisition by legg mason and have no impact on net income. these non-gaap measures also exclude acquisition-related expenses, certain items which management considers to be nonrecurring, unrealized investment gains and losses included in investment and other income (losses), net, and the related income tax effect of these adjustments, as applicable. these non-gaap measures also exclude the impact on compensation and benefits expense which is offset by gains and losses in investment and other income (losses), net on investments made to fund deferred compensation plans and on seed investments under certain historical revenue sharing arrangements.
"adjusted operating income," "adjusted operating margin," "adjusted net income" and "adjusted diluted earnings per share" are defined below, followed by reconciliations of operating income, operating margin, net income attributable to franklin resources, inc. and diluted earnings per share on a u.s. gaap basis to these non-gaap measures. non-gaap measures should not be considered in isolation from, or as substitutes for, any financial information prepared in accordance with u.s. gaap, and may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies. additional reconciling items may be added in the future to these non-gaap measures if deemed appropriate.
adjusted operating income we define adjusted operating income as operating income adjusted to exclude the following:
•   elimination of operating revenues upon consolidation of investment products.
•   acquisition-related retention compensation.
•   impact on compensation and benefits expense from gains and losses on investments related to legg mason deferred compensation plans and seed investments, which is offset in investment and other income (expense), net.
•   other acquisition-related expenses including professional fees and fair value adjustments related to contingent consideration liabilities.
•   amortization and impairment of intangible assets and goodwill.
•   special termination benefits related to workforce optimization initiatives related to the acquisition of legg mason in fiscal year 2020, and voluntary separation and workforce reduction initiatives of 4.5% of our global workforce in fiscal year 2019.
50
adjusted operating margin we calculate adjusted operating margin as adjusted operating income divided by adjusted operating revenues. we define adjusted operating revenues as operating revenues adjusted to exclude the following:
•   acquisition-related performance-based investment management fees which are passed through as compensation and benefits expense.
•   sales and distribution fees and a portion of investment management fees allocated to cover sales, distribution and marketing expenses paid to the financial advisers and other intermediaries who sell our funds on our behalf.
•   elimination of operating revenues upon consolidation of investment products.
adjusted net income we define adjusted net income as net income attributable to franklin resources, inc. adjusted to exclude the following:
•   activities of cips, including investment and other income (losses), net, other expenses and income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests, net of revenues eliminated upon consolidation of investment products.
•   acquisition-related retention compensation.
•   other acquisition-related expenses including professional fees and fair value adjustments related to contingent consideration liabilities and the market-based component of retention awards.
•   amortization and impairment of intangible assets.
•   impairment of goodwill and write off of noncontrolling interests related to the wind down of a recently acquired business.
•   special termination benefits related to workforce optimization initiatives related to the acquisition of legg mason in fiscal year 2020, and voluntary separation and workforce reduction initiatives of 4.5% of our global workforce in fiscal year 2019.
•   net gains or losses on investments related to legg mason deferred compensation plans which are not offset by compensation and benefits expense.
•   unrealized investment gains and losses included in investment and other income (losses), net, other than those that are offset by compensation and benefits expense.
•   interest expense for amortization of legg mason debt premium from acquisition-date fair value adjustment.
•   net income tax expense of the above adjustments based on the respective blended rates applicable to the adjustments.
adjusted diluted earnings per share we define adjusted diluted earnings per share as diluted earnings per share adjusted to exclude the per share impacts of the adjustments applied to net income in calculating adjusted net income.
in calculating adjusted operating income, adjusted operating margin, adjusted net income and adjusted diluted earnings per share, we adjust for activities of cips because the impact of consolidated products are not considered reflective of the underlying results of our operations. we adjust for acquisition-related retention compensation, other acquisition-related expenses, amortization and impairment of intangible assets and goodwill, the write-off of noncontrolling interests, and interest expense for amortization of the legg mason debt premium to facilitate comparability of our operating results with the results of other asset management firms. we adjust for special termination benefits related to workforce optimization initiatives related to the acquisition of legg mason in fiscal year 2020 and certain voluntary separation and workforce reduction initiatives because these items are deemed nonrecurring. in calculating adjusted net income and adjusted diluted earnings per share, we adjust for unrealized investment gains and losses included in investment and other income (losses), net and net gains or losses on investments related to legg mason deferred compensation plans which are not offset by compensation and benefits expense because these items primarily relate to seed and strategic investments which have been and are generally expected to be held long term.

liquidity and capital resources cash flows were as follows:
(in millions)
for the fiscal years ended september 30,                  2020                  2019   2018
operating cash flows                              $1,021.4                $201.6              $2,229.7

net cash provided by operating activities increased in fiscal year 2020 primarily due to lower net purchases of investments by cips, decreases in investments, net, decreases in receivables and other assets, and a smaller decline in taxes payable, partially offset by decreases in accounts payable and accrued expenses, and decreases in net income. net cash used in investing activities increased as compared to the prior year, primarily due to higher cash paid for acquisitions, and net purchases of investments by clos, partially offset by net consolidation of cips as compared to net deconsolidation in the prior year, higher net liquidation of our investments as compared to the prior year, and lower net additions of property, plant and equipment. net cash provided by financing activities, as compared to net cash used in the prior year, primarily resulted from proceeds from debt of cips and lower repurchases of stock, partially offset by lower net subscriptions in cips by noncontrolling interests and payments on debt by cips.
53
net cash provided by operating activities decreased in fiscal year 2019 primarily due to activities of cips which had net purchases of investments as compared to net liquidations in the prior year. net cash used in investing activities increased primarily due to cash paid for bsp and higher net additions of property and equipment primarily related to construction of two new buildings at our corporate headquarters campus in san mateo, california and a purchased office building in poznan, poland. net cash used in financing activities decreased primarily due to lower dividends paid on, and repurchases of, common stock, higher net subscriptions in cips by noncontrolling interests, and a prior-year debt payment.
the assets and liabilities of cips attributable to third-party investors do not impact our liquidity and capital resources. we have no right to the cips' assets, other than our direct equity investment in them and investment management and other fees earned from them. the debt holders of the cips have no recourse to our assets beyond the level of our direct investment, therefore we bear no other risks associated with the cips' liabilities. accordingly, the assets and liabilities of cips, other than our direct investments in them, are excluded from the amounts and discussion below.
our liquid assets and debt consisted of the following:
(in millions)
as of september 30,                        2020                  2019                  2018
assets cash and cash equivalents          $3,026.8              $5,803.4              $6,610.8
receivables                         1,114.8                 740.0                 733.7
investments                           982.2               2,029.4               2,130.6
total liquid assets                $5,123.8              $8,572.8              $9,475.1
liability debt                               $3,017.1                $696.9                $695.9
liquidity liquid assets consist of cash and cash equivalents, receivables and certain investments. cash and cash equivalents at september 30, 2020 primarily consist of money market funds and deposits with financial institutions. liquid investments consist of investments in sponsored and other funds, direct investments in redeemable cips, other equity and debt securities, and time deposits with maturities greater than three months.
we utilize a significant portion of our liquid assets to satisfy operational and regulatory requirements and fund capital contributions to sponsored and other products. certain of our subsidiaries are required by our internal policy or regulation to maintain minimum levels of cash and/or capital, and may be restricted in their ability to transfer cash to their parent companies. liquid assets used to satisfy these purposes were $3,290.9 million at september 30, 2020 and $3,429.0 million at september 30, 2019, including $316.6 million and $263.3 million that was restricted by regulatory requirements. should we require more capital than is available for use, we could elect to reduce the level of discretionary activities, such as share repurchases or investments in sponsored and other products, or we could raise capital through debt or equity issuance. these alternatives could result in increased interest expense, decreased dividend or interest income, or other dilution to our earnings.
capital resources we believe that we can meet our present and reasonably foreseeable operating cash needs and future commitments through existing liquid assets, continuing cash flows from operations, the ability to issue debt or equity securities and borrowing capacity under our uncommitted private placement program.
in prior fiscal years, we issued senior unsecured unsubordinated notes for general corporate purposes, to redeem outstanding notes and to finance an acquisition. at september 30, 2020, $699.5 million of the notes were outstanding with an aggregate principal amount due of $700.0 million. the notes were issued at fixed interest rates and consist of $300.0 million at 2.800% per annum which mature in 2022 and $400.0 million at 2.850% per annum which mature in 2025.
54
additionally, legg mason has outstanding senior and junior unsecured unsubordinated notes with an aggregate principal amount due of $2,000.0 million at september 30, 2020. the notes have fixed interest rates from 3.950% to 6.375% with interest payable semi-annually for senior notes and quarterly for junior notes, and have an aggregate carrying value, inclusive of unamortized premium, of $2,319.7 million at september 30, 2020.
the senior notes contain an optional redemption feature that allows us to redeem each series of notes prior to maturity in whole or in part at any time, at a make-whole redemption price. the junior notes due march 2056 and september 2056 may only be redeemed in whole prior to march 2021 and september 2021, respectively. the indentures governing the senior notes contain limitations on our ability and the ability of our subsidiaries to pledge voting stock or profit participating equity interests in our subsidiaries to secure other debt without similarly securing the notes equally and ratably. in addition, the indentures include requirements that must be met if we consolidate or merge with, or sell all of our assets to, another entity. we were in compliance with all debt covenants at september 30, 2020.
on october 19, 2020, the company completed its offering and sale of the 1.600% notes due 2030 with a principal amount of $750.0 million. the notes contain an optional redemption feature that allows the company to redeem each series of notes prior to maturity in whole or in part at any time, at a make-whole redemption price.
at september 30, 2020, we had $500.0 million of short-term commercial paper available for issuance under an uncommitted private placement program which has been inactive since 2012 and is unrated.
our ability to access the capital markets in a timely manner depends on a number of factors, including our credit rating, the condition of the global economy, investors' willingness to purchase our securities, interest rates, credit spreads and the valuation levels of equity markets. if we are unable to access capital markets in a timely manner, our business could be adversely impacted.
uses of capital we expect that our main uses of cash will be to invest in and grow our business, pay stockholder dividends, invest in our products, pay income taxes and operating expenses of the business, enhance technology infrastructure and business processes, repurchase shares of our common stock, fund property and equipment purchases, and service and repay debt. while we expect to continue to repurchase shares to offset dilution from share-based compensation, and expect to continue to repurchase shares opportunistically from time to time, we will likely spend more of our post-dividend free cash flow investing in our business, including seed capital and acquiring resources to help grow our investment teams, affiliates and operations.
we repatriate the earnings in excess of regulatory, capital or operational requirements for all non-u.s. subsidiaries.
we declare dividends on a quarterly basis. we declared regular dividends of $1.08 per share ($0.27 per share per quarter) in fiscal year 2020, and of $1.04 per share ($0.26 per share per quarter) in fiscal year 2019. we currently expect to continue paying comparable regular dividends on a quarterly basis to holders of our common stock depending upon earnings and other relevant factors.
we maintain a stock repurchase program to manage our equity capital with the objective of maximizing shareholder value. our stock repurchase program is effected through regular open-market purchases and private transactions in accordance with applicable laws and regulations, and is not subject to an expiration date. the size and timing of these purchases will depend on business conditions, price, market and other factors. during fiscal years 2020 and 2019, we repurchased 9.0 million and 24.6 million shares of our common stock at a cost of $219.4 million and $756.3 million. at september 30, 2020, 38.2 million shares remained available for repurchase under the authorization of 80.0 million shares approved by our board of directors in april 2018.
we redeemed $636.6 million, net of investments, in our sponsored products during fiscal year 2020, and invested $128.0 million, net of redemptions, during fiscal year 2019.
on july 31, 2020, we acquired all of the outstanding common stock of legg mason for a purchase consideration of $4.5 billion in cash and $0.2 billion related to the settlement of historical compensation arrangements. during the fiscal year 2020, we completed additional acquisitions with a total purchase consideration of $94.8 million in cash, including the acquisitions of pennsylvania trust company, advisorengine inc., athena capital advisors, llc and onsa, inc. on february 1, 2019, we acquired all of the outstanding ownership interests in bsp for a purchase consideration of $720.1 million in cash.
55
in february 2020, we purchased an office building in edinburgh, scotland with a total cost of approximately $40 million. during fiscal year 2019, we completed construction of two new buildings at our corporate headquarters campus in san mateo, california with a total cost of approximately $130 million and purchased an office building in poznan, poland with a total cost of approximately $86 million. the buildings are used in our business operations, and portions of the edinburgh building and california campus are leased to third parties.
the funds that we manage have their own resources available for purposes of providing liquidity to meet shareholder redemptions, including securities that can be sold or provided to investors as in-kind redemptions, and lines of credit. current increased liquidity risks and redemptions in these funds have required, and may continue to require, increased cash in the form of loans or other lines of credit to help settle redemptions and for other related purposes. while we have no legal or contractual obligation to do so, we have in certain instances voluntarily elected to provide the funds with direct or indirect financial support based on our business objectives. in april 2020, we authorized loans aggregating up to 5.0 billion indian rupees (approximately $66.2 million) to certain sponsored funds in india that had experienced increased liquidity risks and redemptions and that are subject to the decision of the fund's trustee to wind up the funds. see note 16 - commitments and contingencies in the notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 of part ii of this annual report for further information. the loans have a fixed interest rate of 8.0% per annum, are secured by the funds' assets and are due upon demand. at september 30, 2020, the loans have an aggregate outstanding balance of $42.4 million, and the remaining authorization available is approximately $4.9 million. we did not provide financial or other support to our sponsored funds during fiscal year 2019.

1   debt principal represents amounts due on maturity. excludes 1.600% notes with a principal amount of $750.0 million due 2030 which were issued on october 19, 2020. see note 22 - subsequent event in the notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 of part ii of this annual report.
2   purchase obligations include contractual amounts that will be due to purchase goods and services to be used in our operations and may be canceled at earlier times than those indicated under certain conditions that may include termination fees.
3   represents purchase consideration payments to be made in connection with the acquisition of legg mason.
4   committed capital contributions relate to discretionary commitments to invest in sponsored funds and other investment products and entities, including cips. generally, the timing of the funding of these commitments is unknown as they are callable on demand at any time prior to the expiration of the commitment periods.
5   the amount of contingent consideration liabilities reflected for any year represents the expected settlement amounts as of september 30, 2020. the fair value of the aggregate contingent consideration liability at september 30, 2020 totaled $25.3 million and is included in other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet.
6   transition tax on the deemed repatriation of post-1986 undistributed foreign subsidiaries' earnings under the tax act.
the debt holders of cips have no recourse to our assets beyond the level of our direct investments, therefore we bear no risks associated with these entities' liabilities and have not included them in the table above. see note 11 - consolidated investment products in the notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 of part ii of this annual report.
at september 30, 2020, our consolidated balance sheet included liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits of $262.9 million and related accrued interest of $24.6 million (see note 14 - taxes on income in the notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 of part ii of this annual report). because of the high degree of uncertainty regarding the timing and amounts of future cash outflows, unrecognized tax benefits and related accrued interest are not included in the table above.
critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america, which require the use of estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented. these estimates, judgments and assumptions are affected by our application of accounting policies. further, global concerns about the covid-19 pandemic have adversely affected, and we expect will continue to adversely affect, our business, financial condition and results of operations including the estimates and assumptions made by management. actual results could differ from the estimates. described below are the accounting policies that we believe are most critical to understanding our financial position and results of operations. for additional information about our accounting policies, see note 1 - significant accounting policies in the notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 of part ii of this annual report.

consolidation we consolidate our subsidiaries and investment products in which we have a controlling financial interest. we have a controlling financial interest when we own a majority of the voting interest in a voting interest entity ("voe") or are the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity ("vie").
a vie is an entity in which the equity investment holders have not contributed sufficient capital to finance its activities or do not have defined rights and obligations normally associated with an equity investment. the assessment of whether an entity is a vie or voe involves judgment and analysis on a structure-by-structure basis. when performing the assessment we consider factors such as the entity's legal organization and capital structure, the rights of the equity investment holders and our contractual involvement with and ownership interest in the entity. substantially all of our vies are investment products and our variable interests consist of our equity ownership interests in and investment management fees earned from these products.
we are the primary beneficiary of a vie if we have the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the vie's economic performance and the obligation to absorb losses of or right to receive benefits from the vie that could potentially be significant to the vie. investment management fees earned from vies are excluded from the primary beneficiary determination if they are deemed to be at market and commensurate with service. the key estimates and assumptions used in the analyses include the amount of aum and the life of the investment product. these estimates and assumptions are subject to variability. for example, aum is impacted by market volatility and the level of sales, redemptions, distributions to investors and reinvested distributions. there is judgment involved in assessing whether we have the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact vies' economic performance and the obligation to absorb losses of or right to receive benefits from vies that could potentially be significant to the vies. as of september 30, 2020, we were the primary beneficiary of 43 investment product vies.
business combinations business combinations are accounted for by recognizing the acquired assets, including separately identifiable intangible assets, and assumed liabilities at their acquisition-date estimated fair values. any excess of the purchase consideration over the acquisition-date fair values of these identifiable assets and liabilities is recognized as goodwill. determining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions. during the measurement period, which is not to exceed one year from the acquisition date, we may record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, with the corresponding offset to goodwill. upon the conclusion of the measurement period, any subsequent adjustments are recorded in earnings.
intangible assets acquired in business combinations consist primarily of investment management contracts and trade names. the fair values of the acquired management contracts are based on the net present value of estimated future cash flows attributable to the contracts, which include significant assumptions about forecasts of the aum growth rate, pre-tax profit margin, discount rate, average effective fee rate and effective tax rate. the fair value of trade names is determined using the relief from royalty method based on net present value of estimated future cash flows, which include significant assumptions about royalty rate, revenue growth rate, discount rate and effective tax rate. our estimates are based on assumptions believed to be reasonable, but are inherently uncertain and unpredictable and, as a result, may differ from actual results.
the company's management contract intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives, which range from three to fifteen years, using the straight-line method, unless the asset is determined to have an indefinite useful life. indefinite-lived intangible assets represent contracts to manage investment assets for which there is no foreseeable limit on the contract period. trade names are amortized over their estimated useful lives which range from five to twenty years using the straight-line method.
on july 31, 2020, the company acquired all outstanding shares of legg mason common stock for purchase consideration of $4.5 billion in cash and $0.2 billion related to the settlement of historical compensation arrangements, and recognized $2.3 billion of goodwill, $2.7 billion of indefinite-lived intangible assets related to investment management contracts and $1.4 billion of definite-lived intangible assets primarily related to investment management contracts and trade names.
goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are tested for impairment annually and when an event occurs or circumstances change that more likely than not reduce the fair value of the related reporting unit or indefinite-lived intangible asset below its carrying value. we have one reporting unit, investment management and related services, consistent with our single operating segment, to which all goodwill has been assigned. we make significant estimates and assumptions when evaluating goodwill and other intangible assets for impairment.
58
we may first assess goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform a quantitative impairment test. the qualitative analysis considers entity-specific and macroeconomic factors and their potential impact on the key assumptions used in the determination of the fair value of the reporting unit or indefinite-lived intangible asset. a quantitative impairment test is performed if the results of the qualitative assessment indicate that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value or an indefinite-lived intangible asset is impaired, or if a qualitative assessment is not performed. quantitative tests compare the fair value of the asset to its carrying value.
the fair values of the reporting unit and indefinite-lived intangible assets are based on the net present value of estimated future cash flows, which include significant assumptions about the aum growth rate, pre-tax profit margin, discount rate, average effective fee rate and effective tax rate. the most relevant of these assumptions to the determination of estimated fair value are the aum growth rate, pre-tax profit margin and the discount rate.
we performed our annual impairment tests for goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets as of august 1, 2020. we performed a qualitative test for goodwill and a substantial portion of the indefinite-lived intangible assets and concluded it is more likely than not that the fair value of the specific intangible assets exceeds their carrying value. we performed a quantitative test for approximately 21% of indefinite-lived intangible assets, and recognized $30.0 million of impairments of indefinite-lived intangible assets. the company recognized $23.7 million of impairment of goodwill directly attributable to the company's decision to wind-down onsa, inc. which was acquired on october 24, 2019 and had not been integrated into the company. the impairments of indefinite-lived intangible assets were primarily due to a reduction in the revenue growth rate assumption for a benefit street partners' private debt fund resulting from declines in interest rates and continued market volatility. the estimated fair values of substantially all of the other indefinite-lived intangible assets exceeded their carrying values by more than 47%. we estimated the discounted future cash flows for indefinite-lived intangible assets using compounded annual aum growth rates ranging from (10.0%) to 11.6%, which were developed taking into account ongoing volatility in the capital markets, and a discount rate of 8.1%, which is based on our weighted average cost of capital. a hypothetical 200 basis point decline in the aum growth rates or a 200 basis point increase in the discount rate would not reduce the estimated fair values of the other indefinite-lived intangible assets below their carrying values.
we subsequently monitored market conditions and their potential impact on the assumptions used in the annual calculations of fair value to determine whether circumstances have changed that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of the reporting unit below its carrying value, or indicate that the other indefinite-lived intangible assets might be impaired. we considered, among other things, changes in our aum and weighted-average cost of capital by assessing whether these changes would impact the reasonableness of the assumptions used in the impairment tests as of august 1, 2020. we also monitored fluctuations of our common stock per share price to evaluate our market capitalization relative to the reporting unit as a whole. subsequent to august 1, 2020, there were no impairments of goodwill or indefinite-lived intangible assets as no events occurred or circumstances changed that would indicate these assets might be impaired.
we test definite-lived intangible assets for impairment quarterly. impairment is indicated when the carrying value of an asset is not recoverable and exceeds its fair value. recoverability is evaluated based on estimated undiscounted future cash flows using assumptions about the aum growth rate, pre-tax profit margin, average effective fee rate and expected useful life as well as royalty rate for trade name intangible assets. the most relevant of these assumptions to determine future cash flows is the aum growth rate. if the carrying value of an asset is not recoverable through undiscounted cash flows, impairment is recognized in the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the asset's fair value, as determined by discounted cash flows or other methods as appropriate for the asset type. we recognized $1.7 million of impairment of definite-lived intangible assets during fiscal year 2020 related to edinburgh partners management contracts due to the loss of a significant mandate.
while we believe that the assumptions used to estimate fair value in our impairment tests are reasonable and appropriate, future changes in the assumptions could result in recognition of impairment.
fair value measurements a substantial amount of our investments is recorded at fair value or amounts that approximate fair value on a recurring basis. we use a three-level fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value based on whether the inputs to those valuation techniques are observable or unobservable. the assessment of the hierarchy level of the assets or liabilities measured at fair value is determined based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety. see note 1 - significant accounting policies in the notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 of part ii of this annual report for more information on the fair value hierarchy.
59
as of september 30, 2020, level 3 assets represented 24% of total assets measured at fair value, substantially all of which related to cips' investments in equity and debt securities, and real estate. there were $2.3 million of transfers into and $1.1 million of transfers out of level 3 during fiscal year 2020.
the following are descriptions of the significant assets measured at fair value and their fair value methodologies.
sponsored funds and separate accounts consist primarily of investments in nonconsolidated sponsored funds and to a lesser extent, separate accounts. changes in the fair value of the investments are recognized as gains and losses in earnings. the fair values of funds are determined based on their published nav or estimated using nav as a practical expedient. the fair values of separate accounts are determined using quoted market prices, or independent third-party broker or dealer price quotes if quoted market prices are not available.
investments related to long-term incentive plans consist primarily of investments in sponsored funds related to certain compensation plans that have certain vesting provisions. changes in fair value are recognized as gains and losses in earnings. the fair values of the investments are determined based on the funds' published nav or estimated using nav as a practical expedient.
other equity and debt securities consist of other equity investment securities and debt securities classified as trading or available-for-sale. changes in the fair value of other equity and trading debt securities are recognized as gains and losses in earnings. unrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale securities are recorded net of tax as part of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) until realized, at which time they are recognized in earnings using the average cost method. the fair values of equity securities other than funds are determined using independent third-party broker or dealer price quotes or based on discounted cash flows using significant unobservable inputs. the fair values of debt securities are determined using independent third-party broker or dealer price quotes or based on discounted cash flows using significant unobservable inputs.
investments of cips consist of marketable debt and equity securities and other investments that are not generally traded in active markets. changes in the fair value of the investments are recognized as gains and losses in earnings. the fair values of marketable securities are determined using quoted market prices, or independent third-party broker or dealer price quotes if quoted market prices are not available. the investments that are not generally traded in active markets consist of equity and debt securities of entities in emerging markets, fund products, other equity and debt instruments, real estate and loans. the fair values are determined using significant unobservable inputs in either a market-based or income-based approach, except for fund products, for which fair values are estimated using nav as a practical expedient.
noncontrolling interests consist of third-party equity interests in cips and minority interests in certain subsidiaries. noncontrolling interests that are redeemable or convertible for cash or other assets at the option of the noncontrolling interest holders and are classified as temporary equity at fair value, except when the fair value is less than the issuance date fair value, the reported amount is the issuance date fair value. changes in fair value of redeemable noncontrolling interest is recognized as an adjustment to retained earnings. nonredeemable noncontrolling interests do not permit the noncontrolling interest holders to request settlement, are reported at their issuance value and undistributed net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests.
the fair value of third-party equity interests in cips are determined based on the published nav or estimated using nav a practical expedient. the fair value of redeemable noncontrolling interests related to minority interest in certain subsidiaries are derived using discounted cash flows and guideline public company methodology, which include significant assumptions about forecasts of the aum growth rate, pre-tax profit margin, discount rate and operating income multiples.
revenues we earn revenue primarily from providing investment management and related services to our customers. in addition to investment management, services include fund administration, sales and distribution, and shareholder servicing. revenues are recognized when our obligations related to the services are satisfied and it is probable that a significant reversal of the revenue amount would not occur in future periods. the obligations are satisfied over time as the services are rendered, except for the sales and distribution obligations for the sale of shares of sponsored funds, which are satisfied on trade date. multiple services included in customer contracts are accounted for separately when the obligations are determined to be distinct. management judgement is involved in assessing the probability of significant revenue reversal and in the identification of distinct services.
60
fees from providing investment management and fund administration services ("investment management fees"), other than performance-based investment management fees, are determined based on a percentage of aum, primarily on a monthly basis using daily average aum, and are recognized as the services are performed over time. performance-based investment management fees are generated when investment products' performance exceeds targets established in customer contracts. these fees are recognized when the amount is no longer probable of significant reversal and may relate to investment management services that were provided in prior periods.
sales and distribution fees primarily consist of upfront sales commissions and ongoing distribution fees. sales commissions are based on contractual rates for sales of certain classes of sponsored funds and are recognized on trade date. distribution service fees are determined based on a percentage of aum, primarily on a monthly basis using daily average aum. as the fee amounts are uncertain on trade date, they are recognized over time as the amounts become known and may relate to sales and distribution services provided in prior periods.
aum is generally based on the fair value of the underlying securities held by investment products and is calculated using fair value methods derived primarily from unadjusted quoted market prices, unadjusted independent third-party broker or dealer price quotes in active markets, or market prices or price quotes adjusted for observable price movements after the close of the primary market. the fair values of securities for which market prices are not readily available are valued internally using various methodologies which incorporate significant unobservable inputs as appropriate for each security type. pricing of the securities is governed by our global valuation and pricing policy, which defines valuation and pricing conventions for each security type, including practices for responding to unexpected or unusual market events.
as substantially all of our aum is valued based on observable market prices or inputs, market risk is the most significant risk underlying the valuation of our aum.
income taxes deferred tax assets and liabilities are recorded for temporary differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and the reported amounts in the consolidated financial statements using the statutory tax rates in effect for the year when the reported amount of the asset or liability is expected to be recovered or settled, respectively. the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income tax expense in the period that includes the enactment date. a valuation allowance is recorded to reduce the carrying values of deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized. for each tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return, we determine whether it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination based on the technical merits of the position, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation. a tax position that meets the more likely than not recognition threshold is measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized upon settlement.
as a multinational corporation, we operate in various locations outside the u.s. and generate earnings worldwide. we repatriate the foreign earnings that are in excess of regulatory, capital or operational requirements of all of our non-u.s. subsidiaries.
loss contingencies we are involved in various lawsuits and claims encountered in the normal course of business. when such a matter arises and periodically thereafter, we consult with our legal counsel and evaluate the merits of the claims based on the facts available at that time. in management's opinion, an adequate accrual has been made as of september 30, 2020 to provide for any probable losses that may arise from such matters for which we could reasonably estimate an amount. see also note 16 - commitments and contingencies in the notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 of part ii of this annual report.

item 7.    management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion is intended to assist you in understanding our results of operations and our present financial condition. our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10-k contain additional information that should be referred to when reviewing this material.
overview financial and operating overview financial and operating results for the year ended december 31, 2020 compared to the year ended december 31, 2019 are as follows:
•natural gas production decreased 7.6 bcf, or one percent, from 865.3 bcf in 2019 to 857.7 bcf in 2020. the slight decrease was driven by strategic curtailments of production during a portion of the second half of 2020 due to weaker natural gas prices.
•average realized natural gas price for 2020 was $1.68 per mcf, 31 percent lower than the $2.45 per mcf price realized in 2019.
•total capital expenditures were $569.8 million in 2020 compared to $783.3 million in 2019.
•drilled 74 gross wells (64.3 net) with a success rate of 100 percent in 2020 compared to 96 gross wells (94.0 net) with a success rate of 100 percent in 2019.
•completed 86 gross wells (77.3 net) in 2020 compared to 99 gross wells (97.0 net) in 2019.
•average rig count during 2020 was approximately 2.3 rigs in the marcellus shale, compared to an average rig count in the marcellus shale of approximately 3.1 rigs during 2019.
•repaid $87.0 million of our 6.51% weighted-average senior notes, which matured in july 2020.
market conditions and commodity prices our financial results depend on many factors, particularly commodity prices and our ability to market our production on economically attractive terms. commodity prices are affected by many factors outside of our control, including changes in market supply and demand, which are impacted by pipeline capacity constraints, inventory storage levels, basis differentials, weather conditions and other factors. our realized prices are also further impacted by our hedging activities.
our revenues, operating results, financial condition and ability to borrow funds or obtain additional capital depend substantially on prevailing commodity prices, particularly natural gas prices. since substantially all of our production and reserves are natural gas, significant declines in natural gas prices could have a material adverse effect on our operating results, financial condition, liquidity and ability to obtain financing. lower natural gas prices also may reduce the amount of natural gas that we can produce economically. in addition, in periods of low natural gas prices, we may elect to curtail a portion of our production from time to time. historically, natural gas prices have been volatile, with prices fluctuating widely, and they are likely to continue to be volatile. as a result, we cannot accurately predict future commodity prices and, therefore, cannot determine with any degree of certainty what effect increases or decreases in these prices will have on our capital program, production volumes or revenues. in addition to commodity prices and production volumes, finding and developing sufficient amounts of natural gas reserves at economical costs are critical to our long-term success.
we account for our derivative instruments on a mark-to-market basis with changes in fair value recognized in operating revenues in the consolidated statement of operations. as a result of these mark-to-market adjustments associated with our derivative instruments, we will experience volatility in our earnings due to commodity price volatility. refer to "impact of derivative instruments on operating revenues" below and note 6 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for more information.
the ongoing covid-19 outbreak, which the world health organization (who) declared as a pandemic on march 11, 2020, has reached more than 200 countries and territories and there continues to be considerable uncertainty regarding the extent to which covid-19 will continue to spread, the development, availability and administration of effective treatments and vaccines and the extent and duration of governmental and other measures implemented to try to slow the spread of the virus and alleviate strain on the healthcare system and the economic impact of such actions. one of the impacts of the covid-19
pandemic has been a significant reduction in demand for crude oil, and to a lesser extent, natural gas. the supply/demand imbalance driven by the covid-19 pandemic, as well as production disagreements among members of opec+, has led to significant global economic contraction generally and continues to have disruptive impacts on the oil and gas industry. while subsequent negotiations between members of opec+ led to an agreement to reduce production volumes in an effort to stabilize crude oil prices, crude oil prices remained at depressed levels throughout 2020 and continue to remain at depressed levels in 2021, as the oversupply and lack of demand in the market persist. natural gas prices remained low during 2020 compared to 2019, including during the second half of 2020, in part, due to lower seasonal demand during the shoulder season of 2020 and storage levels nearing capacity. in response to the weakness of natural gas prices, we strategically curtailed our production during the second half of 2020, resulting in an estimated curtailment of approximately 16.1 bcf of gross production.
meanwhile, nymex natural gas futures prices have shown improvements since the implementation of pandemic-related restrictions and opec+ price disagreements. the improvements in natural gas futures prices are based on market expectations that declines in future natural gas supplies due to a substantial reduction of associated gas related to the curtailment of operations in oil basins throughout the united states will more than offset the lower demand recently experienced with the covid-19 pandemic. while the current outlook on natural gas prices is favorable and our operations have not been significantly impacted in the short-term, in the event these disruptions continue for an extended period of time, our operations could be adversely impacted, commodity prices could continue to decline further and our costs may increase. while we are unable to predict future commodity prices, at current natural gas price levels, we do not believe that an impairment of our oil and gas properties is reasonably likely to occur in the near future; however, in the event that commodity prices significantly decline from current levels, management would evaluate the recoverability of the carrying value of our oil and gas properties.
we have implemented preventative measures and developed response plans intended to minimize unnecessary risk of exposure and prevent infection among our employees and the communities in which we operate. we also have modified certain business practices (including those related to nonoperational employee work locations and the cancellation of physical participation in meetings, events and conferences) to conform to government restrictions and best practices encouraged by the centers for disease control and prevention, the who and other governmental and regulatory authorities. in addition, we implemented and provided training on a covid-19 safety policy containing personal safety protocols; provided additional personal protective equipment to our workforce; implemented rigorous covid-19 self-assessment, contract tracing and quarantine protocols; increased cleaning protocols at all of our employee work locations; and provided additional paid leave to employees with actual or presumed covid-19 cases. we also collaborated, and continue to collaborate, with customers to minimize potential impacts to or disruptions of our operations and to implement longer-term emergency response protocols. we will continue to monitor developments affecting our workforce, our customers, our service providers and the communities in which we operate, including any resurgence in covid-19 transmission and infection, and take additional precautions as we believe are warranted.
our efforts to respond to the challenges presented by the on-going pandemic, as well as certain operational decisions we previously implemented such as our maintenance capital program, have helped to minimize the impact, and any resulting disruptions, of the pandemic to our business and operations. we have not required any funding under any federal or other governmental programs to support our operations, and we do not expect to have to utilize any such funding. as a result, we currently believe that we are well-positioned to manage the challenges presented in a lower commodity pricing environment and can endure the current cyclical downturn in the energy industry and continued volatility in current and future commodity prices by:
•continuing to exercise discipline in our capital program with the expectation of funding our capital expenditures with cash on hand, operating cash flows, and if required, borrowings under our revolving credit facility;
•continuing to manage our portfolio by strategically curtailing production in periods of weaker natural gas prices;
•continuing to optimize our drilling, completion and operational efficiencies, resulting in lower operating costs per unit of production;
•continuing to manage our balance sheet, which we believe provides sufficient availability under our revolving credit facility and existing cash balances to meet our capital requirements and maintain compliance with our debt covenants; and
•continuing to manage price risk by strategically hedging our production.
the impact that covid-19 will have on our business, cash flows, liquidity, financial condition and results of operations will depend on future developments, including, among others, the duration, ultimate geographic spread and severity of the virus, any resurgence in covid-19 transmission and infection in affected regions after they have begun to experience an improvement, the consequences of governmental and other measures designed to mitigate the spread of the virus and alleviate strain on the healthcare system, the development of effective treatments, actions taken by governmental authorities, customers, suppliers and other third parties, workforce availability, and the timing and extent to which normal economic and operating conditions resume.
for information about the impact of realized commodity prices on our revenues, refer to "results of operations" below.
financial condition capital resources and liquidity our primary sources of cash in 2020 were from the sale of natural gas production, including the receipt of derivative cash settlements and certain income tax receivables related to alternative minimum tax credit refunds. these cash flows were used to fund our capital expenditures, principal and interest payments on debt and payment of dividends. see below for additional discussion and analysis of our cash flows.
the borrowing base under the terms of our revolving credit facility is redetermined annually in april. in addition, either we or the banks may request an interim redetermination twice a year or in connection with certain acquisitions or divestitures of oil and gas properties. effective april 23, 2020, the borrowing base and available commitments were reaffirmed at $3.2 billion and $1.5 billion, respectively. as of december 31, 2020, there were no borrowings outstanding under our revolving credit facility and our unused commitments remained at $1.5 billion.
a decline in commodity prices could result in the future reduction of our borrowing base and related commitments under our revolving credit facility. unless commodity prices decline significantly from current levels, we do not believe that any such reductions would have a significant impact on our ability to service our debt and fund our drilling program and related operations.
we strive to manage our debt at a level below the available credit line in order to maintain borrowing capacity. our revolving credit facility includes a covenant limiting our total debt. we believe that, with internally generated operating cash flow, cash on hand and availability under our revolving credit facility, we have the capacity to finance our spending plans.
at december 31, 2020, we were in compliance with all restrictive financial covenants for both our revolving credit facility and senior notes. refer to note 5 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for further details regarding restrictive covenants.
cash flows our cash flows from operating activities, investing activities and financing activities are as follows:
year ended december 31,
(in thousands)                                                                           2020   2019                            2018
cash flows provided by operating activities                                      $778,235                      $1,445,791                      $1,104,903
cash flows used in investing activities                                         (584,478)                       (543,915)                       (293,383)
cash flows used in financing activities                                         (255,849)                       (690,380)                     (1,289,280)
net (decrease) increase in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash           $(62,092)                        $211,496                      $(477,760)
operating activities. operating cash flow fluctuations are substantially driven by commodity prices, changes in our production volumes and operating expenses. commodity prices have historically been volatile, primarily as a result of supply and demand for natural gas, pipeline infrastructure constraints, basis differentials, inventory storage levels, seasonal influences, and other factors. in addition, fluctuations in cash flow may result in an increase or decrease in our capital expenditures.
our working capital is substantially influenced by the variables discussed above and fluctuates based on the timing and amount of borrowings and repayments under our revolving credit facility, repayments of debt, the timing of cash collections and payments on our trade accounts receivable and payable, respectively, payment of dividends, repurchases of our securities and changes in the fair value of our commodity derivative activity. from time to time, our working capital will reflect a deficit, while at other times it will reflect a surplus. this fluctuation is not unusual. at december 31, 2020 and 2019, we had a working capital surplus of $25.5 million and $240.2 million, respectively. we believe we have adequate liquidity and availability under our revolving credit facility to meet our working capital requirements over the next twelve months.
net cash provided by operating activities in 2020 decreased by $667.6 million compared to 2019. this decrease was primarily due to lower natural gas revenue and lower derivative settlement gains. these decreases were partially offset by favorable changes in working capital and other assets and liabilities. the decrease in natural gas revenue was primarily due to a decrease in realized natural gas prices and marginally lower natural gas production. average realized natural gas prices decreased by 31 percent in 2020 compared to 2019. natural gas production decreased by one percent for 2020 compared to 2019, which was driven by strategic curtailments of production during a portion of the second half of 2020 due to weaker natural gas prices.
refer to "results of operations" for additional information relative to commodity price, production and operating expense fluctuations. we are unable to predict future commodity prices and, as a result, cannot provide any assurance about future levels of net cash provided by operating activities.
investing activities. cash flows used in investing activities increased by $40.6 million from 2019 compared to 2020. the increase was due to lower proceeds of $258.8 million from sale of our investment in meade in november 2019 and constitution in january 2020, partially offset by $212.5 million of lower capital expenditures as a result of the implementation of our maintenance capital program in 2020 and $9.3 million of lower capital contributions associated with our equity method investments.
financing activities. cash flows used in financing activities decreased by $434.5 million from 2019 compared to 2020. the decrease was due to $519.9 million of lower repurchases of our common stock in 2020 compared to 2019 and $7.4 million of lower debt issuance costs associated with the amendment of our revolving credit facility in 2019. these decreases were partially offset by $80.0 million higher net repayments of debt primarily related to maturities of certain of our senior notes in 2020 and $13.9 million of higher dividend payments related to an increase in our dividend rate in 2019.
2019 and 2018 compared. for additional information on the comparison of operating, investing and financing cash flows for the year ended december 31, 2018 compared to the year ended december 31, 2019, refer to financial condition (cash flows) included in the cabot oil & gas corporation annual report on form 10-k for the year ended december 31, 2019.

amounts related to our asset retirement obligations are not included in the above table due to the uncertainty regarding the actual timing of such expenditures. the total amount of our asset retirement obligations at december 31, 2020 was $86.0 million. refer to note 8 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for further details.
we have no off-balance sheet debt or other similar unrecorded obligations.
potential impact of our critical accounting policies our significant accounting policies are described in note 1 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements. the preparation of the consolidated financial statements, which is in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states, requires management to make certain estimates and judgments that affect the amounts reported in our financial statements and the related disclosures of assets and liabilities. the following accounting policies are our most critical policies requiring more significant judgments and estimates. we evaluate our estimates and assumptions on a regular basis. actual results could differ from those estimates.
successful efforts method of accounting we follow the successful efforts method of accounting for our oil and gas producing activities. acquisition costs for proved and unproved properties are capitalized when incurred. judgment is required to determine the proper classification of wells designated as developmental or exploratory, which will ultimately determine the proper accounting treatment of costs incurred. exploration costs, including geological and geophysical costs, the costs of carrying and retaining unproved properties and exploratory dry hole costs are expensed. development costs, including costs to drill and equip development wells and successful exploratory drilling costs to locate proved reserves, are capitalized.
oil and gas reserves the process of estimating quantities of proved reserves is inherently imprecise, and the reserves data included in this document is only an estimate. the process relies on interpretations and judgment of available geological, geophysical, engineering and production data. the extent, quality and reliability of this technical data can vary. the process also requires certain economic assumptions, some of which are mandated by the sec, such as commodity prices. additional assumptions include drilling and operating expenses, capital expenditures, taxes and availability of funds. any significant variance in the interpretations or assumptions could materially affect the estimated quantity and value of our reserves and can change substantially over time. periodic revisions to the estimated reserves and future cash flows may be necessary as a result of reservoir performance, drilling activity, commodity prices, fluctuations in operating expenses, technological advances, new geological or geophysical data or other economic factors. accordingly, reserve estimates are generally different from the quantities ultimately recovered. we cannot predict the amounts or timing of such future revisions.
our reserves estimate has been prepared by our petroleum engineering staff and audited by miller and lents, independent petroleum engineers, who in their opinion determined the estimates presented to be reasonable in the aggregate. for more information regarding reserve estimation, including historical reserve revisions, refer to the supplemental oil and gas information to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8.
our rate of recording depreciation, depletion and amortization (dd&a) expense is dependent upon our estimate of proved and proved developed reserves, which are utilized in our unit-of-production calculation. if the estimates of proved reserves were to be reduced, the rate at which we record dd&a expense would increase, reducing net income. such a reduction in reserves may result from lower market prices, which may make it uneconomic to drill and produce higher cost fields. a five percent positive or negative revision to proved reserves would result in a decrease of $0.02 per mcfe and an increase of $0.02 per mcfe, respectively, on our dd&a rate. this estimated impact is based on current data, and actual events could require different adjustments to our dd&a rate.
in addition, a decline in proved reserve estimates may impact the outcome of our impairment test under applicable accounting standards. due to the inherent imprecision of the reserve estimation process, risks associated with the operations of proved producing properties and market sensitive commodity prices utilized in our impairment analysis, we cannot determine if an impairment is reasonably likely to occur in the future.
oil and gas properties we evaluate our proved oil and gas properties for impairment on a field-by-field basis whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate an asset's carrying amount may not be recoverable. we compare expected undiscounted future cash flows to the net book value of the asset. if the future undiscounted expected cash flows, based on our estimate of future commodity prices, operating costs and anticipated production from proved reserves and risk-adjusted probable and possible reserves, are lower than the net book value of the asset, the capitalized cost is reduced to fair value. commodity pricing is estimated by using a combination of assumptions management uses in its budgeting and forecasting process, historical and current prices adjusted for geographical location and quality differentials, as well as other factors that we believe will impact realizable prices. in the event that commodity prices significantly decline, we would test the recoverability of the carrying value of our oil and gas properties and, if necessary, record an impairment charge. fair value is calculated by discounting the future cash flows. the discount factor used is based on rates utilized by market participants that are commensurate with the risks inherent in the development and production of the underlying natural gas and oil.
unproved oil and gas properties are assessed periodically for impairment on an aggregate basis through periodic updates to our undeveloped acreage amortization based on past drilling and exploration experience, our expectation of converting leases to held by production and average property lives. average property lives are determined on a geographical basis and based on the estimated life of unproved property leasehold rights. historically, the average property life in each of the geographical areas has not significantly changed and generally range from three to five years. the commodity price environment may impact the capital available for exploration projects as well as development drilling.
as these properties are developed and reserves are proved, the remaining capitalized costs are subject to depreciation and depletion. if the development of these properties is deemed unsuccessful and the properties are abandoned or surrendered, the capitalized costs related to the unsuccessful activity are expensed in the year the determination is made. the rate at which the unproved properties are written off depends on the timing and success of our future exploration and development program.
asset retirement obligations the majority of our asset retirement obligations (aro) relate to the plugging and abandonment of oil and gas wells. we record the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation in the period in which it is incurred, with the associated asset retirement cost capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the related long-lived asset. the recognition of an asset retirement obligation requires management to make assumptions that include estimated plugging and abandonment costs, timing of settlements, inflation rates and discount rate. in periods subsequent to initial measurement, the asset retirement cost is depreciated using the units-of-production method, while increases in the discounted aro liability resulting from the passage of time (accretion expense) are reflected as depreciation, depletion and amortization expense.
derivative instruments under applicable accounting standards, the fair value of each derivative instrument is recorded as either an asset or liability on the balance sheet. at the end of each quarterly period, these instruments are marked-to-market. the change in fair value of derivatives not designated as hedges are recorded as a component of operating revenues in gain (loss) on derivative instruments in the consolidated statement of operations.
our derivative contracts are measured based on quotes from our counterparties or internal models. such quotes and models have been derived using an income approach that considers various inputs including current market and contractual prices for the underlying instruments, quoted forward commodity prices, basis differentials, volatility factors and interest rates for a similar length of time as the derivative contract term, as applicable. these estimates are derived from or verified using relevant nymex futures contracts or are compared to multiple quotes obtained from counterparties for reasonableness. the determination of fair value also incorporates a credit adjustment for non-performance risk. we measure the non-performance risk of our counterparties by reviewing credit default swap spreads for the various financial institutions with which we have derivative transactions, while our non-performance risk is evaluated using a market credit spread provided by one of our banks.
our financial condition, results of operations and liquidity can be significantly impacted by changes in the market value of our derivative instruments due to volatility of commodity prices, both nymex and basis differentials.
income taxes we make certain estimates and judgments in determining our income tax expense for financial reporting purposes. these estimates and judgments include the calculation of certain deferred tax assets and liabilities that arise from differences in the timing and recognition of revenue and expenses for tax and financial reporting purposes and estimating reserves for potential adverse outcomes regarding tax positions that we have taken. we account for the uncertainty in income taxes using a recognition and measurement threshold for tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position is recognized when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination by taxing authorities based on technical merits of the position. the amount of the tax benefit recognized is the largest amount of the benefit that has a greater than 50 percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. the effective tax rate and the tax basis of assets and liabilities reflect management's estimates of the ultimate outcome of various tax uncertainties.
we believe all of our deferred tax assets, net of any valuation allowances, will ultimately be realized, taking into consideration our forecasted future taxable income, which includes consideration of future operating conditions specifically related to commodity prices. if our estimates and judgments change regarding our ability to realize our deferred tax assets, our tax provision could increase in the period it is determined that it is more likely than not it will not be realized.
our effective tax rate is subject to variability as a result of factors other than changes in federal and state tax rates and/or changes in tax laws which could affect us. our effective tax rate is affected by changes in the allocation of property, payroll and revenues among states in which we operate. a small change in our estimated future tax rate could have a material effect on current period earnings.
contingency reserves a provision for contingencies is charged to expense when the loss is probable and the cost is estimable. the establishment of a reserve is based on an estimation process that includes the advice of legal counsel and subjective judgment of management. in certain cases, our judgment is based on the advice and opinions of legal counsel and other advisors, the interpretation of laws and regulations, which can be interpreted differently by regulators and courts of laws, our experience and the experiences of other companies dealing with similar matters, and our decision on how we intend to respond to a particular matter. actual losses can differ from estimates for various reasons, including those noted above. we monitor known and potential legal, environmental and other contingencies and make our best estimate based on the information we have. future changes in facts and circumstances not currently foreseeable could result in the actual liability exceeding the estimated ranges of loss and amounts accrued.
stock-based compensation we account for stock-based compensation under the fair value method of accounting in accordance with applicable accounting standards. under the fair value method, compensation cost is measured at the grant date for equity-classified awards and remeasured each reporting period for liability-classified awards based on the fair value of an award and is recognized over the service period, which is generally the vesting period. to calculate fair value, we use a monte carlo valuation model, as determined by the specific provisions of the award. the use of this model requires significant judgment with respect to expected life, volatility and other factors. stock-based compensation cost for all types of awards is included in general and administrative expense in the consolidated statement of operations. refer to note 14 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for a full discussion of our stock-based compensation.
recently adopted accounting pronouncements refer to note 1 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements, "summary of significant accounting policies," for a discussion of recently adopted accounting pronouncements.
other issues and contingencies regulations our operations are subject to various types of regulation by federal, state and local authorities. refer to the "other business matters" section of item 1 for a discussion of these regulations.
restrictive covenants our ability to incur debt and to make certain types of investments is subject to certain restrictive covenants in our various debt instruments. among other requirements, our senior note agreements and our revolving credit agreement specify a minimum annual coverage ratio of consolidated cash flow to interest expense for the trailing four quarters of 2.8 to 1.0 and a minimum asset coverage ratio of the present value of proved reserves before income taxes plus adjusted cash to indebtedness and other liabilities of 1.75 to 1.0. our revolving credit agreement also requires us to maintain a minimum current ratio of 1.0 to 1.0. at december 31, 2020, we were in compliance with all restrictive financial covenants in both our senior note agreements and our revolving credit agreement.
operating risks and insurance coverage our business involves a variety of operating risks. refer to "risk factors-business and operational risks-we face a variety of hazards and risks that could cause substantial financial losses" in item 1a. in accordance with customary industry practice, we maintain insurance against some, but not all, of these risks and losses. the occurrence of any of these events not fully covered by insurance could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. the costs of these insurance policies are somewhat dependent on our historical claims experience, the areas in which we operate and market conditions.
commodity pricing and risk management activities our revenues, operating results, financial condition and ability to borrow funds or obtain additional capital depend substantially on prevailing commodity prices. further declines in commodity prices may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, liquidity, ability to obtain financing and operating results. lower commodity prices also may reduce the amount of natural gas that we can produce economically. historically, commodity prices have been volatile, with prices fluctuating widely, and they are likely to continue to be volatile. depressed prices in the future would have a negative impact on our future financial results. in particular, substantially lower prices would significantly reduce revenue and could potentially trigger an impairment of our oil and gas properties or a violation of certain financial debt covenants. because substantially all of our reserves are natural gas, changes in natural gas prices have a more significant impact on our financial results.
the majority of our production is sold at market prices. generally, if the related commodity index declines, the price that we receive for our production will also decline. therefore, the amount of revenue that we realize is determined by certain factors that are beyond our control. however, we may mitigate this price risk on a portion of our anticipated production with the use of financial commodity derivatives, including collars and swaps to reduce the impact of sustained lower pricing on our revenue. under both arrangements, there is also a risk that the movement of index prices may result in our inability to realize the full benefit of an improvement in market conditions.
results of operations
2020 and 2019 compared we reported net income for 2020 of $200.5 million, or $0.50 per share, compared to net income for 2019 of $681.1 million, or $1.64 per share. the decrease in net income was primarily due to lower operating revenues and lower earnings on equity method investments, partially offset by lower operating and income tax expenses.

the decrease in natural gas revenues of $580.3 million was due to lower production and lower natural gas prices. the slight decrease in production was driven by strategic curtailments of production during a portion of the second half of 2020 due to weaker natural gas prices.

total costs and expenses from operations decreased by $19.0 million from 2019 to 2020. the primary reasons for this fluctuation are as follows:
•direct operations decreased $3.6 million primarily due to lower production and continued efficiencies in our operations in the marcellus shale offset by higher workover expenses during the period.
•transportation and gathering decreased $3.6 million due to lower throughput as a result of lower marcellus shale production, partially offset by higher demand charges.
•taxes other than income decreased $2.7 million due to $3.5 million lower drilling impact fees driven by a decrease in rates associated with lower natural gas prices and a decrease in drilling activity in 2020 compared to 2019, partially offset by a $1.1 million decrease in production tax refunds that were received in 2019.
•exploration decreased $4.9 million primarily due to a $3.5 million decrease in geological and geophysical expenses, $1.3 million decrease in employee costs and $0.9 million decrease in other exploration costs. these decreases were partially offset by higher exploratory dry hole costs of $1.4 million.
•depreciation, depletion and amortization decreased $14.8 million primarily due to lower amortization of unproved properties of $24.4 million, partially offset by higher dd&a of $8.3 million. amortization of unproved properties decreased due to lower amortization rates as a result of a decrease in exploration activities. the increase in dd&a was primarily due to an increase of $11.5 million related to a higher dd&a rate of $0.43 per mcfe for 2020 compared to $0.42 per mcfe for 2019, partially offset by a decrease of $3.2 million due to lower natural gas production volumes in the marcellus shale.
•general and administrative increased $10.5 million primarily due to a $12.4 million increase in stock-based compensation expense associated with certain of our market-based performance awards and a $5.0 million increase in legal expenses. these increases were partially offset by $2.5 million of lower severance costs that were incurred in the third quarter 2019 and a $5.0 million decrease in employee-related costs. the remaining changes in other general and administrative expense were not individually significant.
(loss) earnings on equity method investments earnings on equity method investments decreased $80.6 million primarily due to the sale of our investment in meade in the fourth quarter of 2019 for a gain of $75.8 million and constitution in february 2020 for a loss of $9.4 million that was previously accrued in 2019. there was no significant activity during 2020.
interest expense, net interest expense decreased $0.8 million primarily due to $2.7 million of lower interest expense related to the repayment of $87.0 million of our 6.51% weighted-average senior notes, which matured in july 2020 and $3.5 million of interest income associated with certain income tax refunds received in the fourth quarter of 2020. these decreases were partially offset by a $3.1 million reversal of interest expense in 2019 related to certain income tax reserves previously recorded in prior periods.
income tax expense income tax expense decreased $178.6 million due to lower pretax income and a lower effective tax rate. the effective tax rates for 2020 and 2019 were 16.8 percent and 24.3 percent, respectively. the decrease in the effective tax rate is primarily due to research and development tax credit benefits recorded in 2020 related to amended prior year returns.
2019 and 2018 compared we reported net income for 2019 of $681.1 million, or $1.64 per share, compared to net income for 2018 of $557.0 million, or $1.25 per share. the increase in net income was primarily due to lower operating expenses and interest expense and higher earnings on equity method investments. these increases were partially offset by lower operating revenues and higher income tax expense.
for additional information on the comparison of the results of operations for the year ended december 31, 2019 compared to the year ended december 31, 2018, refer to management's discussion and analysis included in the cabot oil & gas corporation annual report on form 10-k for the year ended december 31, 2019.
non-gaap financial measures explanation and reconciliation of non-gaap financial measures we report our financial results in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states (gaap). however, we believe certain non-gaap performance measures may provide financial statement users with additional meaningful comparisons between current results and results of prior periods. in addition, we believe these measures are used by analysts and others in the valuation, rating and investment recommendations of companies within the oil and natural gas exploration and production industry. the reconciliations of gaap financial measures to non-gaap financial measures presented in this annual report on form 10-k are shown below.
reconciliation of net income to adjusted net income adjusted net income is presented based on our belief that this non-gaap measure enables a user of the financial information to understand the impact of these items on reported results. adjusted net income is defined as net income plus gain and loss on sale of assets, gain and loss on derivative instruments, gain on sale of equity method investments, stock-based compensation expense, severance expense, interest expense related to income tax reserves and tax effect on selected items. additionally, this presentation provides a beneficial comparison to similarly adjusted measurements of prior periods. adjusted net income is not a measure of financial performance under gaap and should not be considered as an alternative to net income, as defined by gaap.

discretionary cash flow and free cash flow calculation and reconciliation discretionary cash flow is defined as net cash provided by operating activities excluding changes in assets and liabilities. discretionary cash flow is widely accepted as a financial indicator of an oil and gas company's ability to generate cash which is used to internally fund exploration and development activities, return capital to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases, and service debt. discretionary cash flow is presented based on our belief that this non-gaap measure is useful information to investors when comparing our cash flows with the cash flows of other companies that use the full cost method of accounting for oil and gas producing activities or have different financing and capital structures or tax rates. discretionary cash flow is not a measure of financial performance under gaap and should not be considered as an alternative to cash flows from operating activities or net income, as defined by gaap, or as a measure of liquidity.
free cash flow is defined as discretionary cash flow (defined above) less capital expenditures and investment in equity method investments. free cash flow is an indicator of a company's ability to generate cash flow after spending the money required to maintain or expand its asset base. free cash flow is presented based on our belief that this non-gaap measure is useful information to investors when comparing our cash flows with the cash flows of other companies. free cash flow is not a measure of financial performance under gaap and should not be considered as an alternative to cash flows from operating activities or net income, as defined by gaap, or as a measure of liquidity.

finding and development costs drill-bit finding and development cost is defined as costs incurred in exploration and development activities, as defined by gaap, divided by reserve extensions, discoveries and other additions. additions-only finding and development cost is defined as costs incurred in property acquisition, exploration and development activities, as defined by gaap, divided by reserve extensions, discoveries and other additions. all-sources finding and development cost is defined as costs incurred in property acquisition, exploration and development activities as defined by gaap divided by the total of reserve extensions, discoveries and other additions and revision of prior estimates. drill-bit finding and development cost, additions-only finding and development cost and all-sources finding and development cost are presented based on our belief that these non-gaap measures are useful information to investors to evaluate how much it costs to add proved reserves. these calculations do not include the future development costs required for the development of proved undeveloped reserves and may not be comparable to similarly titled measurements used by other companies.

item 7.    management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations introduction borgwarner inc. and consolidated subsidiaries (the "company") is a global product leader in clean and efficient technology solutions for combustion, hybrid and electric vehicles. our products help improve vehicle performance, propulsion efficiency, stability and air quality. these products are manufactured and sold worldwide, primarily to original equipment manufacturers ("oems") of light vehicles (passenger cars, sport-utility vehicles ("suvs"), vans and light trucks). the company's products are also sold to other oems of commercial vehicles (medium-duty trucks, heavy-duty trucks and buses) and off-highway vehicles (agricultural and construction machinery and marine applications). we also manufacture and sell our products to certain tier one vehicle systems suppliers and into the aftermarket for light, commercial and off-highway vehicles. the company operates manufacturing facilities serving customers in europe, the americas and asia and is an original equipment supplier to nearly every major automotive oem in the world.
acquisition of delphi technologies plc on october 1, 2020, the company completed its acquisition of 100% of the outstanding ordinary shares of delphi technologies plc ("delphi technologies") from the shareholders of delphi technologies pursuant to the terms of the transaction agreement, dated january 28, 2020, as amended on may 6, 2020, by and between the company and delphi technologies (the "transaction agreement"). pursuant to the terms of the transaction agreement, the company issued, in exchange for each delphi technologies share, 0.4307 of a share of common stock of the company and cash in lieu of any fractional share. in the aggregate, the company delivered consideration of approximately $2.4 billion, including approximately 37 million shares of common stock of the company, valued at $1.5 billion, repayment of approximately $900 million of delphi technologies' debt and stock-based compensation of approximately $15 million. upon closing, the company also assumed approximately $800 million in senior notes as discussed below. the acquisition is expected to strengthen the company's electronics and power electronics products, capabilities and scale, position the company for greater growth as electrified propulsion systems gain momentum and enhance key combustion, commercial vehicle and aftermarket product offerings.
on october 5, 2020, the company completed its offer to exchange approximately $800 million in aggregate principal amount of delphi technologies' outstanding 5.000% senior notes due 2025 (the "dt notes"). approximately $776 million in aggregate principal amount of outstanding dt notes, representing 97% of the $800 million total outstanding principal amount of the dt notes, were validly exchanged and cancelled for new borgwarner notes. following such cancellation, approximately $24 million in aggregate principal amount of the dt notes remain outstanding. since the majority of the dt notes were exchanged, the company was able to eliminate substantially all of the restrictive covenants and events of default not related to payment on the $800 million in outstanding senior notes of the company.
following the delphi technologies acquisition, to align with the manner in which the business is viewed and managed subsequent to the acquisition, the company reorganized its management reporting structure. previously, the company reported its results under two reporting segments, engine and drivetrain, which are now referred to as air management and e-propulsion & drivetrain, respectively. the former delphi technologies powertrain products segment was integrated into the air management segment and the former delphi technologies electronics & electrification segment was integrated into the e-propulsion & drivetrain segment. the remaining delphi technologies segments comprise two additional reporting segments, which are referred to as fuel injection and aftermarket.
results of operations for delphi technologies are included in the company's financial information following the date of acquisition on october 1, 2020.
covid-19 pandemic update to date, covid-19 has surfaced in nearly all regions around the world and has resulted, at times, in travel restrictions, closing of borders and business slowdowns or shutdowns in affected areas. many oems temporarily suspended certain manufacturing operations, particularly in north america and europe, due to market conditions and matters associated with covid-19. furthermore, covid-19 has impacted and may further impact the broader economies of affected countries, including negatively impacting economic growth, the proper functioning of financial and capital markets, foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. the continued spread of covid-19 has led to disruption and volatility in the global capital markets, which adversely impact the access to capital and increase the cost of capital.
in response to the outbreak and business disruption, we, first and foremost, prioritized the health and safety of our employees. as a global manufacturer, we have responded to shelter-in-place and similar government orders in various locations around the world, including throughout the united states and europe. additionally, our employees must respond to self-isolation and quarantine orders based on circumstances in their local communities, which continues to impact our facilities. the reopening procedures related to covid-19 led to a number of employee safety measures upon reopening to contain the spread, including domestic and international travel restrictions, work-from-home practices, extensive cleaning protocols, social distancing guidelines, requirement for employees to wear masks and various temporary closures of or reduced operations at our manufacturing and assembly facilities.
in april 2020, we implemented a range of actions aimed at temporarily reducing costs and preserving liquidity. these actions included, but were not limited to:
•a temporary 20% reduction in base salaries of our senior executive leadership team and annual retainers of our non-employee directors;
•up to 10% temporary base pay reductions for other salaried employees; and
•reductions in discretionary spending, such as outside professional services and travel.
effective september 1, 2020, all of the base pay and annual retainer reductions had been eliminated.
we continue to monitor the evolving situation and guidance from international and domestic authorities, including federal, state and local public health authorities and may take additional actions based on their recommendations. in these circumstances, there may be developments outside our control requiring us to adjust our operating plan. to date, covid-19 has had a material adverse impact on our revenue and overall profitability, primarily in the quarter ended june 30, 2020. significant reductions in automotive or truck production have had, and may continue to have, an adverse effect on the company's sales to oems. while production levels increased in the third and fourth quarters and revenue and profitability improved, covid-19 continues to impact our business globally, and it is possible covid-19 could result in adverse impacts in the future. we cannot reasonably estimate the full impacts covid-19 could have on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows in the future.
as of december 31, 2020, we had liquidity of $3,650 million, comprised of cash and cash equivalent balances of $1,650 million and an undrawn revolving credit facility of $2,000 million. we were in full compliance with our covenants under the revolving credit facility and had full access to our undrawn revolving credit facility. debt maturities through the end of 2021 total $45 million. given our strong liquidity position, we believe that the company will have sufficient liquidity and will maintain compliance with all covenants throughout the next 12 months.

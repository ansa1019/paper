item 7.  management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations as used herein, the terms equifax, the company, we, our and us refer to equifax inc., a georgia corporation, and its consolidated subsidiaries as a combined entity, except where it is clear that the terms mean only equifax inc.
all references to earnings per share data in management's discussion and analysis, or md&a, are to diluted earnings per share, or eps, unless otherwise noted. diluted eps is calculated to reflect the potential dilution that would occur if stock options or other contracts to issue common stock were exercised and resulted in additional common shares outstanding.
business overview equifax inc. is a global data, analytics and technology company. we provide information solutions and human resources business process outsourcing services for businesses, governments and consumers. we have a large and diversified group of clients, including financial institutions, corporations, governments and individuals. our services are based on comprehensive databases of consumer and business information derived from numerous sources including credit, financial assets, telecommunications and utility payments, employment, income, demographic and marketing data. we use advanced statistical techniques, machine learning and proprietary software tools to analyze available data to create customized insights, decision-making solutions and processing services for our clients. we also provide information, technology and services to support debt collections and recovery management. additionally, we are a leading provider of payroll-related and human resource management business process outsourcing services in the united states of america, or u.s. for consumers, we provide products and services to help people understand, manage and protect their personal information and make more informed financial decisions.
we currently operate in four global regions: north america (u.s. and canada), asia pacific (australia, new zealand and india), europe (the united kingdom, or u.k., spain and portugal) and latin america (argentina, chile, costa rica, ecuador, el salvador, honduras, mexico, paraguay, peru and uruguay). we maintain support operations in the republic of ireland, chile, costa rica and india. we also offer equifax branded credit services in russia through a joint venture, have investments in consumer and/or commercial credit information companies through joint ventures in cambodia, malaysia, singapore and the united arab emirates and have an investment in a consumer and commercial credit information company in brazil.
recent events and company outlook as further described above, we operate in the united states, which represented 78% of our revenue in 2020, and internationally in 24 countries. our products and services span a wide variety of vertical markets including financial services, mortgage, federal, state and local governments, automotive, telecommunications and many others.
on march 11, 2020, the world health organization designated the novel coronavirus disease ("covid-19") as a global pandemic. the impact of covid-19 and related actions to attempt to control its spread began to impact our consolidated operating results in march 2020. the impact on the operating results in each country in which we operate differed based on the conditions and the vertical markets we serve in that country. in the united states, consolidated revenue grew in each calendar quarter of 2020, compared to 2019, reflecting very strong mortgage market related revenue in both usis and workforce solutions, and, to a lesser degree, higher revenue growth in our workforce solutions unemployment claims management business. however, in the u.s., we experienced year-over-year revenue declines in most other vertical markets including commercial, financial services and telecommunications. internationally, all countries in which we operate experienced revenue declines, across most vertical markets. the year-over-year reductions in countries and vertical markets referenced were most pronounced in the second quarter and improved during the third and fourth quarters. although some countries continue to show year-over-year declines, performance in the fourth quarter of 2020 has improved from the levels seen in the third quarter and several vertical markets and countries have reported year over year growth as market conditions improve. we are unable to determine the severity or duration of the impact of the covid-19 pandemic on equifax or how the impact on the individual markets in the countries we serve will change with time. although consolidated revenue has grown during 2020 when compared to 2019, due to the uncertain effects on the global economy caused by the impact of covid-19, the impact on our future results of operations related to the covid-19 pandemic are unclear.
we expect that the global covid-19 pandemic will continue to impact our business and results of operations. while the covid-19 pandemic affects the countries in which we operate, our critical priorities are:
(i)the health and safety of our employees and their families;
(ii)providing support to consumers;
(iii)helping our customers execute their changing business plans by providing innovative solutions combining our unique data assets and leading analytical and technology capabilities; and
(iv)executing on our cloud technology, data and security transformation per our previously stated plans.
in the first quarter of 2020, we executed on our business continuity plans and formed a crisis management team to address the challenges related to the ongoing covid-19 pandemic. in march and april 2020, our employees worked from home in each country where we operate, with only essential employees in customer support and data center operations working on site at our facilities. beginning in may, in jurisdictions where local restrictions implemented to prevent the further spread of the virus were lifted, our employees began to return to their assigned offices, with limits placed on the number of employees on site at one time. for employees working at our offices and facilities, we have instituted social distancing protocols, increased the level of cleaning and sanitizing in those facilities and undertaken other actions to make these sites safer. we have also substantially reduced employee travel to only essential business needs. as part of our business continuity plans, we are generally following the requirements and protocols published by the u.s. centers for disease control and the world health organization, and state and local governments. if public health authorities dictate further measures to limit further spread of the virus, we may need to reinstate our business continuity plans in certain countries or regions in which we operate. as of the date of this filing, we do not believe our work from home and return to office protocol have materially adversely impacted our internal controls, financial reporting systems or our operations.
our data and analytics, product and sales teams are focused on how to refine existing products and services, as well as generate new products and services, to meet the changing needs of our customers in this environment. our technology teams continue to execute on our cloud technology, data and security transformation, including the continued migration of our technology to cloud native environments. to date, the change to our working environment has not caused material disruptions in the execution of these plans.
as a response to the ongoing covid-19 pandemic, we have implemented plans to manage our costs. we have significantly limited the addition of new employees and third party contracted services, eliminated all travel except where necessary to meet customer or regulatory needs, and acted to limit discretionary spending. recovery of the global economy from the covid-19 induced recession remains uncertain and may require several years to return to economic levels experienced prior to the pandemic and may affect certain markets or regions we serve differently. any future asset impairment charges, increase in allowance for doubtful accounts, or restructuring charges could be more likely and will be dependent on the severity and duration of this crisis.
at december 31, 2020, we had approximately $1.7 billion in cash and $1.1 billion available to borrow under our revolving credit facility that matures in september 2023. in the second quarter of 2020, we amended our revolving credit facility to increase the maximum leverage ratio through 2021 to provide us with additional financial flexibility.
in light of the evolving health, social, economic and business environment, governmental regulations or mandates, and business disruptions that could occur, the potential impact that covid-19 could have on our financial condition and operating results remains highly uncertain.

2017 cybersecurity incident in 2017, we experienced a cybersecurity incident following a criminal attack on our systems that involved the theft of certain personally identifiable information of u.s., canadian and u.k. consumers. criminals exploited a software vulnerability in a u.s. website application to gain unauthorized access to our network. in march 2017, the u.s. department of homeland security distributed a notice concerning the software vulnerability. we undertook efforts to identify and remediate vulnerable systems; however, the vulnerability in the website application that was exploited was not identified by our security processes. we discovered unusual network activity in late-july 2017 and upon discovery promptly investigated the activity. once the activity was identified as potential unauthorized access, we acted to stop the intrusion and engaged a leading, independent cybersecurity firm to conduct a forensic investigation to determine the scope of the unauthorized access, including the specific information impacted. based on our forensic investigation, the unauthorized access occurred from mid-may 2017 through july 2017. no evidence was found that the company's core consumer, employment and income, or commercial reporting databases were accessed. on february 10, 2020, the u.s. department of justice announced that four members of the chinese people's liberation army were indicted on criminal charges for their involvement in the 2017 cybersecurity incident.
product liability.  as a result of the 2017 cybersecurity incident, we offered trustedid® premier, a credit file monitoring and identity theft protection product, for free to all eligible u.s. consumers who signed up through january 31, 2018. in late 2018, the company extended the free credit monitoring services for an additional twelve months for eligible consumers impacted by the 2017 cybersecurity incident by providing them the opportunity to enroll in experian® idnotifytm at no cost. we also provided free credit reports and scores, credit monitoring and identity theft protection for twenty four months to impacted consumers in canada and the u.k. we have recorded the expenses necessary to provide this service to those who signed up. the remaining product liability balance at december 31, 2020 and 2019 was not material to the consolidated financial statements.
litigation, claims and government investigations.  as a result of the 2017 cybersecurity incident, we were subject to a significant number of proceedings and investigations as described in part i, "item 3. legal proceedings" in this form 10-k. we did not record any settlement expenses related to the resolution of these proceedings and investigations for the twelve months ended december 31, 2020. we recorded expenses, net of insurance recoveries, of $800.9 million in other current liabilities and selling, general, and administrative expenses in our consolidated balance sheets and statements of income (loss), respectively, as of and for the twelve months ended december 31, 2019, exclusive of our legal and professional services expenses and net of insurance recoveries. the amount accrued represents our best estimate of the liability related to these matters. the company will continue to evaluate information as it becomes known and adjust accruals for new information and further developments in accordance with asc 450-20-25.
future costs. we are currently executing substantial initiatives in security and consumer support, and a company-wide transformation of our technology infrastructure, which we refer to as our technology transformation, and incurred substantial increased expenses and capital expenditures in 2018, 2019 and 2020 related to these initiatives. we expect to continue to incur additional expenses and capital expenditures in 2021 related to these initiatives, although at reduced levels as those incurred in 2020.
we incurred significant legal and professional services expenses in 2019 related to the lawsuits, claims and government investigations to which we were a party in 2019, and expect to continue to incur these expenses until all matters are fully resolved. however, as expected, the level of legal and professional service expenses related to these matters was significantly lower in 2020 due to the settlement of all of the significant matters in the u.s.
we will recognize the expenses and capital expenditures referenced herein as they are incurred.
insurance coverage.  at the time of the 2017 cybersecurity incident, we had $125.0 million of cybersecurity insurance coverage, above a $7.5 million deductible, to limit our exposure to losses such as those related to this incident. since the announcement of the 2017 cybersecurity incident in september 2017, we have received the maximum reimbursement under the insurance policy of $125.0 million. we also maintained a directors and officers insurance policy of which we have recorded our estimated maximum recoveries as of december 31, 2020.
segment and geographic information segments. the usis segment consists of three service lines: online information solutions, mortgage solutions, and financial marketing services. online information solutions and mortgage solutions revenue is principally transaction-based and is derived from our sales of products such as consumer and commercial credit reporting and scoring, identity management, fraud detection and modeling services. usis also markets certain decisioning software services which facilitate and automate a variety of consumer and commercial credit-oriented decisions. financial marketing services revenue is principally project and subscription based and is derived from our sales of batch credit and consumer wealth information such as those that assist clients in acquiring new customers, cross-selling to existing customers and managing portfolio risk.
the workforce solutions segment consists of the verification services and employer services business lines. verification services revenue is transaction-based and is derived primarily from employment and income verification. employer services revenue is derived from our provision of certain human resources business process outsourcing services that include both transaction and subscription based product offerings. these services include unemployment claims management, employment-based tax credit services and other complementary employment-based transaction services.
the international segment consists of asia pacific, europe, latin america and canada. canada's services are similar to our usis offerings. asia pacific, europe and latin america are made up of varying mixes of service lines that are generally consistent with those in our usis reportable segment. we also provide information and technology services to support lenders and other creditors in the collections and recovery management process.
global consumer solutions revenue is both transaction and subscription based and is derived from the sale of credit monitoring and identity theft protection products, which we deliver electronically to consumers primarily via the internet in the u.s., canada, and the u.k. we also sell consumer and credit information to resellers who combine our information with other information to provide direct-to-consumer monitoring, reports and scores.
geographic information. we currently have operations in the following countries: argentina, australia, canada, chile, costa rica, ecuador, el salvador, honduras, india, mexico, new zealand, paraguay, peru, portugal, the republic of ireland, spain, the u.k., uruguay and the u.s. we also offer equifax branded credit services in russia through a joint venture, have investments in consumer and/or commercial credit information companies through joint ventures in cambodia, malaysia, singapore and the united arab emirates and have an investment in a consumer and commercial credit information company in brazil. approximately 78% and 73% our revenue was generated in the u.s. during the twelve months ended december 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.
key performance indicators. management focuses on a variety of key indicators to monitor operating and financial performance. these performance indicators include measurements of operating revenue, change in operating revenue, operating income, operating margin, net income, diluted earnings per share, cash provided by operating activities and capital expenditures. key performance indicators for the twelve months ended december 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, which reflect the change in accounting principle related to the change in accounting method for our pension and other benefits plans (see note 1), include the following:

revenue for 2020 increased by 18% compared to 2019. the growth was driven by our workforce solutions and usis segments, primarily due to strong u.s. mortgage volume as well as growth in our workforce solutions unemployment claims business. this growth was partially offset by declines beginning in the second half of march 2020 across international and global consumer solutions segments due to the economic impact of the covid-19 pandemic. the effect of foreign exchange rates reduced revenue by $24.5 million, or 1%, in 2020 compared to 2019.
revenue for 2019 increased by 3% compared to 2018. the growth was driven by our workforce solutions and usis segments which was partially offset by declines in international and global consumer solutions. workforce solutions saw strong growth driven by verification services. usis growth was primarily driven by increases in core credit decisioning volumes and revenue from acquisitions. international had local currency growth across latin america and canada. the effect of foreign exchange rates reduced revenue by $74.7 million, or 2%, in 2019 compared to 2018. global consumer solutions revenue decreased primarily due to decreases in consumer direct revenue in the u.s. and the u.k.

cost of services increased $81.3 million in 2019 compared to 2018. the increase was due to increased royalty and technology costs. we also incurred increased incremental technology and data security costs of $20.3 million in 2019. these increased technology and security costs predominantly reflect the investments we are making in our technology transformation, which include costs for enhanced data security. the effect of changes in foreign exchange rates reduced cost of services by $33.2 million.
selling, general and administrative expenses. selling, general and administrative expenses decreased $667.7 million in 2020 compared to 2019. the decrease in 2020 is primarily due to losses, net of insurance recoveries, of $800.9 million associated with certain legal proceedings and government investigations related to the 2017 cybersecurity incident that were recorded in 2019 but did not recur in 2020, partially offset by increased people costs and a restructuring charge taken in the fourth quarter of 2020. the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates decreased our selling, general and administrative expenses by $10.2 million.

interest expense increased in 2020, when compared to 2019, due to the issuance of $1.0 billion in senior notes in april 2020 and $750.0 million senior notes issued in november 2019. this increase was partially offset by interest related to outstanding commercial paper and receivables funding facility balances in 2019.
interest expense increased in 2019, when compared to 2018, due to an increase in our overall debt outstanding during the year due to borrowings on our receivables facility and under our commercial paper program. these borrowings were paid down with the proceeds from the issuance of the $750.0 million senior notes in november 2019.
the increase in other income, net in 2020 is primarily due to gains recorded related to the fair value adjustment of our investment in brazil of $116.6 million due to its initial public offering in the third quarter of 2020, as well as the $32.9 million gain recorded related to a fair value adjustment of the equity investment in india, for which we completed the acquisition of the remaining shareholder interest in the first quarter of 2020. this was partially offset by the $32.2 million mark-to-market fair value adjustment of pension assets which resulted in a loss during the fourth quarter of 2020.
the increase in other income, net in 2019 is primarily due to higher earnings on certain equity method investments and partially offset by an increased loss related to the foreign exchange impact of remeasuring the peso denominated monetary assets and liabilities as a result of argentina becoming a highly inflationary economy for accounting purposes starting in july 2018.

general corporate expense decreased $701.3 million in 2020. the decrease in 2020 as compared to 2019 is due to the legal accruals for losses associated with certain legal proceedings and investigations related to the 2017 cybersecurity incident of $800.9 million that were recorded in 2019 and did not recur in 2020 and lower technology costs, partially offset by increased people costs and a restructuring charge taken in the fourth quarter of 2020. the restructuring charge in the fourth quarter of 2020 resulted from our continuing efforts to realign our internal resources to support our strategic objectives.
general corporate expense increased $789.4 million in 2019 due to the aforementioned losses associated with the 2017 cybersecurity incident.
liquidity and financial condition management assesses liquidity in terms of our ability to generate cash to fund operating, investing and financing activities. we continue to generate substantial cash from operating activities, remain in a strong financial position, and manage our capital structure to meet short- and long-term objectives including reinvestment in existing businesses and strategic acquisitions.
sources and uses of cash funds generated by operating activities, our revolver and related commercial paper program, more fully described below, are our most significant sources of liquidity. in april 2020, we issued $1.0 billion aggregate principal amount of senior notes. the net proceeds of the sale of the notes were used to repay borrowings under our receivables facility and revolver, while the remaining funds are intended for general corporate purposes. at december 31, 2020, we had $1.7 billion in cash balances, as well as $1.1 billion available to borrow under our revolver.
the company has and expects to make payments to resolve certain legal proceedings and investigations related to the 2017 cybersecurity incident, described more fully in "item 3. legal proceedings" in this form 10-k. through 2020, the company made payments of $439.3 million for legal settlements related to the 2017 cybersecurity incident. the remaining $346.7 million to be paid to the consumer restitution fund will be made after a final adjudication affirming the u.s. consumer mdl litigation settlement or dismissal of the pending appeals. although we expect this payment and the remaining settlement payments to be made in 2021, we can give no assurance that these payments will occur in 2021 due to pending approvals or appeals. as a result of the possible payments that could be made in 2021 related to the losses associated with certain legal proceedings and government investigations related to the 2017 cybersecurity incident and other requirements, funds generated by operating activities may not be sufficient to fund working capital and other cash requirements, including for acquisitions and share repurchases, throughout 2021. our plan is to finance the payments with existing cash balances and borrowing capacity, as necessary.
fund transfer limitations. the ability of certain of our subsidiaries and associated companies to transfer funds to the u.s may be limited, in some cases, by certain restrictions imposed by foreign governments. these restrictions do not, individually or in the aggregate, materially limit our ability to service our indebtedness, meet our current obligations or pay dividends. as of december 31, 2020, we held $259.6 million of cash in our foreign subsidiaries.
information about our cash flows, by category, is presented in the consolidated statements of cash flows. the following table summarizes our cash flows for the twelve months ended december 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018:

operating activities cash provided by operating activities for 2020 increased by $632.4 million compared to 2019. the increase in cash from operations is due to increased net income in 2020 and additional payments made in 2019 associated with certain legal proceedings and investigations related to the 2017 cybersecurity incident.
cash provided by operating activities for 2019 decreased by $358.4 million compared to 2018. the decrease is due to partial payment of the losses associated with certain legal proceedings and investigations related to the 2017 cybersecurity incident as well as having received $110.0 million in insurance proceeds in 2018.

borrowing and repayment activity.  net short-term repayments primarily represent repayments or borrowings of outstanding amounts under our commercial paper ("cp") program. we primarily borrow under our cp program as needed and as availability allows.
the decrease in net short-term repayments in 2020, 2019 and 2018 primarily relates to the net repayments of our cp notes.
in april 2020, we issued $400.0 million aggregate principal amount of 2.6% five-year senior notes due 2025 (the "2025 notes") and $600.0 million aggregate principal amount of 3.1% ten-year senior notes due 2030 (the "2030 notes") in an underwritten public offering. interest on the 2025 notes accrues at a rate of 2.6% per year and is payable semi-annually in arrears on june 15 and december 15 of each year. interest on the 2030 notes accrues at a rate of 3.1% per year and is payable semi-annually in arrears on may 15 and november 15 of each year. the net proceeds of the sale of the notes were used to repay borrowings under our receivables facility and revolver, while the remaining funds are intended for general corporate purposes, which may include the repayment of a portion of the 2021 debt maturities.
in november 2019, we issued $750.0 million aggregate principal amount of 2.6% five-year senior notes due 2024 (the "2024 notes") in an underwritten public offering. interest on the 2024 notes accrue at a rate of 2.6% per year and will be payable semi-annually in arrears on june 1 and december 1 of each year. the net proceeds of the sale of the notes were used to repay borrowings under our receivables facility and our cp program and for general corporate purposes.
in may 2018, we issued $300.0 million aggregate principal amount of 3.6% senior notes due 2021 (the "2021 notes"), $400.0 million aggregate principal amount of 3.95% senior notes due 2023 (the "2023 notes"), and $300.0 million aggregate principal amount floating rate notes due 2021 (the "floating rate notes") in an underwritten public offering. the net proceeds of the sale of the notes were used to repay borrowings under our revolver, our prior $800.0 million three-year delayed draw term loan facility ("term loan") and our cp program.
payments on long-term debt in 2020 and 2019 reflect payments on our receivable facility using proceeds from the issuance of the senior notes. payments on long-term debt in 2018 reflect $100.0 million of payments on the revolver using proceeds from the issuance of 3.60%, floating rate and 3.95% senior notes in 2018.
credit facility availability.  in september 2018, the company entered into the $1.1 billion five-year unsecured revolving credit facility with a group of financial institutions, which will mature in september 2023 (the "revolver"). the revolver replaced the company's previous $900.0 million unsecured revolving credit facility that was scheduled to mature in november 2020. borrowings under the revolver may be used for general corporate purposes, including working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and share repurchase programs. the revolver has an accordion feature that allows us to request an increase in the total commitment to $1.6 billion. the revolver includes an option to request a maximum of two one-year extensions of the maturity date, any time after the first anniversary of the revolver closing. we believe we are currently in compliance with all representations and warranties necessary as a condition for borrowing under the revolver, but we cannot assure that we will be able to comply with all such conditions for borrowing in the future. availability of the revolver is reduced by the outstanding principal balance of our commercial paper notes and by any letters of credit issued under the facility. on april 10, 2020, we amended our existing revolving credit facility to increase the maximum leverage ratio to provide additional financial flexibility as described further below.
our $1.1 billion cp program has been established to allow for borrowing through the private placement of cp with maturities ranging from overnight to 397 days. we may use the proceeds of cp for general corporate purposes. the cp program is supported by our revolver and the total amount of cp which may be issued is reduced by the amount of any outstanding borrowings under our revolver and by any letters of credit issued under the facility.
at december 31, 2020, the company had no borrowings outstanding of cp, $0.7 million of letters of credit outstanding and no borrowings outstanding under the revolver. at december 31, 2020, a total of $1.10 billion was available under the revolver.
at december 31, 2020, approximately 93% of our debt was fixed rate and 7% was variable rate. our variable-rate debt consists of the floating rate notes. the interest rate resets periodically, based on the terms of the respective financing arrangement. at december 31, 2020, the interest rate on our variable-rate debt was 1.1%.
in november 2020, we terminated our $225.0 million receivables funding facility (the "receivables facility").
debt covenants.  a downgrade in credit ratings would increase the cost of borrowings under our cp program and revolver, and could limit or, in the case of a significant downgrade, preclude our ability to issue cp. the outstanding indentures and comparable instruments contain customary covenants including, for example, limits on mortgages, liens and sale/leaseback transactions.
on april 10, 2020, we amended our existing revolving credit facility to increase the maximum leverage ratio to provide additional financial flexibility. the amendment increases the maximum leverage ratio, defined as consolidated funded debt divided by consolidated ebitda for the preceding four quarters, to (i) 4.5 to 1.0 for fiscal quarters ending on june 30,
2020 through and including september 30, 2021 and (ii) 4.0 to 1.0 for the fiscal quarter ending on december 31, 2021. the maximum leverage ratio will return to 3.5 to 1.0 beginning with the fiscal quarter ending march 31, 2022 and thereafter. beginning january 1, 2021, we may also elect to increase the maximum leverage ratio by 0.5 to 1.0 (not to exceed 4.5 to 1.0) in connection with certain material acquisitions if we satisfy certain requirements. the amendment also (i) permits cash in excess of $200 million to be netted against debt in the calculation of the leverage ratio through september 30, 2021, subject to certain restrictions and (ii) extends the add-back of certain expenses related to the 2017 cybersecurity incident to the definition of consolidated ebitda through december 31, 2021.
none of these covenants are considered restrictive to our operations and, as of december 31, 2020, the company was in compliance with all of our debt covenants.
the company does not have any credit rating triggers that would accelerate the maturity of a material amount of the outstanding debt; however, our 2.3% senior notes due 2021, 3.6% senior notes due 2021, floating rate notes due 2021, 3.3% senior notes due 2022, 3.95% senior notes due 2023, 2.6% senior notes due 2024, 2.6% senior notes due 2025, 3.25% senior notes due 2026, 3.1% senior notes due 2030 and 7.0% senior notes due 2037 (together, the "senior notes") contain change in control provisions. if the company experiences a change of control or publicly announces the company's intention to effect a change of control and the rating on the senior notes is lowered by standard & poor's ("s&p") and moody's investors service ("moody's") below an investment grade rating within 60 days of such change of control or notice thereof, then the company will be required to offer to repurchase the senior notes at a price equal to 101% of the aggregate principal amount of the senior notes plus accrued and unpaid interest.
credit ratings. credit ratings reflect an independent agency's judgment on the likelihood that a borrower will repay a debt obligation at maturity. the ratings reflect many considerations, such as the nature of the borrower's industry and its competitive position, the size of the company, its liquidity and access to capital and the sensitivity of a company's cash flows to changes in the economy. the two largest rating agencies, s&p and moody's, use alphanumeric codes to designate their ratings. the highest quality rating for long-term credit obligations is aaa and aaa for s&p and moody's, respectively. a security rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities and may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating agency.
long-term ratings of bbb- and baa3 or better by s&p and moody's, respectively, reflect ratings on debt obligations that fall within a band of credit quality considered to be "investment grade." at december 31, 2020, the long-term ratings for our obligations were bbb with a negative outlook for s&p and baa2 with a stable outlook for moody's. a downgrade in our credit rating would increase the cost of borrowings under our cp program and revolver, and could limit, or in the case of a significant downgrade, preclude our ability to issue cp. if our credit ratings were to decline to lower levels, we could experience increases in the interest cost for any new debt. in addition, the market's demand for, and thus our ability to readily issue, new debt could become further affected by the economic and credit market environment. these ratings are subject to change as events and circumstances change.

sources and uses of cash related to equity during the twelve months ended december 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 were as follows:
•we did not repurchase any shares from public market transactions in 2020, 2019 or 2018. as of december 31, 2020, under the existing board authorization, the company is approved for additional stock repurchases of $590.1 million.
•during the twelve months ended december 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, we paid cash dividends to equifax shareholders of $189.5 million, $188.7 million and $187.9 million, respectively, at $1.56 per share for 2020, 2019 and 2018.
we anticipate continuing the payment of quarterly cash dividends. the actual amount of such dividends is subject to declaration by our board of directors and will depend upon future earnings, results of operations, capital requirements, our financial condition and other relevant factors. there can be no assurance that the company will continue to pay quarterly cash dividends at current levels or at all.

interest payments (6)                                                                  789.5                           129.5                             206.1                            145.9                            308.0

(1)the amounts are gross of unamortized discounts totaling $23.8 million at december 31, 2020. total debt on our consolidated balance sheets is net of the unamortized discounts and fair value adjustments. there were no fair value adjustments to our debt at december 31, 2020.
(2)our operating lease obligations principally involve office space and equipment.
(3)these agreements primarily represent our minimum contractual obligations for services that we outsource associated with our computer data processing operations and related functions, and certain administrative functions. these agreements expire between 2021 and 2027.
(4)these long-term liabilities primarily relate to obligations associated with certain pension, postretirement and other compensation-related plans, some of which are discounted in accordance with u.s. generally accepted accounting principles, or gaap. we made certain assumptions about the timing of such future payments. in the table above, we have not included amounts related to future pension plan obligations, as such required funding amounts beyond 2020 have not been deemed necessary due to our current expectations regarding future plan asset performance.
(5)this table excludes $27.1 million of unrecognized tax benefits, including interest and penalties, as we cannot make a reasonably reliable estimate of the period of cash settlement with the respective taxing authorities.
(6)for future interest payments on variable-rate debt, which bears a rate equal to three-month libor on the interest determination date plus 0.87% per annum, we used the variable rate in effect at december 31, 2020 to calculate these payments. our outstanding variable rate debt at december 31, 2020 consisted of the floating rate notes. the variable rate at december 31, 2020 was 1.1%. future interest payments may be different depending on future borrowing activity and interest rates.
off-balance sheet transactions we do not engage in off-balance sheet financing activities.
pursuant to the terms of certain industrial revenue bonds, we have transferred title to certain of our fixed assets with total costs of $156.4 million as of december 31, 2020 and 2019 to a local governmental authority in the u.s. to receive a property tax abatement related to economic development. the title to these assets will revert back to us upon retirement or cancellation of the applicable bonds. these fixed assets are still recognized on the company's consolidated balance sheets as all risks and rewards related to the assets remain with the company.
letters of credit and guarantees we will from time to time issue standby letters of credit, performance or surety bonds or other guarantees in the normal course of business. the aggregate notional amount of all performance and surety bonds and standby letters of credit was not material at december 31, 2020, and generally have a remaining maturity of one year or less. guarantees are issued from time to time to support the needs of our operating units. the maximum potential future payments we could be required to make under the guarantees is not material at december 31, 2020.
benefit plans we sponsor a qualified defined benefit retirement plan, the u.s. retirement income plan ("usrip"), that covers approximately 10% of current u.s. salaried employees who were hired on or before june 30, 2007, the last date on which an individual could be hired and enter the plan before the usrip was closed to new participation at december 31, 2008. this plan also covers retirees as well as certain terminated but vested individuals not yet in retirement status. we also sponsor a retirement plan with both defined benefit and defined contribution components that cover most salaried and hourly employees in canada, the canadian retirement income plan ("crip"); the defined benefit component was also closed to new hires on october 1, 2011.
during the twelve months ended december 31, 2020, we made no voluntary contributions to the usrip or to the crip. during the twelve months ended december 31, 2019, we made no voluntary contributions to the usrip and made contributions of $0.2 million to the crip. at december 31, 2020, the usrip met or exceeded erisa's minimum funding requirements. in the future, we will make minimum funding contributions as required and may make discretionary contributions, depending on certain circumstances, including market conditions and liquidity needs. we believe additional funding contributions, if any, would not prevent us from continuing to meet our liquidity needs, which are primarily funded from cash flows generated by operating activities, available cash and cash equivalents, and our credit facilities.
for our non-u.s., tax-qualified retirement plans, we fund an amount sufficient to meet minimum funding requirements but no more than allowed as a tax deduction pursuant to applicable tax regulations. for the non-qualified supplemental retirement plans, we fund the benefits as they are paid to retired participants, but accrue the associated expense and liabilities in accordance with gaap.
for additional information about our benefit plans including the change in accounting method adopted in 2020, see notes 1 and 9 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report.
effects of inflation and changes in foreign currency exchange rates equifax's operating results are not materially affected by inflation, although inflation may result in increases in the company's expenses, which may not be readily recoverable in the price of services offered. to the extent inflation results in rising interest rates and has other adverse effects upon the securities markets and upon the value of financial instruments, it may adversely affect the company's financial position and profitability.
a portion of the company's business is conducted in currencies other than the u.s. dollar and changes in foreign exchange rates relative to the u.s. dollar can therefore affect the value of non-u.s. dollar net assets, revenues and expenses.
potential exposures as a result of these fluctuations in currencies are closely monitored. we generally do not mitigate the risks associated with fluctuating exchange rates, although we may from time to time through forward contracts or other derivative instruments hedge a portion of our translational foreign currency exposure or exchange rate risks associated with material transactions which are denominated in a foreign currency.
recent accounting pronouncements for information about new accounting pronouncements and the potential impact on our consolidated financial statements, see note 1 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report.
application of critical accounting policies and estimates the company's consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with u.s. generally accepted accounting principles, or gaap. this requires our management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities in our consolidated financial statements and the notes to consolidated financial statements. the following accounting policies involve critical accounting estimates because they are particularly dependent on estimates and assumptions made by management about matters that are uncertain at the time the accounting estimates are made. in addition, while we have used our best estimates based on facts and circumstances available to us at the time, different estimates reasonably could have been used in the current period, or changes in the accounting estimates that we used are reasonably likely to occur from period to period, either of which may have a material impact on the presentation of our consolidated balance sheets, statements of income (loss), and statements of comprehensive income (loss). we also have other significant accounting policies which involve the use of estimates, judgments and assumptions that are relevant to understanding our results. for additional information about these policies, see note 1 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report. although we believe that our estimates, assumptions and judgments are reasonable, they are based upon information available at the time. actual results may differ significantly from these estimates under different assumptions, judgments or conditions.
revenue recognition in accordance with asc 606, "revenue from contracts with customers," we recognize revenue when a performance obligation has been satisfied by transferring a promised good or service to a customer and the customer obtains control of the good or service. in order to recognize revenue, we note that the two parties must have an agreement that creates enforceable rights, the performance obligations must be distinct and the transaction price can be determined. our revenue is derived from the provision of information services to our customers on a transactional basis, in which distinct services are delivered over time as the customer simultaneously receives and consumes the benefits of the services delivered. to measure our performance over time, the output method is utilized to measure the value to the customer based on the transfer to date of the services promised, with no rights of return once consumed. in these cases, revenue on transactional contracts with a defined price but an undefined quantity is recognized utilizing the right to invoice expedient resulting in revenue being recognized when the service is provided and billed. additionally, multi-year contracts with defined pricing but an undefined quantity that utilize tier pricing would be defined as a series of distinct performance obligations satisfied over time utilizing the same method of measurement, the output method, with no rights of return once consumed. this measurement method is applied on a monthly basis resulting in revenue being recognized when the service is provided and billed.
additionally, we recognize revenue from subscription-based contracts under which a customer pays a preset fee for a predetermined or unlimited number of transactions or services provided during the subscription period, generally one year. revenue from subscription-based contracts having a preset number of transactions is recognized as the services are provided, using an effective transaction rate as the actual transactions are delivered. any remaining revenue related to unfulfilled units is not recognized until the end of the related contract's subscription period. revenue from subscription-based contracts having an unlimited volume is recognized ratably during the contract term. multi-year subscription contracts are analyzed to determine the full contract transaction price over the term of the contract and the subsequent price is ratably recognized over the full term of the contract.
revenue is recorded net of sales taxes.
if at the outset of an arrangement, we determine that collectibility is not reasonably assured, revenue is deferred until the earlier of when collectibility becomes probable or the receipt of payment from the customer. if there is uncertainty as to the customer's acceptance of the performance obligation, revenue is not recognized until the earlier of receipt of customer acceptance or expiration of the acceptance period.
we sell certain offerings that contain multiple performance obligations. these obligations may include consumer or commercial information, file updates for certain solutions, services provided by our decisioning technologies personnel, training services, statistical models and other services. in order to account for each of these obligations separately, the delivered promises within our contracts must meet the criterion to be considered distinct performance obligations to our customer. if we determine that the arrangement does not contain separate distinct obligations, the performance obligations are bundled together until a distinct obligation is achieved. this may lead to the arrangement consideration being recognized as the final contract obligation is delivered to our customer or ratably over the term of the contract.
some of our arrangements with multiple performance obligations involve the delivery of services generated by a combination of services provided by one or more of our operating segments. no individual information service impacts the value or usage of other information services included in an arrangement and each service can be sold alone or, in most cases, purchased from another vendor without affecting the quality of use or value to the customer of the other information services included in the arrangement. some of our products require the installation of interfaces or platforms by our technology personnel that allow our customers to interact with our proprietary information databases. these installation services do not meet the requirement for being distinct, thus any related installation fees are deferred when billed and are recognized over the expected period that the customer will benefit from the related services. revenue from the delivery of one-time files and models is recognized as the service is provided and accepted, assuming all other revenue recognition criteria are met. the direct costs of installation of a customer are capitalized and amortized over the useful life of the identifiable asset.
we record revenue on a net basis for those sales in which we have in substance acted as an agent or broker in the transaction and therefore do not have control.
in certain instances within our debt collections and recovery management services in our international operating segment and certain tax management services within our workforce solutions operating segment, variable consideration is constrained due to the fact that the revenue is contingent on a particular outcome. within our debt collections and recovery management businesses, revenue is calculated as a percentage of debt collected on behalf of the customer and, as such, is primarily recognized when the debt is collected assuming all other revenue recognition criteria are met. within our workforce solutions operating segment, the fees for certain of our tax credits and incentives revenue are based on a percentage of the credit delivered to our clients. revenue for these arrangements is recognized based on the achievement of milestones, upon calculation of the credit, approval from a regulatory agency or when the credit is utilized by our client, depending on the provisions of the client contract.
certain costs incurred prior to the satisfaction of a performance obligation are deferred as contract costs and are amortized on a systematic basis consistent with the pattern of transfer of the related goods and services. these costs generally consist of labor costs directly relating to the implementation and setup of the contract.
judgments and uncertainties - each performance obligation within a contract must be considered separately to ensure that appropriate accounting is performed for these distinct goods or services. these considerations include assessing the price at which the element is sold compared to its standalone selling price; concluding when the element will be delivered; evaluating collectability; and determining whether any contingencies exist in the related customer contract that impact the prices paid to us for the services.
contract balances - the contract balances are generated when revenue recognized varies from billing in a given period. a contract asset is created when an entity transfers a good or service to a customer and recognizes more revenue than what has been billed. as of december 31, 2020, the contract asset balance was $11.0 million. a contract liability is created when an entity transfers a good or service to a customer and recognizes less than what has been billed. deferred revenue is recognized when we have an obligation to transfer goods or services to a customer and have already received consideration from the customer. we generally expect to recognize our deferred revenue as revenue within twelve months of being recorded based on the terms of the contracts.
goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets we review goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment annually (as of september 30) and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable. these events or circumstances could include a significant change in the business climate, legal factors, operating performance or trends, competition, or sale or disposition of a significant portion of a reporting unit. we have seven reporting units comprised of usis (which includes online information solutions, mortgage solutions and financial marketing services), asia pacific, europe, latin america, canada, global consumer solutions ("gcs"), and equifax workforce solutions (which includes verification services and employer services).
the goodwill balance at december 31, 2020, for our seven reporting units was as follows:
december 31, 2020
(in millions)
u.s. information solutions             1,286.7
asia pacific                           1,566.8
europe                                   165.1
latin america                            223.1
canada                                    52.9
global consumer solutions                190.5
workforce solutions                    1,010.7
total goodwill                        $4,495.8
valuation techniques we performed a qualitative assessment to determine whether further impairment testing was necessary for our usis, workforce solutions, europe, canada and gcs reporting units. in this qualitative assessment, we considered the following items for each of the reporting units: macroeconomic conditions, industry and market conditions, overall financial performance and other entity specific events. in addition, for each of these reporting units, the most recent fair value determination resulted in an amount that significantly exceeded the carrying amount of the reporting units. based on these assessments, we determined the likelihood that a current fair value determination would be less than the current carrying amount of the reporting unit is not more likely than not. as a result of our conclusions, no further testing was required for these reporting units.
we performed a quantitative assessment for our asia pacific and latin america reporting units to determine whether impairment exists from the most recent valuation dates due to the size of the cushion and lower current year forecasts than the 2020 projections from the most recent valuations in relation to our other reporting units. in determining the fair value of the reporting unit, we used a combination of the income and market approaches to estimate the reporting unit's business enterprise value.
under the income approach, we calculate the fair value of a reporting unit based on estimated future discounted cash flows which require assumptions about short and long-term revenue growth rates, operating margins for each reporting unit, discount rates, foreign currency exchange rates and estimates of capital expenditures. the assumptions we use are based on what we believe a hypothetical marketplace participant would use in estimating fair value. under the market approach, we estimate the fair value based on market multiples of revenue or earnings before income taxes, depreciation and amortization, for benchmark companies or guideline transactions, if available. we believe the benchmark companies used for our asia pacific and latin america reporting units serve as an appropriate input for calculating a fair value for the reporting unit as those benchmark companies have similar risks, participate in similar markets, provide similar services for their customers and compete with us directly. the companies we use as benchmarks are principally outlined in our discussion of competition in item 1 of this form 10-k. competition for our asia pacific and latin america reporting units generally includes global consumer credit reporting companies, such as experian, which offer a product suite similar to the reporting unit's credit reporting solutions.
the values separately derived from each of the income and market approach valuation techniques were used to develop an overall estimate of a reporting unit's fair value. we use a consistent approach across all reporting units when considering the weight of the income and market approaches for calculating the fair value of each of our reporting units. this approach relies more heavily on the calculated fair value derived from the income approach, with 70% of the value coming from the income approach. we believe this approach is consistent with that of a market participant in valuing prospective purchase business combinations. the selection and weighting of the various fair value techniques may result in a higher or lower fair value. judgment is applied in determining the weightings that are most representative of fair value.
we have not made any material changes to the valuation methodology we use to assess goodwill impairment since the date of our last annual impairment test.
growth assumptions the assumptions for our future cash flows begin with our historical operating performance, the details of which are described in our management's discussion & analysis of operating performance. additionally, we consider the impact that known economic, industry and market trends, including the potential impact of the covid-19 global pandemic, will have on our future forecasts, as well as the impact that we expect from planned business initiatives including new product initiatives, client service and retention standards, and cost management programs. at the end of the forecast period, the long-term growth rate we used to determine the terminal value of our asia pacific and latin american reporting units were between 3.0% and 5.0% based on management's assessment of the minimum expected terminal growth rate of the reporting unit, as well as broader economic considerations such as gdp, inflation and the maturity of the markets we serve.
we projected revenue growth in 2021 for our asia pacific and latin america reporting units in completing our 2020 impairment testing based on expected economic recovery from the negative impact the covid-19 pandemic has had on these regions in 2020, planned business initiatives and prevailing trends exhibited by these units and not based on the assumption of meaningful acceleration in economic growth. the anticipated revenue growth in these reporting units, however, is partially offset by assumed increases in expenses for the reporting unit which reflects the additional level of investment needed in order to achieve the planned revenue growth and completion of our technology transformation initiatives.
discount rate assumptions we utilize a weighted average cost of capital, or wacc, in our impairment analysis that makes assumptions about the capital structure that we believe a market participant would make and include a risk premium based on an assessment of risks related to the projected cash flows for the reporting unit. we believe this approach yields a discount rate that is consistent with an implied rate of return that a market participant would require for an investment in a company having similar risks and business characteristics to the reporting unit being assessed. to calculate the wacc, the cost of equity and cost of debt are multiplied by the assumed capital structure of the reporting unit as compared to industry trends and relevant benchmark company structures. the cost of equity was computed using the capital asset pricing model which considers the risk-free interest rate, beta, equity risk premium and specific company risk premium related to a particular reporting unit. the cost of debt was computed using a benchmark rate and the company's tax rate. for the 2020 annual goodwill impairment evaluation, the discount rates used to develop the estimated fair value of the asia pacific and latin america reporting units were between 9.0% and 16.0%.
estimated fair value and sensitivities the estimated fair value of the reporting units is derived from the valuation techniques described above, incorporating the related projections and assumptions. impairment occurs when the estimated fair value of the reporting unit is below the carrying value of its equity. the estimated fair value for our asia pacific and latin america reporting units exceeded their related carrying values as of september 30, 2020. as a result, no goodwill impairment was recorded.
the estimated fair value of the reporting unit is highly sensitive to changes in these projections and assumptions; therefore, in some instances changes in these assumptions could impact whether the fair value of a reporting unit is greater than its carrying value. for example, an increase in the discount rate and decline in the projected cumulative cash flow of a reporting unit could cause the fair value of certain reporting units to be below its carrying value. we perform sensitivity analyses around these assumptions in order to assess the reasonableness of the assumptions and the resulting estimated fair values. ultimately, future potential changes in these assumptions may impact the estimated fair value of a reporting unit and cause the fair value of the reporting unit to be below its carrying value. due to the lower cushions when compared to other reporting units, asia pacific and latin america are more sensitive to changes in the assumptions noted above that could result in a fair value that is less than its carrying value. the excess of fair value over carrying value for the asia pacific reporting unit was less than 5% and the excess fair value over carrying value for the latin america reporting unit was between 15% and 20% as of september 30, 2020.
given the small excess of fair value over carrying value for the asia pacific reporting unit, we believe that it is at risk of a possible future goodwill impairment. although we experienced growth in this reporting unit for the three months ended december 31, 2020 in comparison to the estimates used in the 2020 goodwill impairment testing, the covid-19 pandemic has had a substantial negative impact on our results over the last nine months of 2020. avoidance of a future impairment will be dependent on continued economic recovery from the negative impact caused by covid-19 in 2020 and our ability to execute on initiatives to grow revenue and manage expenses prudently. we will continue to monitor the performance of this reporting unit to ensure no interim indications of possible impairment have occurred before our next annual goodwill impairment assessment in september 2021.
loss contingencies we are subject to various proceedings, lawsuits and claims arising in the normal course of our business. we determine whether to disclose and/or accrue for loss contingencies based on our assessment of whether the potential loss is estimable, probable, reasonably possible or remote.
in the third quarter of 2017, we announced a cybersecurity incident potentially impacting u.s., canadian and u.k. consumers. as a result of the 2017 cybersecurity incident, we were subject to a significant number of proceedings and investigations as described in "item 3. legal proceedings" in this form 10-k. we recorded expenses, net of insurance recoveries, of $800.9 million in other current liabilities and selling, general, and administrative expenses in our consolidated statements of income (loss) for the twelve months ended december 31, 2019, exclusive of our legal and professional services expenses. the amount accrued represents our best estimate of the liability related to these matters. the company will continue to evaluate information as it becomes known and adjust accruals for new information and further developments in accordance with asc 450-20-25. while it is reasonably possible that losses exceeding the amount accrued may be incurred, it is not possible at this time to estimate the additional possible loss in excess of the amount already accrued that might result from adverse judgments, settlements, penalties or other resolution of the proceedings and investigations described in "item 3. legal proceedings" in this form 10-k.
judgments and uncertainties - we periodically review claims and legal proceedings and assess whether we have potential financial exposure based on consultation with internal and outside legal counsel and other advisors. if the likelihood of an adverse outcome from any claim or legal proceeding is probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated, we record a liability on our consolidated balance sheets for the estimated amount. if the likelihood of an adverse outcome is reasonably possible, but not probable, we provide disclosures related to the potential loss contingency. our assumptions related to loss contingencies are inherently subjective.
effect if actual results differ from assumptions - with the exception of the 2017 cybersecurity incident, we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions we use to determine loss contingencies. however, if facts and circumstances change in the future that change our belief regarding assumptions used to determine our estimates, we may be exposed to a loss that could be material.
income taxes we record deferred income taxes using enacted tax laws and rates for the years in which the taxes are expected to be paid. we assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income or other tax planning strategies. to the extent that we believe that recovery is not likely, we must establish a valuation allowance to reduce the deferred tax assets to the amount we estimate will be recoverable.
our income tax provisions are based on assumptions and calculations which will be subject to examination by various tax authorities. we record tax benefits for positions in which we believe are more likely than not of being sustained under such examinations. we assess the potential outcome of such examinations to determine the adequacy of our income tax accruals.
judgments and uncertainties - we consider accounting for income taxes critical because management is required to make significant judgments in determining our provision for income taxes, our deferred tax assets and liabilities, and our future taxable income for purposes of assessing our ability to realize any future benefit from our deferred tax assets. these judgments and estimates are affected by our expectations of future taxable income, mix of earnings among different taxing jurisdictions, and timing of the reversal of deferred tax assets and liabilities.
we also use our judgment to determine whether it is more likely than not that we will sustain positions that we have taken on tax returns and, if so, the amount of benefit to initially recognize within our financial statements. we review our uncertain tax positions and adjust our unrecognized tax benefits in light of changes in facts and circumstances, such as changes in tax law, interactions with taxing authorities and developments in case law. these adjustments to our unrecognized tax benefits may affect our income tax expense. settlement of uncertain tax positions may require use of our cash. at december 31, 2020, $27.1 million was recorded for uncertain tax benefits, including interest and penalties, of which it is reasonably possible that up to $6.8 million of our unrecognized tax benefit may change within the next twelve months.
effect if actual results differ from assumptions - although management believes that the judgments and estimates discussed herein are reasonable, actual results could differ, and we may be exposed to increases or decreases in income tax expense that could be material.
pension and other postretirement plans we consider accounting for our u.s. and canadian pension and other postretirement plans critical because management is required to make significant judgments about a number of actuarial assumptions, which include discount rates, expected return on plan assets, interest cost and mortality and retirement rates. actuarial valuations are used in determining our benefit obligation and net periodic benefit cost.
in the fourth quarter of 2020, we voluntarily changed our method of accounting for recognizing actuarial gains and losses and expected return on plan assets for our defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans. under the accounting method change, remeasurement of projected benefit obligation and plan assets are immediately recognized in earnings through net periodic benefit cost within other income (expense) on the consolidated statements of income (loss), with pension and postretirement plans to be remeasured annually in the fourth quarter or on an interim basis as triggering events require remeasurement. refer to note 1 of the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report for further discussion.
during 2020, we adopted the new mp-2020 mortality improvement scale in determining liability for the u.s. plans. the updated projection scale contributed to a slight decrease in the projected benefit obligation, partially offsetting the decrease in the discount rates in 2020, the net of which resulted in the increase of the projected benefit obligation as of december 31, 2020.
during 2019, we adopted the new pri-2012 mortality tables and mp-2019 mortality improvement projection scale in determining the liability for the u.s. plans. the updated mortality tables and projection scale, partially offset the decrease in the discount rates in 2019, the net of which resulted in the increase in the projected benefit obligation as of december 31, 2019.
during 2018, we adopted the new mp-2018 mortality improvement projection scale in determining the liability for the u.s. plans. this updated scale, along with the change in the discount rates, contributed to a decrease in the projected benefit obligation as of december 31, 2018.
judgments and uncertainties - we believe that the most significant assumptions related to our net periodic benefit cost are (1) the discount rate and (2) the expected return on plan assets offset by the actual return on assets, in each case as it relates to our u.s. pension plan. our canadian plan is not significant and the impact of changes in assumptions for that plan is not material.
we determine our discount rates primarily based on high-quality, fixed-income investments and yield-to-maturity analyses specific to our estimated future benefit payments available as of the measurement date. discount rates are reset annually on the measurement date to reflect current market conditions. to determine the discount rate for our u.s. pension and postretirement benefit plans, we use a bond matching approach to select specific bonds that would satisfy our projected benefit payments. we believe the bond matching approach reflects the process we would employ to settle our pension and postretirement benefit obligations. for our canadian plans we use a third-party yield curve to develop our discount rates. the yield curve provides discount rates related to a dedicated high-quality bond portfolio whose cash flows extend beyond the current period, from which we choose a rate matched to the expected benefit payments required for each plan. taking into consideration the factors noted above, our weighted-average discount rate used to determine benefit obligations was 2.56% at december 31, 2020.
the weighted average expected return on plan assets for 2020 was 6.46%. the weighted average expected return on plan assets for 2021 is 4.65%. the expected return on plan assets was based on the company's review of the asset allocation of the portfolio among various asset classes and represents an estimate of future experience for trust asset returns, reflects current and expected future market conditions along with recent changes to the asset allocations. the rate is net of investment and administrative expenses paid from the trust.

under the new method of accounting for our pension and postretirement benefit plans, the market-related value of our assets will be equal to our fair value of plan assets and are remeasured in the fourth quarter with gains and losses recognized through the consolidated statements of income. we do not expect our 2021 net periodic benefit income, which includes the effect of the market-related value of assets, to be materially different from our 2020 net periodic benefit income. see note 9 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report for details on changes in the pension benefit obligation and the fair value of plan assets.

overview and executive summary agilent technologies inc. ("we", "agilent" or the "company"), incorporated in delaware in may 1999, is a global leader in life sciences, diagnostics and applied chemical markets, providing application focused solutions that include instruments, software, services and consumables for the entire laboratory workflow.
covid-19 pandemic both our domestic and international operations have been and continue to be affected by the ongoing global pandemic of a novel strain of coronavirus ("covid-19") and the resulting volatility and uncertainty it has caused in the u.s. and international markets. many countries, including the united states, implemented measures such as quarantine, shelter-in-place, curfew, travel and activity restrictions and similar isolation measures, including government orders and other restrictions on the conduct of business operations at different times. due to these measures, we experienced unpredictable reductions or increases in demand for certain of our products, disruptions or delays in shipments of certain materials or components of our products, and delays in installations and services due to the inability to access customer sites, primarily in the latter part of our second quarter.
as an essential business throughout the covid-19 pandemic, we have remained open with our top priority being the health and safety of our employees, customers and community. at every stage of the pandemic, we have taken decisive and appropriate precautions, including a mandatory work from home policy for all employees with the exception of manufacturing, distribution, and certain laboratory environments, as well as restrictions on all non-essential travel and visitors into our facilities. at this time, our factories continue to operate around the world in accordance with the guidance issued by local, state and national government authorities. our digital workplace strategy and strategic technology investments have enabled us to provide modern connectivity and collaboration tools to our employees to meet remote working needs as this situation has escalated. we have taken and continue to take proactive measures to ensure the health and safety of our global employee base. we designed a multi-phase return-to-office process for the safe return of our employees to our sites. we developed and implemented rigorous return-to-office protocols to promote a safe work environment in all locations for employees who have been working on-site throughout the pandemic and for employees who will be returning in the future, as well as, for the safety of all customer and vendor interactions.
at this time, the covid-19 pandemic has not significantly impacted our manufacturing facilities or third parties to whom we outsource certain manufacturing processes, the distribution centers where our inventory is managed or the operations of our logistics and other service providers. we continue working with our customers and suppliers to understand the existing and potential future negative impacts to our delivery and supply chain and take actions in an effort to mitigate such impacts. the majority of the markets we serve, such as the pharmaceutical, biopharmaceutical, food, environmental and diagnostics and clinical markets, have continued to operate at various levels throughout the pandemic, and we continue working closely with our customers to ensure their seamless operations. from a customer-facing perspective, we continue leveraging digital demand generation activities, including virtual demonstrations across all regions, remote instrument repairs, virtual sales seminars, online product training, and rapid one-on-one communications over emails, phone and video conferencing.
despite the economic challenges due to the covid-19 pandemic, we ended fiscal year 2020 with revenue growth of 3 percent year over year with revenue growth from most of our key end markets. in the latter part of the fiscal year, our agilent crosslab business began to see an increase in revenue for our on-demand services and installation services due to the re-opening of laboratories around the world, especially in europe. while we began to see elective medical procedures resume in the fourth quarter, revenue from our diagnostics and genomics business continues to be negatively impacted by the covid-19 pandemic. in our life sciences and applied markets business, we saw an increase in demand for some of our products for use in the covid-19 testing, vaccine and therapeutic drug development. we also benefited from our cost savings actions which included reduction in travel and non-essential spending.
the covid-19 pandemic continues to be dynamic, and near-term challenges across the economy remain. although we anticipate there will be vaccines distributed widely in the near future, we expect continued volatility and unpredictability related to the impact of covid-19 on our business results. we continue to actively monitor the pandemic and we will continue to take appropriate steps to mitigate the adverse impacts on our business posed by the on-going spread of covid-19.
2030 senior notes on june 4, 2020, we issued an aggregate principal amount of $500 million in senior notes ("2030 senior notes"). the 2030 senior notes were issued at 99.812% of their principal amount. the 2030 senior notes will mature on june 4, 2030, and bear interest at a fixed rate of 2.10% per annum. the interest is payable semi-annually on june 4th and december 4th of each year and payments commenced on december 4, 2020.
acquisitions in 2019, we acquired 100 percent of the stock of acea biosciences inc. ("acea"), a developer of cell analysis tools, for $250 million. in addition, we completed the acquisition of privately-owned lionheart technologies llc ("biotek"), a leader in the design, manufacture and distribution of innovative life science instrumentation for $1.17 billion. the financial results of these businesses have been included in our financial results from the date of the close.

net income was $719 million in 2020 compared to net income of $1,071 million and $316 million in 2019 and 2018, respectively. net income in 2020 was impacted by revenue declines in certain of our businesses associated with the covid-19 pandemic and increased costs and expenses which included an impairment charge of $98 million related to the closure of our sequencer development program. net income for the year ended october 31, 2019 was impacted by a discrete tax benefit of $299 million related to the extension of the company's tax incentives in singapore. net income for the year ended october 31, 2018 was impacted by a discrete tax charge of $552 million related to the enactment of the tax act that was passed on december 22, 2017. as of october 31, 2020 and 2019, we had cash and cash equivalents balances of $1,441 million and $1,382 million, respectively.
on may 28, 2015 we announced that our board of directors had approved a share repurchase program (the "2015 repurchase program"). the 2015 share repurchase program authorizes the purchase of up to $1.14 billion of our common stock at the company's discretion through and including november 1, 2018. the 2015 repurchase program did not require the company to acquire a specific number of shares and could have been suspended or discontinued at any time. during the year ended october 31, 2018, we repurchased and retired approximately 6.4 million shares for $422 million under this authorization. as of october 31, 2018, we had remaining authorization to repurchase up to $188 million of our common stock under this program which expired on november 1, 2018.
on november 19, 2018 we announced that our board of directors had approved a new share repurchase program (the "2019 repurchase program") designed, among other things, to reduce or eliminate dilution resulting from issuance of stock under the company's employee equity incentive programs. the 2019 share repurchase program authorizes the purchase of up to $1.75 billion of our common stock at the company's discretion and has no fixed termination date. the 2019 repurchase program does not require the company to acquire a specific number of shares and may be suspended, amended or discontinued at any time. during the year ended october 31, 2019, we repurchased and retired 10.4 million shares for $723 million under this authorization. during the year ended october 31, 2020, we repurchased and retired approximately 5.2 million shares for $469 million under this authorization. as of october 31, 2020, we had remaining authorization to repurchase up to $558 million of our common stock under this program.
during the year ended october 31, 2020, cash dividends of 0.720 per share, or $222 million were declared and paid on the company's outstanding common stock. during the year ended october 31, 2019, cash dividends of 0.656 per share, or $206 million were declared and paid on the company's outstanding common stock. during the year ended october 31, 2018, cash dividends of 0.596 per share, or $191 million were declared and paid on the company's outstanding common stock.
on november 18, 2020 we declared a quarterly dividend of $0.194 per share of common stock, or approximately $59 million which will be paid on january 27, 2021 to shareholders of record as of the close of business on january 5, 2021. the timing and amounts of any future dividends are subject to determination and approval by our board of directors.
looking forward, our top priority continues to be the health and safety of our employees, customers and community, as well as supporting our customers' operations. we also remain focused on improving our customers' experience, differentiating product solutions and productivity especially during these extraordinary times. our focus on meeting our customers' needs supported several aspects of the covid-19 research and testing along with therapeutic and vaccine development. while uncertainties remain as the spread of covid-19 begins to rise, we are cautiously optimistic that in the short-term our financial results can continue to improve as the global economy continues its path towards recovery.
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the u.s. requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. management bases its estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions believed to be reasonable. although these estimates are based on management's best knowledge of current events and actions that may impact the company in the future, actual results may be different from the estimates. an accounting policy is deemed to be critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made and if different estimates that reasonably could have been used or changes in the accounting estimate that are reasonably likely to occur could materially change the financial statements. our critical accounting policies are those that affect our financial statements materially and involve difficult, subjective or complex judgments by management. those policies are revenue recognition, inventory valuation, retirement and post-retirement plan assumptions, valuation of goodwill and purchased intangible assets and accounting for income taxes.
revenue recognition.  on november 1, 2018, we adopted accounting standard codification topic 606, revenue from contracts with customers ("asc 606").
we enter into contracts to sell products, services or combinations of products and services. products may include hardware or software and services may include one-time service events or services performed over time.
we derive revenue primarily from the sale of analytical and diagnostics products and services. a performance obligation is a promise in a contract to transfer a distinct product or service to a customer and is the unit of account under asc 606. revenue is recognized when control of the promised products or services is transferred to our customers and the performance obligation is fulfilled in an amount that reflects the consideration that we expect to be entitled in exchange for those products or services, the transaction price. for equipment, consumables, and most software licenses, control transfers to the customer at a point in time. we use present right to payment, legal title, physical possession of the asset, and risks and rewards of ownership as indicators to determine the transfer of control to the customer. where acceptance is not a formality, the customer must have documented their acceptance of the product or service. for products that include installation, if the installation meets the criteria to be considered a separate performance obligation, product revenue is recognized when control has passed to the customer, and recognition of installation revenue occurs once completed. product revenue, including sales to resellers and distributors is reduced for provisions for warranties, returns, and other adjustments in the period the related sales are recorded.
service revenue includes extended warranty, customer and software support including: software as a service, post contract support, consulting including companion diagnostics, and training and education. instrument service contracts and software maintenance contracts are typically annual contracts, which are billed at the beginning of the contract or maintenance period. revenue for these contracts is recognized on a straight-line basis to revenue over the service period, as a time-based measure of progress best reflects our performance in satisfying this obligation. there are no deferred costs associated with the service contract, as the cost of the service is recorded when the service is performed. service calls not included in a support contract are recognized to revenue at the time a service is performed.
we have sales from standalone software. these arrangements typically include software licenses and maintenance contracts, both of which we have determined are distinct performance obligations. we determine the amount of the transaction price to allocate to the license and maintenance contract based on the relative standalone selling price of each performance obligation. software license revenue is recognized at the point in time when control has been transferred to the customer. the revenue allocated to the software maintenance contract is recognized on a straight-line basis over the maintenance period, which is the contractual term of the contract, as a time-based measure of progress best reflects our performance in satisfying this obligation. unspecified rights to software upgrades are typically sold as part of the maintenance contract on a when-and-if-available basis.
our multiple-element arrangements are generally comprised of a combination of instruments, installation or other start-up services, and/or software, and/or support or services. hardware and software elements are typically delivered at the same time and revenue is recognized when control passes to the customer. service revenue is deferred and recognized over the contractual period or as services are rendered and accepted by the customer. our arrangements generally do not include any provisions for cancellation, termination, or refunds that would significantly impact recognized revenue.
for contracts with multiple performance obligations, we allocate the consideration to which we expect to be entitled to each performance obligation based on relative standalone selling prices and recognize the related revenue when or as control of each individual performance obligation is transferred to customers. we estimate the standalone selling price by calculating the average historical selling price of our products and services per country for each performance obligation. stand-alone selling prices are determined for each distinct good or service in the contract and then we allocate the transaction price in proportion to those standalone selling prices by performance obligations.
a portion of our revenue relates to lease arrangements. standalone lease arrangements are outside the scope of asc 606 and are therefore accounted for in accordance with asc 842, leases. each of these contracts is evaluated as a lease arrangement, either as an operating lease or a sales-type capital lease using the current lease classification guidance. in a lease arrangement that is a multiple-element arrangement that contains equipment leases and the supply of consumables, the revenue associated with the instrument rental is treated under the lease accounting standard asc 842, whereas the revenue associated with the consumables, the non-lease component, is recognized in accordance with the asc 606 revenue standard.
inventory valuation.  we assess the valuation of our inventory on a periodic basis and make adjustments to the value for estimated excess and obsolete inventory based upon estimates about future demand and actual usage. such estimates are difficult to make under most economic conditions. the excess balance determined by this analysis becomes the basis for our excess inventory charge. our excess inventory review process includes analysis of sales forecasts, managing product rollovers and working with manufacturing to maximize recovery of excess inventory. if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management, additional write-downs may be required. if actual market conditions are more favorable than anticipated, inventory previously written down may be sold to customers, resulting in lower cost of sales and higher income from operations than expected in that period.
retirement and post-retirement benefit plan assumptions.  retirement and post-retirement benefit plan costs are a significant cost of doing business. they represent obligations that will ultimately be settled sometime in the future and therefore are subject to estimation. pension accounting is intended to reflect the recognition of future benefit costs over the employees' average expected future service to agilent based on the terms of the plans and investment and funding decisions. to estimate the impact of these future payments and our decisions concerning funding of these obligations, we are required to make assumptions using actuarial concepts within the framework of accounting principles generally accepted in the u.s. two critical assumptions are the discount rate and the expected long-term return on plan assets. other important assumptions include, expected future salary increases, expected future increases to benefit payments, expected retirement dates, employee turnover, retiree mortality rates, and portfolio composition. we evaluate these assumptions at least annually.
the discount rate is used to determine the present value of future benefit payments at the measurement date - october 31 for both u.s. and non-u.s. plans. for 2020 and 2019, the u.s. discount rates were based on the results of matching expected plan benefit payments with cash flows from a hypothetically constructed bond portfolio. in 2020, discount rates for the u.s. plans decreased compared to the previous year due to the decrease in the corporate bond rates. for 2020 and 2019, the discount rates for non-u.s. plans were generally based on published rates for high quality corporate bonds and in 2020, decreased marginally compared to the previous year. if we changed our discount rate by 1 percent, the impact would be less than $1 million in u.s. pension expense and $17 million on non-u.s. pension expense. lower discount rates increase present values of the pension benefit obligation and subsequent year pension expense; higher discount rates decrease present values of the pension benefit obligation and subsequent year pension expense.
the company uses alternate methods of amortization as allowed by the authoritative guidance which amortizes the actuarial gains and losses on a consistent basis for the years presented. for u.s. plans, gains and losses are amortized over the average future lifetime of participants using the corridor method. for most non-u.s. plans and u.s. post-retirement benefit plans, gains and losses are amortized using a separate layer for each year's gains and losses.
in the u.s., target asset allocations for our retirement and post-retirement benefit plans are approximately 80 percent to equities and approximately 20 percent to fixed income investments. our deferred profit-sharing plan target asset allocation is approximately 60 percent to equities and approximately 40 percent to fixed income investments. approximately 1 percent of the retirement and post-retirement plans consists of limited partnerships. outside the u.s., our target asset allocation ranges from 24 percent to 60 percent to equities, from 38 percent to 65 percent to fixed income investments, and from zero to 25 percent to real estate, depending on the plan. all plans' assets are broadly diversified. due to fluctuations in equity markets, our actual allocations of plan assets at october 31, 2020 and 2019 differ from the target allocation. our policy is to bring the actual allocation in line with the target allocation.
equity securities include exchange-traded common stock and preferred stock of companies from broadly diversified industries. fixed income securities include a global portfolio of corporate bonds of companies from diversified industries, government securities, mortgage-backed securities, asset-backed securities, derivative instruments and other. other investments include a group trust consisting primarily of private equity partnerships.
the expected long-term return on plan assets is estimated using current and expected asset allocations as well as historical and expected returns. plan assets are valued at fair value. if we changed our estimated return on assets by 1 percent, the impact would be $4 million on u.s. pension expense and $9 million on non-u.s. pension expense. the net periodic pension and post-retirement benefit costs recorded were a $22 million expense in 2020, $10 million expense in 2019 and $3 million benefit in 2018. the year ended october 31, 2020 included a loss on settlement of $4 million. the year ended october 31, 2018 included a settlement gain of $5 million.
goodwill and purchased intangible assets. under the authoritative guidance, we have the option to perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether further impairment testing is necessary. the accounting standard gives an entity the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether performing the two-step test is necessary. if an entity believes, as a result of its qualitative assessment, that it is more-likely-than-not (i.e., greater than 50% chance) that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, the quantitative impairment test will be required. otherwise, no further testing will be required.
the guidance includes examples of events and circumstances that might indicate that a reporting unit's fair value is less than its carrying amount. these include macro-economic conditions such as deterioration in the entity's operating environment or industry or market considerations; entity-specific events such as increasing costs, declining financial performance, or loss of key personnel; or other events such as an expectation that a reporting unit will be sold or a sustained decrease in the stock price on either an absolute basis or relative to peers.
if it is determined, as a result of the qualitative assessment, that it is more-likely-than-not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, the provisions of authoritative guidance require that we perform a two-step impairment test on goodwill. in the first step, we compare the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value. the second step (if necessary) measures the amount of impairment by applying fair-value-based tests to the individual assets and liabilities within each reporting unit. as defined in the authoritative guidance, a reporting unit is an operating segment, or one level below an operating segment. we aggregate components of an operating segment that have similar economic characteristics into our reporting units.
in fiscal year 2020, we assessed goodwill impairment for our three reporting units which consisted of three segments: life sciences and applied markets, diagnostics and genomics and agilent crosslab. we performed a qualitative test for goodwill impairment of the three reporting units as of september 30, 2020. based on the results of our qualitative testing, we believe that it is more-likely-than-not that the fair value of each reporting unit is greater than its respective carrying value. each quarter we review the events and circumstances to determine if goodwill impairment is indicated. there was no impairment of goodwill during the years ended october 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018.
purchased intangible assets consist primarily of acquired developed technologies, proprietary know-how, trademarks, and customer relationships and are amortized using the best estimate of the asset's useful life that reflect the pattern in which the economic benefits are consumed or used up or a straight-line method ranging from 6 months to 15 years. our determination of the fair value of the intangible assets acquired involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions. specifically, our determination of the fair value of the developed product technology and in-process research and development ("ipr&d") acquired involves significant estimates and assumptions related to revenue growth rates and discount rates. our determination of the fair value of customer relationships acquired involves significant estimates and assumptions related to revenue growth rates, discount rates, and customer attrition rates. our determination of the fair value of the tradename acquired involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions related to revenue growth rates, royalty rates and discount rates. the company believes that the fair value assigned to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed are based on reasonable assumptions and estimates that marketplace participants would use. actual results could differ materially from these estimates. ipr&d is initially capitalized at fair value as an intangible asset with an indefinite life and assessed for impairment thereafter. when the ipr&d project is complete, it is reclassified as an amortizable purchased intangible asset and is amortized over its estimated useful life. if an ipr&d project is abandoned, we will record a charge for the value of the related intangible asset to our consolidated statement of operations in the period it is abandoned.
we continually monitor events and changes in circumstances that could indicate carrying amounts of finite-lived intangible assets may not be recoverable. when such events or changes in circumstances occur, we assess the recoverability of finite-lived intangible assets by determining whether the carrying value of such assets will be recovered through undiscounted expected future cash flows. if the total of the undiscounted future cash flows is less than the carrying amount of those assets, we recognize an impairment loss based on the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value of the assets. during 2018, we recorded an impairment charge of $21 million related to purchased intangible assets within the diagnostics and genomics segment that were deemed unrecoverable.
our indefinite-lived intangible assets are ipr&d intangible assets. the accounting guidance allows a qualitative approach for testing indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment, similar to the issued impairment testing guidance for goodwill and allows the option to first assess qualitative factors (events and circumstances) that could have affected the significant inputs used in determining the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset to determine whether it is more-likely-than-not (i.e., greater than 50% chance) that the indefinite-lived intangible asset is impaired. an organization may choose to bypass the qualitative assessment for any indefinite-lived intangible asset in any period and proceed directly to calculating its fair value. we performed a qualitative test for impairment of indefinite-lived intangible assets as of september 30, 2020. based on the results of our qualitative testing, we believe that it is more-likely-than-not that the fair value of these indefinite-lived intangible assets is greater than their respective carrying values. each quarter we review the events and circumstances to determine if impairment of indefinite-lived intangible assets is indicated. during fiscal year 2020, we recorded an impairment of in-process research and development of $90 million related to the shutdown of our sequencer development program in our diagnostics and genomics segment. during the year ended october 31, 2019 and 2018 there were no impairments of indefinite-lived intangible assets.
accounting for income taxes. we must make certain estimates and judgments in determining income tax expense for financial statement purposes. these estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of tax credits, benefits and deductions, and in the calculation of certain tax assets and liabilities which arise from differences in the timing of recognition of revenue and expense for tax and financial statement purposes, as well as interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions. significant changes to these estimates may result in an increase or decrease to our tax provision in a subsequent period. on a quarterly basis, we provide for income taxes based upon an estimated annual effective tax rate. the effective tax rate is highly dependent upon the geographic composition of worldwide earnings, tax regulations governing each region, availability of tax credits and the effectiveness of our tax planning strategies. we monitor the changes in many factors and adjust our effective income tax rate on a timely basis. if actual results differ from these estimates, this could have a material effect on our financial condition and results of operations.
significant management judgment is also required in determining whether deferred tax assets will be realized in full or in part. when it is more-likely-than-not that all or some portion of deferred tax assets may not be realized, a valuation allowance must be established against such deferred tax assets. we consider all available positive and negative evidence on a jurisdiction-by-jurisdiction basis when assessing whether it is more likely than not that deferred tax assets are recoverable. we consider evidence such as our past operating results, the existence of losses in recent years and our forecast of future taxable income.
the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax law and regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions. although the guidance on the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes prescribes the use of a recognition and measurement model, the determination of whether an uncertain tax position has met those thresholds will continue to require significant judgment by management. in accordance with the guidance on the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes, for all u.s. and other tax jurisdictions, we recognize potential liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues based on our estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes and interest will be due. the ultimate resolution of tax uncertainties may differ from what is currently estimated, which could result in a material impact on income tax expense. if our estimate of income tax liabilities proves to be less than the ultimate assessment, a further charge to expense would be required. if events occur and the payment of these amounts ultimately proves to be unnecessary, the reversal of the liabilities would result in tax benefits being recognized in the period when we determine the liabilities are no longer necessary. we include interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits within the provision for income taxes on the consolidated statements of operations.
adoption of new pronouncements see note 2, "new accounting pronouncements," to the consolidated financial statements for a description of new accounting pronouncements.
foreign currency our revenues, costs and expenses, and monetary assets and liabilities are exposed to changes in foreign currency exchange rates as a result of our global operating and financing activities. foreign currency movements for the year ended october 31, 2020 had an overall unfavorable impact on revenue of 1 percentage point when compared to the same period last year. the unfavorable effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates have decreased revenue by approximately 2 percentage points for the year ended october 31, 2019. when movements in foreign currency exchange rates have a negative impact on revenue, they will also have a positive impact on our costs and expenses. we calculate the impact of movements in foreign currency exchange rates by applying the actual foreign currency exchange rates in effect during the last month of each quarter of the current year to both the applicable current and prior year periods. we hedge revenues, expenses and balance sheet exposures that are not denominated in the functional currencies of our subsidiaries on a short term and anticipated basis. we do experience some fluctuations within individual lines of the consolidated statement of operations and balance sheet because our hedging program is not designed to offset the currency movements in each category of revenues, expenses, monetary assets and liabilities. our hedging program is designed to hedge currency movements on a relatively short-term basis (up to a rolling thirteen-month period). we may also hedge equity balances denominated in foreign currency on a long-term basis. to the extent that we are required to pay for all, or portions, of an acquisition price in foreign currencies, we may enter into foreign exchange contracts to reduce the risk that currency movements will impact the u.s. dollar cost of the transaction.

for 2020, the company's income tax expense was $123 million with an effective tax rate of 14.6 percent. for the year ended october 31, 2020, our effective tax rate and the resulting provision for income taxes were impacted by foreign income taxed at lower rates.
for 2019, the company's income tax benefit was $152 million with an effective tax rate of (16.5) percent. for the year ended october 31, 2019, our effective tax rate and the resulting provision for income taxes were significantly impacted by the discrete benefit of $299 million related to the extension of the company's tax incentive in singapore.
for 2018, the company's income tax expense was $630 million with an effective tax rate of 66.6 percent. for the year ended october 31, 2018, our effective tax rate and the resulting provision for income taxes were significantly impacted by the discrete charge of $552 million related to the enactment of the u.s. tax cuts and jobs act (the "tax act") consisting of (1) an expense of $499 million of u.s. transition tax and correlative items on deemed repatriated earnings of non-u.s. subsidiaries and (2) an expense of $53 million associated with the impact on deferred taxes resulting from the decreased u.s. corporate tax rate.
the company has negotiated tax holidays in several different jurisdictions, most significantly in singapore. the tax holidays provide lower rates of taxation on certain classes of income and require various thresholds of investments and employment or specific types of income in those jurisdictions. in december 2018, the tax holiday in singapore was renegotiated and extended through 2027. as a result of the incentives, the impact of the tax holidays decreased income taxes by $71 million, $368 million, and $87 million in 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively. the benefit of the tax holidays on net income per share (diluted) was approximately $0.23, $1.16, and $0.27 in 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. of the $1.16 benefit of the tax incentives on net income per share (diluted) in 2019, $0.94 of the benefit relates to one-time items from the extension of the company's tax incentive in singapore.
with these jurisdictions and the u.s., it is reasonably possible that there could be significant changes to our unrecognized tax benefits in the next twelve months due to either the expiration of a statute of limitation or a tax audit settlement which will be partially offset by an anticipated tax liability related to unremitted foreign earnings, where applicable. given the number of years and numerous matters that remain subject to examination in various tax jurisdictions, management is unable to estimate the range of possible changes to the balance of our unrecognized tax benefits.
the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax law and regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions. although the guidance on the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes prescribes the use of a recognition and measurement model, the determination of whether an uncertain tax position has met those thresholds will continue to require significant judgment by management. in accordance with the guidance on the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes, for all u.s. and other tax jurisdictions, we recognize potential liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues based on our estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes and interest will be due. the ultimate resolution of tax uncertainties may differ from what is currently estimated, which could result in a material impact on income tax expense. if our estimate of income tax liabilities proves to be less than the ultimate assessment, a further charge to expense would be required. if events occur and the payment of these amounts ultimately proves to be unnecessary, the reversal of the liabilities would result in tax benefits being recognized in the period when we determine the liabilities are no longer necessary.

off balance sheet arrangements and other our liquidity is affected by many factors, some of which are based on normal ongoing operations of our business and some of which arise from fluctuations related to global economics and markets. our cash balances are generated and held in many locations throughout the world. local government regulations may restrict our ability to move cash balances to meet cash needs under certain circumstances. we do not currently expect such regulations and restrictions to impact our ability to pay vendors and conduct operations throughout our global organization.
contractual commitments our cash flows from operations are dependent on a number of factors, including fluctuations in our operating results, accounts receivable collections, inventory management, and the timing of tax and other payments. as a result, the impact of contractual obligations on our liquidity and capital resources in future periods should be analyzed in conjunction with such factors.
the following table summarizes our total contractual obligations at october 31, 2020 for agilent operations and excludes amounts recorded in our consolidated balance sheet (in millions):
less than one            one to three years         three to five years        more than five years year commitments to contract manufacturers and suppliers                      $541                   $15                        $1                         $-

commitments to contract manufacturers and suppliers.  we purchase components from a variety of suppliers and use several contract manufacturers to provide manufacturing services for our products. during the normal course of business, we issue purchase orders with estimates of our requirements several months ahead of the delivery dates. the above amounts represent the commitments under the open purchase orders with our suppliers that have not yet been received. however, our agreements with these suppliers usually provide us the option to cancel, reschedule, and adjust our requirements based on our business needs prior to firm orders being placed. we expect to fulfill most of our purchase commitments for inventory within one year.
other purchase commitments. we have categorized "other purchase commitments" related to contracts with professional services suppliers. typically, we can cancel contracts with professional services suppliers without penalties. for those contracts that are not cancelable without penalties, there are termination fees and costs or commitments for continued spending that we are obligated to pay to a supplier under each contact's termination period before such contract can be cancelled. our contractual obligations with these suppliers under "other purchase commitments" were approximately $85 million within the next year. approximately $23 million of the contracts relate to penalties that will reduce over the next 13 years.
retirement plans.  commitments under the retirement plans relate to expected contributions to be made to our u.s. and non-u.s. defined benefit plans and to our post-retirement medical plans for the next year only. contributions after next year are impractical to estimate. effective may 1, 2016 until april 30, 2022, we will provide an additional transitional company contribution for certain eligible employees equal to 3 percent, 4 percent or 5 percent of an employee's annual eligible compensation due to the u.s. retirement plan benefits being frozen.
we had no material off-balance sheet arrangements as of october 31, 2020 or october 31, 2019.

other long-term liabilities as of october 31, 2020 and october 31, 2019 include $323 million and $328 million, respectively, related to long-term income tax liabilities. of these amounts, $199 million related to uncertain tax positions as of both october 31, 2020 and october 31, 2019, respectively. we are unable to accurately predict when these amounts will be realized or released. however, it is reasonably possible that there could be significant changes to our unrecognized tax benefits in the next twelve months due to either the expiration of a statute of limitations or a tax audit settlement. the remaining $124 million in other long-term liabilities relates to the one-time transition tax payable.

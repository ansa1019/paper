introduction and segments walgreens boots alliance, inc. ("walgreens boots alliance") and its subsidiaries are a global leader in retail and wholesale pharmacy. its operations are conducted through three reportable segments:
•retail pharmacy usa;
•retail pharmacy international; and
•pharmaceutical wholesale see note 16, segment reporting and note 17, sales further information.
factors affecting our results and comparability the company has been, and we expect it to continue to be, affected by a number of factors that may cause actual results to differ from our historical results or current expectations. these factors include: the impact of the coronavirus covid-19 ("covid-19") pandemic on our operations and financial results; the financial performance of our equity method investees, including amerisourcebergen; the influence of certain holidays; seasonality; foreign currency rates; changes in vendor, payer and customer relationships and terms and associated reimbursement pressure; changes in pharmaceutical manufacturers' pricing or distribution policies; strategic transactions and acquisitions, including the acquisition of stores and other assets from rite aid; joint ventures and other strategic collaborations; changes in laws, including the u.s. tax law changes; changes in trade, tariffs, including trade relations between the united states and china, and international relations, including the uk's withdrawal from the european union and its impact on our operations and prospects and those of our customers and counterparties; the timing and magnitude of cost reduction initiatives, including under our transformational cost management program (as defined below); the timing and severity of the cough, cold and flu season; fluctuations in variable costs; the impacts of looting, natural disasters, war, terrorism and other catastrophic events; and changes in general economic conditions in the markets in which the company operates. these and other factors can affect the company's operations and net earnings for any period and may cause such results not to be comparable to the same period in previous years. the results presented in this report are not necessarily indicative of future operating results.
estimated covid-19 impacts and uncertainties in december 2019, a novel strain of coronavirus, which causes the infectious disease known as covid-19, was reported. the world health organization declared covid-19 a "public health emergency of international concern" on january 30, 2020 and a global pandemic on march 11, 2020. covid-19 has severely impacted, and is expected to continue to impact, the economies of the u.s., the uk and other countries around the world. covid-19 has created significant public health concerns as well as significant volatility, uncertainty and economic disruption in every region in which we operate, all of which have adversely affected and may continue to adversely affect our industries and our business operations. further, financial and credit markets have experienced and may again experience volatility and turmoil. policies and initiatives designed to reduce the transmission of covid-19 have resulted in, among other things, temporary closure or reduced hours of operation of certain store locations in u.s., uk and other countries, reduced customer traffic and sales in our retail pharmacies and the adoption of work-from-home policies.
covid-19 adversely affected global economic conditions in fiscal 2020 and the company expects this will continue into fiscal 2021 and possibly longer. the situation surrounding covid-19 remains fluid, and we are actively managing our response in collaboration with customers, government officials, team members and business partners and assessing potential impacts to our financial position and operating results, as well as developments in our business. as covid-19 impacts the economies of the u.s. and other countries around the world, the company has put preparedness plans in place at our facilities to maintain continuity of our operations, while also taking steps to keep our team members healthy and safe.

during the fiscal 2020, we experienced certain adverse impacts of covid-19, particularly in the second half of fiscal 2020. sales were adversely impacted with the majority of the decline within the retail pharmacy international division, reflecting a significant reduction in footfall in boots uk stores, particularly in major high street, train stations and airport locations due to government restrictions. footfall did, however, improve steadily in the fourth quarter compared with the third quarter. while most boots stores remained open throughout the uk lockdown to provide communities with pharmacy and essential healthcare, our largest premium beauty and fragrance counters were effectively closed. during the three months ended may 31, 2020, more than 100 boots stores, mainly in high street, train stations and airport locations, were temporarily closed as were nearly all of the 600 boots opticians stores. globally pharmacy volume was impacted by a decline in doctor visits and hospital patient admissions in the third quarter. however, trends improved in the three months ended august 31, 2020 in new to therapy scripts compared to the prior quarter. additionally, retail gross margin was adversely impacted by sales mix, with a shift from higher margin discretionary categories to lower margin essential categories, and by higher supply chain costs. the company took measures to keep stores open during covid-19, incurring incremental selling, general and administrative expenses, including higher employee costs and store expenses related to social distancing and incremental cleaning. operating income was significantly and adversely impacted as a result of the foregoing factors. in addition, due to the significant impact of covid-19 on the financial performance of the retail pharmacy international division, the company completed a quantitative impairment analysis for goodwill and certain intangibles in boots uk, which resulted in the recording of non-cash pre-tax impairment charges of $2.0 billion during the three months ended may 31, 2020.
in an effort to strengthen our liquidity position while navigating covid-19, we have taken a number of proactive steps since march 2020, including the issuance of $1.5 billion of debt securities, entry into new and extended credit facilities, establishing a euro commercial paper program and suspending activity under our 2018 stock repurchase program, as described in liquidity and capital resources below.
in response to covid-19, various domestic and foreign federal, state and local governmental legislation, regulations, orders, policies and initiatives have been implemented designed to reduce the transmission of covid-19, as well as to help address economic and market volatility and instability resulting from covid-19. the company has assessed and will continue to assess the impact of these governmental actions on the company. it has participated in certain of these programs, including for example availing itself to certain tax deferrals which were introduced by the cares act in the u.s. and certain tax deferral and benefit and employee wage support in the uk, and may continue to do so in the future.
the company has also taken a number of proactive actions consistent with regulatory directives, such as digital 'order ahead' drive-thru with an increased range of products available for drive-thru pick-up, and put in place new delivery options available nationwide in the u.s. to continue to work with customers and manage through the pandemic, the company has launched a new covid-19 testing program for businesses and also completed more than two million covid-19 tests across the us and uk. the company also took certain actions during fiscal 2020 to partly mitigate the impact of covid-19 through cost containment across the company including temporary store closures, furloughing approximately 16,000 uk employees at the peak of the crisis, decreasing store hours and reducing rent at some locations.
as a result of covid-19, a portion of our global workforce, including employees and extended workforce, rapidly shifted to a working from home environment beginning in march 2020 and many continue to work remotely. while our system of internal controls were not specifically designed and implemented to accommodate for this shift, we have evaluated and concluded that these changes to the working environment did not have a material effect on the company's internal control over financial reporting during the second half of fiscal 2020 as described in item 9a. controls and procedures below. the company will continue to monitor and assess the covid-19 situation and its internal controls and seek to mitigate any impact on their design and operating effectiveness.
the company anticipates additional mandates and directives, including revisions thereto, from foreign, federal, state, county and city authorities throughout the continuation of the covid-19 pandemic and for some time thereafter. the impact of this activity on the u.s. and global economies and consumer, customer and health care utilization patterns depends upon the evolving factors and future developments. as a result, the financial and/or operational impact these covid-19 related governmental actions and inactions will have on our businesses, operating results, cash flows and/or financial condition is uncertain, but the collective impact could be material and adverse.
we continue to closely monitor the impact of covid-19 on our business and geographies, including how it is impacting our customers, team members, suppliers, vendors, business partners and distribution channels. however, the future impact that covid-19 will have on our financial position and operating results may be affected by numerous uncertainties, including the severity of the virus, the duration of the outbreak, governmental, business or other actions, impacts on our supply chain, the effect on customer demand, store closures or changes to our operations. the health of our workforce, and our ability to meet staffing needs in our stores, distribution facilities, wholesale operations and other critical functions cannot be predicted and is vital to our operations. the impacts of a potential worsening of global economic conditions and the continued disruptions to,
- 37 -
and volatility in, the credit and financial markets and consumer spending, as well as other unanticipated consequences, remain unknown. further, additional waves of covid-19 in fiscal 2021 or beyond would cause many of the impacts described herein to return or be exacerbated. in addition, we cannot predict with certainty the impact that covid-19 will have on our customers, vendors, suppliers and other business partners; however, any material effect on these parties could adversely impact us.
for further information, please see item 1a, risk factors in this report, which is incorporated herein by reference. the company's current expectations described above are forward-looking statements and our actual results may differ. factors that might cause a difference include, but are not limited to, those discussed below under "cautionary note regarding forward-looking statements", and in item 1a, risk factors, in this report.
u.s. recent events during the fiscal 2020, significant looting impacted certain stores with varying degrees of damage throughout the united states. as a result, the company recognized $68 million charge during the fiscal 2020 for estimated store damage and inventory losses, net of insurance recoveries. the resulting store closures adversely affected sales.
store damage and inventory losses related to these recent events are recognized as the costs are incurred in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles ("gaap"). the company treats these charges as special items impacting comparability of results in its earnings disclosures.
the impact of brexit following the june 2016 advisory referendum, the united kingdom withdrew from the european union ("brexit") on january 31, 2020. it began a transition period until december 31, 2020 in which to negotiate a new trading relationship for goods and services. failure to complete negotiations by the deadline could result in the united kingdom becoming subject to trade agreements with the european union that are less favorable than those currently in effect. in addition, since the referendum, there has been periods of significant volatility in the global stock markets and currency exchange rates, as well as challenging market condition in the united kingdom. given the lack of comparable precedent, it is unclear what financial, trade, regulatory and legal implications the withdrawal of the united kingdom from the european union will have on our business, particularly united kingdom and other european operations; however, brexit and its related effects could have a material impact on the company's consolidated financial position or operating results. for more information relating to this topic, see "risk factors-our substantial international business operations subject us to a number of operating, economic, political, regulatory and other international business risks."
transformational cost management program on december 20, 2018, the company announced a transformational cost management program that was expected at that time to deliver in excess of $1.0 billion of annual cost savings by fiscal 2022 (the "transformational cost management program"). as of the date of this report, the company now expects to deliver in excess of $2.0 billion of annual cost savings by fiscal 2022, an increase from the previously reported expectations of annual cost savings in excess of $1.8 billion in october 2019 and $1.5 billion in april 2019. the transformational cost management program, which is multi-faceted and includes divisional optimization initiatives, global smart spending, global smart organization and the transformation of the company's information technology (it) capabilities, is designed to help the company achieve increased cost efficiencies. to date, the company has taken actions across all aspects of the transformational cost management program. the actions under the transformational cost management program focus on all reportable segments and the company's global functions. divisional optimization within each of the company's segments includes activities such as optimization of stores including plans to exit approximately 200 boots stores in the united kingdom and approximately 250 stores in the united states, as compared to the 200 stores previously reported in july 2020.
the company currently estimates that the transformational cost management program will result in cumulative pre-tax charges to its gaap financial results of approximately $2.1 billion to $2.4 billion, of which $1.8 billion to $2.1 billion are expected to be recorded as exit and disposal activities. the company estimates that approximately 80% of the cumulative pre-tax charges relating to the transformational cost management program will result in future cash expenditures, primarily related to employee severance and business transition costs, it transformation and lease and other real estate payments.

the company considers certain metrics presented in this annual report on form 10-k, such as comparable store sales, comparable pharmacy sales, comparable retail sales, comparable number of prescriptions, and comparable 30-day equivalent prescriptions, to be key performance indicators because the company's management has evaluated its results of operations using these metrics and believes that these key performance indicators presented provide additional perspective and insights when analyzing the core operating performance of the company from period to period and trends in its historical operating results. these key performance indicators should not be considered superior to, as a substitute for or as an alternative to, and should be considered in conjunction with, the gaap financial measures presented herein. these measures, which are described in more detail in this annual report on form 10-k, may not be comparable to similarly-titled performance indicators used by other companies.

instruments and plans complying with rule 10b5-1. see note 5, equity method investments, to the consolidated financial statements included herein for further information.
commitments and contingencies the information set forth in note 10, commitments and contingencies, to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii, item 8 of this form 10-k is incorporated herein by reference.
critical accounting policies the consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america and include amounts based on management's prudent judgments and estimates. actual results may differ from these estimates. management believes that any reasonable deviation from those judgments and estimates would not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations. to the extent that the estimates used differ from actual results, however, adjustments to the consolidated statements of earnings and corresponding consolidated balance sheets accounts would be necessary. these adjustments would be made in future periods. some of the more significant estimates include business combinations, goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment, long-lived assets impairment, cost of sales and inventory, equity method investments, pension and postretirement benefits and income taxes. the company uses the following methods to determine its estimates:
business combinations - the company accounts for business combinations using the acquisition method of accounting, which requires that once control is obtained, all the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, including amounts attributable to noncontrolling interests, be recorded at their respective fair values at the date of acquisition. the determination of fair values of assets and liabilities acquired requires estimates and the use of valuation techniques when market value is not readily available.
for intangible assets, the company generally uses the income approach to determine fair value. the income approach requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions. these estimates and assumptions primarily include, but are not limited to: discount rates, terminal growth rates, royalty rates, forecasts of revenue, operating income, depreciation, amortization and capital expenditures. the discount rates applied to the projections reflect the risk factors associated with those projections.
although the company believes its estimates of fair value are reasonable, actual financial results could differ from those estimates due to the inherent uncertainty involved in making such estimates. changes in assumptions concerning future financial results or other underlying assumptions could have a significant impact on the determination of the fair value of the intangible assets acquired.
judgment is also required in determining the intangible asset's useful life.
leases - the company determines if an arrangement contains a lease at the inception of a contract. the lease classification is determined at the commencement date. right-of-use assets represent the company's right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent the company's obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease during the lease term. right-of-use assets and lease liabilities are recognized at the commencement date based on the present value of the remaining future minimum lease payments during the lease term. the commencement date of all lease terms is the earlier of the date the company becomes legally obligated to make rent payments or the date the company has the right to control the property. the company utilizes its incremental borrowing rate to discount the lease payments. the incremental borrowing rate is based on the company's estimated rate of interest for a collateralized borrowing over a similar term as the lease term. the operating lease right-of-use assets also include lease payments made before commencement, lease incentives and are recorded net of impairment. operating leases are expensed on a straight line basis over the lease term.
the lease term of real estate leases includes renewal options that are reasonably certain of being exercised. options to extend are considered reasonably certain of being exercised based on evaluation if there is significant investments within the leased property which have useful lives greater than the non-cancelable lease term, performance of the underlying store and the company's economic and strategic initiatives. short-term leases with an initial term of 12 months or less are not recorded on the balance sheets.
the company accounts for lease components and non-lease components as a single lease component. variable lease payment amounts that cannot be determined at the commencement of the lease such as increases in lease payments based on changes in index rates or usage, are not included in the right-of-use assets or lease liabilities. these are expensed as incurred. the company has real estate leases which require additional payments based on sales volume, as well as reimbursement for real estate taxes, common area maintenance and insurance, which are expensed as incurred as variable lease costs and hence are not included in the lease payments used to calculate lease liability. other real estate leases contain one fixed lease payment that
- 56 -
includes real estate taxes, common area maintenance and insurance. these fixed payments are considered part of the lease payment and included in the right-of-use assets and lease liabilities. the company does not separately account for the land portion of the leases involving land and building.
finance leases are recognized within property, plant and equipment and as a finance lease liability within accrued expenses and other liabilities and other noncurrent liabilities.
goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment - goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are evaluated for impairment annually during the fourth quarter, or more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change that could more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit or intangible asset below its carrying value. as part of the company's impairment analysis, fair value of a reporting unit is determined using both the income and market approaches. the income approach requires management to estimate a number of factors for each reporting unit, including projected future operating results, economic projections, anticipated future cash flows and discount rates. the market approach estimates fair value using comparable marketplace fair value data from within a comparable industry grouping.
indefinite-lived intangible assets are tested for impairment by comparing the estimated fair value of the asset to its carrying value. if the carrying value of the asset exceeds its estimated fair value, an impairment loss is recognized and the asset is written down to its estimated fair value. indefinite-lived intangible assets fair values are estimated using the relief from royalty method and excess earnings method of the income approach. the determination of the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangibles requires the company to make significant estimates and assumptions. these estimates and assumptions primarily include, but are not limited to: forecasts of revenue, the selection of appropriate royalty rate and discount rates.
during the three months ended may 31, 2020, the company completed a quantitative impairment analysis for goodwill and certain indefinite-lived intangible assets related to its two reporting units within retail pharmacy international division, boots and other international, as a result of the significant impact of covid-19 on their financial performance. based on this analysis, the company recorded impairment charges of $1.7 billion on boots goodwill and $0.3 billion on certain indefinite-lived boots tradename assets.
based on the annual evaluation as of june 1, 2020 valuation date, the fair values of the company's reporting units exceeded their carrying amounts ranging from approximately 4% to approximately 239% excluding boots reporting unit for which the excess of fair value over carrying amount was nominal due to an impairment charge recognized during the three months ended may 31, 2020. other international reporting unit's fair value was in excess of its carrying value by approximately 4% compared to 16% on june 1, 2019. as of august 31, 2020, the carrying values of goodwill were $1.1 billion and $0.5 billion for boots reporting unit and other international reporting unit, respectively. the fair values of certain indefinite-lived intangibles within the boots reporting unit exceeded their carrying amounts ranging from approximately 4% to approximately 31%, excluding certain indefinite-lived boots tradename assets for which the excess of fair values over carrying amounts were nominal due to impairment charges recognized during the three months ended may 31, 2020. as of august 31, 2020, the carrying value of the indefinite-lived intangibles within the boots reporting unit was $7.2 billion. during the fiscal year ended august 31, 2019, the company recorded an impairment of $73 million on its pharmacy licenses in the boots reporting unit.
the determination of the fair value of the reporting units requires the company to make significant estimates and assumptions including the business and financial performance of the company's reporting units, as well as how such performance may be impacted by covid-19. these estimates and assumptions primarily include, but are not limited to: the selection of appropriate peer group companies, control premiums appropriate for acquisitions in the industries in which we compete, discount rates, terminal growth rates, forecasts of revenue, operating income, depreciation, amortization and capital expenditures, including considering the impact of covid-19.
although the company believes its estimates of fair value are reasonable, actual financial results could differ from those estimates due to the inherent uncertainty involved in making such estimates. changes in assumptions concerning future financial results or other underlying assumptions, including the impact of covid-19, could have a significant impact on either the fair value of the reporting units and indefinite-lived intangibles, the amount of any goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible impairment charges, or both. these estimates can be affected by a number of factors including, but not limited to, the impact of covid-19, its severity, duration and its impact on global economies, general economic conditions as well as our profitability. the company will continue to monitor these potential impacts, including the impact of covid-19 and economic, industry and market trends and the impact these may have on boots and other international reporting units.
the company also compares the sum of estimated fair values of reporting units to the company's fair value as implied by the market value of its equity securities. this comparison provides an indication that, in total, assumptions and estimates are reasonable. future declines in the overall market value of the company's equity securities may provide an indication that the fair value of one or more reporting units has declined below its carrying value.

see note 6, goodwill and other intangible assets, to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.
impairment of long lived assets - the company evaluates the recoverability of long-lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of such an asset may not be recoverable. the evaluation of long-lived assets is performed at the lowest level of identifiable cash flows. long-lived assets related to the company's retail operations include property, plant and equipment, definite-lived intangibles, right of use asset as well as operating lease liability. if the asset group fails the recoverability test, then an impairment charge is determined based on the difference between the fair value of the asset group compared to its carrying value. fair value of the asset group is generally determined using income approach based on cash flows expected from the use and eventual disposal of the asset group.
the determination of the fair value of the asset group requires management to estimate a number of factors including anticipated future cash flows and discount rates. although we believe these estimates are reasonable, actual results could differ from those estimates due to the inherent uncertainty involved in making such estimates.
cost of sales and inventory - cost of sales includes the purchase price of goods and cost of services rendered, store and warehouse inventory loss, inventory obsolescence and supplier rebates. in addition to product costs, cost of sales includes warehousing costs for retail operations, purchasing costs, freight costs, cash discounts and vendor allowances.
cost of sales for our retail pharmacy usa segment is derived based upon point-of-sale scanning information with an estimate for shrinkage and is adjusted based on periodic inventory counts. inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market determined by the last-in, first-out ("lifo") method for the retail pharmacy usa segment and primarily on a first-in first-out ("fifo") basis for inventory in the retail pharmacy international and pharmaceutical wholesale segments.
equity method investments - the company uses the equity method of accounting for equity investments if the investment provides the ability to exercise significant influence, but not control, over operating and financial policies of the investee. the company's proportionate share of the net income or loss of these investees is included in consolidated net earnings. judgment regarding the level of influence over each equity method investment includes considering key factors such as the company's ownership interest, legal form of the investee (e.g. limited liability partnership), representation on the board of directors, participation in policy-making decisions and material intra-entity transactions.
the company evaluates equity method investments for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the investment might not be recoverable. factors considered by the company when reviewing an equity method investment for impairment include the length of time (duration) and the extent (severity) to which the fair value of the equity method investment has been less than cost, the investee's financial condition and near-term prospects and the intent and ability to hold the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for anticipated recovery. an impairment that is other-than-temporary is recognized in the period identified.
pension and postretirement benefits - the company has various defined benefit pension plans that cover some of its non-u.s. employees. the company also has a postretirement healthcare plan that covers qualifying u.s. employees. eligibility and the level of benefits for these plans vary depending on participants' status, date of hire and or length of service. pension and postretirement plan expenses and valuations are dependent on assumptions used by third-party actuaries in calculating those amounts. these assumptions include discount rates, healthcare cost trends, long-term return on plan assets, retirement rates, mortality rates and other factors.
in determining long-term rate of return on plan assets assumption, the company considers both the historical performance of the investment portfolio as well as the long-term market return expectations based on the investment mix of the portfolio. a change in any of these assumptions would have an effect on its pension expense. a 25 basis point increase in the discount rate would result in a decline of $438.8 million to the company's pension benefit obligation. a 25 basis point decrease on the expected return on plan assets assumption would increase the company's pension expense by $23.7 million.
the company funds its pension plans in accordance with applicable regulations. the postretirement healthcare plan is not funded.
income taxes -the company is subject to routine income tax audits that occur periodically in the normal course of business. u.s. federal, state, local and foreign tax authorities raise questions regarding the company's tax filing positions, including the timing and amount of deductions and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions. in evaluating the tax benefits associated with the various tax filing positions, the company records a tax benefit for uncertain tax positions using the highest cumulative tax benefit that is more likely than not to be realized. adjustments are made to the liability for unrecognized tax benefits in the period in which the company determines the issue is effectively settled with the tax authorities, the statute of
- 58 -
limitations expires for the return containing the tax position or when more information becomes available. the liability for unrecognized tax benefits, including accrued penalties and interest, is primarily included in other non-current liabilities and current income taxes on the company's consolidated balance sheets and in income tax provision in its consolidated statements of earnings.
in determining its provision for income taxes, the company uses income, permanent differences between book and tax income and enacted statutory income tax rates. the provision for income taxes rate also reflects its assessment of the ultimate outcome of tax audits in addition to any foreign-based income deemed to be taxable in the united states. discrete events such as audit settlements or changes in tax laws are recognized in the period in which they occur.

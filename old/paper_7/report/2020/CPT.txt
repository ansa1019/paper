executive summary we are primarily engaged in the ownership, management, development, redevelopment, acquisition, and construction of multifamily apartment communities. overall, we focus on investing in markets characterized by high-growth economic conditions, strong employment, and attractive quality of life which we believe leads to higher demand and retention of our apartments. as of december 31, 2020, we owned interests in, operated, or were developing 174 multifamily properties comprised of 59,104 apartment homes across the united states as detailed in the following property portfolio table. in addition, we own other land holdings which we may develop into multifamily apartment communities in the future.
impact of the coronavirus pandemic (covid-19) on our business covid-19 has currently resulted in a widespread health crisis which has adversely affected international, national, and local economies and financial markets generally, and has had an unprecedented effect on many industries including the multifamily industry. the discussions below, including without limitation statements with respect to outlooks of future operating performance and liquidity, are subject to the future effects of covid-19 and the responses to curb its spread, which continue to evolve. accordingly, the full magnitude of the pandemic and its ultimate effect on our results of operations, cash flows, financial condition, and liquidity for future years, is uncertain at this time.
additionally, our property revenues and expenses have been and will likely continue to be impacted by covid-19. for the three months ended december 31, 2020, we collected approximately 98.6% of our same store scheduled rents and approximately 1.4% were delinquent. our january collections are approximately 96.9% of our same store scheduled rents and approximately 3.1% are delinquent.
consolidated results net income attributable to common shareholders decreased approximately $95.7 million for the year ended december 31, 2020, as compared to the same period in 2019.
during the year ended december 31, 2020, we incurred a covid-19 related impact of approximately $14.8 million comprised of $9.5 million related to the resident relief funds which were established in april 2020. of this amount, approximately $9.1 million was paid to residents at our wholly-owned communities and was recorded as a reduction to property revenues, and approximately $1.3 million of resident relief funds paid to residents of the operating communities owned by our unconsolidated joint ventures, of which we recognized our ownership interest of $0.4 million in equity in income of joint ventures. additionally, we incurred approximately $4.5 million of covid-19 expenses at our operating properties, which included $2.8 million of bonuses paid to on-site employees who provided essential services during the pandemic and $1.7 million in other directly-related covid-19 expenses. during the year ended december 31, 2020, we also incurred approximately $0.8 million related to the employee relief fund we established to help our employees impacted by covid-19, which was recorded within general and administrative expenses.
in addition to the covid-19 related expenses discussed above, the decrease during the year ended december 31, 2020 was also primarily due to a decrease of $49.5 million related to gains from operating property dispositions in 2019, higher depreciation expense of approximately $30.9 million, and higher interest expense of approximately $10.8 million, as compared to the same period in 2019. the decrease for the year ended december 31, 2020 was partially offset by the approximate $12.0
million loss on early retirement of debt in the fourth quarter of 2019 as compared to the $0.2 million loss recognized in the fourth quarter of 2020. see further discussions of our 2020 operations as compared to 2019 in "results of operations."
property operations our results for the year ended december 31, 2020 reflect an increase in same store revenues of 1.1% as compared to 2019. these increases were primarily due to higher average rental rates which we believe was primarily attributable to our focus on high-growth markets, favorable demographics, a manageable supply of new multifamily housing, and in part many individuals choosing to rent versus buy. the increase during the year ended december 31, 2020 was partially offset by the impact of covid-19.
challenges within the multifamily industry surfaced during 2020 due to covid-19. factors adversely affecting demand for and rents received from our multifamily communities remained and continue to remain intense and pervasive across the united states. overall weak consumer confidence, high unemployment, fears of a prolonged recession, and government-imposed moratoriums on our ability to collect rents and/or evict non-paying tenants, among other factors, have also persisted through the date of this filing. based on our belief these conditions may continue, we could have a decline in property revenues during fiscal year 2021 and beyond.
construction activity at december 31, 2020, we had a total of seven projects under construction to be comprised of 2,254 apartment homes. initial occupancies of these seven projects are currently scheduled to occur within the next 27 months. we estimate the additional cost to complete the construction of the seven projects to be approximately $325.4 million. the covid-19 pandemic and efforts to curb its spread may adversely affect, among other matters, the timely completion and final project costs of some or all of our projects under development if, for example, we are required to temporarily cease construction, experience delays in obtaining governmental permits and authorizations, or experience disruption in the supply of or in the costs of materials or labor.
acquisitions land: during the year ended december 31, 2020, we acquired approximately 4.1 acres of land in durham, north carolina for approximately $27.6 million for the future development of approximately 354 apartment homes, and approximately 4.9 acres of land in raleigh, north carolina for approximately $18.2 million for the future development of approximately 355 apartment homes.
dispositions land: during the year ended december 31, 2020, we sold approximately 4.7 acres of land adjacent to one of our operating properties in raleigh, north carolina for approximately $0.8 million and recognized a gain of $0.4 million.
other
•in april 2020, we issued $750.0 million of 2.80%, senior unsecured notes due may 2030 at an effective annual interest rate of 2.91% under our then-existing shelf registration statement.
•in may 2020, camden's chairman and ceo, and executive vice chairman, each agreed to voluntarily reduce the amount of their respective annual bonus (cash or shares) which may be awarded in the future by $500,000. the aggregate $1.0 million compensation reduction served as a contribution to the resident relief funds and to the employee relief fund.
•in june 2020, we created an at-the market ("atm") share offering program through which we can, but have no obligation to, sell common shares and we may also enter into separate forward sale agreements with forward purchasers for an aggregate offering price of up to $362.7 million (the "2020 atm program").
•in october 2020, we entered into a $40.0 million two-year unsecured floating rate term loan with an unrelated third party and used the net proceeds, together with cash on hand, to repay our $100.0 million unsecured term loan which was scheduled to mature in 2022.
future outlook subject to market conditions, we intend to continue to seek opportunities to develop new communities, and to redevelop, reposition and acquire existing communities. we also intend to evaluate our operating property and land development portfolio and plan to continue our practice of selective dispositions as market conditions warrant and opportunities arise. we expect to maintain a strong balance sheet and preserve our financial flexibility by continuing to focus on our core fundamentals which currently are generating positive cash flows from operations, maintaining appropriate debt levels and leverage ratios, and controlling overhead costs. we intend to meet our near-term liquidity requirements through a combination of one or more of the following: cash and cash equivalents, cash flows generated from operations, draws on our unsecured credit facility, the use of debt and equity offerings under our automatic shelf registration statement, proceeds from property dispositions, equity issued from our atm programs, other unsecured borrowings, or secured mortgages.
as of december 31, 2020, we had approximately $420.4 million in cash and cash equivalents, and $888.0 million available under our $900.0 million unsecured credit facility. as of the date of this filing, we had common shares having an aggregate offering price of up to $362.7 million remaining available for sale under our 2020 atm program and do not have any debt maturing through the year ending 2021. additionally, as of december 31, 2020 and through the date of this filing, 100% of our consolidated properties were unencumbered. we believe we are well-positioned with a strong balance sheet and sufficient liquidity to fund new development, redevelopment, and other capital funding requirements. we will, however, continue to assess and take further actions we believe are prudent to meet our objectives and capital requirements.

results of operations changes in revenues and expenses related to our operating properties from period to period are due primarily to the performance of stabilized properties in the portfolio, the lease-up of newly constructed properties, acquisitions, and dispositions. where appropriate, comparisons of income and expense for communities included in continuing operations are made on a dollars-per-weighted average apartment home basis in order to adjust for such changes in the number of apartment homes owned during each period. selected weighted averages for the years ended december 31 are as follows:

(1)average monthly property revenue per apartment home for the year ended december 31, 2020, includes approximately $9.1 million of resident relief funds paid to residents at our wholly-owned communities who have experienced financial losses caused by covid-19 and was recorded as a reduction to property revenues.
(2)annualized total property expenses per apartment home includes approximately $4.5 million of directly-related covid-19 expenses incurred at our operating properties for the year ended december 31, 2020.
management considers property net operating income ("noi") to be an appropriate supplemental measure of operating performance to net income because it reflects the operating performance of our communities without an allocation of corporate level property management overhead or general and administrative costs. we define noi as total property income less property operating and maintenance expenses less real estate taxes. noi is further detailed in the property-level noi table as seen below. noi is not defined by accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america ("gaap") and should not be considered an alternative to net income as an indication of our operating performance, should not be considered an alternative to net cash from operating activities as a measure of liquidity, and should not be considered an indication of cash available to fund cash needs. additionally, noi as disclosed by other reits may not be comparable to our calculation.

(1)    for 2020, same store communities are communities we owned and were stabilized since january 1, 2019, excluding communities under redevelopment and properties held for sale. non-same store communities are stabilized communities not owned or stabilized since january 1, 2019, including communities under redevelopment and excluding properties held for sale. we define communities under redevelopment as communities with capital expenditures that improve a community's cash flow and competitive position through extensive unit, exterior building, common area, and amenity upgrades. management believes same store information is useful as it allows both management and investors to determine financial results over a particular period for the same set of communities. development and lease-up communities are non-stabilized communities we have developed since january 1, 2019, excluding properties held for sale. covid-19 related impact relates to the resident relief funds which were established for our residents experiencing financial losses caused by covid-19 and includes the amount we paid to residents at our wholly-owned communities as an adjustment to property revenues. the covid-19 related impact also includes direct related expenses incurred at our operating properties as a result of the pandemic. dispositions/other includes those communities disposed of or held for sale which are not classified as discontinued operations, non-multifamily rental properties, expenses related to land holdings not under active development, and other miscellaneous revenues and expenses.
same store analysis same store property noi decreased approximately $2.4 million for the year ended december 31, 2020 as compared to the same period in 2019. the decrease was due to an increase of approximately $12.3 million in same store property expenses for the year ended december 31, 2020, partially offset by an increase of approximately $9.9 million in same store property revenues for the year ended december 31, 2020, as compared to the same period in 2019.
the $12.3 million increase in same store property expenses for the year ended december 31, 2020, as compared to the same period in 2019, was primarily due to higher real estate taxes of approximately $5.8 million as a result of increased property valuations at a number of our communities, higher property insurance expenses of approximately $2.2 million as a result of higher premiums, higher salary expenses of approximately $1.9 million, higher utilities of approximately $1.6 million, and higher repair and maintenance costs of approximately $0.8 million.
the $9.9 million increase in same store property revenues for the year ended december 31, 2020, as compared to the same period in 2019, was primarily due to an increase of approximately $12.8 million in rental revenues primarily from a 1.6% increase in average rental rates of which approximately $6.2 million was recognized during the first quarter of 2020 primarily due to a 3.3% first quarter increase in average rental rates. the increase during the year ended december 31, 2020 was also due to an approximately $3.4 million increase in income from our bulk internet and other utility rebilling programs, and an approximate $3.1 million higher net reletting and other rental income. these increases for the year ended december 31, 2020 were partially offset by lower occupancy of approximately $3.5 million, higher bad debt expense of approximately $5.1 million due in part to covid-19, and a decrease of approximately $0.8 million related to fee and other income due to waived late and other fees during covid-19.
non-same store and development and lease-up analysis property noi from non-same store and development and lease-up communities increased approximately $14.5 million for the year ended december 31, 2020, as compared to the same period in 2019. the increases were comprised of increases from non-same store communities of approximately $15.2 million and partially offset by decreases from development and lease-up communities of approximately $0.7 million for the year ended december 31, 2020, as compared to the same period in 2019. the increase in property revenues and expenses from our non-same store communities was primarily due to the acquisition of four operating properties during 2019, four operating properties reaching stabilization during 2019 and two operating properties reaching stabilization during the year ended december 31, 2020. the slight decrease in property noi from our development and lease-up communities were primarily due to the timing of completion and partial lease-up of two development properties during the year ended december 31, 2020. the following table details the changes, described above, relating to non-same store and development and lease-up noi:

covid-19 related impact analysis the direct covid-19 related impact was approximately $13.6 million for the year ended december 31, 2020 due to the resident relief funds and the covid-19 directly-related expenses incurred at our operating properties. in april 2020, we announced two resident relief funds for our residents experiencing financial losses caused by covid-19 and the company paid approximately $9.1 million to approximately 7,100 residents of our wholly-owned communities which was recorded as a reduction to property revenues. during the year ended december 31, 2020, we also incurred approximately $4.5 million of directly-related covid-19 expenses at our operating properties, which included $2.8 million of bonuses paid to on-site employees who provided essential services during the pandemic and approximately $1.7 million of other directly-related covid-19 expenses.
dispositions/other property analysis dispositions/other property noi decreased approximately $11.6 million for the year ended december 31, 2020 as compared to the same period in 2019. the decrease was primarily due to lower retail property noi of approximately $6.0 million which was primarily due to an approximate $3.5 million non-cash retail straight-line rent receivable adjustment in the fourth quarter of 2020 as a result of our collectability assessment and determining it was no longer probable certain leasing revenue would be collected from retail tenants and an approximate $1.8 million increase in retail bad debt expense. the decrease was also due to approximately $4.9 million of property noi from the disposition of two consolidated operating properties in the fourth quarter of 2019. we had no operating property dispositions during the year ended december 31, 2020.

* not a meaningful percentage fee and asset management income from property management, asset management, construction, and development activities at our joint ventures and our third-party construction projects increased approximately $2.1 million for the year ended december 31, 2020 as compared to 2019. the increase for 2020 as compared to 2019 was primarily due to higher fees earned related to an increase in third-party construction activity, and increased construction and development activity for one property held by one of the funds which completed construction in december 2020.
our deferred compensation plans recognized income of approximately $12.0 million and $21.7 million in 2020 and 2019, respectively. the changes were related to the performance of the investments held in deferred compensation plans for participants and were directly offset by the expense related to these plans, as discussed below.

* not a meaningful percentage property management expenses, which primarily represent regional supervision and accounting costs related to property operations, decreased approximately $1.1 million for the year ended december 31, 2020 as compared to 2019. the decrease was primarily related to lower incentive compensation expense and travel related expenses in 2020 as compared to 2019. the decrease was partially offset by higher salary and benefit costs. property management expenses were 2.3% and 2.5% of total property revenues for the years ended december 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.
fee and asset management expense from property management, asset management, construction, and development activities at our joint ventures and our third-party construction projects decreased approximately $1.8 million for the year ended december 31, 2020 as compared to 2019. the decrease was primarily due to lower salaries and discretionary spending incurred in managing our joint ventures and construction activities in 2020 as compared to 2019.
general and administrative expenses increased approximately $0.4 million for the year ended december 31, 2020 as compared to 2019. the increase was primarily due to higher salary and benefit costs, higher professional expenses, and higher information technology costs as compared to 2019. the increase was partially offset by lower incentive compensation expense and lower travel related expenses. excluding deferred compensation plans, general and administrative expenses were 5.1% of total revenues for each of the years ended december 31, 2020 and 2019.
interest expense increased approximately $10.8 million for the year ended december 31, 2020 as compared to 2019. the increase was primarily due to the issuance of $600 million, 3.67% senior unsecured notes in june 2019, the issuance of $300 million, 3.41% senior unsecured notes in october 2019, and the issuance of $750 million, 2.91% senior unsecured notes in april 2020. the increase was partially offset by the repayment of approximately $439.3 million of secured conventional mortgage debt with a weighted average interest rate of 5.2% in the first quarter of 2019, the redemption of our $250 million, 4.78% senior unsecured notes due 2021, and the prepayment of an approximate $45.3 million, 4.38% secured conventional mortgage note in october 2019. the increase was also partially offset by higher capitalized interest in 2020 resulting from higher average balances in our development pipeline and a decrease in interest expense recognized on our $100 million term loan, which was repaid in october 2020 and had lower weighted average interest rates in 2020 as compared to 2019. the increase in 2020 was further offset by a decrease in interest expense recognized on our unsecured credit facility due to lower balances outstanding during 2020 as compared to 2019.
depreciation and amortization expense increased approximately $30.9 million for the year ended december 31, 2020 as compared to 2019. the increase was primarily due to the acquisition of four operating properties in 2019, the completion of units in our development pipeline, the completion of repositions, and the partial completion of redevelopments during 2020 and 2019. the increase was partially offset by a decrease in depreciation expense related to the disposition of two operating properties in december 2019.
our deferred compensation plans incurred an expense of approximately $12.0 million and $21.7 million in 2020 and 2019, respectively. these changes were related to the performance of the investments held in deferred compensation plans for participants and were directly offset by the income related to these plans, as discussed in the non-property income section above.

the loss on early retirement of debt for the year ended december 31, 2020 related to the early retirement of our $100 million unsecured term loan which was scheduled to mature in 2022; this loss is primarily related to the applicable unamortized loan costs. the loss for the year ended december 31, 2019 related to the early redemption of our $250 million, 4.78% senior notes due 2021 and the prepayment of a $45.3 million, 4.38% secured conventional mortgage note due 2045.
the gain on sale for the year ended december 31, 2020 was due to the sale of approximately 4.7 acres of land adjacent to one of our operating properties in raleigh, north carolina for approximately $0.8 million. the gain on sale in 2019 was due to the sale of two operating properties located in corpus christi, texas in the fourth quarter.
equity in income of joint ventures decreased approximately $6.7 million for the year ended december 31, 2020 as compared to 2019. the decrease in 2020 was primarily due to a decrease in earnings due to the recognition of a $6.2 million proportionate share of gain in 2019 related to the sale of one operating property by one of the funds in the fourth quarter of 2019 and the approximate $1.3 million of resident relief funds paid to residents of the operating communities owned by our unconsolidated joint ventures in 2020, which was recorded as a reduction to property revenues. we recognized our ownership interest of the resident relief funds of $0.4 million in equity in income of joint ventures. the decrease in earnings was partially offset by lower interest expense recognized by operating properties owned by the funds due to lower weighted average interest rates on variable rate debt in 2020 as compared to 2019.
income tax expense increased approximately $0.9 million for the year ended december 31, 2020, as compared to 2019. the increase was primarily due to an increase in state and local taxes and an increase in taxable income related to higher third-party construction activities conducted in a taxable reit subsidiary.
funds from operations ("ffo") and adjusted ffo ("affo")
management considers ffo and affo to be appropriate supplementary measures of the financial performance of an equity reit. the national association of real estate investment trusts ("nareit") currently defines ffo as net income (computed in accordance with gaap), excluding gains (or losses) associated with the sale of previously depreciated operating properties, real estate depreciation and amortization, impairments of depreciable assets, and adjustments for unconsolidated joint ventures to reflect ffo on the same basis. our calculation of diluted ffo also assumes conversion of all potentially dilutive securities, including certain non-controlling interests, which are convertible into common shares. we consider ffo to be an appropriate supplemental measure of operating performance because, by excluding gains or losses on dispositions of operating properties and depreciation, ffo can assist in the comparison of the operating performance of a company's real estate investments between periods or to different companies.
affo is calculated utilizing ffo less recurring capitalized expenditures which are necessary to help preserve the value of and maintain the functionality at our communities. we also consider affo to be a useful supplemental measure because it is frequently used by analysts and investors to evaluate a reit's operating performance between periods or different companies. our definition of recurring capital expenditures may differ from other reits, and there can be no assurance our basis for computing this measure is comparable to other reits.
to facilitate a clear understanding of our consolidated historical operating results, we believe ffo and affo should be examined in conjunction with net income attributable to common shareholders as presented in the consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income and data included elsewhere in this report. ffo and affo are not defined by gaap and should not be considered alternatives to net income attributable to common shareholders as an indication of our operating performance. additionally, ffo and affo as disclosed by other reits may not be comparable to our calculation.
reconciliations of net income attributable to common shareholders to ffo and affo for the years ended december 31 are as follows:

(1) net income attributable to common shareholders includes an approximate $3.5 million non-cash adjustment to retail straight-line rent receivable and a $14.8 million covid-19 related impact for the year ended december 31, 2020. the total covid-19 related impact for the year ended december 31, 2020, was comprised of $9.5 million related to the resident relief funds which were established in april 2020. of this amount, approximately $9.1 million was paid to residents at our wholly-owned communities and was recorded as a reduction to property revenues, and approximately $1.3 million of resident relief funds paid to residents of the operating communities owned by our unconsolidated joint ventures, of which we recognized our ownership interest of $0.4 million in equity in income of joint ventures. additionally, we incurred approximately $4.5 million of covid-19 expenses at our operating communities, which included $2.8 million of bonuses paid to on-site employees who provided essential services during the pandemic and $1.7 million in other directly-related covid-19 expenses. we also incurred approximately $0.8 million related to the employee relief fund we established to help our employees impacted by covid-19. net income attributable to common shareholders for the year ended december 31, 2019 included an approximate $12.0 million loss on early retirement of debt related to the redemption of our 4.78% senior notes due 2021 and the prepayment of a 4.38% secured conventional mortgage note due 2045.
liquidity and capital resources financial condition and sources of liquidity we intend to maintain a strong balance sheet and preserve our financial flexibility, which we believe should enhance our ability to identify and capitalize on investment opportunities as they become available. we intend to maintain what management believes is a conservative capital structure by:
•extending and sequencing the maturity dates of our debt where practicable;
•managing interest rate exposure using what management believes to be prudent levels of fixed and floating rate debt;
•maintaining what management believes to be conservative coverage ratios; and
•using what management believes to be a prudent combination of debt and equity.
our interest expense coverage ratio, net of capitalized interest, was approximately 6.5 and 7.3 times for the years ended december 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. this ratio is a method for calculating the amount of operating cash flows available to cover interest expense and is calculated by dividing interest expense for the period into the sum of property revenues and expenses, non-property income, and other expenses after adding back depreciation, amortization, and interest expense. all of our properties were unencumbered at both december 31, 2020 and 2019. our weighted average maturity of debt was approximately 8.4 years at december 31, 2020.
we also intend to strengthen our capital and liquidity positions by continuing to focus on our core fundamentals, which currently are generating positive cash flows from operations, maintaining appropriate debt levels and leverage ratios, and controlling overhead costs.
our primary sources of liquidity are cash and cash equivalents on hand and cash flow generated from operations. other sources may include one or more of the following: availability under our unsecured credit facility, the use of debt and equity offerings under our automatic shelf registration statement, proceeds from property dispositions, equity issued from our atm programs, and other unsecured borrowings or secured mortgages. we believe our liquidity and financial condition are sufficient to meet all of our reasonably anticipated cash needs during 2021 including:
•normal recurring operating expenses;
•current debt service requirements, including debt maturities;
•recurring capital expenditures;
•reposition expenditures;
•funding of property developments, redevelopments, acquisitions, and joint venture investments; and
•the minimum dividend payments required to maintain our reit qualification under the code.
factors which could increase or decrease our future liquidity include but are not limited to volatility in capital and credit markets, changes in rent control or rent stabilization laws, sources of financing, the minimum reit dividend requirements, our ability to complete asset purchases, sales, or developments, the effect our debt level and changes in credit ratings could have on our cost of funds, and our ability to access capital markets. a variety of these factors, among others, could also be affected by covid-19.
cash flows the following is a discussion of our cash flows for the years ended december 31, 2020 and 2019.
net cash from operating activities was approximately $519.3 million during the year ended december 31, 2020 as compared to approximately $555.6 million during the year ended december 31, 2019. the decrease was primarily due to lower cash inflows from operating accounts due to the timing of payments to vendors, lower prepayment of rental income received from our residents, and higher interest payments on our unsecured debt in 2020 as compared to 2019. the decrease was also due to the covid-19 impact on our property revenues and property expenses. see further discussions of our 2020 operations as compared to 2019 in "results of operations." these decreases were partially offset by cash outflows related to the settlement of our forward interest rate swaps in 2019.
net cash used in investing activities during the year ended december 31, 2020 totaled approximately $429.6 million as compared to $792.4 million during the year ended december 31, 2019. cash outflows during 2020 primarily related to property development and capital improvements of approximately $427.2 million, and increases in non-real estate assets of $7.5
million. these outflows were partially offset by a net decrease in notes receivable of $1.4 million. cash outflows during 2019 primarily related to property development and capital improvements of approximately $407.6 million, the acquisition of four operating properties for approximately $436.3 million, and increases in non-real estate assets of $17.2 million. these outflows were partially offset by net proceeds from the sale of two operating properties of approximately $67.6 million and a net decrease in notes receivable of $1.4 million. the increase in property development and capital improvements for 2020, as compared to the same period in 2019, was primarily due to the timing and completion of four consolidated operating properties in 2019 and 2020, and the acquisition of development properties. the property development and capital improvements during 2020 and 2019, included the following:

net cash from financing activities totaled approximately $307.3 million during the year ended december 31, 2020 as compared to approximately $220.7 million during the year ended december 31, 2019. cash inflows during 2020 primarily related to net proceeds of approximately $782.8 million from the issuance of $750.0 million senior unsecured notes in april 2020 and a $40.0 million unsecured floating-rate term loan in october 2020. these cash inflows were partially offset by approximately $333.4 million to pay distributions to common shareholders and non-controlling interest holders, the repayment of an unsecured floating-rate term loan of approximately $100.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2020, and net payment of $44.0 million of borrowings from our unsecured line of credit. cash inflows during 2019 primarily related to net proceeds of approximately $890.0 million from the issuance of $600.0 million senior unsecured notes in june 2019 and $300.0 million senior unsecured notes in october 2019, as well as net proceeds of $353.2 million from the issuance of approximately 3.4 million common shares through an underwritten equity offering completed in february 2019 and approximately 0.2 million common shares through our 2017 atm program. we also had net proceeds of $44.0 million of borrowings from our unsecured line of credit. these cash inflows were partially offset by the repayment of approximately $439.3 million of secured conventional mortgage debt in the first quarter of 2019, and the early redemption of our $250 million unsecured notes payable due 2021 and the prepayment of the approximate $45.3 million secured conventional mortgage note due 2045 and associated prepayment penalties in the fourth quarter of 2019. we also used approximately $317.3 million to pay distributions to common shareholders and non-controlling interest holders.
financial flexibility we have a $900 million unsecured credit facility which matures in march 2023, with two options to further extend the facility at our election for two additional six-month periods and may be expanded three times by up to an additional $500 million upon the satisfaction of certain conditions. the interest rate on our unsecured credit facility is based upon the libor plus a margin which is subject to change as our credit ratings change. advances under our credit facility may be priced at the scheduled rates, or we may enter into bid rate loans with participating banks at rates below the scheduled rates. these bid rate loans have terms of 180 days or less and may not exceed the lesser of $450 million or the remaining amount available under our credit facility. our credit facility is subject to customary financial covenants and limitations. we believe we are in compliance with all such financial covenants and limitations as of december 31, 2020 and through the date of this filing.
our credit facility provides us with the ability to issue up to $50.0 million in letters of credit. while our issuance of letters of credit does not increase our borrowings outstanding under our credit facility, it does reduce the amount available. at december 31, 2020, we had approximately no borrowings outstanding on our $900.0 million credit facility and we had outstanding letters of credit totaling approximately $12.0 million, leaving approximately $888.0 million available under our credit facility.
we currently have an automatic shelf registration statement which allows us to offer common shares, preferred shares, debt securities, or warrants, and our amended and restated declaration of trust provides we may issue up to 185 million shares of beneficial interest, consisting of 175 million common shares and 10 million preferred shares. at december 31, 2020, we had approximately 97.4 million common shares outstanding, net of treasury shares and shares held in our deferred compensation arrangements, and no preferred shares outstanding.
in june 2020, we created the 2020 atm program through which we can, but have no obligation to, sell common shares and also enter into separate forward sale agreements with forward purchasers for an aggregate offering price of up to $362.7 million, in amounts and at times as we determine, into the existing trading market at current market prices as well as through negotiated transactions. actual sales from time to time may depend on a variety of factors including, among others, market conditions, the trading price of our common shares, and determinations by management of the appropriate sources of funding for us. the proceeds from the sale of our common shares under the 2020 atm program are intended to be used for general corporate purposes, which may include reducing future borrowings under our $900 million unsecured line of credit, the repayment of other indebtedness, the redemption or other repurchase of outstanding debt or equity securities, funding for development activities, and financing for acquisitions. there were no shares sold under the 2020 atm program in the year ended december 31, 2020 and no shares have been sold through the date of this filing. as of the date of this filing, we had common shares having an aggregate offering price of up to $362.7 million remaining available for sale under the 2020 atm program.
we believe our ability to access capital markets is enhanced by our senior unsecured debt ratings by moody's, fitch, and standard and poor's, which were a3 with stable outlook, a- with stable outlook, and a- with stable outlook, respectively, as of december 31, 2020. we believe our ability to access capital markets is also enhanced by our ability to borrow on a secured basis from various institutions including banks, fannie mae, freddie mac, or life insurance companies. however, we may not be able to maintain our current credit ratings and may not be able to borrow on a secured or unsecured basis in the future.
future cash requirements and contractual obligations one of our principal long-term liquidity requirements includes the repayment of maturing debt, including any future borrowings under our unsecured credit facility. as of the date of this filing, we did not have any debt maturing through the year ending december 31, 2021. see note 9, "notes payable," in the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion of scheduled maturities.
we estimate the additional cost to complete the construction of the seven consolidated projects to be approximately $325.4 million. of this amount, we expect to incur costs between approximately $220 million and $240 million during 2021 and to incur the remaining costs during 2022 through 2023. additionally, we expect to incur costs between approximately $65 million and $75 million related to the start of new development activities, between approximately $58 million and $62 million of repositions and revenue enhancing expenditures and between approximately $70 million and $74 million of additional recurring capital expenditures. the covid-19 pandemic and efforts to curb its spread may adversely affect, among other matters, the timely completion and final project costs of some or all of our projects under development if, for example, we are required to temporarily cease construction, experience delays in obtaining governmental permits and authorizations, or experience disruption in the supply of or increases in the costs of materials or labor.
we anticipate meeting our near-term liquidity requirements through a combination of one or more of the following: cash and cash equivalents, cash flows generated from operations, draws on our unsecured credit facility, the use of debt and equity offerings under our automatic shelf registration statement, proceeds from property dispositions, equity issued from our 2020 atm program, other unsecured borrowings, or secured mortgages. we continue to evaluate our operating properties and land development portfolio and plan to continue our practice of selective dispositions as market conditions warrant and opportunities arise.
as a reit, we are subject to a number of organizational and operational requirements, including a requirement to distribute current dividends to our shareholders equal to a minimum of 90% of our annual taxable income. in order to reduce the amount of income taxes, our general policy is to distribute at least 100% of our taxable income. in december 2020, we announced our board of trust managers had declared a quarterly dividend of $0.83 per common share to our common shareholders of record as of december 16, 2020. this dividend was subsequently paid on january 15, 2021 and we paid equivalent amounts per unit to holders of common operating partnership units. when aggregated with previous 2020 dividends, this distribution to common shareholders and holders of the common operating partnership units equates to an annual dividend rate of $3.32 per share or unit for the year ended december 31, 2020.
in the first quarter of 2021, the company's board of trust managers declared a first quarter dividend of $0.83 per common share to our common shareholders of record as of march 31, 2021. future dividend payments are paid at the discretion of the board of trust managers and depend on cash flows generated from operations, the company's financial condition and capital requirements, distribution requirements under the reit provisions of the code and other factors which may be deemed relevant by our board of trust managers. assuming similar dividend distributions for the remainder of 2021, our annualized dividend rate for 2021 would be $3.32.
the following table summarizes our known contractual cash obligations as of december 31, 2020:

(1)includes all available extension options, amortization of debt discounts and debt issuance costs, net of scheduled principal payments.
(2)includes contractual interest payments for our senior unsecured notes and all available extension options. the interest payments on our unsecured term loan with floating interest rates were calculated based on the interest rates in effect as of december 31, 2020.
off-balance sheet arrangements the joint ventures in which we have an interest have been funded in part with secured, third-party debt. at december 31, 2020, our unconsolidated joint ventures had outstanding debt of approximately $509.1 million. as of december 31, 2020, we had no outstanding guarantees related to the loans of our unconsolidated joint ventures.
inflation our apartment leases are for an average term of approximately fourteen months. in an inflationary environment, we may realize increased rents at the commencement of new leases or upon the renewal of existing leases. we believe the short-term nature of our leases generally minimizes our risk from the adverse effects of inflation.
critical accounting policies the preparation of our financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions. these estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the balance sheet date, and the amounts of revenues and expenses recognized during the reporting period. these estimates are based on historical experience and other assumptions believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. the following is a discussion of our critical accounting policies. for a discussion of all of our significant accounting policies, see note 2, "summary of significant accounting policies and recent accounting pronouncements," to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.
valuation of assets. long-lived assets are reviewed for impairment annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. impairment may exist if estimated future undiscounted cash flows associated with long-lived assets are not sufficient to recover the carrying value of such assets. we consider projected future undiscounted cash flows, trends, strategic decisions regarding future development plans, and other factors in our assessment of whether impairment indicators exist. while we believe our estimates of future cash flows are reasonable, different assumptions regarding a number of factors, including market rents, economic conditions, and occupancies, could significantly affect these estimates. when impairment exists, the long-lived asset is adjusted to its fair value. in estimating fair value, management uses appraisals, management estimates, and discounted cash flow calculations which utilize inputs from a marketplace participant's perspective. in addition, we evaluate our equity investments in joint ventures and if we believe there is an other than temporary decline in market value of our investment below our carrying value, we will record an impairment charge.
the value of our properties under development depends on market conditions, including estimates of the project start date, projected construction costs, as well as estimates of demand for multifamily communities. we have reviewed market trends and other marketplace information and have incorporated this information as well as our current outlook into the assumptions we use in our impairment analyses. due to the judgment and assumptions applied in the impairment analyses, it is possible actual results could differ substantially from those estimated.
we believe the carrying value of our operating real estate assets, properties under development, and land is currently recoverable. however, if market conditions deteriorate or if changes in our development strategy significantly affect any key assumptions used in our fair value estimates, we may need to take material charges in future periods for impairments related to existing assets. any such material non-cash charges could have an adverse effect on our consolidated financial position and results of operations.

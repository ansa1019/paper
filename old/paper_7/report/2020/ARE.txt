the covid-19 pandemic in december 2019, a novel coronavirus, which causes respiratory illness and spreads from person to person (covid-19), was first identified during an investigation into an outbreak in wuhan, china. the first case of covid-19 in the u.s. was reported on january 20, 2020. on march 11, 2020, the world health organization declared covid-19 a pandemic, and on march 13, 2020, the u.s. declared a national emergency with respect to covid-19. as of january 29, 2021, according to the world health organization, over 101.0 million novel coronavirus cases have been reported worldwide. the u.s. has reported more than 25.3 million cases of covid-19 and over 425,670 deaths as of january 29, 2021.
covid-19 disease, treatment, and measures to combat the pandemic most patients with covid-19 have had mild to severe respiratory illness with symptoms of fever, chills, cough, shortness of breath, fatigue, and loss of taste. many individuals with covid-19 are asymptomatic and show limited to no symptoms, highlighting the ongoing challenge of containing the continued spread of covid-19. some patients develop pneumonia in both lungs and/or multi-organ failure, which in some cases leads to death. since scientists shared the virus's genetic makeup in january 2020, intense research has been underway around the world to develop treatments and vaccines for covid-19. this has led to the fda issuing emergency use authorizations ("eua"s) for therapeutics to treat patients with covid-19 and, most recently, approving two vaccines for use in the prevention of coronavirus disease caused by covid-19.
the two approved vaccines were created by pfizer inc. (in partnership with biontech) and moderna, inc. (in partnership with the national institutes of health), each a tenant of ours. the u.s. began a large-scale covid-19 vaccination campaign in december 2020. as of january 29, 2021, according to the u.s. centers for disease control and prevention, over 4.7 million individuals in the u.s. have been fully vaccinated for covid-19, and the u.s. will continue to roll out vaccines across the nation, prioritizing frontline and essential workers, the elderly, and individuals considered high risk.
although the u.s. fda has approved two vaccines and certain therapies for use as of the date of this report, the initial rollout of vaccine distribution has encountered significant delays, and uncertainties remain as to the amount of vaccine available for distribution, the logistics of implementing a national vaccine program, and the overall efficacy of the vaccines once widely administered, especially as new strains of covid-19 have been discovered, and the level of resistance these new strains have to the existing vaccines, if any, remains unknown.
in response to the supply and distribution issues surrounding the vaccine, in january 2021, president biden outlined a plan to create additional vaccination sites, increase the supply and distribution of vaccines, and increase the number of vaccinations administered to americans. the biden administration plans to utilize the defense production act to maximize the manufacturing and distribution of vaccines in order to administer 100 million vaccination shots within the first 100 days of holding office.
in addition to the currently approved vaccines, as of january 29, 2021, there are over 60 other potential vaccines in clinical development that may contribute to increasing the supply of vaccines in 2021. the current vaccines in development use a myriad of different scientific approaches to attempt to provoke an immune response, including:
•genetic vaccines that use part of the coronavirus's genetic code;
•viral vector vaccines that use a virus to deliver coronavirus genes into cells;
•protein-based vaccines that use a coronavirus protein or protein fragment to stimulate the immune system; and
•whole-virus vaccines that use a weakened or inactivated version of the coronavirus.
over 60 potential vaccines are currently in human clinical trials, with nearly a third of these in later stages of clinical development. phase i trials typically include a small number of participants to test safety and dosage as well as to confirm that the vaccine stimulates the immune system. phase ii trials involve hundreds of participants split into groups, such as children and the elderly, to determine whether the vaccine acts differently in each subpopulation. phase iii trials involve delivering the vaccine to tens of thousands of people, observing how many subsequently become infected, and determining the severity of symptoms when compared with volunteer subjects who received a placebo. regulators in each country will review the trial results to make a determination as to whether the drug or vaccine should be approved. as of january 29, 2021, there were 20 potential vaccines in phase iii trials, including a number that require only a single dose, rather than two doses for the currently approved vaccines and that are potentially easier to distribute.
shelter-in-place and stay-at-home orders on march 19, 2020, california became the first state to set mandatory stay-at-home restrictions to help combat the spread of the coronavirus. the order included the shutdown of all nonessential services, such as dine-in restaurants, bars, gyms, conference or convention centers, and other businesses not deemed to support critical infrastructure. exceptions for essential services, such as grocery stores, pharmacies, gas stations, food banks, convenience stores, and delivery restaurants, have allowed these services to remain open. subsequently, almost all states issued similar orders, including new york, massachusetts, washington, maryland, and north carolina, where our remaining properties outside california are located. countries around the world also implemented measures to slow the spread of the coronavirus, from national quarantines to school closures or similar types of stay-at-home orders or movement limitations.
most state orders expired or were rescinded between may and early june 2020, and authorities began reopening businesses, including retail stores, restaurants, bars, salons, houses of worship, entertainment venues such as movie theaters and museums, and manufacturing facilities and offices. daily new covid-19 cases in the u.s., which had declined to approximately 18,000 new daily cases by june 9, 2020, from the low- to mid-30,000 daily range in april 2020, began to surge, leading to additional restrictions in many parts of the country. additionally, in recent months, new covid-19 variants were discovered in the u.k, among other countries, which have spread globally, including the u.s. while these strains do not appear to cause more severe symptoms in individuals, they have shown to be more infectious than the original strain discovered in china. as a result, more stringent lockdown restrictions have been implemented globally and within the u.s. on january 29, 2021, according to the world health organization, 155,203 new cases and 4,100 deaths were reported in the u.s.
impact to the global and u.s. economy as a result of the unprecedented measures taken in the u.s. and around the world, the disruption and impact to the u.s. and global economies and financial markets by the covid-19 pandemic have been significant. in january 2021, the imf estimated that the global and u.s. economies contracted by 3.5% and 3.4%, respectively, during 2020, in contrast to the expansion of 3.3% and 2.0%, respectively, that imf projected for the year 2020 in january 2020. however, multiple vaccine approvals have raised hopes for an eventual end to the pandemic, and the rollout of vaccines has contributed to the positive global and u.s. growth projections for 2021, as estimated by imf in january 2021, of 5.5% and 5.1%, respectively. these projections may be negatively impacted by potential new strains of the virus, renewed lockdowns, or logistical problems with vaccine distribution.
based on the data provided by the u.s. bureau of labor statistics on january 8, 2021, the unemployment rate in the u.s. is up by 3.2% since february 2020 to 6.7%. the december 2020 data reported 140 thousand jobs lost in december 2020. stock markets around the globe have rebounded substantially since march 2020; however, since the pandemic was declared, access to capital has become much more challenging for most companies or non-existent for some.
the unprecedented disruption and impact to the u.s. and global economies and financial markets from the covid-19 pandemic resulted in the u.s. president trump's signing into law on march 27, 2020, the coronavirus aid, relief, and economic security act ("cares act"), a $2 trillion economic stimulus package. the cares act allocated over $140 billion to the u.s. health system to support covid-19-related manufacturing, production, diagnostics, and treatments, and to accelerate the market entrance of necessary vaccines and cures. the cares act also designated $945.4 million specifically to the nih, a tenant of ours in our maryland market, to combat covid-19, which includes, but is not limited to, providing support for research, construction, and acquisition of equipment for vaccine and infectious disease research facilities, including the acquisition of real property.
in addition, on april 24, 2020, the president trump signed the paycheck protection program and health care enhancement act into law, which provided an additional $484 billion of relief primarily to assist distressed small businesses and prevent them from shutting their operations and laying off employees. this package designated $75 billion to hospitals and $25 billion for a new covid-19 testing program. it is too early to determine if the cares act and the $484 billion relief package were effective or sufficient to offset some of the most severe economic effects of the pandemic.
on august 8, 2020, president trump signed four executive actions to provide additional covid-19 relief along with unemployment benefits of $400 weekly payment to those receiving more than $100 a week in state-funded unemployment benefits through december 6, 2020. on december 27, 2020, a second stimulus package was passed to provide relief aid to americans during financial hardship, aggregating $900 billion in provisions, which included an additional $600 payment to eligible american adults and $600 for qualifying child dependents, a reinstatement of unemployment benefits of $300 per week through march 14, 2021, an additional $285 billion towards loan programs for small businesses, $82 billion towards education, and additional aid for hard-hit industries, including the airline industry.
on january 14, 2020, then president-elect biden unveiled a $1.9 trillion "american rescue plan" proposal to combat the pandemic and stimulate the economy. the proposal provides additional provisions for increased unemployment benefits, rental assistance, small businesses, state and local governments, educational institutions, and substantial funding towards accelerated distribution of vaccinations and for covid-19 testing, as well as direct payments of $1,400 to all eligible americans. the american rescue plan is the first of two major spending initiatives expected to be proposed by president biden in the coming weeks.
potential ineffectiveness or delay of such relief measures could lead to further deterioration of economic conditions, higher unemployment rates, and prolonged recession, which in turn could materially affect our (or our tenants' or venture investment portfolio companies') performance, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. see "item 1a. risk factors" within "part i" in this annual report on form 10-k for additional discussion of the risks posed by the covid-19 pandemic, and uncertainties we, our tenants, and the national and global economies face as a result.

unconsolidated real estate joint venture loan
•in march 2020, our unconsolidated joint venture at 1655 and 1725 third street, in which we own a 10% interest, located in mission bay/soma, refinanced an existing variable-rate secured construction loan with a fixed-rate loan with terms as follows:

investments
•our investments in publicly traded companies and privately held entities aggregated a carrying amount of $1.6 billion, including an adjusted cost basis of $835.4 million and unrealized gains of $775.7 million, as of december 31, 2020.
•investment income of $421.3 million during the year ended december 31, 2020, consisted of $47.3 million of realized gains, which included $24.5 million of impairments related to investments in privately held entities that do not report nav, and $374.0 million of unrealized gains.
2021 capital strategy during 2021, we intend to continue to execute our capital strategy to achieve further improvements to our credit profile, which will allow us to further improve our cost of capital and continue our disciplined approach to capital allocation. for further information, refer to the "projected results" section below under this item 7 in this annual report on form 10-k. consistent with 2020, our capital strategy for 2021 includes the following elements:
•allocate capital to class a properties located in collaborative life science, technology, and agtech campuses in aaa urban innovation clusters;
•continue to improve our credit profile;
•maintain prudent access to diverse sources of capital, which include cash flows from operating activities after dividends, incremental debt supported by our growth in ebitda, real estate asset sales, non-real estate investment sales, joint venture capital, and other capital such as sales of equity;
•maintain commitment to long-term capital to fund growth;
•prudently ladder debt maturities;
•reduce short-term variable-rate debt;
•prudently manage equity investments to support corporate-level investment strategies;
•maintain significant balance sheet liquidity; and
•maintain a stable and flexible balance sheet.
given the anticipated delivery of significant incremental ebitda from our development and redevelopment of new class a properties, we expect to be able to debt fund a significant portion of construction on a leverage-neutral basis. we expect to continue to maintain access to a diverse source of debt, including unsecured senior notes payable, as well as secured construction loans for our development and redevelopment projects from time to time. we expect to continue to maintain a significant proportion of our net operating income on an unencumbered basis to allow for future flexibility for accessing both unsecured and secured debt markets, although we expect traditional secured mortgage notes payable will remain a small component of our capital structure. in addition to debt funding on a leverage-neutral basis, we intend to supplement our remaining capital needs with net cash flows from operating activities, after dividends and proceeds from real estate asset sales, non-real estate investment sales, partial interest sales, and other debt and equity capital.
improved cost of capital as part of our capital strategy to continue strengthening our credit profile, we expect to complete and place into service development and redevelopment projects currently under construction, which we expect will deliver significant incremental ebitda. the expected growth in our ebitda in 2021 and beyond should allow us to obtain debt funding on a leverage-neutral basis and provide significant capital to fund our development and redevelopment projects. additionally, the resulting expected improvement in our balance sheet leverage ratio should allow us to access diverse sources of capital, strengthen our credit profile, and reduce our cost of capital. in addition, we expect to continue to maintain a significant proportion of unencumbered net operating income. for the year ended december 31, 2020, our unencumbered net operating income as a percentage of total net operating income was 96%.
investments we present our equity investments at fair value whenever fair value or nav is readily available. adjustments for our limited partnership investments represent changes in reported nav as a practical expedient to estimate fair value. for investments without readily available fair values, we adjust the carrying amount whenever such investments have an observable price change, and further adjustments are not made until another price change, if any, is observed. refer to note 7 - "investments" to our consolidated financial statements under item 15 in this annual report on form 10-k for additional information.

alexandria and our innovative tenants are at the vanguard and heart of the life science ecosystem advancing solutions for covid-19
safe and effective vaccines and therapies, in addition to widespread testing, continue to be critically needed to combat the global covid-19 pandemic. by maintaining essential continuous operations across our campuses, alexandria has enabled several of our life science tenants to pursue mission-critical covid-19-related research and development. the heroic work being done by so many of our tenants and campus community members to help test for, treat, and prevent covid-19, as well as provide medical supplies and protective equipment to neighboring hospitals, is profound and inspiring. we are currently tracking approximately 100 tenants across our cluster markets that have contributed meaningful time and resources to advancing solutions for covid-19.
developing preventative vaccines
•a prophylactic vaccine is critically needed to resolve the global covid-19 pandemic. as such, researchers around the world are working tirelessly to develop a safe and effective vaccine in record time. furthermore to help expedite the development, manufacturing, and distribution of covid-19 vaccines, the u.s. government initiated an unprecedented public-private collaboration, allocating several billions of dollars to these efforts.

results of operations we present a tabular comparison of items, whether gain or loss, that may facilitate a high-level understanding of our results and provide context for the disclosures included in this annual report on form 10-k. we believe such tabular presentation promotes a better understanding for investors of the corporate-level decisions made and activities performed that significantly affect comparison of our operating results from period to period. we also believe this tabular presentation will supplement for investors an understanding of our disclosures and real estate operating results. gains or losses on sales of real estate and impairments of held for sale assets are related to corporate-level decisions to dispose of real estate. gains or losses on early extinguishment of debt, gains or losses on early termination of interest rate hedge agreements, and preferred stock redemption charges are related to corporate-level financing decisions focused on our capital structure strategy. significant realized and unrealized gains or losses on non-real estate investments, impairments of real estate and non-real estate investments, and significant termination fees are not related to the operating performance of our real estate assets as they result from strategic corporate-level decisions and external market conditions. impairments of non-real estate investments are not related to the operating performance of our real estate as they represent the write-down of non-real estate investments when their fair values decline below their respective carrying values due to changes in general market or other conditions outside of our control. significant items included in the tabular disclosure for current periods are described in further detail under this item 7 in this annual report on form 10-k. items included in net income attributable to alexandria's common stockholders were as follows:

income from rentals total income from rentals for the year ended december 31, 2020, increased by $361.3 million, or 23.8%, to $1.9 billion, compared to $1.5 billion for the year ended december 31, 2019, as a result of increases in rental revenues and tenant recoveries, as discussed below.
rental revenues total rental revenues for the year ended december 31, 2020, increased by $306.1 million, or 26.3%, to $1.5 billion, compared to $1.2 billion for the year ended december 31, 2019. the increase was primarily due to an increase in rental revenues from our non-same properties aggregating $292.7 million primarily related to 1,008,382 rsf of development and redevelopment projects placed into service subsequent to january 1, 2019, and 84 operating properties aggregating 7.8 million rsf acquired subsequent to january 1, 2019, as well as a termination fee of $89.5 million recognized in connection with the termination of our contract for a future lease at our development project at 88 bluxome street in our soma submarket during the three months ended september 30, 2020. our annual rental revenue per rsf was $49.08 as of december 31, 2020 compared to $51.04 as of december 31, 2019. the decrease in our rental revenue per rsf was due to our recent acquisitions of alexandria center® for life science - durham in our research triangle submarket, and acquisitions made during the three months ended december 31, 2020, including 6420 and 6450 sequence drive in our sorrento mesa submarket of san diego, and 380 and 420 e street in our seaport innovation district submarket of greater boston. annual rental rates per rsf in our research triangle and seattle markets, in which most of the operating rsf of the aforementioned acquisitions is concentrated, is generally lower than annual rental rates per rsf in our greater boston and san francisco markets where the majority of our operating rsf is located. excluding these acquisitions, our annual rental revenue per rsf as of december 31, 2020, would have been $51.26. for the definition of "annual rental revenue" refer to the "non-gaap measures and definitions" section under item 7 in this annual report on form 10-k.
rental revenues from our same properties for the year ended december 31, 2020, increased by $13.4 million, or 1.3%, to $1.03 billion, compared to $1.02 billion for the year ended december 31, 2019. the increase was primarily due to rental rate increases on lease renewals and re-leasing of space since january 1, 2019. refer to the "leasing activity" section of "item 2. properties" within "part i" in this annual report on form 10-k for additional details. the increase was partially offset by the effect of reduced revenues generated from our transient parking, retail tenants, and amenities, which had limited operations due to covid-19 restrictions.
the increase in total rental revenues was also partially offset by a $5.4 million reduction to rental revenues recognized during the year ended december 31, 2020, due to specific write-offs and a general allowance related to deferred rent balances of tenants that are or may potentially be impacted by uncertainties surrounding covid-19.
tenant recoveries tenant recoveries for the year ended december 31, 2020, increased by $55.3 million, or 15.7%, to $406.4 million, compared to $351.1 million for the year ended december 31, 2019. this increase is consistent with the increase in our rental operating expenses of $84.7 million, or 19.0%, as discussed under "rental operations" below.
same properties' tenant recoveries for the year ended december 31, 2020, increased by $14.1 million, or 4.5%, to $327.8 million, compared to $313.7 million for the year ended december 31, 2019, primarily due to the increase in property tax expenses resulting from higher assessed values of our properties, higher property insurance, and higher repairs and maintenance expenses during the year ended december 31, 2020, as discussed under "rental operations" below. as of december 31, 2020, 94% of our leases (on an rsf basis) were triple net leases, which require tenants to pay substantially all real estate taxes, insurance, utilities, repairs and maintenance, common area expenses, and other operating expenses (including increases thereto) in addition to base rent.
other income other income for the years ended december 31, 2020 and 2019, was $7.4 million and $14.4 million, respectively, primarily consisting of construction management fees and interest income earned during each respective period. the decrease was primarily a result of lower construction management fees recognized due to the completion of certain projects.
rental operations total rental operating expenses for the year ended december 31, 2020, increased by $84.7 million, or 19.0%, to $530.2 million, compared to $445.5 million for the year ended december 31, 2019. the increase was primarily due to incremental expenses from our non-same properties, primarily related to 1,008,382 rsf of development and redevelopment projects placed into service subsequent to january 1, 2019, and 84 operating properties aggregating 7.8 million rsf acquired subsequent to january 1, 2019.
same properties' rental operating expenses increased by $2.5 million, or 0.7%, to $373.4 million, compared to $370.9 million for the year ended december 31, 2019. the increase was primarily due to an increase in property tax expenses resulting from higher assessed values of our properties, higher property insurance, and higher repairs and maintenance expenses, which were partially offset by reduced operating expenses related to retail tenants and amenities, which had no or limited operations due to covid-19 restrictions during the year ended december 31, 2020.
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses for the year ended december 31, 2020, increased by $24.5 million, or 22.5%, to $133.3 million, compared to $108.8 million for the year ended december 31, 2019. approximately $4.5 million of the increase was the result of the acceleration of stock compensation expense recognized in connection with the resignation of an executive officer during the three months ended september 2020. this former executive officer remains a consultant to the company. a portion of unvested stock outstanding will continue to vest pursuant to the original terms of the awards. this was deemed a modification for accounting purposes due to a significant reduction in future services to the company, which resulted in an accelerated vesting and recognition of the fair value of the modified award. the remaining increase was primarily due to continued growth in the depth and breadth of our operations in multiple markets, including development and redevelopment projects placed into service and properties acquired subsequent to january 1, 2019, as discussed under "income from rentals" above. as a percentage of net operating income, our general and administrative expenses for the years ended december 31, 2020 and 2019, were 9.8% and 10.0%, respectively.

we expect to meet certain long-term liquidity requirements, such as requirements for development, redevelopment, other construction projects, capital improvements, tenant improvements, property acquisitions, leasing costs, non-revenue-enhancing capital expenditures, scheduled debt maturities, distributions to noncontrolling interests, and payment of dividends through net cash provided by operating activities, periodic asset sales, strategic real estate joint venture capital, and long-term secured and unsecured indebtedness, including borrowings under our unsecured senior line of credit, issuances under our commercial paper program, and issuances of additional debt and/or equity securities.
we expect to continue meeting our short-term liquidity and capital requirements, as further detailed in this section, generally through our working capital and net cash provided by operating activities. we believe that the net cash provided by operating activities will continue to be sufficient to enable us to make the distributions necessary to continue qualifying as a reit.
over the next several years, our balance sheet, capital structure, and liquidity objectives are as follows:
•retain positive cash flows from operating activities after payment of dividends and distributions to noncontrolling interests for investment in development and redevelopment projects and/or acquisitions;
•improve credit profile and relative long-term cost of capital;
•maintain diverse sources of capital, including sources from net cash provided by operating activities, unsecured debt, secured debt, selective real estate asset sales, partial interest sales, non-real estate investment sales, preferred stock, and common stock;
•maintain commitment to long-term capital to fund growth;
•maintain prudent laddering of debt maturities;
•maintain solid credit metrics;
•maintain significant balance sheet liquidity;
•mitigate variable-rate debt exposure through the reduction of short-term and medium-term variable-rate bank debt;
•maintain a large unencumbered asset pool to provide financial flexibility;
•fund common stock dividends and distributions to noncontrolling interests from net cash provided by operating activities;
•manage a disciplined level of value-creation projects as a percentage of our gross investments in real estate; and
•maintain high levels of pre-leasing and percentage leased in value-creation projects.

operating activities cash flows provided by operating activities are primarily dependent upon the occupancy level of our asset base, the rental rates of our leases, the collectibility of rent and recovery of operating expenses from our tenants, the timing of completion of development and redevelopment projects, and the timing of acquisitions and dispositions of operating properties. net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended december 31, 2020, increased to $882.5 million, compared to $683.9 million for the year ended december 31, 2019. this increase was primarily attributable to (i) cash flows generated from our highly leased development and redevelopment projects recently placed into service, (ii) income-producing acquisitions since january 1, 2019, and (iii) increases in rental rates on lease renewals and re-leasing of space since january 1, 2019.

inflation as of december 31, 2020, approximately 94% of our leases (on an rsf basis) were triple net leases, which require tenants to pay substantially all real estate taxes, insurance, utilities, repairs and maintenance, common area expenses, and other operating expenses (including increases thereto) in addition to base rent. approximately 94% of our leases (on an rsf basis) contained effective annual rent escalations that were either fixed (generally ranging from 3.0% to 3.5%) or indexed based on a consumer price index or other indices. accordingly, we do not believe that our cash flows or earnings from real estate operations are subject to significant risks from inflation. a period of inflation, however, could cause an increase in the cost of our variable-rate borrowings, including borrowings related to our unsecured senior line of credit and secured construction loans held by our unconsolidated joint ventures.
capital resources we expect that our principal liquidity needs for the year ending december 31, 2021, will be satisfied by the following multiple sources of capital, as shown in the table below. there can be no assurance that our sources and uses of capital will not be materially higher or lower than these expectations.

(1)in december 2020, three office buildings aggregating 146,842 rsf met the criteria to be classified as held for sale. we expect to complete the sale of these properties in 2021 for a total estimated sales price of $78.1 million, including the buyer's assumption of a $28.2 million secured note payable related to one of the buildings. upon the buildings being classified as held for sale, we recognized impairment charges aggregating $25.2 million.
(2)represents forward equity sales agreements that we expect to settle in 2021 and receive net proceeds of approximately $1.1 billion.
(3)in addition to our guidance range, we may seek opportunities to refinance our $650 million unsecured senior notes payable green bond due in 2024 prior to its maturity, subject to market conditions.
the key assumptions behind the sources and uses of capital in the table above include a favorable capital market environment, performance of our core operating properties, lease-up and delivery of current and future development and redevelopment projects, and leasing activity. our expected sources and uses of capital are subject to a number of variables and uncertainties, including those discussed as "forward-looking statements" under "part 1"; "item 1a. risk factors" and "item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations" in this annual report on form 10-k. we expect to update our forecast of sources and uses of capital on a quarterly basis.
sources of capital net cash provided by operating activities after dividends we expect to retain $210.0 million to $250.0 million of net cash flows from operating activities after payment of common stock dividends, and distributions to noncontrolling interests for the year ending december 31, 2021. for purposes of this calculation, changes in operating assets and liabilities are excluded as they represent timing differences. we also excluded significant contract termination fees that represent an ancillary source of cash that is not associated with any ongoing activity at any of our operating properties. for the year ending december 31, 2021, we expect our recently delivered projects, our highly pre-leased value-creation projects expected to be completed and along with contributions from same properties and recently acquired properties, to contribute significant increases in income from rentals, net operating income, and cash flows. we anticipate significant contractual near-term growth in annual cash rents of $28 million related to the commencement of contractual rents on the projects recently placed into service that are near the end of their initial free rent period. refer to the "cash flows" section within this item 7 in this annual report on form 10-k for a discussion of cash flows provided by operating activities for the year ended december 31, 2020.
debt as of december 31, 2020, we have no outstanding balance on our unsecured senior line of credit. our unsecured senior line of credit bears an interest rate of libor plus 0.825%. in addition to the cost of borrowing, the unsecured senior line of credit is subject to an annual facility fee of 0.15% based on the aggregate commitments outstanding. on october 6, 2020, we amended our unsecured senior line of credit to increase commitments available for borrowing by $800 million to an aggregate of $3.0 billion and to extend the maturity date to january 6, 2026. among other things, the amended credit agreement includes a 0% libor floor on the interest rate and is subject to certain annual sustainability measures entitling us to a temporary reduction in the interest rate margin of one basis point, but not below zero percent per year.
we use our unsecured senior line of credit to fund working capital, construction activities, and, from time to time, acquisition of properties. borrowings under the unsecured senior line of credit bear interest at a "eurocurrency rate," a "libor floating rate," or a "base rate" specified in the unsecured senior line of credit agreement plus, in any case, the applicable margin. the eurocurrency rate specified in the unsecured senior line of credit agreement is, as applicable, the rate per annum equal to either (i) the libor or a successor rate thereto as agreed to by the administrative agent and the company for loans denominated in a libor quoted currency (i.e., u.s. dollars, euro, sterling, or yen), (ii) the average annual yield rates applicable to canadian dollar bankers' acceptances for loans denominated in canadian dollars, (iii) the bank bill swap reference bid rate for loans denominated in australian dollars, or (iv) the rate designated with respect to the applicable alternative currency for loans denominated in a non-libor quoted currency (other than canadian or australian dollars). the libor floating rate means, for any day, one-month libor, or a successor rate thereto as agreed to by the administrative agent and the company for loans denominated in u.s. dollars. the base rate means, for any day, a fluctuating rate per annum equal to the highest of (i) the federal funds rate plus 1/2 of 1.00%, (ii) the rate of interest in effect for such day as publicly announced from time to time by the administrative agent as its "prime rate," and (iii) the eurocurrency rate plus 1.00%. our unsecured senior line of credit contains a feature that allows lenders to competitively bid on the interest rate for borrowings under the facility. this may result in an interest rate that is below the stated rate.
we expect to fund a portion of our capital needs in 2021 from the settlement of our outstanding forward equity sales agreements, from sales of our common stock under our atm program, from issuances under our commercial paper program discussed below, from borrowings under our unsecured senior line of credit, and from real estate dispositions and partial interest sales.
we established a commercial paper program that provides us with the ability to issue up to $1.5 billion of commercial paper notes generally with a maturity of 30 days or less and with a maximum maturity of 397 days from the date of issuance. our commercial paper program is backed by our unsecured senior line of credit, and at all times we expect to retain a minimum undrawn amount of borrowing capacity under our unsecured senior line of credit equal to any outstanding balance on our commercial paper program. we use borrowings under the program to fund short-term capital needs. the notes issued under our commercial paper program are sold under customary terms in the commercial paper market. they are typically issued at a discount to par, representing a yield to maturity dictated by market conditions at the time of issuance. in the event we are unable to issue commercial paper notes or refinance outstanding commercial paper notes under terms equal to or more favorable than those under the unsecured senior line of credit, we expect to borrow under the unsecured senior line of credit at libor plus 0.825%. the commercial paper notes sold during the year ended december 31, 2020, were issued at a weighted-average yield to maturity of 0.26%. as of december 31, 2020, we had $100.0 million of outstanding notes under our commercial paper program.
in march 2020, we completed an offering of $700.0 million of unsecured senior notes payable due on december 15, 2030, at an interest rate of 4.90% for net proceeds of $691.6 million. the net proceeds were used to reduce the outstanding indebtedness under our unsecured senior line of credit and commercial paper program.
in august 2020, we completed an offering of $1.0 billion of unsecured senior notes payable due on february 1, 2033, at an interest rate of 1.875% for net proceeds of $989.1 million. a portion of the proceeds was used to refinance our 3.90% unsecured senior notes payable due in 2023, aggregating $500.0 million, pursuant to a partial cash tender offer and a subsequent call for redemption. on august 5, 2020, we tendered $247.0 million, or 49.4%, of our outstanding 3.90% unsecured senior notes payable and settled the call for redemption of the remaining outstanding balance on september 4, 2020. as a result of our debt refinancing, we recognized a loss on early extinguishment of debt of $50.8 million, including the write-off of unamortized loan fees.
in december 2020, we extinguished two secured notes payable aggregating $108.2 million due in 2023 with a weighted-average interest rate of 3.67% and recognized losses on early extinguishment of debt aggregating $7.3 million. as a result of these extinguishments, we have no debt maturing until 2024.
since january 1, 2019, we have completed the issuances of $4.4 billion in unsecured senior notes, with a weighted-average interest rate of 3.48% and a weighted-average maturity of 14.1 years, as of december 31, 2020.
refer to note 10 - "secured and unsecured senior debt" to our consolidated financial statements under item 15 in this annual report on form 10-k for additional information.
proactive management of transition away from libor libor has been used extensively in the u.s. and globally as a reference rate for various commercial and financial contracts, including variable-rate debt and interest rate swap contracts. however, it is expected that libor will no longer be used after june 30, 2023. to address the increased risk of libor discontinuation, in the u.s. the alternative reference rates committee ("arrc") was established to help ensure the successful transition from libor. in june 2017, the arrc selected sofr, a new index calculated by reference to short-term repurchase agreements backed by u.s. treasury securities, as its preferred replacement for u.s. dollar libor. we have been closely monitoring developments related to the transition away from libor and have implemented numerous proactive measures to minimize the potential impact of the transition to the company, specifically:
•we have proactively eliminated outstanding libor-based borrowings under our unsecured senior bank term loans and secured construction loans through repayments. from january 2017 through december 2020, we retired approximately $1.5 billion of such debt.
•during 2020, we increased the aggregate amount of our commercial paper program to $1.5 billion from $750.0 million. this program provides us with ability to issue commercial paper notes bearing interest at short-term fixed rates, generally with a maturity of 30 days or less and with a maximum maturity of 397 days from the date of issuance. our commercial paper program is not subject to libor and is used for funding short-term working capital needs. as of december 31, 2020, we had $100.0 million of outstanding notes under our commercial paper program.
•we continue to prudently manage outstanding borrowings under our unsecured senior line of credit, our only libor-based debt (excluding $12.7 million libor-based debt held by one of our unconsolidated joint ventures as of december 31, 2020). as of december 31, 2020, we had no borrowings outstanding under our unsecured senior line of credit.
•our unsecured senior line of credit contains fallback language generally consistent with the arrc's amendment approach, which provides a streamlined amendment approach for negotiating a benchmark replacement and introduces clarity with respect to the fallback trigger events and an adjustment to be applied to the successor rate.
•we continue to monitor developments by the arrc and other governing bodies involved in libor transition.
refer to note 10 - "secured and unsecured senior debt" to our consolidated financial statements under item 15 and "item 1a. risk factors" in this annual report on form 10-k for additional information about our management of risks related to the transition away from libor.
real estate dispositions and partial interest sales we expect to continue the disciplined execution of select sales of operating assets. future sales will provide an important source of capital to fund a portion of pending and recently completed opportunistic acquisitions and our highly leased value-creation development and redevelopment projects, and also provide significant capital for growth over the next two to three quarters. we may also consider additional sales of partial interests in core class a properties and/or development projects. for 2021, we expect real estate dispositions and partial interest sales ranging from $1.3 billion to $1.5 billion. the amount of asset sales necessary to meet our forecasted sources of capital will vary depending upon the amount of ebitda associated with the assets sold.
during the year ended december 31, 2020, we received proceeds of $1.1 billion, primarily related to our sale of properties at 510 townsend street, 505 brannan street, and 945 market street in our soma submarket, our sale of properties at 9808 and 9868 scranton road in our sorrento mesa submarket, and our partial interest sale of properties at 1201 and 1208 eastlake avenue east and 199 east blaine street in our lake union submarket. the proceeds received were used primarily to fund development and redevelopment projects in our highly leased value-creation pipeline and to fund acquisitions completed in 2020.
as a reit, generally we are subject to a 100% tax on the net income from real estate asset sales that the irs characterizes as "prohibited transactions." we do not expect our sales will be categorized as prohibited transactions. however, unless we meet certain "safe harbor" requirements, whether a real estate asset sale is a prohibited transaction will be based on the facts and circumstances of the sale. our real estate asset sales may not always meet such safe harbor requirements. refer to "item 1a. risk factors" in this annual report on form 10-k for additional information about the "prohibited transaction" tax.
common equity transactions during the year ended december 31, 2020, we completed issuances and executed forward equity sales agreements for an aggregate of 15.7 million shares of common stock, including the exercise of an underwriters' option, for aggregate net proceeds of approximately $2.4 billion, as follows:
•in january 2020 and july 2020, we entered into forward equity sales agreements aggregating $1.0 billion and $1.1 billion, respectively, to sell an aggregate of 6.9 million shares for each offering (13.8 million in aggregate) of our common stock, including the exercise of underwriters' options, at public offering prices of $155.00 per share and $160.50 per share, respectively, before underwriting discounts. during 2020, we issued all 13.8 million shares under these forward equity sales agreements and received net proceeds of $2.1 billion.
•in february 2020, we entered into an atm common stock offering program, which allowed us to sell up to an aggregate of $850.0 million of our common stock.
•we issued 1.5 million shares of common stock under our atm program at a price of $159.09 per share (before underwriting discounts), and received net proceeds of $235.0 million during 2020.
•we have 362 thousand shares under our atm program subject to forward equity sales agreements that remain outstanding at a price of $159.09 per share (before underwriting discounts) as of december 31, 2020. we expect to settle these forward equity sales agreements in 2021 and receive net proceeds of approximately $56.3 million.
•the remaining availability of $547.3 million under this atm program expired in december 2020 concurrently with the expiration of the associated shelf registration. in january 2021, we filed a new shelf registration statement and expect to establish a new atm program soon in 2021.
other sources under our current shelf registration statement filed with the sec, we may offer common stock, preferred stock, debt, and other securities. these securities may be issued, from time to time, at our discretion based on our needs and market conditions, including, as necessary, to balance our use of incremental debt capital.
additionally, we hold interests, together with joint venture partners, in real estate joint ventures that we consolidate in our financial statements. these joint venture partners may contribute equity into these entities primarily related to their share of funds for construction and financing-related activities. during the year ended december 31, 2020, we received $367.6 million of contributions from and sales of noncontrolling interests.
uses of capital summary of capital expenditures one of our primary uses of capital relates to the development, redevelopment, pre-construction, and construction of properties. we currently have projects in our growth pipeline aggregating 3.3 million rsf of class a office/laboratory and tech office space undergoing construction, 7.1 million rsf of near-term and intermediate-term development and redevelopment projects, and 7.4 million sf of future development projects in north america. we incur capitalized construction costs related to development, redevelopment, pre-construction, and other construction activities. we also incur additional capitalized project costs, including interest, property taxes, insurance, and other costs directly related and essential to the development, redevelopment, pre-construction, or construction of a project, during periods when activities necessary to prepare an asset for its intended use are in progress. refer to the "new class a development and redevelopment properties: current projects" and "summary of capital expenditures" subsections of the "investments in real estate" section under item 2 in this annual report on form 10-k for more information on our capital expenditures.
we capitalize interest cost as a cost of the project only during the period for which activities necessary to prepare an asset for its intended use are ongoing, provided that expenditures for the asset have been made and interest cost has been incurred. capitalized interest for the years ended december 31, 2020 and 2019, of $125.6 million and $88.6 million, respectively, was classified in investments in real estate. indirect project costs, including construction administration, legal fees, and office costs that clearly relate to projects under development or construction, are capitalized as incurred during the period an asset is undergoing activities to prepare it for its intended use. we capitalized payroll and other indirect project costs related to development, redevelopment, pre-construction, and construction projects, which aggregated $61.0 million and $43.2 million for the years ended december 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. the increase in capitalized payroll and other indirect project costs for the year ended december 31, 2020, compared to the same period in 2019 was primarily due to an increase in our value-creation pipeline projects undergoing construction and pre-construction activities aggregating 11 projects with 7.2 million rsf in 2020 over 2019. pre-construction activities include entitlements, permitting, design, site work, and other activities preceding commencement of construction of aboveground building improvements. the advancement of pre-construction efforts is focused on reducing the time required to deliver projects to prospective tenants. these critical activities add significant value for future ground-up development and are required for the vertical construction of buildings. should we cease activities necessary to prepare an asset for its intended use, the interest, taxes, insurance, and certain other direct project costs related to this asset would be expensed as incurred. expenditures for repairs and maintenance are expensed as incurred.
fluctuations in our development, redevelopment, and construction activities could result in significant changes to total expenses and net income. for example, had we experienced a 10% reduction in development, redevelopment, and construction activities without a corresponding decrease in indirect project costs, including interest and payroll, total expenses would have increased by approximately $18.7 million for the year ended december 31, 2020.
we use third-party brokers to assist in our leasing activity, who are paid on a contingent basis upon successful leasing. we are required to capitalize initial direct costs related to successful leasing transactions that result directly from and are essential to the lease transaction and would not have been incurred had that lease transaction not been successfully executed. during the year ended december 31, 2020, we capitalized total initial direct leasing costs of $61.2 million. costs that we incur to negotiate or arrange a lease regardless of its outcome, such as fixed employee compensation, tax, or legal advice to negotiate lease terms, and other costs, are expensed as incurred.
acquisitions refer to the "acquisitions" section in note 3 - "investments in real estate" and to note 4 - "consolidated and unconsolidated real estate joint ventures" to our consolidated financial statements under item 15 in this annual report on form 10-k for detailed information on our acquisitions.

$532,980                          $451,170          $81,810
the increase in dividends paid on our common stock during the year ended december 31, 2020, compared to the year ended december 31, 2019, was primarily due to an increase in number of common shares outstanding subsequent to january 1, 2019, as a result of issuances of common stock under our atm program and settlement of forward equity sales agreements, and partially due to the increase in the related dividends to $4.18 per common share paid during the year ended december 31, 2020, from $3.94 per common share paid during the year ended december 31, 2019.
the decrease in dividends paid on our series d convertible preferred stock during the year ended december 31, 2020, compared to the year ended december 31, 2019, was due to the repurchase of 275,000 outstanding shares of our series d convertible preferred stock and the conversion of the remaining 2.3 million outstanding shares of our series d convertible preferred stock into shares of our common stock during 2019. as a result, we had no outstanding shares of series d convertible preferred stock as of december 31, 2020.

critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with gaap. the preparation of these financial statements in conformity with gaap requires us to make estimates, judgments, and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses. we base these estimates, judgments, and assumptions on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances.
we continually evaluate the policies and estimates we use to prepare our consolidated financial statements. changes in estimates or policies applied could affect our financial position and specific items in our results of operations that are used by our stockholders, potential investors, industry analysts, and lenders in their evaluation of our performance. our significant accounting policies are described in note 2 - "summary of significant accounting policies" to our consolidated financial statements under item 15 in this annual report on form 10-k.
reit compliance we have elected to be taxed as a reit under the internal revenue code. qualification as a reit involves the application of highly technical and complex provisions of the internal revenue code to our operations and financial results, and the determination of various factual matters and circumstances not entirely within our control. we believe that our current organization and method of operation comply with the rules and regulations promulgated under the internal revenue code to enable us to qualify, and continue to qualify, as a reit. however, it is possible that we have been organized or have operated in a manner that would not allow us to qualify as a reit, or that our future operations could cause us to fail to qualify.
if we fail to qualify as a reit in any taxable year, then we will be required to pay federal and state income taxes on our taxable income at regular corporate rates. if we lose our reit status, then our net earnings available for investment or distribution to our stockholders will be significantly reduced for each of the years involved and we will no longer be required to make distributions to our stockholders.
investments in real estate recognition of real estate acquired we evaluate each acquisition of real estate or in-substance real estate (including equity interests in entities that predominantly hold real estate assets) to determine whether the integrated set of assets and activities acquired meets the definition of a business and needs to be accounted for as a business combination. an acquisition of an integrated set of assets and activities that does not meet the definition of a business is accounted for as an asset acquisition.
for acquisitions of real estate or in-substance real estate that are accounted for as business combinations, we allocate the acquisition consideration (excluding acquisition costs) to the assets acquired, liabilities assumed, noncontrolling interests, and previously existing ownership interests at fair value as of the acquisition date. assets include intangible assets such as tenant relationships, acquired in-place leases, and favorable intangibles associated with in-place leases in which we are the lessor. liabilities include unfavorable intangibles associated with in-place leases in which we are the lessor. in addition, for acquired in-place finance or operating leases in which we are the lessee, acquisition consideration is allocated to lease liabilities and related right-of-use assets, adjusted to reflect favorable or unfavorable terms of the lease when compared with market terms. any excess (deficit) of the consideration transferred relative to the fair value of the net assets acquired is accounted for as goodwill (bargain purchase gain). acquisition costs related to business combinations are expensed as incurred.
generally, we expect that acquisitions of real estate or in-substance real estate will not meet the definition of a business because substantially all of the fair value is concentrated in a single identifiable asset or group of similar identifiable assets (i.e., land, buildings, and related intangible assets). the accounting model for asset acquisitions is similar to the accounting model for business combinations except that the acquisition consideration (including acquisition costs) is allocated to the individual assets acquired and liabilities assumed on a relative fair value basis. any excess (deficit) of the consideration transferred relative to the sum of the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed is allocated to the individual assets and liabilities based on their relative fair values. as a result, asset acquisitions do not result in the recognition of goodwill or a bargain purchase gain. incremental and external direct acquisition costs (such as legal and other third-party services) are capitalized.
we exercise judgment to determine the key assumptions used to allocate the purchase price of real estate acquired among its components. the allocation of the consideration to the various components of properties acquired during the year can have an effect on our net income due to the useful depreciable and amortizable lives applicable to each component and the recognition of the related depreciation and amortization expense in our consolidated statements of operations. we apply judgment in utilizing available comparable market information to assess relative fair value. we assess the relative fair values of tangible and intangible assets and liabilities based on available comparable market information, including estimated replacement costs, rental rates, and recent market transactions. in addition, we may use estimated cash flow projections that utilize appropriate discount and capitalization rates.
estimates of future cash flows are based on a number of factors, including the historical operating results, known and anticipated trends, and market/economic conditions that may affect the property.
the value of tangible assets acquired is based upon our estimation of fair value on an "as if vacant" basis. the value of acquired in-place leases includes the estimated costs during the hypothetical lease-up period and other costs that would have been incurred in the execution of similar leases under the market conditions at the acquisition date of the acquired in-place lease. the value of above-market lease assets and below-market lease liabilities reflects the difference between (i) the contractual rents to be paid over the remaining term for each in-place lease and (ii) the estimated current market lease rates using available comparable market information and tenant credit quality. if there is a bargain fixed-rate renewal option for the period beyond the noncancelable lease term of an in-place lease, we evaluate intangible factors such as the business conditions in the industry in which the lessee operates, the economic conditions in the area in which the property is located, and the ability of the lessee to sublease the property during the renewal term, in order to determine the likelihood that the lessee will renew. when we determine there is reasonable assurance that such bargain purchase option will be exercised, we consider the option in determining the intangible value of such lease and its related amortization period. we also recognize the relative fair values of assets acquired, the liabilities assumed, and any noncontrolling interest in acquisitions of less than a 100% interest when the acquisition constitutes a change in control of the acquired entity.
we completed acquisitions of 55 properties for a total purchase price of $2.6 billion during the year ended december 31, 2020. these transactions were accounted for as asset acquisitions, and the purchase price of each was allocated based on the relative fair value of the asset acquired and liabilities assumed.
depreciation and amortization the values allocated to buildings and building improvements, land improvements, tenant improvements, and equipment are depreciated on a straight-line basis using the shorter of the respective ground lease term, estimated useful life, or up to 40 years, for buildings and building improvements; estimated life, or up to 20 years, for land improvements; the respective lease term or estimated useful life for tenant improvements; and the shorter of the lease term or estimated useful life for equipment. the values of acquired in-place leases and associated favorable intangibles (i.e., acquired above-market leases) are classified in other assets in our consolidated balance sheets and are amortized over the remaining terms of the related leases as a reduction of income from rentals in our consolidated statements of operations. the values of unfavorable intangibles (i.e., acquired below-market leases) associated with acquired in-place leases are classified in accounts payable, accrued expenses, and other liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets and are amortized over the remaining terms of the related leases, as an increase in income from rentals in our consolidated statements of operations.
capitalized project costs we capitalize project costs, including pre-construction costs, interest, property taxes, insurance, and other costs directly related and essential to the development, redevelopment, pre-construction, or construction of a project. capitalization of development, redevelopment, pre-construction, and construction costs is required while activities are ongoing to prepare an asset for its intended use. fluctuations in our development, redevelopment, pre-construction, and construction activities could result in significant changes to total expenses and net income. costs incurred after a project is substantially complete and ready for its intended use are expensed as incurred. should development, redevelopment, pre-construction, or construction activity cease, interest, property taxes, insurance, and certain other costs would no longer be eligible for capitalization and would be expensed as incurred. expenditures for repairs and maintenance are expensed as incurred.
properties classified as held for sale a property is classified as held for sale when all of the following criteria for a plan of sale have been met: (i) management, having the authority to approve the action, commits to a plan to sell the property; (ii) the property is available for immediate sale in its present condition, subject only to terms that are usual and customary; (iii) an active program to locate a buyer and other actions required to complete the plan to sell have been initiated; (iv) the sale of the property is probable and is expected to be completed within one year; (v) the property is being actively marketed for sale at a price that is reasonable in relation to its current fair value; and (vi) actions necessary to complete the plan of sale indicate that it is unlikely that significant changes to the plan will be made or that the plan will be withdrawn. depreciation of assets ceases upon designation of a property as held for sale.
if the disposal of a property represents a strategic shift that has (or will have) a major effect on our operations or financial results, such as (i) a major line of business, (ii) a major geographic area, (iii) a major equity method investment, or (iv) other major parts of an entity, then the operations of the property, including any interest expense directly attributable to it, are classified as discontinued operations in our consolidated statements of operations, and amounts for all prior periods presented are reclassified from continuing operations to discontinued operations. the disposal of an individual property generally will not represent a strategic shift and therefore will typically not meet the criteria for classification as a discontinued operation.
impairment of long-lived assets prior to and subsequent to the end of each quarter, we review current activities and changes in the business conditions of all of our long-lived assets to determine the existence of any triggering events or impairment indicators requiring an impairment analysis. if triggering events or impairment indicators are identified, we review an estimate of the future undiscounted cash flows, including, if necessary, a probability-weighted approach if multiple outcomes are under consideration.
long-lived assets to be held and used, including our rental properties, cip, land held for development, right-of-use assets related to operating leases in which we are the lessee, and intangibles, are individually evaluated for impairment when conditions exist that may indicate that the carrying amount of a long-lived asset may not be recoverable. the carrying amount of a long-lived asset to be held and used is not recoverable if it exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset. triggering events or impairment indicators for long-lived assets to be held and used, including our rental properties, cip, land held for development, and intangibles, are assessed by project and include significant fluctuations in estimated net operating income, occupancy changes, significant near-term lease expirations, current and historical operating and/or cash flow losses, construction costs, estimated completion dates, rental rates, and other market factors. we assess the expected undiscounted cash flows based upon numerous factors, including, but not limited to, construction costs, available market information, current and historical operating results, known trends, current market/economic conditions that may affect the property, and our assumptions about the use of the asset, including, if necessary, a probability-weighted approach if multiple outcomes are under consideration.
upon determination that an impairment has occurred, a write-down is recognized to reduce the carrying amount to its estimated fair value. if an impairment loss is not required to be recognized, the recognition of depreciation or amortization is adjusted prospectively, as necessary, to reduce the carrying amount of the real estate to its estimated disposition value over the remaining period that the asset is expected to be held and used. we may adjust depreciation of properties that are expected to be disposed of or redeveloped prior to the end of their useful lives.
we use the held for sale impairment model for our properties classified as held for sale. the held for sale impairment model is different from the held and used impairment model. under the held for sale impairment model, an impairment loss is recognized if the carrying amount of the long-lived asset classified as held for sale exceeds its fair value less cost to sell. because of these two different models, it is possible for a long-lived asset previously classified as held and used to require the recognition of an impairment charge upon classification as held for sale.
equity investments we hold investments in publicly traded companies and privately held entities primarily involved in the life science, technology, and agtech industries. as a reit, we generally limit our ownership percentage in the voting stock of each individual entity to less than 10%.
our investments in publicly traded companies are classified as investments with readily determinable fair values and are carried at fair value, with changes in fair value recognized in net income. the fair values for our investments in publicly traded companies are determined based on sales prices/quotes available on securities exchanges and therefore generally require no judgment to determine fair value. investments in privately held entities that report nav per share, such as our privately held investments in limited partnerships, are carried at fair value using nav as a practical expedient, with changes in fair value recognized in net income. as a result, fair value estimation for these investments generally requires limited judgment. investments in privately held entities that do not report nav are measured at cost, adjusted for observable price changes and impairments, with changes recognized in net income. observable price changes result from, among other things, equity transactions for the same issuer executed during the reporting period, including subsequent equity offerings or other reported equity transactions related to the same issuer. for these equity transactions to be considered observable price changes of the same issuer, we evaluate whether these transactions have similar rights and obligations, including voting rights, distribution preferences, conversion rights, and other factors, to the investments we hold.
we monitor investments in privately held entities that do not report nav per share throughout the year for new developments, including operating results, prospects and results of clinical trials, new product initiatives, new collaborative agreements, capital-raising events, and merger and acquisition activities. these investments are evaluated on the basis of a qualitative assessment for indicators of impairment by monitoring the presence of the following triggering events or impairment indicators: (i) a significant deterioration in the earnings performance, asset quality, or business prospects of the investee; (ii) a significant adverse change in the regulatory, economic, or technological environment of the investee, (iii) a significant adverse change in the general market condition, including the research and development of technology and products that the investee is bringing or attempting to bring to the market, or (iv) significant concerns about the investee's ability to continue as a going concern. if such indicators are present, we are required to estimate the investment's fair value and immediately recognize an impairment loss in an amount equal to the investment's carrying value in excess of its estimated fair value.
liability and right-of-use assets related to operating leases in which we are the lessee we have operating lease agreements in which we are the lessee consisting of ground and office leases. at the lease commencement date (or at the acquisition date if the lease is acquired as part of a real estate acquisition), we are required to recognize a liability to account for our future obligations under these operating leases, and a corresponding right-of-use asset.
the lease liability is measured based on the present value of the future lease payments, including payments during the term under our extension options that we are reasonably certain to exercise. the present value of the future lease payments is calculated for each operating lease using each respective remaining lease term and a corresponding estimated incremental borrowing rate, which is the interest rate that we estimate we would have to pay to borrow on a collateralized basis over a similar term for an amount equal to the lease payments. subsequently, the lease liability is accreted by applying a discount rate established at the lease commencement date to the lease liability balance as of the beginning of the period and is reduced by the payments made during the period. we classify the operating lease liability in accounts payable, accrued expenses, and other liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets.
the right-of-use asset is measured based on the corresponding lease liability, adjusted for initial direct leasing costs and any other consideration exchanged with the landlord prior to the commencement of the lease, as well as adjustments to reflect favorable or unfavorable terms of an acquired lease when compared with market terms at the time of acquisition. subsequently, the right-of-use asset is amortized on a straight-line basis during the lease term. we classify the right-of-use asset in other assets in our consolidated balance sheets. refer to the "lessee accounting" subsection of "lease accounting" section within note 2 - "summary of significant accounting policies" to our consolidated financial statements under item 15 in this annual report on form 10-k.
monitoring of tenant credit quality during the term of each lease, we monitor the credit quality and any related material changes of our tenants by (i) monitoring the credit rating of tenants that are rated by a nationally recognized credit rating agency, (ii) reviewing financial statements of the tenants that are publicly available or that are required to be delivered to us pursuant to the applicable lease, (iii) monitoring news reports regarding our tenants and their respective businesses, and (iv) monitoring the timeliness of lease payments.
allowance for credit losses on january 1, 2020, we adopted an accounting standard that requires companies to estimate and recognize lifetime expected losses, rather than incurred losses, which results in the earlier recognition of credit losses even if the expected risk of credit loss is remote. the accounting standard applies to most financial assets including trade receivables and direct financing leases. the standard does not apply to the receivables arising from operating leases. upon adoption of the new standard on january 1, 2020, we recognized a credit loss adjustment related to adoption of this accounting standard as a cumulative adjustment to retained earnings. for details, refer to the "allowance for credit losses" section in note 2 - "summary of significant accounting policies"
we have one lease classified as a direct financing lease subject to this standard. in this direct financing lease, the payment obligation of the lessee is collateralized by real estate property. at each reporting date, we estimate the current credit loss related to this asset by assessing the probability of default on this lease based on the lessee's financial condition, credit rating, business prospects, remaining lease term, and expected value of the underlying collateral upon its repossession, and, if necessary, we recognize a credit loss adjustment. we recognized subsequent credit loss adjustments related to our direct financing lease in our consolidated statements of operations during the year ended december 31, 2020. for further details, refer to note 5 - "leases" to our consolidated financial statements.
non-gaap measures and definitions this section contains additional information of certain non-gaap financial measures and the reasons why we use these supplemental measures of performance and believe they provide useful information to investors, as well as the definitions of other terms used in this annual report on form 10-k.
funds from operations and funds from operations, as adjusted, attributable to alexandria real estate equities, inc.'s common stockholders gaap-basis accounting for real estate assets utilizes historical cost accounting and assumes that real estate values diminish over time. in an effort to overcome the difference between real estate values and historical cost accounting for real estate assets, the nareit board of governors established funds from operations as an improved measurement tool. since its introduction, funds from operations has become a widely used non-gaap financial measure among equity reits. we believe that funds from operations is helpful to investors as an additional measure of the performance of an equity reit. moreover, we believe that funds from operations, as adjusted, allows investors to compare our performance to the performance of other real estate companies on a consistent basis, without having to account for differences recognized because of real estate acquisition and disposition decisions, financing decisions, capital structure, capital market transactions, variances resulting from the volatility of market conditions outside of our control, or other corporate activities that may not be representative of the operating performance of our properties.
on january 1, 2019, we adopted standards established by the nareit board of governors in its november 2018 white paper (the "nareit white paper") on a prospective basis. the nareit white paper defines funds from operations as net income (computed in accordance with gaap), excluding gains or losses on sales of real estate, and impairments of real estate, plus depreciation and amortization of operating real estate assets, and after adjustments for our share of consolidated and unconsolidated partnerships and real estate joint ventures. impairments represent the write-down of assets when fair value over the recoverability period is less than the carrying value due to changes in general market conditions and do not necessarily reflect the operating performance of the properties during the corresponding period.
we compute funds from operations, as adjusted, as funds from operations calculated in accordance with the nareit white paper, excluding significant gains, losses, and impairments realized on non-real estate investments, unrealized gains or losses on non-real estate investments, gains or losses on early extinguishment of debt, gains or losses on early termination of interest rate hedge agreements, significant termination fees, acceleration of stock compensation expense due to the resignation of an executive officer, preferred stock redemption charges, deal costs, the income tax effect related to such items, and the amount of such items that is allocable to our unvested restricted stock awards. neither funds from operations nor funds from operations, as adjusted, should be considered as alternatives to net income (determined in accordance with gaap) as indications of financial performance, or to cash flows from operating activities (determined in accordance with gaap) as measures of liquidity, nor are they indicative of the availability of funds for our cash needs, including our ability to make distributions.

adjusted ebitda and adjusted ebitda margin we use adjusted ebitda as a supplemental performance measure of our operations, for financial and operational decision-making, and as a supplemental means of evaluating period-to-period comparisons on a consistent basis. adjusted ebitda is calculated as earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization ("ebitda"), excluding stock compensation expense, gains or losses on early extinguishment of debt, gains or losses on sales of real estate, impairments of real estate, and significant termination fees. adjusted ebitda also excludes unrealized gains or losses and significant realized gains and impairments that result from our non-real estate investments. these non-real estate investment amounts are classified in our consolidated statements of operations outside of revenues.
we believe adjusted ebitda provides investors with relevant and useful information as it allows investors to evaluate the operating performance of our business activities without having to account for differences recognized because of investing and financing decisions related to our real estate and non-real estate investments, our capital structure, capital market transactions, and variances resulting from the volatility of market conditions outside of our control. for example, we exclude gains or losses on the early extinguishment of debt to allow investors to measure our performance independent of our indebtedness and capital structure. we believe that adjusting for the effects of impairments and gains or losses on sales of real estate, significant impairments and gains on the sale of non-real estate investments, and significant termination fees allows investors to evaluate performance from period to period on a consistent basis without having to account for differences recognized because of investing and financing decisions related to our real estate and non-real estate investments or other corporate activities that may not be representative of the operating performance of our properties.
in addition, we believe that excluding charges related to stock compensation and unrealized gains or losses facilitates for investors a comparison of our business activities across periods without the volatility resulting from market forces outside of our control. adjusted ebitda has limitations as a measure of our performance. adjusted ebitda does not reflect our historical expenditures or future requirements for capital expenditures or contractual commitments. while adjusted ebitda is a relevant measure of performance, it does not represent net income (loss) or cash flows from operations calculated and presented in accordance with gaap, and it should not be considered as an alternative to those indicators in evaluating performance or liquidity.
in order to calculate adjusted ebitda margin, we also make comparable adjustments to our revenues. we adjust our total revenues by realized gains, losses, and impairments related to our non-real estate investments and significant termination fees to arrive at revenues, as adjusted. our calculation of adjusted ebitda margin divides adjusted ebitda by our revenues, as adjusted. we believe that consistent application of these comparable adjustments to both components of adjusted ebitda margin provides a more useful calculation for the comparison across periods.
the following table reconciles net income (loss) and revenues, the most directly comparable financial measures calculated and presented in accordance with gaap, to adjusted ebitda and revenues, as adjusted, respectively, for the three months and years ended december 31, 2020 and 2019 (dollars in thousands):

annual rental revenue annual rental revenue represents the annualized fixed base rental obligations, calculated in accordance with gaap, for leases in effect as of the end of the period, related to our operating rsf. annual rental revenue is presented using 100% of the annual rental revenue of our consolidated properties and our share of annual rental revenue for our unconsolidated real estate joint ventures. annual rental revenue per rsf is computed by dividing annual rental revenue by the sum of 100% of the rsf of our consolidated properties and our share of the rsf of properties held in unconsolidated real estate joint ventures. as of december 31, 2020, approximately 94% of our leases (on an rsf basis) were triple net leases, which require tenants to pay substantially all real estate taxes, insurance, utilities, repairs and maintenance, common area expenses, and other operating expenses (including increases thereto) in addition to base rent. annual rental revenue excludes these operating expenses recovered from our tenants. amounts recovered from our tenants related to these operating expenses, along with base rent, are classified in income from rentals in our consolidated statements of operations.
cash interest cash interest is equal to interest expense calculated in accordance with gaap plus capitalized interest, less amortization of loan fees and debt premiums (discounts). refer to the definition of "fixed-charge coverage ratio" in this section under this item 7 in this annual report on 10-k for a reconciliation of interest expense, the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with gaap, to cash interest.
class a properties and aaa locations class a properties are properties clustered in aaa locations that provide innovative tenants with highly dynamic and collaborative environments that enhance their ability to successfully recruit and retain world-class talent and inspire productivity, efficiency, creativity, and success. class a properties generally command higher annual rental rates than other classes of similar properties.
aaa locations are in close proximity to concentrations of specialized skills, knowledge, institutions, and related businesses. such locations are generally characterized by high barriers to entry for new landlords, high barriers to exit for tenants, and a limited supply of available space.
development, redevelopment, and pre-construction a key component of our business model is our disciplined allocation of capital to the development and redevelopment of new class a properties, and property enhancements identified during the underwriting of certain acquired properties, located in collaborative life science, technology, and agtech campuses in aaa urban innovation clusters. these projects are generally focused on providing high-quality, generic, and reusable spaces that meet the real estate requirements of, and are reusable by, a wide range of tenants. upon completion, each value-creation project is expected to generate a significant increase in rental income, net operating income, and cash flows. our development and redevelopment projects are generally in locations that are highly desirable to high-quality entities, which we believe results in higher occupancy levels, longer lease terms, higher rental income, higher returns, and greater long-term asset value.
development projects generally consist of the ground-up development of generic and reusable facilities. redevelopment projects consist of the permanent change in use of office, warehouse, and shell space into office/laboratory, tech office, or agtech space. we generally will not commence new development projects for aboveground construction of new class a office/laboratory, tech office, and agtech space without first securing significant pre-leasing for such space, except when there is solid market demand for high-quality class a properties.
pre-construction activities include entitlements, permitting, design, site work, and other activities preceding commencement of construction of aboveground building improvements. the advancement of pre-construction efforts is focused on reducing the time required to deliver projects to prospective tenants. these critical activities add significant value for future ground-up development and are required for the vertical construction of buildings. ultimately, these projects will provide high-quality facilities and are expected to generate significant revenue and cash flows.
development, redevelopment, and pre-construction spending also includes the following costs: (i) certain tenant improvements and renovations that will be reimbursed, (ii) amounts to bring certain acquired properties up to market standard and/or other costs identified during the acquisition process (generally within two years of acquisition), and (iii) permanent conversion of space for highly flexible, move-in-ready office/laboratory space to foster the growth of promising early- and growth-stage life science companies.
revenue-enhancing and repositioning capital expenditures represent spending to reposition or significantly change the use of a property, including through improvement in the asset quality from class b to class a.
non-revenue-enhancing capital expenditures represent costs required to maintain the current revenues of a stabilized property, including the associated costs for renewed and re-leased space.
fixed-charge coverage ratio fixed-charge coverage ratio is a non-gaap financial measure representing the ratio of adjusted ebitda to fixed charges. we believe this ratio is useful to investors as a supplemental measure of our ability to satisfy fixed financing obligations and preferred stock dividends. cash interest is equal to interest expense calculated in accordance with gaap plus capitalized interest, less amortization of loan fees and debt premiums (discounts).
the following table reconciles interest expense, the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with gaap, to cash interest and fixed charges for the three months ended december 31, 2020 and 2019 (dollars in thousands):

initial stabilized yield is calculated as the estimated amounts of net operating income at stabilization divided by our investment in the property. our initial stabilized yield excludes the benefit of leverage. our cash rents related to our value-creation projects are generally expected to increase over time due to contractual annual rent escalations. our estimates for initial stabilized yields, initial stabilized yields (cash basis), and total costs at completion represent our initial estimates at the commencement of the project. we expect to update this information upon completion of the project, or sooner if there are significant changes to the expected project yields or costs.
•initial stabilized yield reflects rental income, including contractual rent escalations and any rent concessions over the term(s) of the lease(s), calculated on a straight-line basis.
•initial stabilized yield (cash basis) reflects cash rents at the stabilization date after initial rental concessions, if any, have elapsed and our total cash investment in the property.
investment-grade or publicly traded large cap tenants investment-grade or publicly traded large cap tenants represent tenants that are investment-grade rated or publicly traded companies with an average daily market capitalization greater than $10 billion for the twelve months ended december 31, 2020, as reported by bloomberg professional services. in addition, we monitor the credit quality and related material changes of our tenants. material changes that cause a tenant's market capitalization to decline below $10 billion, which are not immediately reflected in the twelve-month average, may result in their exclusion from this measure.

joint venture financial information we present components of balance sheet and operating results information related to our real estate joint ventures, which are not presented, or intended to be presented, in accordance with gaap. we present the proportionate share of certain financial line items as follows: (i) for each real estate joint venture that we consolidate in our financial statements, which are controlled by us through contractual rights or majority voting rights, but of which we own less than 100%, we apply the noncontrolling interest economic ownership percentage to each financial item to arrive at the amount of such cumulative noncontrolling interest share of each component presented; and (ii) for each real estate joint venture that we do not control and do not consolidate, and are instead controlled jointly or by our joint venture partners through contractual rights or majority voting rights, we apply our economic ownership percentage to each financial item to arrive at our proportionate share of each component presented.
the components of balance sheet and operating results information related to our real estate joint ventures do not represent our legal claim to those items. for each entity that we do not wholly own, the joint venture agreement generally determines what equity holders can receive upon capital events, such as sales or refinancing, or in the event of a liquidation. equity holders are normally entitled to their respective legal ownership of any residual cash from a joint venture only after all liabilities, priority distributions, and claims have been repaid or satisfied.
we believe this information can help investors estimate the balance sheet and operating results information related to our partially owned entities. presenting this information provides a perspective not immediately available from consolidated financial statements and one that can supplement an understanding of the joint venture assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses included in our consolidated results.
the components of balance sheet and operating results information related to our real estate joint ventures are limited as an analytical tool as the overall economic ownership interest does not represent our legal claim to each of our joint ventures' assets, liabilities, or results of operations. in addition, joint venture financial information may include financial information related to the unconsolidated real estate joint ventures that we do not control. we believe that in order to facilitate for investors a clear understanding of our operating results and our total assets and liabilities, joint venture financial information should be examined in conjunction with our consolidated statements of operations and balance sheets. joint venture financial information should not be considered an alternative to our consolidated financial statements, which are prepared in accordance with gaap.
net cash provided by operating activities after dividends net cash provided by operating activities after dividends includes the deduction for distributions to noncontrolling interests. for purposes of this calculation, changes in operating assets and liabilities are excluded as they represent timing differences.
net debt and preferred stock to adjusted ebitda net debt and preferred stock to adjusted ebitda is a non-gaap financial measure that we believe is useful to investors as a supplemental measure in evaluating our balance sheet leverage. net debt and preferred stock is equal to the sum of total consolidated debt less cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash, plus preferred stock outstanding as of the end of the period. refer to the definition of "adjusted ebitda and adjusted ebitda margin" under item 7 in this annual report on form 10-k for further information on the calculation of adjusted ebitda.

net operating income is a non-gaap financial measure calculated as net income, the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with gaap, excluding equity in the earnings of our unconsolidated real estate joint ventures, general and administrative expenses, interest expense, depreciation and amortization, impairments of real estate, gains or losses on early extinguishment of debt, gains or losses on sales of real estate, and investment income or loss. we believe net operating income provides useful information to investors regarding our financial condition and results of operations because it primarily reflects those income and expense items that are incurred at the property level. therefore, we believe net operating income is a useful measure for investors to evaluate the operating performance of our consolidated real estate assets. net operating income on a cash basis is net operating income adjusted to exclude the effect of straight-line rent and amortization of acquired above- and below-market lease revenue adjustments required by gaap. we believe that net operating income on a cash basis is helpful to investors as an additional measure of operating performance because it eliminates straight-line rent revenue and the amortization of acquired above- and below-market leases.
furthermore, we believe net operating income is useful to investors as a performance measure for our consolidated properties because, when compared across periods, net operating income reflects trends in occupancy rates, rental rates, and operating costs, which provide a perspective not immediately apparent from net income or loss. net operating income can be used to measure the initial stabilized yields of our properties by calculating net operating income generated by a property divided by our investment in the property. net operating income excludes certain components from net income in order to provide results that are more closely related to the results of operations of our properties. for example, interest expense is not necessarily linked to the operating performance of a real estate asset and is often incurred at the corporate level rather than at the property level. in addition, depreciation and amortization, because of historical cost accounting and useful life estimates, may distort comparability of operating performance at the property level. impairments of real estate have been excluded in deriving net operating income because we do not consider impairments of real estate to be property-level operating expenses. impairments of real estate relate to changes in the values of our assets and do not reflect the current operating performance with respect to related revenues or expenses. our impairments of real estate represent the write-down in the value of the assets to the estimated fair value less cost to sell. these impairments result from investing decisions or a deterioration in market conditions. we also exclude realized and unrealized investment income or loss, which results from investment decisions that occur at the corporate level related to non-real estate investments in publicly traded companies and certain privately held entities. therefore, we do not consider these activities to be an indication of operating performance of our real estate assets at the property level. our calculation of net operating income also excludes charges incurred from changes in certain financing decisions, such as losses on early extinguishment of debt, as these charges often relate to corporate strategy. property operating expenses included in determining net operating income primarily consist of costs that are related to our operating properties, such as utilities, repairs, and maintenance; rental expense related to ground leases; contracted services, such as janitorial, engineering, and landscaping; property taxes and insurance; and property-level salaries. general and administrative expenses consist primarily of accounting and corporate compensation, corporate insurance, professional fees, office rent, and office supplies that are incurred as part of corporate office management. we calculate operating margin as net operating income divided by total revenues.
we believe that in order to facilitate for investors a clear understanding of our operating results, net operating income should be examined in conjunction with net income or loss as presented in our consolidated statements of operations. net operating income should not be considered as an alternative to net income or loss as an indication of our performance, nor as an alternative to cash flows as a measure of our liquidity or our ability to make distributions.
operating statistics we present certain operating statistics related to our properties, including number of properties, rsf, occupancy percentage, leasing activity, and contractual lease expirations as of the end of the period. we believe these measures are useful to investors because they facilitate an understanding of certain trends for our properties. we compute the number of properties, rsf, occupancy percentage, leasing activity, and contractual lease expirations at 100% for all properties in which we have an investment, including properties owned by our consolidated and unconsolidated real estate joint ventures. for operating metrics based on annual rental revenue, refer to the definition of "annual rental revenue" in this "non-gaap measures and definitions" section.
same property comparisons as a result of changes within our total property portfolio during the comparative periods presented, including changes from assets acquired or sold, properties placed into development or redevelopment, and development or redevelopment properties recently placed into service, the consolidated total income from rentals, as well as rental operating expenses in our operating results, can show significant changes from period to period. in order to supplement an evaluation of our results of operations over a given quarterly or annual period, we analyze the operating performance for all consolidated properties that were fully operating for the entirety of the comparative periods presented, referred to as same properties. we separately present quarterly and year-to-date same property results to align with the interim financial information required by the sec in our management's discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations. these same properties are analyzed separately from properties acquired subsequent to the first day in the earliest comparable quarterly or year-to-date period presented, properties that underwent development or redevelopment at any time during the comparative periods, unconsolidated real estate joint ventures, properties classified as held for sale, and corporate entities (legal entities performing general and administrative functions), which are excluded from same property results. additionally, termination fees, if any, are excluded from the results of same properties. refer to the "same properties" subsection in the "results of operations" section within this item 7 in this annual report on form 10-k for additional information.
stabilized occupancy date the stabilized occupancy date represents the estimated date on which the project is expected to reach occupancy of 95% or greater.
tenant recoveries tenant recoveries represent revenues comprising reimbursement of real estate taxes, insurance, utilities, repairs and maintenance, common area expenses, and other operating expenses and earned in the period during which the applicable expenses are incurred and the tenant's obligation to reimburse us arises.
we classify rental revenues and tenant recoveries generated through the leasing of real estate assets within revenue in income from rentals in our consolidated statements of operations. we provide investors with a separate presentation of rental revenues and tenant recoveries in the "comparison of results for the year ended december 31, 2020, to the year ended december 31, 2019" subsection of the "results of operations" section within this item 7 because we believe it promotes investors' understanding of our operating results. we believe that the presentation of tenant recoveries is useful to investors as a supplemental measure of our ability to recover operating expenses under our triple net leases, including recoveries of utilities, repairs and maintenance, insurance, property taxes, common area expenses, and other operating expenses, and of our ability to mitigate the effect to net income for any significant variability to components of our operating expenses.

unencumbered net operating income as a percentage of total net operating income unencumbered net operating income as a percentage of total net operating income is a non-gaap financial measure that we believe is useful to investors as a performance measure of the results of operations of our unencumbered real estate assets as it reflects those income and expense items that are incurred at the unencumbered property level. unencumbered net operating income is derived from assets classified in continuing operations, which are not subject to any mortgage, deed of trust, lien, or other security interest, as of the period for which income is presented.

weighted-average shares of common stock outstanding - diluted from time to time, we enter into capital market transactions, including forward equity sales agreements ("forward agreements"), to fund acquisitions, to fund construction of our highly leased development and redevelopment projects, and for general working capital purposes. we are required to consider the potential dilutive effect of our forward equity sales agreements under the treasury stock method while the forward equity sales agreements are outstanding. as of december 31, 2020, we had forward agreements outstanding to sell an aggregate of 362 thousand shares of common stock.
prior to the conversion of our remaining outstanding shares in october 2019, we considered the effect of assumed conversion of our outstanding 7.00% series d convertible preferred stock when determining potentially dilutive incremental shares to our common stock. when calculating the assumed conversion, we add back to net income or loss the dividends paid on our series d convertible preferred stock to the numerator and then include additional common shares assumed to have been issued (as displayed in the table below) to the denominator of the per share calculation. the effect of the assumed conversion is considered separately for our per share calculations of net income or loss; funds from operations, computed in accordance with the definition in the nareit white paper; and funds from operations, as adjusted. prior to the conversion of our remaining outstanding shares in october 2019, our series d convertible preferred stock was dilutive and assumed to be converted when quarterly and annual basic eps, funds from operations, or funds from operations, as adjusted, exceeded approximately $1.75 and $7.00 per share, respectively, subject to conversion ratio adjustments and the impact of repurchases of our series d convertible preferred stock. the effect of the assumed conversion was included when it was dilutive on a per share basis. the dilutive effect to both numerator and denominator may result in a per share effect of less than a half cent, which would appear as zero in our per share calculation, even when the dilutive effect to the numerator alone appears in our reconciliation. refer to note 12 - "earnings per share" and note 15 - "stockholders' equity" to our consolidated financial statements under item 15 in this annual report on form 10-k for more information related to our forward equity sales agreements.

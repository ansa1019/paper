item 7.   managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations managements discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included in item 8 of this annual report on form 10-k, which include additional information about our accounting policies, practices and the transactions underlying our financial results. the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america (u.s. gaap) requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts in our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes including various claims and contingencies related to lawsuits, taxes, environmental and other matters arising during the normal course of business. we apply our best judgment, our knowledge of existing facts and circumstances and actions that we may undertake in the future in determining the estimates that affect our consolidated financial statements. we evaluate our estimates on an ongoing basis using our historical experience, as well as other factors we believe appropriate under the circumstances, such as current economic conditions, and adjust or revise our estimates as circumstances change. as future events and their effects cannot be determined with precision, actual results may differ from these estimates. ball corporation and its subsidiaries are referred to collectively as ball corporation, ball, the company or we or our in the following discussion and analysis.
overview business overview and industry trends ball corporation is one of the worlds leading suppliers of metal packaging to the beverage, food, personal care and household products industries. our packaging products are produced for a variety of end uses, are manufactured in facilities around the world and are competitive with other substrates, such as plastics and glass. in the rigid packaging industry, sales and earnings can be increased by reducing costs, increasing prices, developing new products, expanding volumes and making strategic acquisitions. we also provide aerospace and other technologies and services to governmental and commercial customers.
we sell our packaging products mainly to large, multinational beverage, food, personal care and household products companies with which we have developed long-term customer relationships. this is evidenced by our high customer retention and our large number of long-term supply contracts. while we have a diversified customer base, we sell a majority of our packaging products to relatively few major companies in north america, europe, asia and south america, as do our equity joint ventures in the u.s. and vietnam. the overall metal container industry is growing globally and is expected to continue to grow in the medium to long term despite the north american industry seeing a continued decline in standard-sized aluminum beverage packaging for the carbonated soft drink market. the primary customers for the products and services provided by our aerospace and technologies segment are u.s. government agencies or their prime contractors.
we purchase our raw materials from relatively few suppliers. we also have exposure to inflation, in particular the rising costs of raw materials, as well as other direct cost inputs. we mitigate our exposure to the changes in the costs of metal through the inclusion of provisions in contracts covering the majority of our volumes to pass through metal price changes, as well as through the use of derivative instruments. the pass-through provisions generally result in proportional increases or decreases in sales and costs with a greatly reduced impact, if any, on net earnings. because of our customer and supplier concentration, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected by the loss, insolvency or bankruptcy of a major customer or supplier or a change in a supply agreement with a major customer or supplier, although our contract provisions generally mitigate the risk of customer loss, and our long-term relationships represent a known, stable customer base.
we recognize sales under long-term contracts in the aerospace and technologies segment using percentage-of-completion under the cost-to-cost method of accounting. throughout the period of contract performance, we regularly reevaluate and, if necessary, revise our estimates of aerospace and technologies total contract revenue, total contract cost and progress toward completion. because of contract payment schedules, limitations on funding and other contract terms, our sales and accounts receivable for this segment include amounts that have been earned but not yet billed.

corporate strategy our drive for 10 vision encompasses five strategic levers that are key to growing our business and achieving long-term success. since launching drive for 10 in 2011, we made progress on each of the levers as follows:
·                  maximizing value in our existing businesses by rationalizing standard beverage container and end capacity in north america and expanding specialty container production to meet current demand; leveraging plant floor systems in our metal beverage facilities to improve efficiencies and reduce costs; consolidating and/or closing multiple metal beverage and metal food and aerosol packaging facilities; relocating our european headquarters to zurich, switzerland, to gain business, customer and supplier efficiencies; and implementing cost-out and value-in initiatives across all of our businesses;
·                  expanding further into new products and capabilities by expanding into extruded aluminum aerosol manufacturing with our mexican acquisition in december 2012 and the installation of a new extruded aluminum aerosol line in our deforest, wisconsin, facility during 2014; and successfully commercializing extruded aluminum aerosol packaging that utilizes a significant amount of recycled material;
·                  aligning ourselves with the right customers and markets by investing capital to meet double-digit volume growth for specialty beverage containers throughout our global network, which now represent over 27 percent of our global beverage packaging mix, and the introduction of next generation aluminum bottle-shaping technology in north america for a customer under a long term arrangement that is scheduled to start up at the end of the first quarter 2015;
·                  broadening our geographic reach with new investments in a metal beverage manufacturing facility in myanmar, as well as an extruded aluminum aerosol manufacturing facility in india, and the award of a south korean environmental instrument in our aerospace business; and
·                  leveraging our technological expertise in packaging innovation, including the introduction of next-generation aluminum bottle-shaping technologies, the introduction of a new steel aerosol manufacturing technology starting up in mid-2015 and a joint effort between our aerospace business, nasa and the japan aerospace exploration agency to collect science data on the earths rain and snowfall via the global precipitation measurement (gpm) microwave imager, as well as other technologies to maintain our competitive advantage today and in the future.
these ongoing business developments help us stay close to our customers while expanding and/or sustaining our industry positions with major beverage, food, personal care, household products and aerospace customers.

the increase in net sales in 2014 compared to 2013 was due primarily to higher metal beverage container sales volumes and higher aerospace program revenues, partially offset by lower north american food and household product volumes. net earnings were favorably impacted by higher metal beverage container sales volumes, lower cost of sales as a percentage of net sales, lower depreciation expense, lower interest expense and a lower tax rate in 2014, partially offset by lower north american food and household product volumes, unfavorable tinplate service center manufacturing performance in the u.s., higher debt refinancing costs and higher selling, general and administrative costs in 2014.
the decrease in net sales in 2013 compared to 2012 was driven largely by lower demand for standard 12-ounce aluminum beverage containers in the u.s., partially offset by specialty can growth in the americas and higher sales volumes in europe, brazil and the prc. earnings were flat compared to 2012 with lower standard 12-ounce volumes in the u.s. and higher selling, general and administrative expenses being offset by higher specialty can volumes in the americas and improved cost management in our global packaging operations.

cost of sales (excluding depreciation and amortization)
cost of sales, excluding depreciation and amortization, was $6,903.5 million in 2014 compared to $6,875.4 million in 2013 and $7,174.0 million in 2012. these amounts represented 80.6 percent, 81.2 percent and 82.1 percent of consolidated net sales for those three years, respectively.
depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization expense was $280.9 million in 2014 compared to $299.9 million in 2013 and $282.9 million in 2012. these amounts represented 3.3 percent, 3.5 percent and 3.2 percent of consolidated net sales for those three years, respectively. lower expense in 2014 compared to 2013 was largely due to the completion of depreciation for certain acquired european assets. the higher expense in 2013 compared to 2012 was primarily due to capital spending in excess of historical levels and changes in currency exchange rates.
selling, general and administrative selling, general and administrative (sg&a) expenses were $466.5 million in 2014 compared to $418.6 million in 2013 and $385.5 million in 2012. these amounts represented 5.4 percent, 4.9 percent and 4.4 percent of consolidated net sales for those three years, respectively. the increase in sg&a in 2014 compared to 2013 was primarily due to higher incentive compensation and employee benefit costs and other individually insignificant higher costs. the higher expenses in 2013 compared to 2012 were largely related to the reassessment of certain expenses in europe from cost of sales to sg&a in light of the relocation of the european headquarters.
interest expense consolidated interest expense was $193.0 million in 2014 compared to $211.8 million in 2013 and $194.9 million in 2012. excluding debt refinancing costs, interest expense in 2014 was lower than in 2013 due primarily to lower average debt levels and lower average borrowing rates. excluding debt refinancing costs, interest expense in 2013 was higher than in 2012 due to higher average debt levels and the timing difference of the issuance of $1 billion senior notes due in 2023 versus the tender and call of the 2016 senior notes, partially offset by lower average borrowing rates.  interest expense, excluding the effect of debt refinancing costs, as a percentage of average monthly borrowings was 4.8 percent in 2014, 5.1 percent in 2013 and 5.5 percent in 2012.
interest expense in 2014 included $33.1 million for the call premium and the write off of unamortized financing costs and issuance premiums related to the tender of balls 7.375 percent senior notes due september 2019. interest expense in 2013 included $28.0 million for the tender and call premiums, as well as the write off of unamortized financing costs and issuance discounts related to the tender of our 7.125 percent senior notes due in september 2016, the repayment of the term a loan and the amendment and extension of the senior credit facilities.
tax provision the effective income tax rate for earnings from continuing operations was 23.2 percent in 2014 compared to 25.6 percent in 2013 and 28.9 percent in 2012. the lower tax rate in 2014 was primarily the result of a higher foreign tax rate differential, lower u.s. taxes on foreign earnings, and the 2014 releases of uncertain tax positions which exceeded those occurring in 2013. the lower tax rate in 2013 compared to 2012 was primarily the result of the retroactive extension of the u.s. research and development credit, a lower state effective tax rate and a higher foreign tax rate differential, partially offset by higher u.s. taxes on foreign earnings and the 2012 releases of uncertain tax positions which exceeded those occurring in 2013.

the metal beverage packaging, americas and asia, segment consists of operations located in the u.s., canada, brazil and the prc, which manufacture aluminum containers used in beverage packaging.
during february 2015, we announced the introduction of a next-generation aluminum bottle-shaping technology in our conroe, texas, facility, which is expected to begin production at the end of the first quarter 2015. additionally, in may 2014, we announced the expansion of our asian operations with the construction of a new one-line beverage can manufacturing facility in myanmar, which is expected to begin production in early 2016.
segment sales in 2014 were $53.4 million higher compared to 2013 due primarily to $101 million higher sales volumes, offset by a reduction in the pass through price of aluminum.
segment sales in 2013 were $348.3 million lower compared to 2012 due to $320 million for the combination of lower sales volumes, principally related to lower standard 12-ounce container sales volumes in north america, and a reduction in the pass through price of aluminum, partially offset by higher specialty container sales volumes.
segment earnings in 2014 were $22.4 million higher than in 2013 due to $36 million from higher sales volumes, partially offset by higher incentive compensation and other individually insignificant costs.
segment earnings in 2013 were $10.5 million lower than in 2012 due to a total of $109 million from unfavorable net pricing in the prc and lower variable margin contribution attributable to the aforementioned lower standard 12-ounce container sales volumes, net of higher specialty container sales volumes. the volume and pricing variances were largely offset by $104 million of improved manufacturing performance, reduced fixed costs and other reduced costs.

the aerospace and technologies segment consists of the manufacture and sale of aerospace and other related products and services provided for the defense, civil space and commercial space industries.
segment sales in 2014 increased $37.7 million compared to 2013 due to higher sales for civil space contracts and u.s. national defense contracts. segment earnings in 2014 increased $13.5 million primarily as a result of favorable program execution and increased recovery of pension costs.
segment sales in 2013 increased $20.3 million compared to 2012 due to higher sales from u.s. national defense contracts. segment earnings in 2013 decreased $6.5 million due to higher amounts of net favorable contract adjustments in 2012.
sales to the u.s. government, either directly as a prime contractor or indirectly as a subcontractor, represented 95 percent of segment sales in 2014, 94 percent in 2013 and 90 percent in 2012. the aerospace and technologies contract mix in 2014 consisted of 62 percent cost-type contracts, which are billed at our costs plus an agreed upon and/or earned profit component, and 38 percent fixed-price contracts.
contracted backlog for the aerospace and technologies segment at december 31, 2014 and 2013, was $765 million and $938 million, respectively. the year-over-year decline reflects the successful completion of several multi-year contracts including satellite launches completed in 2014. the segment has numerous outstanding bids for future contract awards. comparisons of backlog are not necessarily indicative of the trend of future operations due to the nature of varying delivery and milestone schedules on contracts, funding of programs and the uncertainty of timing of future contract awards.
additional segment information for additional information regarding our segments, see the business segment information in note 3 accompanying the consolidated financial statements within item 8 of this annual report. the charges recorded for business consolidation and other activities were based on estimates by ball management and were developed from information available at the time. if actual outcomes vary from the estimates, the differences will be reflected in current period earnings in the consolidated statement of earnings and identified as business consolidation gains and losses. additional details about our business consolidation and other activities are provided in note 5 accompanying the consolidated financial statements within item 8 of this annual report.

subsequent events on february 19, 2015, the company and rexam plc (rexam) announced the terms of a recommended offer by the company to acquire all of the outstanding shares of rexam in a cash and stock transaction. under the terms of the offer, for each rexam share, rexam shareholders will receive 407 pence in cash and 0.04568 new shares of the company. the transaction values rexam at 610 pence per share based on the companys 90-day volume weighted average price as of february 17, 2015, and an exchange rate of us$1.54: £1 on that date representing an equity value of £4.3 billion ($6.6 billion).
on february 19, 2015, the company entered into a £3.3 billion unsecured bridge loan agreement, pursuant to which lending institutions have agreed, subject to limited conditions, to provide financing necessary to pay the cash portion of the consideration payable to rexam shareholders upon consummation of the proposed acquisition of rexam and related fees and expenses.
on february 19, 2015, the company entered into a new $3 billion revolving credit facility to replace the existing approximate $1.1 billion bank credit facility, redeem the 2020 and 2021 senior notes and provide ongoing liquidity for the company.
in addition, on february 19, 2015, the company announced the redemption of all of the outstanding 6.75 percent senior notes due in september 2020 and all of the 5.75 percent senior notes due in may 2021, each in the amount of $500 million. the redemption of these bonds will result in a pre-tax charge in interest expense of approximately $56.3 million ($36.9 million after tax), composed of the redemption premiums and the write-offs of related debt financing costs.
financial condition, liquidity and capital resources cash flows and capital expenditures our primary sources of liquidity are cash provided by operating activities and external committed borrowings. we believe that cash flows from operations and cash provided by short-term, long-term and committed revolver borrowings, when necessary, will be sufficient to meet our ongoing operating requirements, scheduled principal and interest payments on debt, dividend payments, proposed acquisitions, including the announced, proposed acquisition of rexam, and anticipated capital expenditures. the following summarizes our cash flows:

cash flows from operations in 2014 improved compared to 2013 due to higher net earnings and favorable working capital changes. the favorable working capital changes were primarily related to lower days sales outstanding, lower inventory days on hand and higher days payable outstanding. days sales outstanding decreased from 36 days to 34 days, inventory days on hand decreased from 53 days to 52 days and days payable outstanding increased from 51 days to 69 days.
working capital changes in 2013 compared to 2012 were primarily related to higher days payable outstanding and lower days sales outstanding, partially offset by higher inventory days on hand. days payable outstanding increased from 47 days to 51 days, days sales outstanding decreased from 37 days to 36 days and inventory days on hand increased from 51 days to 53 days.
we have entered into several regional uncommitted accounts receivable factoring programs with various financial institutions for certain accounts receivables of the company. the programs are accounted for as true sales of the receivables, without recourse to ball, and had combined limits of approximately $293 million at december 31, 2014. a total of $197.6 million and $137.5 million were sold under these programs as of december 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. in addition, latapack-ball has non-recourse uncommitted accounts receivable factoring programs with a combined limit of approximately $8 million at december 31, 2014. there were no accounts receivable sold as of december 31, 2014, and $6.0 million was sold as of december 31, 2013.
annual cash dividends paid on common stock were 52 cents per share in both 2014 and 2013 and 40 cents per share in 2012. total dividends paid were $72.7 million in 2014, $75.2 million in 2013 and $61.8 million in 2012. we also paid dividends to noncontrolling interests of $12.2 million in 2014, $12.9 million in 2013 and $7.6 million in 2012.
share repurchases the companys share repurchases, net of issuances, totaled $360.1 million in 2014, $398.8 million in 2013 and $494.1 million in 2012. the repurchases were completed using cash on hand and available borrowings and included accelerated share repurchase agreements and other purchases under our ongoing share repurchase program. additional details about our share repurchase activities are provided in note 15 accompanying the consolidated financial statements within item 8 of this annual report.

debt facilities and refinancing given our cash flow projections and unused credit facilities that are available until june 2018, our liquidity is strong and is expected to meet our ongoing cash and debt service requirements. total interest-bearing debt was $3.2 billion at december 31, 2014, compared to $3.6 billion at december 31, 2013.
on december 9, 2013, we announced the redemption of our outstanding 7.375 percent senior notes due in september 2019 in the amount of $315.4 million. the redemption occurred on january 10, 2014, at a price per note of 108.01 percent of the outstanding principal amount plus accrued interest. the redemption of the bonds resulted in a pretax charge in the first quarter of 2014 of $33.1 million for the call premium and the write off of unamortized financing costs and premiums.
in may 2013, we: (1) issued $1 billion of 4.00 percent senior notes due in november 2023; (2) tendered for the redemption of our 7.125 percent senior notes originally due in september 2016 in the amount of $375 million, at a redemption price per note of 105.322 percent of the outstanding principal amount plus accrued interest; and (3) repaid the $125 million term a loan, which was a component of the senior credit facilities. the redemption of the senior notes and the early repayment of the term a loan resulted in charges of $26.5 million for the tender and call premiums, as well as the write off of unamortized financing costs and issuance discounts. these charges are included as a component of interest expense in the consolidated statement of earnings.
in june 2013, we amended the senior credit facilities and extended the term from december 2015 to june 2018. in connection with the amendment, we recorded a charge of $0.4 million for the write off of unamortized financing costs. the charge is included as a component of interest expense in the consolidated statement of earnings.
on march 9, 2012, we issued $750 million of 5.00 percent senior notes due in march 2022. on the same date, we tendered for the redemption of our 6.625 percent senior notes originally due in march 2018 in the amount of $450 million, at a redemption price per note of 102.583 percent of the outstanding principal amount plus accrued interest. the redemption of the bonds resulted in a charge of $15.1 million for the call premium and the write off of unamortized financing costs and premiums. the charge is included as a component of interest expense in the consolidated statement of earnings.
short-term debt and current portion of long-term debt on the balance sheet includes the companys borrowings under its existing accounts receivable securitization agreement, totaling $110 million at december 31, 2014. this agreement, which has been amended and extended from time to time, is scheduled to mature in june 2017 and allows the company to borrow against a maximum amount of accounts receivable that varies between $85 million and $175 million depending on the seasonal accounts receivable balances in the companys north american packaging businesses.
at december 31, 2014, taking into account outstanding letters of credit and excluding availability under the accounts receivable securitization program, approximately $984 million was available under the companys long-term, multi-currency committed revolving credit facilities. in addition to these facilities, the company had approximately $790 million of short-term uncommitted credit facilities available at the end of 2014, of which $10.1 million was outstanding and due on demand.
while ongoing financial and economic conditions raise concerns about credit risk with counterparties to derivative transactions, the company mitigates its exposure by spreading the risk among various counterparties and limiting exposure to any one party. we also monitor the credit ratings of our suppliers, customers, lenders and counterparties on a regular basis.
on february 19, 2015, the company entered into a £3.3 billion unsecured bridge loan agreement, pursuant to which lending institutions have agreed, subject to limited conditions, to provide financing necessary to pay the cash portion of the consideration payable to rexam shareholders upon consummation of the proposed acquisition of rexam and related fees and expenses.
on february 19, 2015, the company entered into a new $3 billion revolving credit facility to replace the existing approximate $1.1 billion bank credit facility, redeem the 2020 and 2021 senior notes and provide ongoing liquidity for the company.
in addition, on february 19, 2015, the company announced the redemption of all of the outstanding 6.75 percent senior notes due in september 2020 and all of the 5.75 percent senior notes due in may 2021, each in the amount of $500 million. the redemption of these bonds will result in a pre-tax charge in interest expense of approximately $56.3 million ($36.9 million after tax), composed of the redemption premiums and the write-offs of related debt financing costs.
we were in compliance with all loan agreements at december 31, 2014, and all prior years presented, and have met all debt payment obligations. the u.s. note agreements and bank credit agreement contain certain restrictions relating to dividends, investments, financial ratios, guarantees and the incurrence of additional indebtedness. additional details about our debt and receivables sales agreements are available in note 12, accompanying the consolidated financial statements within item 8 of this annual report.

other liquidity measures management performance measures management internally uses various measures to evaluate company performance such as return on average invested capital (net operating earnings after tax over the relevant performance period divided by average invested capital over the same period); economic value added (eva®) dollars (net operating earnings after tax less a capital charge on average invested capital employed); earnings before interest and taxes (ebit); earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (ebitda); diluted earnings per share; cash flow from operating activities and free cash flow (generally defined by the company as cash flow from operating activities less capital expenditures). we believe this information is also useful to investors as it provides insight into the earnings and cash flow criteria management uses to make strategic decisions. these financial measures may be adjusted at times for items that affect comparability between periods such as business consolidation costs and gains or losses on acquisitions and dispositions.
nonfinancial measures in the packaging businesses include production efficiency and spoilage rates; quality control figures; environmental, health and safety statistics; production and sales volumes; asset utilization rates; and measures of sustainability. additional measures used to evaluate financial performance in the aerospace and technologies segment include contract revenue realization, award and incentive fees realized, proposal win rates and backlog (including awarded, contracted and funded backlog).
the following financial measurements are on a non-u.s. gaap basis and should be considered in connection with the consolidated financial statements within item 8 of this annual report. non-u.s. gaap measures should not be considered in isolation and should not be considered superior to, or a substitute for, financial measures calculated in accordance with u.s. gaap. a presentation of earnings in accordance with u.s. gaap is available in item 8 of this annual report.

free cash flow management internally uses a free cash flow measure: (1) to evaluate the companys operating results, (2) to evaluate strategic investments, (3) to plan stock buyback and dividend levels and (4) to evaluate the companys ability to incur and service debt. free cash flow is not a defined term under u.s. gaap, and it should not be inferred that the entire free cash flow amount is available for discretionary expenditures. the company defines free cash flow as cash flow from operating activities less capital expenditures. free cash flow is typically derived directly from the companys consolidated statement of cash flows; however, it may be adjusted for items that affect comparability between periods.
based on the above definition, our consolidated free cash flow is summarized as follows:

based on information currently available, we estimate cash flows from operating activities for 2015 to be in the range of $1 billion, capital expenditures to be approximately $400 million and free cash flow to be in the range of $600 million. in 2015, we intend to utilize our operating cash flow to fund our stock repurchases, dividend payments, growth capital projects and, to the extent available, acquisitions that meet our various criteria. of the total 2015 estimated capital expenditures, approximately $170 million was contractually committed as of december 31, 2014.

(b)         for variable rate facilities, amounts are based on interest rates in effect at year end and do not contemplate the effects of any hedging instruments utilized by the company.
(c)          the companys purchase obligations include contracted amounts for aluminum, steel and other direct materials. also included are commitments for purchases of natural gas and electricity, expenses related to aerospace and technologies contracts and other less significant items. in cases where variable prices and/or usage are involved, managements best estimates have been used. depending on the circumstances, early termination of the contracts may or may not result in penalties and, therefore, actual payments could vary significantly.
the table above does not include $65.5 million of uncertain tax positions, the timing of which is unknown at this time.
contributions to the companys defined benefit pension plans, not including the unfunded german plans, are expected to be insignificant in 2015. this estimate may change based on changes in the pension protection act and actual plan asset performance and available company cash flow, among other factors. benefit payments related to these plans are expected to be $91.6 million, $94.9 million, $98.8 million, $102.1 million and $106.0 million for the years ending december 31, 2015 through 2019, respectively, and a total of $572.8 million for the years 2020 through 2024. payments to participants in the unfunded german plans are expected to be between $18 million and $20 million in each of the years 2015 through 2019 and a total of $87 million for the years 2020 through 2024.
based on changes in return on asset and discount rate assumptions, as well as revisions based on plan experience studies, total pension expense in 2015 is anticipated to be approximately $7 million higher than in 2014, excluding curtailment expenses. a reduction of the expected return on pension assets assumption by one quarter of a percentage point would result in an estimated $3.6 million increase in the 2015 pension expense, while a quarter of a percentage point reduction in the discount rate applied to the pension liability would result in an estimated $5.4 million of additional pension expense in 2015. additional information regarding the companys pension plans is provided in note 14 accompanying the consolidated financial statements within item 8 of this annual report.
due to the u.s. tax status of certain of balls subsidiaries in canada and the prc, the company annually provides u.s. taxes on foreign earnings in those subsidiaries, net of any estimated foreign tax credits. the company also provides deferred taxes on the undistributed earnings in its brazil investment related to its 10 percent indirectly held investment. current taxes are also provided on certain other undistributed earnings that are currently taxed in the u.s. net u.s. taxes provided for brazil, canada and prc earnings in 2014, 2013 and 2012 were $11.8 million, $26.4 million and $14.5 million, respectively. managements intention is to indefinitely reinvest undistributed earnings of balls remaining foreign investments and, as a result, no u.s. income or federal withholding tax provision has been made. the indefinite reinvestment assertion is supported by both long-term and short-term forecasts and u.s. financial requirements, including, but not limited to, operating cash flows, capital expenditures, debt maturities and dividends. the company has not provided deferred taxes on earnings in certain non-u.s. subsidiaries because such earnings are intended to be indefinitely reinvested in its international operations. retained earnings in non-u.s. subsidiaries was $1,799.4 million as of december 31, 2014. it is not practical to estimate the additional taxes that may become payable upon the eventual remittance of these foreign earnings to the u.s.; however, repatriation of these earnings could result in a material increase in the companys effective tax rate or if the intention to indefinitely reinvest is discontinued.

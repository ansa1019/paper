item 7.   management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations executive summary fiscal 2014 included the following notable items:
•   gaap earnings per share were $(2.56), including dilution of $(6.38) related to discontinued operations.
•   adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations were $4.27.
•   comparable sales grew 1.3 percent. digital channel sales growth of more than 30 percent contributed 0.7 percentage points to 2014 comparable sales growth.
•   we paid dividends of $1,205 million in 2014, an increase of 19.8 percent above 2013.
sales from continuing operations were $72,618 million for 2014, an increase of $1,339 million or 1.9 percent from the prior year. earnings from continuing operations before interest expense and income taxes in 2014 decreased by $636 million or 12.3 percent from 2013 to $4,535 million. cash flow provided by continuing operations was $5,131 million, $7,519 million, and $5,568 million for 2014, 2013, and 2012, respectively. in connection with the sale of our u.s. credit card receivables, we received cash of $5.7 billion during 2013. of this amount, $2.7 billion is included in operating cash flow provided by continuing operations and $3.0 billion is included in investing cash flow provided by continuing operations.

note:  adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations (adjusted eps), a non-gaap metric, excludes the impact of certain matters not related to our routine retail operations and the impact of our discontinued canadian operations. management believes that adjusted eps is meaningful to provide period-to-period comparisons of our operating results. a reconciliation of non-gaap financial measures to gaap measures is provided on page 21.

canada exit on january 14, 2015, following a comprehensive assessment of canadian operations, our board of directors approved a plan to discontinue operating stores in canada. as a result of this decision, on january 15, 2015, target canada co. and certain other wholly owned subsidiaries of target (collectively canada subsidiaries), filed for protection (the filing) under the companies' creditors arrangement act (ccaa) with the ontario superior court of justice in toronto (the court). the canada subsidiaries comprise substantially all of our canadian operations and our canadian segment. the canada subsidiaries have commenced an orderly liquidation process and stores in canada will remain open during the liquidation. to assist with the exit plan, the court approved the appointment of a monitor and certain other financial advisors.
as a result of the filing, we no longer have a controlling interest in the canada subsidiaries. for this reason, we deconsolidated the canada subsidiaries effective january 15, 2015, resulting in a pretax impairment loss on deconsolidation and other charges, collectively totaling $5.1 billion. the pretax loss on deconsolidation includes the derecognition of the carrying amounts of the canada subsidiaries' assets, liabilities and accumulated other comprehensive loss and the recording of our remaining interests at fair value.
subsequent to deconsolidation, we will use the cost method to account for our equity investment in the canada subsidiaries, which has been reflected as zero in our consolidated statement of financial position at january 31, 2015 based on the estimated fair value of the canada subsidiaries' net assets. loans to and accounts receivable from the canada subsidiaries are recorded at an estimated fair value of $326 million. our ultimate cash recovery on these claims is subject to the final liquidation value of the canada subsidiaries and could vary materially from our estimates.
our canada exit represents a strategic shift in our business. for this reason, our canadian segment results for all periods prior to the january 15, 2015 deconsolidation and costs to exit are classified as discontinued operations.
we have recognized a tax benefit of $1.6 billion in discontinued operations, which primarily relates to the loss on our investment in canada and includes other tax benefits resulting from certain asset write-offs and liabilities paid or accrued to facilitate the liquidation. we have realized the majority of these tax benefits in the first quarter of 2015 and expect to realize substantially all of the remainder in 2015.
the recorded expenses include an accrual for the estimated probable loss related to claims that may be asserted against us, primarily under guarantees in certain leases. our probable loss estimate is based on the expectation that claims will be asserted against us and negotiated settlements will be reached, and not on any determination that it is probable we would be found liable were these claims to be litigated. given the early stage of our exit and the filing, our estimates involve significant judgment and are based on currently available information, an assessment of the validity of certain claims and estimated payments by the canada subsidiaries. we are not able to reasonably estimate a range of possible losses in excess of the year-end accrual because there are significant factual and legal issues to be resolved. we believe that it is reasonably possible that future changes to our estimates of loss and the ultimate amount paid on these claims could be material to our results of operations in future periods. any such losses would be recorded in discontinued operations.
we expect to incur severance, legal and professional services expenses associated with our canadian exit. we will recognize these expenses within discontinued operations as services are received and liabilities are incurred. we currently cannot predict the timing of such expenses and associated cash disbursements; however, we do not expect these amounts to be material to our results in future periods.

see note 6 of the financial statements for further information regarding our canada exit.
data breach in the fourth quarter of 2013, we experienced a data breach in which an intruder stole certain payment card and other guest information from our network (the data breach). in 2014, we recorded $191 million of pretax data breach-related expenses and $46 million of expected insurance proceeds, for net expenses of $145 million. these expenses were included in our consolidated statements of operations as selling, general and administrative expenses (sg&a), but were not part of segment sg&a. along with legal and other professional services, these expenses include an accrual for estimated probable losses for what we believe to be the vast majority of actual and potential breach-related claims, including claims by the payment card networks. our probable loss estimate is based on the expectation of reaching negotiated settlements, and not on any determination that it is probable we would be found liable for the losses we have accrued were these claims to be litigated.
as of january 31, 2015 we have incurred $252 million of cumulative data breach-related expenses, partially offset by $90 million of expected insurance recoveries, for net cumulative expenses of $162 million.
for more information about the data breach, see note 17 of the financial statements.

sales sales include merchandise sales, net of expected returns, and gift card breakage. refer to note 2 of the financial statements for a definition of gift card breakage. the increase in 2014 sales reflects a 1.3 percent increase in comparable sales and the contribution from new stores. the sales decline in 2013 reflected the impact of an additional week in 2012 and a decline in comparable sales, partially offset by the contribution from new stores. inflation did not materially affect sales in any period presented.
comparable sales is a measure that highlights the performance of our existing stores and digital channel sales by measuring the change in sales for a period over the comparable, prior-year period of equivalent length. comparable sales include all sales from stores open at least 13 months. digital channel sales include all sales initiated through mobile applications and our conventional websites, including those of acquired entities from the date of acquisition, and may be fulfilled through our distribution centers or our stores. comparable sales measures vary across the retail industry. as a result, our comparable sales calculation is not necessarily comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies.

td offers credit to qualified guests through target-branded credit cards: the target credit card and the target visa credit card (target credit cards). additionally, we offer a branded proprietary target debit card. collectively, we refer to these products as redcards®. guests receive a 5 percent discount on virtually all purchases and free shipping when they use a redcard at target. we monitor the percentage of sales that are paid for using redcards (redcard penetration) because our internal analysis has indicated that a meaningful portion of incremental purchases on our redcards are also incremental sales for target.

gross margin rate our gross margin rate was 29.4 percent in 2014, 29.8 percent in 2013, and 29.7 percent in 2012. the 2014 decrease is primarily due to promotional activity.
the 2013 increase was primarily the result of a change in vendor contracts regarding payments received in support of marketing programs resulting in more vendor consideration being recognized as a reduction of our cost of sales rather than a reduction of sg&a. increases to the rate were offset by our integrated growth strategies of our 5 percent redcard rewards loyalty program and our store remodel program.
selling, general and administrative expense rate our sg&a expense rate was 19.9 percent in 2014, 20.0 percent in 2013, and 19.1 percent in 2012. the decrease in 2014 primarily related to company-wide expense optimization efforts, partially offset by investments in technology and other initiatives, none of which were individually significant.
the increase in 2013 resulted from a smaller contribution from our credit card portfolio, investments in technology and supply chain in support of multichannel initiatives, changes in merchandise vendor contracts described above, and other increases. increases were partially offset by the benefit from our company-wide expense optimization efforts and favorable incentive compensation and store hourly payroll.

other performance factors other selling, general and administrative expenses in addition to segment selling, general and administrative expenses, we recorded certain other expenses during 2014 and 2013. for 2014, these expenses included $145 million of net data breach-related costs, $16 million of impairments related to undeveloped u.s. land and $13 million of costs related to previously announced plans to convert existing co-branded redcards to mastercard co-branded chip-and-pin cards in 2015 to support the accelerated transition to chip-and-pin-enabled redcards. for 2013, these expenses included a $23 million workforce-reduction charge primarily related to severance and benefits costs, a $22 million charge related to part-time team member health benefit changes, $19 million in impairment charges related to undeveloped u.s. land, and $17 million of net data breach-related costs. additional information about these items is provided within the reconciliation of non-gaap financial measures to gaap measures on page 21.
net interest expense net interest expense from continuing operations was $882 million, $1,049 million, and $684 million for 2014, 2013, and 2012, respectively. net interest expense for 2014 and 2013 included a loss on early retirement of debt of $285 million and $445 million, respectively.
provision for income taxes our effective income tax rate from continuing operations decreased to 33.0 percent in 2014, from 34.6 percent in 2013, driven primarily by the net tax effect of our global sourcing operations and the favorable resolution of various income tax matters. the resolution of various income tax matters reduced tax expense by $35 million and $16 million in 2014 and 2013, respectively. a tax rate reconciliation is provided in note 21 to our consolidated financial statements.
our effective income tax rate from continuing operations increased to 34.6 percent in 2013, from 34.4 percent in 2012, driven by a lower year-over-year benefit from the favorable resolution of various income tax matters. the resolution of various income tax matters reduced tax expense by $16 million and $58 million in 2013 and 2012, respectively.

reconciliation of non-gaap financial measures to gaap measures to provide additional transparency, we have disclosed non-gaap adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations (adjusted eps). this metric excludes the impact of the 2013 sale of our u.s. consumer credit card receivables portfolio, losses on early retirement of debt, net expenses related to the 2013 data breach and other matters presented below. we believe this information is useful in providing period-to-period comparisons of the results of our continuing operations. this measure is not in accordance with, or an alternative to, generally accepted accounting principles in the united states. the most comparable gaap measure is diluted earnings per share from continuing operations. adjusted eps from continuing operations should not be considered in isolation or as a substitution for analysis of our results as reported under gaap. other companies may calculate non-gaap adjusted eps from continuing operations differently than we do, limiting the usefulness of the measure for comparisons with other companies. prior year amounts have been revised to present adjusted eps on a continuing operations basis.

(c)   2014 includes impairments of $16 million related to undeveloped land in the u.s. and $13 million of expense related to converting co-branded card program to mastercard. 2013 includes a $23 million workforce-reduction charge primarily related to severance and benefits costs, a $22 million charge related to part-time team member health benefit changes, and $19 million in impairment charges related to certain parcels of undeveloped land.
analysis of financial condition liquidity and capital resources our period-end cash and cash equivalents balance was $2,210 million, compared with $670 million in 2013. short-term investments of $1,520 million and $3 million were included in cash and cash equivalents at the end of 2014 and 2013, respectively. our investment policy is designed to preserve principal and liquidity of our short-term investments. this policy allows investments in large money market funds or in highly rated direct short-term instruments that mature in 60 days or less. we also place dollar limits on our investments in individual funds or instruments.
cash flows our 2014 operations were funded by both internally and externally generated funds. operating cash flow provided by continuing operations was $5,131 million in 2014 compared with $7,519 million in 2013. net cash flow provided by continuing operations for 2013 includes $5.7 billion of cash received in connection with the sale of our u.s. consumer credit card receivables, of which $2.7 billion is included in operating cash flow provided by continuing operations and $3.0 billion is included in investing cash flow provided by continuing operations. in june 2014, we issued $1 billion of unsecured debt that matures in june 2019 and $1 billion of unsecured debt that matures in july 2024. combined with our prior year-end cash position, these cash flows allowed us to repurchase $725 million of debt at a market value of $1 billion, pay current debt maturities, invest in the business and pay dividends.
year-end inventory levels increased from $8,278 million in 2013 to $8,790 million in 2014. accounts payable increased by $424 million, or 5.8 percent over the same period.
21
share repurchases in january 2012, we began repurchasing shares under a $5 billion program authorized by our board of directors. since the second quarter of 2013, we have not repurchased any shares on the open market. however, as described in note 23 of the financial statements, we reacquired 0.8 million shares during 2014 upon the noncash settlement of prepaid forward contracts related to nonqualified deferred compensation plans. during the first half of 2013, we repurchased 21.9 million shares of our common stock for a total investment of $1,474 million ($67.41 per share).
dividends we paid dividends totaling $1,205 million in 2014 and $1,006 million in 2013, an increase of 19.8 percent. we declared dividends totaling $1,271 million ($1.99 per share) in 2014, a per share increase of 20.6 percent over 2013. we declared dividends totaling $1,051 million ($1.65 per share) in 2013, a per share increase of 19.6 percent over 2012. we have paid dividends every quarter since our 1967 initial public offering, and it is our intent to continue to do so in the future.
short-term and long-term financing our financing strategy is to ensure liquidity and access to capital markets, to manage our net exposure to floating interest rate volatility and to maintain a balanced spectrum of debt maturities. within these parameters, we seek to minimize our borrowing costs. our ability to access the long-term debt and commercial paper markets has provided us with ample sources of liquidity. our continued access to these markets depends on multiple factors, including the condition of debt capital markets, our operating performance and maintaining strong debt ratings. as of january 31, 2015, our credit ratings were as follows:
credit ratings     moody's   standard and poor's   fitch long-term debt     a2        a                     a-
commercial paper   p-1       a-1                   f2
if our credit ratings were lowered, our ability to access the debt markets, our cost of funds and other terms for new debt issuances could be adversely impacted. each of the credit rating agencies reviews its rating periodically and there is no guarantee our current credit ratings will remain the same as described above. standard and poor's lowered our long-term debt rating from a+ to a during 2014, but maintained our a-1 commercial paper rating.
as a measure of our financial condition, we monitor our ratio of earnings from continuing operations to fixed charges, which represents the ratio of pretax earnings from continuing operations before fixed charges to fixed charges. fixed charges include interest expense and the interest portion of rent expense. our ratio of earnings to fixed charges was 6.02x in 2014, 6.48x in 2013 and 7.10x in 2012. see exhibit (12) for a description of how the gain on sale of our u.s. credit card receivable portfolio and loss on early retirement of debt affected the 2014, 2013 and 2012 calculations.
in 2014 and 2013, we funded our peak sales season working capital needs through internally generated funds and the issuance of commercial paper.

we have additional liquidity through a committed $2.25 billion revolving credit facility that expires in october 2018. no balances were outstanding at any time during 2014 or 2013 under this facility.
most of our long-term debt obligations contain covenants related to secured debt levels. in addition to a secured debt level covenant, our credit facility also contains a debt leverage covenant. we are, and expect to remain, in compliance with these covenants. additionally, at january 31, 2015, no notes or debentures contained provisions requiring
22
acceleration of payment upon a debt rating downgrade, except that certain outstanding notes allow the note holders to put the notes to us if within a matter of months of each other we experience both (i) a change in control and (ii) our long-term debt ratings are either reduced and the resulting rating is non-investment grade, or our long-term debt ratings are placed on watch for possible reduction and those ratings are subsequently reduced and the resulting rating is non-investment grade.
we believe our sources of liquidity will continue to be adequate to maintain operations, finance anticipated expansion and strategic initiatives, fund obligations incurred as a result of our exit from canada, fund obligations incurred as a result of the data breach and any related future technology enhancements, pay dividends and execute purchases under our share repurchase program for the foreseeable future. we believe that our exit from canada will increase our after-tax cash flows beginning in 2015. we continue to anticipate ample access to commercial paper and long-term financing.

capital expenditures decreased in 2014 from the prior year due to fewer remodels and new stores, partially offset by technology investments to support of our omnichannel efforts and security enhancements. capital expenditures decreased in 2013 from the prior year due to fewer remodels and new stores. we expect approximately $2.1 billion of capital expenditures in 2015, reflecting our focus on becoming a leading omnichannel retailer through investments in technology and supply chain, elevating signature categories and opening new stores, including urban formats.
capital expenditures related to our discontinued canadian operations were $228 million, $1,567 million and $932 million for 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively.

(g)   purchase obligations include all legally binding contracts such as firm minimum commitments for inventory purchases, merchandise royalties, equipment purchases, marketing-related contracts, software acquisition/license commitments and service contracts. we issue inventory purchase orders in the normal course of business, which represent authorizations to purchase that are cancelable by their terms. we do not consider purchase orders to be firm inventory commitments; therefore, they are excluded from the table above. if we choose to cancel a purchase order, we may be obligated to reimburse the vendor for unrecoverable outlays incurred prior to cancellation. we also issue trade letters of credit in the ordinary course of business, which are excluded from this table as these obligations are conditioned on terms of the letter of credit being met.
(h)   real estate obligations include commitments for the purchase, construction or remodeling of real estate and facilities.
(i)   we have not included obligations under our pension and postretirement health care benefit plans in the contractual obligations table above because no additional amounts are required to be funded as of january 31, 2015. our historical practice regarding these plans has been to contribute amounts necessary to satisfy minimum pension funding requirements, plus periodic discretionary amounts determined to be appropriate.
off balance sheet arrangements:    other than the unrecorded contractual obligations noted above, we do not have any arrangements or relationships with entities that are not consolidated into the financial statements.
critical accounting estimates our analysis of operations and financial condition is based on our consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with gaap. preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions affecting the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements, reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. in the notes to consolidated financial statements, we describe the significant accounting policies used in preparing the consolidated financial statements. our estimates are evaluated on an ongoing basis and are drawn from historical experience and other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. actual
24
results could differ under other assumptions or conditions. however, except as discussed below regarding canada exit and data breach-related costs, we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in future estimates or assumptions. our senior management has discussed the development and selection of our critical accounting estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors. the following items in our consolidated financial statements require significant estimation or judgment:
inventory and cost of sales:    we use the retail inventory method to account for the majority of our inventory and the related cost of sales. under this method, inventory is stated at cost using the last-in, first-out (lifo) method as determined by applying a cost-to-retail ratio to each merchandise grouping's ending retail value. the cost of our inventory includes the amount we pay to our suppliers to acquire inventory, freight costs incurred in connection with the delivery of product to our distribution centers and stores, and import costs, reduced by vendor income and cash discounts. the majority of our distribution center operating costs, including compensation and benefits, are expensed to cost of sales in the period incurred. since inventory value is adjusted regularly to reflect market conditions, our inventory methodology reflects the lower of cost or market. we reduce inventory for estimated losses related to shrink and markdowns. our shrink estimate is based on historical losses verified by physical inventory counts. historically, our actual physical inventory count results have shown our estimates to be reliable. markdowns designated for clearance activity are recorded when the salability of the merchandise has diminished. inventory is at risk of obsolescence if economic conditions change, including changing consumer demand, guest preferences, changing consumer credit markets or increasing competition. we believe these risks are largely mitigated because our inventory typically turns in less than three months. inventory was $8,790 million and $8,278 million at january 31, 2015 and february 1, 2014, respectively, and is further described in note 10 of the financial statements.
vendor income receivable:    cost of sales and sg&a expenses are partially offset by various forms of consideration received from our vendors (vendor income). vendor income is earned for a variety of programs, such as volume rebates, markdown allowances, promotions, advertising allowances and compliance programs. we establish a receivable for vendor income that is earned but not yet received. based on the agreements in place, this receivable is computed by estimating when we have completed our performance and when the amount is earned. the majority of year-end vendor income receivables are collected within the following fiscal quarter, and we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that the assumptions used in our estimate will change significantly. historically, adjustments to our vendor income receivable have not been material. vendor income receivable was $493 million and $536 million at january 31, 2015 and february 1, 2014, respectively, and is described further in note 4 of the financial statements.
long-lived assets:    long-lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts may not be recoverable. the evaluation is performed at the lowest level of identifiable cash flows independent of other assets. an impairment loss would be recognized when estimated undiscounted future cash flows from the operation and/or disposition of the assets are less than their carrying amount. measurement of an impairment loss would be based on the excess of the carrying amount of the asset group over its fair value. fair value is measured using discounted cash flows or independent opinions of value, as appropriate. we recorded impairments of $124 million, $77 million, and $37 million in 2014, 2013, and 2012, respectively, which are described further in note 12. as of january 31, 2015, a 10 percent decrease in the fair value of assets we intend to sell or close would result in additional impairment of $5 million in 2014. historically, we have not realized material losses upon sale of long-lived assets.
investments in and receivables from canada subsidiaries:    we determined the fair value and recoverability of our canadian investments by comparing the estimated fair value of the underlying assets of the canada subsidiaries to estimated liabilities at the time of the filing. we estimated the fair value of the major asset classes using estimated selling price less cost to sell, the income approach based on estimated market rents and capitalization rates, and discounted cash flow analysis of the differential between estimated market rent and contractual rent payments, as appropriate. we also applied an estimated liquidation discount to reflect the ccaa filing.
outstanding liabilities include accounts payable and other liabilities, forward commitments, unsubordinated related party payables, lease liabilities and other potential claims. potential claims include an accrual for the estimated probable loss related to claims that may be asserted against the canada subsidiaries under certain contracts. based on our estimates, the fair value of liabilities exceeds the fair value of assets.
to assess the fair value and recoverability of amounts receivable from the canada subsidiaries, we estimated the fair value of the underlying net assets of the canada subsidiaries available for distribution to their creditors in relation to the estimated creditor claims and the priority of those claims.
our estimates involve significant judgment and are based on currently available information, an assessment of the validity of certain claims and estimated payments by the canada subsidiaries. our ultimate recovery is subject to the

final liquidation value of the canada subsidiaries and may vary significantly from our current estimates. see note 6 of the financial statements for further information.
insurance/self-insurance:    we retain a substantial portion of the risk related to certain general liability, workers' compensation, property loss and team member medical and dental claims. however, we maintain stop-loss coverage to limit the exposure related to certain risks. liabilities associated with these losses include estimates of both claims filed and losses incurred but not yet reported. we use actuarial methods which consider a number of factors to estimate our ultimate cost of losses. general liability and workers' compensation liabilities are recorded at our estimate of their net present value; other liabilities referred to above are not discounted. our workers' compensation and general liability accrual was $566 million and $576 million at january 31, 2015 and february 1, 2014, respectively. we believe that the amounts accrued are appropriate; however, our liabilities could be significantly affected if future occurrences or loss developments differ from our assumptions. for example, a 5 percent increase or decrease in average claim costs would impact our self-insurance expense by $28 million in 2014. historically, adjustments to our estimates have not been material. refer to item 7a, quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk, for further disclosure of the market risks associated with these exposures. we maintain insurance coverage to limit our exposure to certain events, including network security matters. since the data breach, we have recognized $90 million of expected insurance recoveries related to the data breach. as of january 31, 2015, we have a $60 million insurance-recovery receivable relating to the data breach because we believe recovery is probable. however, it is possible that the insurance carriers could dispute our claims and that we may be unable to collect the recorded receivable.
income taxes:    we pay income taxes based on the tax statutes, regulations and case law of the various jurisdictions in which we operate. significant judgment is required in determining the timing and amounts of deductible and taxable items, and in evaluating the ultimate resolution of tax matters in dispute with tax authorities. the benefits of uncertain tax positions are recorded in our financial statements only after determining it is likely the uncertain tax positions would withstand challenge by taxing authorities. we periodically reassess these probabilities, and record any changes in the financial statements as appropriate. liabilities for uncertain tax positions, including interest and penalties, were $195 million and $241 million at january 31, 2015 and february 1, 2014, respectively. we believe the resolution of these matters will not have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial statements. income taxes are described further in note 21 of the financial statements.
pension and postretirement health care accounting:    we maintain a funded qualified, defined benefit pension plan, as well as several smaller and unfunded nonqualified plans and a postretirement health care plan for certain current and retired team members. the costs for these plans are determined based on actuarial calculations using the assumptions described in the following paragraphs. eligibility and the level of benefits varies depending on team members' full-time or part-time status, date of hire and/or length of service. the benefit obligation and related expense for these plans are determined based on actuarial calculations using assumptions about the expected long-term rate of return, the discount rate and compensation growth rates. the assumptions used to determine the period-end benefit obligation also establish the expense for the next year, with adjustments made for any significant plan or participant changes.
our expected long-term rate of return on plan assets of 7.5 percent is determined by the portfolio composition, historical long-term investment performance and current market conditions. our compound annual rate of return on qualified plans' assets was 12.1 percent, 8.3 percent, 7.0 percent and 9.7 percent for the 5-year, 10-year, 15-year and 20-year periods, respectively. a one percentage point decrease in our expected long-term rate of return would increase annual expense by $31 million.
the discount rate used to determine benefit obligations is adjusted annually based on the interest rate for long-term high-quality corporate bonds, using yields for maturities that are in line with the duration of our pension liabilities. our benefit obligation and related expense will fluctuate with changes in interest rates. a 0.5 percentage point decrease to the weighted average discount rate would increase annual expense by $29 million.
based on our experience, we use a graduated compensation growth schedule that assumes higher compensation growth for younger, shorter-service pension-eligible team members than it does for older, longer-service pension-eligible team members.
pension and postretirement health care benefits are further described in note 26 of the financial statements.
legal and other contingencies:    we are exposed to other claims and litigation arising in the ordinary course of business and use various methods to resolve these matters in a manner that we believe serves the best interest of our shareholders and other constituents. when a loss is probable, we record an accrual based on the reasonably estimable loss or range of loss. when no point of loss is more likely than another, we record the lowest amount in the estimated range of loss and disclose the estimated range. we do not record liabilities for reasonably possible loss contingencies, but do disclose a range of reasonably possible losses if they are material and we are able to estimate such a range.
26
if we cannot provide a range of reasonably possible losses, we explain the factors that prevent us from determining such a range. historically, adjustments to our estimates have not been material.
we believe the accruals recorded in our consolidated financial statements properly reflect loss exposures that are both probable and reasonably estimable. with the exception of canada exit and data breach-related loss exposures, we do not believe any of the currently identified claims or litigation may materially affect our results of operations, cash flows or financial condition. however, litigation is subject to inherent uncertainties, and unfavorable rulings could occur. if an unfavorable ruling were to occur, it may cause a material adverse impact on the results of operations, cash flows or financial condition for the period in which the ruling occurs, or future periods. refer to notes 6 and 17 of the financial statements for further information on the canada exit and data breach-related contingencies, respectively.
new accounting pronouncements we do not expect that any recently issued accounting pronouncements will have a material effect on our financial statements.

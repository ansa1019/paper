where you can find important information we may disclose important information through one or more of the following channels: sec filings, public conference calls and webcasts, press releases, the investor relations page of our website (www.henryschein.com) and the social media channels identified on the investor relations page of our website.
executive-level overview we believe we are the world's largest provider of health care products and services primarily to office-based dental, animal health and medical practitioners.  we serve more than 1 million customers worldwide including dental practitioners and laboratories, animal health clinics and physician practices, as well as government, institutional health care clinics and other alternate care clinics.  we believe that we have a strong brand identity due to our more than 82 years of experience distributing health care products.
we are headquartered in melville, new york, employ more than 17,500 people (of which approximately 8,000 are based outside the united states) and have operations or affiliates in 28 countries, including the united states, australia, austria, belgium, brazil, canada, chile, china, the czech republic, france, germany, hong kong sar, iceland, ireland, israel, italy, japan, luxembourg, the netherlands, new zealand, poland, portugal, slovakia, south africa, spain, switzerland, thailand and the united kingdom.

we have established strategically located distribution centers to enable us to better serve our customers and increase our operating efficiency.  this infrastructure, together with broad product and service offerings at competitive prices, and a strong commitment to customer service, enables us to be a single source of supply for our customers' needs.  our infrastructure also allows us to provide convenient ordering and rapid, accurate and complete order fulfillment.
we conduct our business through two reportable segments: (i) health care distribution and (ii) technology and value-added services.  these segments offer different products and services to the same customer base.
the health care distribution reportable segment aggregates our global dental, animal health and medical operating segments.  this segment distributes consumable products, small equipment, laboratory products, large equipment, equipment repair services, branded and generic pharmaceuticals, vaccines, surgical products, diagnostic tests, infection-control products and vitamins.  our global dental group serves office-based dental practitioners, dental laboratories, schools and other institutions.  our global animal health group serves animal health practices and clinics.  our global medical group serves office-based medical practitioners, ambulatory surgery centers, other alternate-care settings and other institutions.
our global technology and value-added services group provides software, technology and other value-added services to health care practitioners.  our technology group offerings include practice management software systems for dental and medical practitioners and animal health clinics.  our value-added practice solutions include financial services on a non-recourse basis, e-services, practice technology, network and hardware services, as well as continuing education services for practitioners.
industry overview in recent years, the health care industry has increasingly focused on cost containment.  this trend has benefited distributors capable of providing a broad array of products and services at low prices.  it also has accelerated the growth of hmos, group practices, other managed care accounts and collective buying groups, which, in addition to their emphasis on obtaining products at competitive prices, tend to favor distributors capable of providing specialized management information support.  we believe that the trend towards cost containment has the potential to favorably affect demand for technology solutions, including software, which can enhance the efficiency and facilitation of practice management.
our operating results in recent years have been significantly affected by strategies and transactions that we undertook to expand our business, domestically and internationally, in part to address significant changes in the health care industry, including consolidation of health care distribution companies, health care reform, trends toward managed care, cuts in medicare and collective purchasing arrangements.
our current and future results have been and could be impacted by the current economic environment and uncertainty, particularly impacting overall demand for our products and services.
industry consolidation the health care products distribution industry, as it relates to office-based health care practitioners, is highly fragmented and diverse.  this industry, which encompasses the dental, animal health and medical markets, was estimated to produce revenues of approximately $45 billion in 2014 in the global markets.  the industry ranges from sole practitioners working out of relatively small offices to group practices or service organizations ranging in size from a few practitioners to a large number of practitioners who have combined or otherwise associated their practices.
due in part to the inability of office-based health care practitioners to store and manage large quantities of supplies in their offices, the distribution of health care supplies and small equipment to office-based health care practitioners has been characterized by frequent, small quantity orders, and a need for rapid, reliable and substantially complete order fulfillment.  the purchasing decisions within an office-based health care practice are typically made by the practitioner or an administrative assistant.  supplies and small equipment are generally purchased from more than one distributor, with one generally serving as the primary supplier.
37
the trend of consolidation extends to our customer base.  health care practitioners are increasingly seeking to partner, affiliate or combine with larger entities such as hospitals, health systems, group practices or physician hospital organizations.  in many cases, purchasing decisions for consolidated groups are made at a centralized or professional staff level; however, orders are delivered to the practitioners' offices.
we believe that consolidation within the industry will continue to result in a number of distributors, particularly those with limited financial, operating and marketing resources, seeking to combine with larger companies that can provide growth opportunities.  this consolidation also may continue to result in distributors seeking to acquire companies that can enhance their current product and service offerings or provide opportunities to serve a broader customer base.
our trend with regard to acquisitions and joint ventures has been to expand our role as a provider of products and services to the health care industry.  this trend has resulted in our expansion into service areas that complement our existing operations and provide opportunities for us to develop synergies with, and thus strengthen, the acquired businesses.
as industry consolidation continues, we believe that we are positioned to capitalize on this trend, as we believe we have the ability to support increased sales through our existing infrastructure.  we also have invested in expanding our sales/marketing infrastructure to include a focus on building relationships with decision makers who do not reside in the office-based practitioner setting.
as the health care industry continues to change, we continually evaluate possible candidates for merger and joint venture or acquisition and intend to continue to seek opportunities to expand our role as a provider of products and services to the health care industry.  there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully pursue any such opportunity or consummate any such transaction, if pursued.  if additional transactions are entered into or consummated, we would incur merger and/or acquisition-related costs, and there can be no assurance that the integration efforts associated with any such transaction would be successful.
aging population and other market influences the health care products distribution industry continues to experience growth due to the aging population, increased health care awareness, the proliferation of medical technology and testing, new pharmacology treatments and expanded third-party insurance coverage, partially offset by the effects of unemployment on insurance coverage.  in addition, the physician market continues to benefit from the shift of procedures and diagnostic testing from acute care settings to alternate-care sites, particularly physicians' offices.
according to the u.s. census bureau's international data base, in 2014 there were more than six million americans aged 85 years or older, the segment of the population most in need of long-term care and elder-care services.  by the year 2050, that number is projected to nearly triple to approximately 18 million.  the population aged 65 to 84 years is projected to increase over 60% during the same time period.
as a result of these market dynamics, annual expenditures for health care services continue to increase in the united states.  we believe that demand for our products and services will grow, while continuing to be impacted by current and future operating, economic and industry conditions.  the centers for medicare and medicaid services, or cms,  published "national health expenditure projections 2013-2023" indicating that total national health care spending reached approximately $2.9 trillion in 2013, or 17.2% of the nation's gross domestic product, the benchmark measure for annual production of goods and services in the united states.  health care spending is projected to reach approximately $5.2 trillion in 2023, approximately 19.3% of the nation's gross domestic product.
38
government certain of our businesses involve the distribution of pharmaceuticals and medical devices, and in this regard we are subject to extensive local, state, federal and foreign governmental laws and regulations applicable to the distribution of pharmaceuticals and medical devices.  additionally, government and private insurance programs fund a large portion of the total cost of medical care, and there has been an emphasis on efforts to control medical costs, including laws and regulations lowering reimbursement rates for pharmaceuticals, medical devices, and/or medical treatments or services.  also, many of these laws and regulations are subject to change and may impact our financial performance.  in addition, our businesses are generally subject to numerous other laws and regulations that could impact our financial performance, including securities, antitrust and other laws and regulations.  failure to comply with law or regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business.
health care reform the united states health care reform law adopted through the march 2010 enactment of the patient protection and affordable care act and the health care and education reconciliation act increased federal oversight of private health insurance plans and included a number of provisions designed to reduce medicare expenditures and the cost of health care generally, to reduce fraud and abuse, and to provide access to increased health coverage.
the health care reform law requirements include a 2.3% excise tax on domestic sales of many medical devices by manufacturers and importers that began in 2013 and a fee on branded prescription drugs and biologics that was implemented in 2011, both of which may affect sales.  the healthcare reform law has also materially expanded the number of individuals in the united states with health insurance.  however, litigation is pending, including before the supreme court of the united states, which could result in the invalidation of some of or all of the law or the manner in which it has been interpreted, and the reduction in the expansion of health insurance coverage.  there has also been an effort by the party in control of congress to repeal some or all of the law.  the uncertain status of the healthcare reform law affects our ability to plan.
a health care reform law provision, generally referred to as the physician payment sunshine act or open payments program, has imposed new reporting and disclosure requirements for drug and device manufacturers with regard to payments or other transfers of value made to certain practitioners (including physicians, dentists and teaching hospitals), and for such manufacturers and for group purchasing organizations, with regard to certain ownership interests held by physicians in the reporting entity. on february 1, 2013, cms released the final rule to implement the physician payment sunshine act.  under this rule, data collection activities began on august 1, 2013, and first disclosure reports were due by march 31, 2014 for the period august 1, 2013 through december 31, 2013.  as required under the physician payment sunshine act, cms published information from these reports on a publicly available website, including amounts transferred and physician, dentist and teaching hospital identities, on september 30, 2014.
under the physician payment sunshine act, we are required to collect and report detailed information regarding certain financial relationships we have with physicians, dentists and teaching hospitals.  it is difficult to predict how the new requirements may impact existing relationships among manufacturers, distributors, physicians, dentists and teaching hospitals.  the physician payment sunshine act pre-empts similar state reporting laws, although we or our subsidiaries may be required to report under certain of such state laws in addition to physician payment sunshine act reporting, and some of these state laws are also ambiguous.  we completed the initial physician payment sunshine act submission to cms due march 31, 2014, covering the period august 1 to december 31, 2013, which was released to the public september 1, 2014.  beginning from 2014 and each year thereafter, data collection for each calendar year must be submitted by march 31 of the subsequent year.  we are also subject to foreign regulations requiring transparency of certain interactions between suppliers and their customers.  while we believe we have substantially compliant programs and controls in place to comply with the physician payment sunshine act requirements (and similar foreign requirements), our compliance with the new final rule (and similar foreign requirements) imposes additional costs on us.
39
health care fraud certain of our businesses are subject to federal and state (and similar foreign) health care fraud and abuse, referral and reimbursement laws and regulations with respect to their operations.  some of these laws, referred to as "false claims laws," prohibit the submission or causing the submission of false or fraudulent claims for reimbursement to federal, state and other health care payers and programs.  other laws, referred to as "anti-kickback laws," prohibit soliciting, offering, receiving or paying remuneration in order to induce the referral of a patient or ordering, purchasing, leasing or arranging for, or recommending ordering, purchasing or leasing of, items or services that are paid for by federal, state and other health care payers and programs.
the fraud and abuse laws and regulations have been subject to varying interpretations, as well as heightened enforcement activity over the past few years, and significant enforcement activity has been the result of  "relators," who serve as whistleblowers by filing complaints in the name of the united states (and if applicable, particular states) under federal and state false claims laws.  under the federal false claims act relators can be entitled to receive up to 30% of total recoveries.  also, violations of the federal false claims act can result in treble damages, and each false claim submitted can be subject to a penalty of up to $11,000 per claim.  the health care reform law significantly strengthened the federal false claims act and the federal anti-kickback law provisions, which could lead to the possibility of increased whistleblower or relator suits, and among other things made clear that a federal anti-kickback law violation can be a basis for federal false claims act liability.
the united states government (among others) has expressed concerns about financial relationships between suppliers on the one hand and physicians and dentists on the other.  as a result, we regularly review and revise our marketing practices as necessary to facilitate compliance.
we also are subject to certain united states and foreign laws and regulations concerning the conduct of our foreign operations, including the u.s. foreign corrupt practices act, the u.k. bribery act and other anti-bribery laws and laws pertaining to the accuracy of our internal books and records, which have been the focus of increasing enforcement activity globally in recent years.
failure to comply with fraud and abuse laws and regulations could result in significant civil and criminal penalties and costs, including the loss of licenses and the ability to participate in federal and state health care programs, and could have a material adverse effect on our business.  also, these measures may be interpreted or applied by a prosecutorial, regulatory or judicial authority in a manner that could require us to make changes in our operations or incur substantial defense and settlement expenses.  even unsuccessful challenges by regulatory authorities or private relators could result in reputational harm and the incurring of substantial costs.  in addition, many of these laws are vague or indefinite and have not been interpreted by the courts, and have been subject to frequent modification and varied interpretation by prosecutorial and regulatory authorities, increasing the risk of noncompliance.
while we believe that we are substantially compliant with applicable fraud and abuse laws and regulations, and have adequate compliance programs and controls in place to ensure substantial compliance, we cannot predict whether changes in applicable law, or interpretation of laws, or changes in our services or marketing practices in response to changes in applicable law or interpretation of laws, could have a material adverse effect on our business.
operating and security standards the federal food, drug, and cosmetic act ("fdc act") and similar foreign laws generally regulate the introduction, manufacture, advertising, labeling, packaging, storage, handling, reporting, marketing and distribution of, and record keeping for, pharmaceuticals and medical devices shipped in interstate commerce, and states may similarly regulate such activities within the state.

the federal drug quality and security act of 2013 brings about significant changes with respect to pharmaceutical supply chain requirements and pre-empts state law.  title ii of this measure, known as the drug supply chain security act ("dscsa"), will be phased in over 10 years, and is intended to build a national electronic, interoperable system to identify and trace certain prescription drugs as they are distributed in the united states.  the law began to take effect in january 2015, and on that date specific product tracing requirements for manufacturers, wholesalers, repackagers and dispensers (e.g., pharmacies) of prescription drugs took effect, although the fda, in a final guidance issued on december 23, 2014, stated that in order to minimize possible disruptions in the distribution of prescription drugs in the united states, it would not take action for noncompliance with these track and trace requirements prior to may 1, 2015.  these new product tracing requirements replace the former fda drug pedigree requirements and pre-empt state requirements that are inconsistent with, more stringent than, or in addition to, the dscsa requirements.  also in january 2015, the dscsa required manufacturers and wholesale distributors to have systems in place by which they can identify whether a product in their possession or control is a "suspect" or "illegitimate" product, and handle it accordingly.
the dscsa also establishes certain requirements for the licensing and operation of prescription drug wholesalers and third party logistics providers ("3pls"), and includes the creation of national wholesaler and 3pl licenses in cases where states do not license such entities.  the dscsa requires that wholesalers and 3pls distribute drugs in accordance with certain standards regarding the recordkeeping, storage and handling of prescription drugs.  wholesalers and 3pls are also required to submit annual reports to the fda beginning on january 1, 2015, which include information regarding each state where the wholesaler or 3pl is licensed, the name and address of each facility and contact information.  according to fda guidance, states are pre-empted from imposing any licensing requirements that are inconsistent with, less stringent than, directly related to, or covered by the standards established by federal law in this area.  current state licensing requirements will likely remain in effect until the fda issues new regulations as directed by the dscsa.
we are in the process of analyzing the impact of the dscsa on our business.
regulated software; electronic health records the fda has become increasingly active in addressing the regulation of computer software intended for use in health care settings, and has developed policies on regulating clinical decision support tools and other types of software as medical devices.  certain of our businesses involve the development and sale of software and related products to support physician and dental practice management, and it is possible that the fda or foreign government authorities could determine that one or more of our products is a medical device, which could subject us or one or more of our businesses to substantial additional requirements with respect to these products.
certain of our businesses involve access to personal health, medical, financial and other information of individuals, and are accordingly directly or indirectly subject to numerous federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations that protect the privacy and security of such information, such as the privacy and security provisions of the federal health insurance portability and accountability act of 1996, as amended, and implementing regulations ("hipaa").  hipaa requires, among other things, the implementation of various recordkeeping, operational, notice and other practices intended to safeguard that information, limit its use to allowed purposes and notify individuals in the event of privacy and security breaches.  failure to comply with these laws and regulations can result in substantial penalties and other liabilities.
in addition, federal initiatives are providing a program of incentive payments available to certain health care providers involving the adoption and use of certain electronic health care records systems and processes.  the initiative includes providing, among others, physicians and dentists, with financial incentives if they meaningfully use certified electronic health record technology ("ehr") in accordance with applicable requirements.  in addition, medicare-eligible providers that fail to timely adopt certified ehr systems and meet "meaningful use" requirements for those systems in accordance with regulatory requirements are to be subject to cumulative medicare reimbursement reductions, which reductions for eligible health professionals (including physicians and dentists) began on january 1, 2015.  qualification for the incentive payments requires the use of ehrs that have certain capabilities for meaningful use pursuant to standards adopted by the department of health and human services.  initial ("stage 1") standards addressed criteria for periods beginning in 2011.  cms has also issued a final rule with more demanding "stage 2" criteria for periods beginning in 2014 for eligible health professionals (including physicians and dentists).
41
recognizing difficulties encountered by some providers in acquiring and implementing 2014 edition-certified ehr technology, cms published a final rule on september 4, 2014 that adds flexibility to the manner in which physicians, dentists and others may demonstrate meaningful use of ehr by extending through the 2014 reporting period the ability, in certain circumstances, to use 2011 edition-certified technology to attest to meaningful use, rather than requiring the use of 2014 edition-certified technology.  the rule also delays for one year implementation of more rigorous "stage 3" measures, and under this rule eligible health professionals (including physicians and dentists) would begin stage 3 in calendar year 2017, as to which regulations are to be proposed in spring 2015.  in addition, also in recognition of difficulties encountered by some providers in acquiring and implementing 2014 edition-certified ehr technology, cms has specifically recognized that a hardship exemption may be granted, among other reasons, where the provider's failure to demonstrate meaningful use was caused by its ehr vendor's failure to timely obtain 2014 certification for its ehr technology, and extended the deadline for health care professionals to file hardship exemption applications from july 1, 2014 to november 30, 2014.  on january 29, 2015, cms announced an intent to engage in further rulemaking under the ehr incentive program to redress the stage 2 reporting burden on providers.  among other things, the new rule, expected in the spring of 2015, will tie ehr reporting to a calendar year, modify other aspects of the program and shorten the ehr reporting period in 2015 to 90 days.  certain of our businesses involve the manufacture and sale of certified ehr systems and other products linked to incentive programs, and so must maintain compliance with, and are affected by, these evolving governmental criteria.
also, hipaa requires certain health care providers, such as physicians, to use certain transaction and code set rules for specified electronic transactions, such as transactions involving claims submissions.  commencing july 1, 2012, cms required that electronic claim submissions and related electronic transactions be conducted under a new hipaa transaction standard, called version 5010.  cms has required this upgrade in connection with another new requirement applicable to the industry, the implementation of new diagnostic code sets to be used in claims submission.  the new diagnostic code sets are called the icd-10-cm.  they were originally to be implemented on october 1, 2013 (and cms delayed the implementation date until october 1, 2014), but as part of the protecting access to medicare act of 2014, enacted on april 1, 2014, congress prohibited the secretary of health and human services from implementing icd-10-cm any earlier than october 1, 2015.  cms published a final rule on august 4, 2014 adopting the october 1, 2015 compliance date and requiring the use of icd-9-cm code sets through september 30, 2015, and there is no suggestion that implementation will be further delayed.  certain of our businesses provide electronic practice management products that must meet those requirements, and while we believe that we are prepared to timely adopt the new standards, it is possible that the transition to these new standards, particularly the transition to icd-10-cm, may result in a degree of disruption and confusion, thus potentially increasing the costs associated with supporting this product.
there may be additional legislative initiatives in the future impacting health care.
e-commerce electronic commerce solutions have become an integral part of traditional health care supply and distribution relationships.  our distribution business is characterized by rapid technological developments and intense competition.  the continuing advancement of online commerce requires us to cost-effectively adapt to changing technologies, to enhance existing services and to develop and introduce a variety of new services to address the changing demands of consumers and our customers on a timely basis, particularly in response to competitive offerings.
through our proprietary, technologically based suite of products, we offer customers a variety of competitive alternatives.  we believe that our tradition of reliable service, our name recognition and large customer base built on solid customer relationships, position us well to participate in this significant aspect of the distribution business.  we continue to explore ways and means to improve and expand our internet presence and capabilities, including our online commerce offerings and our use of various social media outlets.

plans of restructuring on november 6, 2014, we announced a corporate initiative to rationalize our operations and provide expense efficiencies, which will occur throughout fiscal 2015.  this initiative is expected to include the elimination of approximately 2% to 3% of our workforce and the closing of certain facilities.  the costs associated with all actions to complete this restructuring are expected to be in the range of $35 million to $40 million pre-tax (approximately $0.29 to $0.33 per diluted share).  we plan to reduce our cost structure to fund new initiatives to drive future growth as our 2015 - 2017 strategic planning cycle begins.  at this time, we are unable to make a determination of the estimated amount or range of amounts to be included for each major type of cost associated with this restructuring (including associated cash expenditures).  we will provide further details in a future securities and exchange commission filing at such time as we are able to determine the costs we expect to incur in connection with this restructuring.
the costs associated with this restructuring will be included in a separate line item, "restructuring costs" within our consolidated statements of income.
during the year ended december 29, 2012, we incurred restructuring costs of approximately $15.2 million (approximately $10.5 million after taxes) consisting of employee severance pay and benefits related to the elimination of approximately 200 positions; facility closing costs, representing primarily lease terminations and asset write-off costs; and outside professional and consulting fees directly related to the restructuring plan.  this restructuring program is complete and we do not expect any additional costs from this program.

gross profit increased $255.3 million, or 9.6%, for the year ended december 27, 2014 compared to the prior year period.  as a result of different practices of categorizing costs associated with distribution networks throughout our industry, our gross margins may not necessarily be comparable to other distribution companies.  additionally, we realize substantially higher gross margin percentages in our technology segment than in our health care distribution segment.  these higher gross margins result from being both the developer and seller of software products and services, as well as certain financial services. the software industry typically realizes higher gross margins to recover investments in research and development.
within our health care distribution segment, gross profit margins may vary from one period to the next.  changes in the mix of products sold as well as changes in our customer mix have been the most significant drivers affecting our gross profit margin.  for example, sales of pharmaceutical products are generally at lower gross profit margins than other products.  conversely, sales of our private label products achieve gross profit margins that are higher than average.  with respect to customer mix, sales to our large-group customers are typically completed at lower gross margins due to the higher volumes sold as opposed to the gross margin on sales to office-based practitioners who normally purchase lower volumes at greater frequencies.
health care distribution gross profit increased $228.9 million, or 9.3%, for the year ended december 27, 2014 compared to the prior year period.  health care distribution gross profit margin increased to 26.7% for the year ended december 27, 2014 from 26.5% for the comparable prior year period.  the slight increase in our health care distribution gross profit margin reflects stable margins in each of the segment's operating units.
technology and value-added services gross profit increased $26.4 million, or 12.9%, for the year ended december 27, 2014 compared to the prior year period.  technology and value-added services gross profit margin increased to 66.2% for the year ended december 27, 2014 from 64.0% for the comparable prior year period, primarily due to changes in the product sales mix.

other expense, net decreased $6.5 million to $5.8 million for the year ended december 27, 2014 from the comparable prior year period.  interest income increased $0.8 million.  interest expense decreased $3.5 million primarily due to the $6.2 million accelerated amortization of deferred financing costs resulting from the early repayment of our henry schein animal health ("hsah") debt during february 2013, partially offset by an increase in borrowings under our bank credit lines and our private placement facilities.  other, net increased by $2.2 million due primarily to a contractual payment from an animal health supplier in europe related to a change to a non-exclusive sales model.
income taxes for the year ended december 27, 2014, our effective tax rate was 30.4% compared to 28.7% for the prior year period.  during the third quarter of 2013, we concluded that it is more likely than not that certain deferred tax assets related to tax loss carryforwards originating outside the united states, which had been previously reserved, will be realized.  as a result, our provision for income taxes for the year ended december 28, 2013 included a $13.4 million reduction of the valuation allowance which was based on an estimate of future taxable income available to be offset by the tax loss carryforwards.
absent the effects of the reduction of this valuation allowance in the third quarter of 2013, our effective tax rate for the year ended december 28, 2013 would have been 30.7% as compared to our actual effective tax rate of 28.7%.  the remaining difference between our effective tax rates and the federal statutory tax rates for both periods primarily relates to state and foreign income taxes and interest expense.  for 2015, we expect our effective tax rate to be in the range of 30%.
loss on sale of equity investment on july 10, 2013, we divested our investment in a dental wholesale distributor in the middle east that had primarily served as an importer that distributed products largely to other distributors.  the divestiture resulted in a one-time loss of $12.5 million, or $0.14 per diluted share, in the third quarter of 2013.  pursuant to the terms of this divestiture, we made cash payments to this distributor in the aggregate amount of $13.4 million, which it was required to use to reduce its debt, pay certain trade payables and provide working capital.  the investment in this distributor had been fully impaired as of the end of 2012.  there was no tax benefit related to the loss on this divestiture.
net income net income increased $34.0 million, or 7.2%, for the year ended december 27, 2014, compared to the prior year period due to the factors noted above.

technology and value-added services gross profit increased $21.1 million, or 11.5%, for the year ended december 28, 2013 compared to the prior year period.  technology and value-added services gross profit margin decreased to 64.0% for the year ended december 28, 2013 from 64.8% for the comparable prior year period, primarily due to changes in the product sales mix.

other expense, net decreased $2.4 million to $12.4 million for the year ended december 28, 2013 from the comparable prior year period.  interest income decreased $0.5 million primarily due to lower investment income.  interest expense decreased $3.4 million primarily due to a reduction in borrowings under our hsah debt, partially offset by an increase in borrowings under our private placement facilities and increased borrowings based on the securitization of our u.s. trade accounts receivable.  other, net decreased by $0.4 million due primarily to the impact of foreign currency exchange.
income taxes for the year ended december 28, 2013, our effective tax rate was 28.7% compared to 31.1% for the prior year period.  during the third quarter of 2013, we concluded that it is more likely than not that certain deferred tax assets related to tax loss carryforwards originating outside the united states, which had been previously reserved, will be realized.  as a result, our provision for income taxes for the year ended december 28, 2013 included a $13.4 million reduction of the valuation allowance which was based on an estimate of future taxable income available to be offset by the tax loss carryforwards.
absent the effects of the reduction of this valuation allowance in the third quarter of 2013, our effective tax rate for the year ended december 28, 2013 would have been 30.7% as compared to our actual effective tax rate of 28.7% the remaining difference between our effective tax rates and the federal statutory tax rates for both periods primarily relates to state and foreign income taxes and interest expense.
loss on sale of equity investment on july 10, 2013, we divested our investment in a dental wholesale distributor in the middle east that had primarily served as an importer that distributed products largely to other distributors.  the divestiture resulted in a one-time loss of $12.5 million, or $0.14 per diluted share, in the third quarter of 2013.  pursuant to the terms of this divestiture, we made cash payments to this distributor in the aggregate amount of $13.4 million, which it was required to use to reduce its debt, pay certain trade payables and provide working capital.  the investment in this distributor had been fully impaired as of the end of 2012.  there was no tax benefit related to the loss on this divestiture.
net income net income increased $48.1 million, or 11.4%, for the year ended december 28, 2013 compared to the prior year period due to the factors noted above.
49
liquidity and capital resources our principal capital requirements include funding of acquisitions, purchases of additional noncontrolling interests, repayments of debt principal, the funding of working capital needs, purchases of fixed assets and repurchases of common stock.  working capital requirements generally result from increased sales, special inventory forward buy-in opportunities and payment terms for receivables and payables.  historically, sales have tended to be stronger during the third and fourth quarters and special inventory forward buy-in opportunities have been most prevalent just before the end of the year, and have caused our working capital requirements to have been higher from the end of the third quarter to the end of the first quarter of the following year.
we finance our business primarily through cash generated from our operations, revolving credit facilities and debt placements.  our ability to generate sufficient cash flows from operations is dependent on the continued demand of our customers for our products and services, and access to products and services from our suppliers.
our business requires a substantial investment in working capital, which is susceptible to fluctuations during the year as a result of inventory purchase patterns and seasonal demands.  inventory purchase activity is a function of sales activity, special inventory forward buy-in opportunities and our desired level of inventory.  we anticipate future increases in our working capital requirements.
we finance our business to provide adequate funding for at least 12 months.  funding requirements are based on forecasted profitability and working capital needs, which, on occasion, may change.  consequently, we may change our funding structure to reflect any new requirements.
we believe that our cash and cash equivalents, our ability to access private debt markets and public equity markets, and our available funds under existing credit facilities provide us with sufficient liquidity to meet our currently foreseeable short-term and long-term capital needs.  we have no off-balance sheet arrangements.
net cash provided by operating activities was $592.5 million for the year ended december 27, 2014, compared to $664.2 million for the prior year.  the net change of $71.7 million was primarily attributable to unfavorable working capital changes, partially offset by net income improvements.  the prior year's change in working capital was favorably affected by reductions in inventory related to the medical device excise tax.
net cash used in investing activities was $516.6 million for the year ended december 27, 2014, compared to $266.6 million for the prior year.  the net change of $250.0 million was primarily due to increased payments for equity investments and business acquisitions and increased purchases of fixed assets.
net cash used in financing activities was $154.6 million for the year ended december 27, 2014, compared to $336.0 million for the prior year.  the net change of $181.4 million was primarily due to decreased net payments for long-term debt, partially offset by an increase in acquisitions of noncontrolling interests in subsidiaries.

u.s. trade accounts receivable securitization on april 17, 2013, we entered into a facility agreement of up to $300 million with a bank, as agent, based on the securitization of our u.s. trade accounts receivable.  the new facility allowed us to replace public debt (approximately $220 million), which had a higher interest rate at hsah during february 2013 and provided funding for working capital and general corporate purposes.  the financing was structured as an asset-backed securitization program with pricing committed for up to three years.  on september 22, 2014, we extended the expiration date of this facility agreement to april 15, 2017.  the borrowings outstanding under this securitization facility were $150.0 million as of december 27, 2014.  at december 27, 2014, the interest rate on borrowings under this facility was based on the average asset-backed commercial paper rate of 20 basis points plus 75 basis points, for a combined rate of 0.95%.
we are required to pay a commitment fee of 30 basis points on the daily balance of the unused portion of the facility if our usage is greater than or equal to 50% of the facility limit or a commitment fee of 35 basis points on the daily balance of the unused portion of the facility if our usage is less than 50% of the facility limit.

balance, end of period                                                            $564,527                   $497,539                   $435,175
changes in the estimated redemption amounts of the noncontrolling interests subject to put options are adjusted at each reporting period with a corresponding adjustment to additional paid-in capital.  future reductions in the carrying amounts are subject to a floor amount that is equal to the fair value of the redeemable noncontrolling interests at the time they were originally recorded.  the recorded value of the redeemable noncontrolling interests cannot go below the floor level.  these adjustments do not impact the calculation of earnings per share.
additionally, some prior owners of such acquired subsidiaries are eligible to receive additional purchase price cash consideration if certain financial targets are met.  any adjustments to these accrual amounts are recorded in our consolidated statement of income.
unrecognized tax benefits as more fully disclosed in note 12 of "notes to consolidated financial statements," we cannot reasonably estimate the timing of future cash flows related to the unrecognized tax benefits, including accrued interest, of $80.6 million as of december 27, 2014.

critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities.  we base our estimates on historical data, when available, experience, industry and market trends, and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the combined results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.  however, by their nature, estimates are subject to various assumptions and uncertainties.  reported results are therefore sensitive to any changes in our assumptions, judgments and estimates, including the possibility of obtaining materially different results if different assumptions were to be applied.
we believe that the following critical accounting policies, which have been discussed with our audit committee, affect the significant estimates and judgments used in the preparation of our financial statements:
revenue recognition we generate revenue from the sale of dental, animal health and medical consumable products, as well as equipment, software products and services and other sources. provisions for discounts, rebates to customers, customer returns and other contra-revenue adjustments are recorded based upon historical data and estimates and are provided for in the period in which the related sales are recognized.
revenue derived from the sale of consumable products is recognized when products are shipped or made available to customers. such sales typically entail high-volume, low-dollar orders shipped using third-party common carriers. we believe that the shipment date is the most appropriate point in time indicating the completion of the earnings process because we have no post-shipment obligations, the product price is fixed and determinable, collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured and product returns are reasonably estimable.
revenue derived from the sale of equipment is recognized when products are delivered to customers. such sales typically entail scheduled deliveries of large equipment primarily by equipment service technicians. some equipment sales require minimal installation, which is typically completed at the time of delivery.
revenue derived from the sale of software products is recognized when products are shipped to customers. such software is generally installed by customers and does not require extensive training due to the nature of its design. revenue derived from post-contract customer support for software, including annual support and/or training, is recognized over the period in which the services are provided.
revenue derived from multiple element arrangements, and the related deferral of such revenue (which is insignificant to our financial statements), is recognized as follows. when we sell software products together with related services (i.e., training and technical support) we allocate revenue to the delivered elements using the residual method, based upon vendor-specific objective evidence ("vsoe") of the fair value of the undelivered elements, or defer it until such time as vendor-specific evidence of fair value is obtained. multiple element arrangements that include elements that are not considered software consist primarily of equipment and the related installation service.  we allocate revenue for such arrangements based on the relative selling prices of the elements applying the following hierarchy: first vsoe, then third-party evidence ("tpe") of selling price if vsoe is not available, and finally our estimate of the selling price if neither vsoe nor tpe is available. vsoe exists when we sell the deliverables separately and represents the actual price charged by us for each deliverable. estimated selling price reflects our best estimate of what the selling prices of each deliverable would be if it were sold regularly on a standalone basis taking into consideration the cost structure of our business, technical skill required, customer location and other market conditions. each element that has standalone value is accounted for as a separate unit of accounting. revenue allocated to each unit of accounting is recognized when the service is provided or the product is delivered.
revenue derived from other sources including freight charges, equipment repairs and financial services, is recognized when the related product revenue is recognized or when the services are provided.
55
accounts receivable and reserves the carrying amount of accounts receivable is reduced by a valuation allowance that reflects our best estimate of the amounts that will not be collected.  the reserve for accounts receivable is comprised of allowance for doubtful accounts and sales returns.  in addition to reviewing delinquent accounts receivable, we consider many factors in estimating our reserve, including historical data, experience, customer types, credit worthiness and economic trends.  from time to time, we may adjust our assumptions for anticipated changes in any of these or other factors expected to affect collectability.  although we believe our judgments, estimates and/or assumptions related to accounts receivable and reserves are reasonable, making material changes to such judgments, estimates and/or assumptions could materially affect our financial results.
inventories and reserves inventories consist primarily of finished goods and are valued at the lower of cost or market. cost is determined by the first-in, first-out method for merchandise or actual cost for large equipment and high tech equipment.  in accordance with our policy for inventory valuation, we consider many factors including the condition and salability of the inventory, historical sales, forecasted sales and market and economic trends.
from time to time, we may adjust our assumptions for anticipated changes in any of these or other factors expected to affect the value of inventory.  although we believe our judgments, estimates and/or assumptions related to inventory and reserves are reasonable, making material changes to such judgments, estimates and/or assumptions could materially affect our financial results.
goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets (primarily trademarks) are not amortized, but are subject to impairment analysis at least once annually.  such impairment analyses for goodwill require a comparison of the fair value to the carrying value of reporting units.  we regard our reporting units to be our operating segments: health care distribution (global dental, animal health and medical) and technology and value-added services.
we test goodwill impairment under the provisions of accounting standards update 2011-08, "intangibles-goodwill and other (topic 350): testing goodwill for impairment," which allows us to use qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair values of our reporting units are less than their carrying values.  the factors that we consider in developing our qualitative assessment include:
•   macroeconomic conditions consisting of the overall sales growth of our business and the overall sales growth of each of our operating segments. we also consider our growth in market share in the markets in which we compete;

•   credit markets and our ability to access debt facilities at favorable terms;

•   key personnel and management expertise, as well as our growth strategies for the next several years; and

•   our expectations of selling or disposing all, or a portion, of a reporting unit.

goodwill was allocated to such reporting units, for the purposes of preparing our impairment analyses, based on a specific identification basis.  our impairment analysis for indefinite-lived intangibles consists of a comparison of the fair value to the carrying value of the assets.  this comparison is made based on a review of historical, current and forecasted sales and gross profit levels, as well as a review of any factors that may indicate potential impairment.  for certain indefinite-lived intangible assets, a present value technique, such as estimates of future cash flows, is utilized.  we assessed the potential impairment of goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets annually (at the beginning of our fourth quarter) and on an interim basis whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable.
some factors we consider important that could trigger an interim impairment review include:
•   significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results;

•   significant changes in the manner of our use of acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business (e.g., decision to divest a business); or

•   significant negative industry or economic trends.

if we determine through the impairment review process that goodwill or other indefinite-lived intangible assets are impaired, we record an impairment charge in our consolidated statements of income.

for the years ended december 27, 2014, december 28, 2013 and december 29, 2012, the results of our goodwill impairment analysis did not result in any impairments.
supplier rebates supplier rebates are included as a reduction of cost of sales and are recognized over the period they are earned.  the factors we consider in estimating supplier rebate accruals include forecasted inventory purchases and sales in conjunction with supplier rebate contract terms which generally provide for increasing rebates based on either increased purchase or sales volume.  although we believe our judgments, estimates and/or assumptions related to supplier rebates are reasonable, making material changes to such judgments, estimates and/or assumptions could materially affect our financial results.
long-lived assets long-lived assets, other than goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangibles, are evaluated for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable through the estimated undiscounted future cash flows to be derived from such assets.
definite-lived intangible assets primarily consist of non-compete agreements, trademarks, trade names, customer lists, customer relationships and intellectual property.   for long-lived assets used in operations, impairment losses are only recorded if the asset's carrying amount is not recoverable through its undiscounted, probability-weighted future cash flows.  we measure the impairment loss based on the difference between the carrying amount and the estimated fair value.  when an impairment exists, the related assets are written down to fair value.  although we believe our judgments, estimates and/or assumptions used in estimating cash flows and determining fair value are reasonable, making material changes to such judgments, estimates and/or assumptions could materially affect such impairment analyses and our financial results.
stock-based compensation we measure stock-based compensation at the grant date, based on the estimated fair value of the award.  prior to march 2009, awards principally included a combination of at-the-money stock options and restricted stock/units.  since march 2009, equity-based awards have been granted solely in the form of restricted stock/units, with the exception of providing stock options to employees pursuant to certain pre-existing contractual obligations.
we estimated the fair value of stock options using the black-scholes valuation model which required us to make assumptions about the expected life of options, stock price volatility, risk-free interest rates and dividend yields.
grants of restricted stock/units are stock-based awards granted to recipients with specified vesting provisions.  in the case of restricted stock, common stock is delivered on the date of grant, subject to vesting conditions.  in the case of restricted stock units, common stock is generally delivered on or following satisfaction of vesting conditions.  prior to february 2014, we issued restricted stock/units that vest solely based on the recipient's continued service over time (primarily four-year cliff) and restricted stock/units that vest based on our achieving specified performance measurements and the recipient's continued service over time (primarily three-year cliff vesting).  since february 2014, we have issued restricted stock/units that vest solely based on the recipient's continued service over time (primarily four-year cliff vesting under our 2013 stock incentive plan and primarily 13-month cliff vesting under our 1996 non-employee director stock incentive plan) and restricted stock/units that vest based on our achieving specified performance measurements and the recipient's continued service over time (primarily three-year cliff vesting under our 2013 stock incentive plan).
57
with respect to time-based restricted stock/units, we estimate the fair value on the date of grant based on our closing stock price.  with respect to performance-based restricted stock/units, the number of shares that ultimately vest and are received by the recipient is based upon our performance as measured against specified targets over a three-year period as determined by the compensation committee of the board of directors.  although there is no guarantee that performance targets will be achieved, we estimate the fair value of performance-based restricted stock/units based on our closing stock price at time of grant.  adjustments to the performance-based restricted stock/units targets are provided for significant events such as acquisitions, divestitures, new business ventures, share repurchases and certain foreign exchange fluctuations.  over the performance period, the number of shares of common stock that will ultimately vest and be issued and the related compensation expense is adjusted upward or downward based upon our estimation of achieving such performance targets.  the ultimate number of shares delivered to recipients and the related compensation cost recognized as an expense will be based on our actual performance metrics as defined.
although we believe our judgments, estimates and/or assumptions related to stock-based compensation are reasonable, making material changes to such judgments, estimates and/or assumptions could materially affect our financial results.
recently issued accounting standards in may 2014, the fasb issued accounting standards update no. 2014-09, "revenue from contracts with customers" ("asu 2014-09"), which supersedes nearly all existing revenue recognition guidance under accounting principles generally accepted in united states ("u.s. gaap"). the core principle of asu 2014-09 is to recognize revenues when promised goods or services are transferred to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which an entity expects to be entitled for those goods or services. asu 2014-09 defines a five step process to achieve this core principle and, in doing so, more judgment and estimates may be required within the revenue recognition process than are required under existing u.s. gaap.
the standard is effective for annual periods beginning after december 15, 2016, and interim periods therein, using either of the following transition methods: (i) a full retrospective approach reflecting the application of the standard in each prior reporting period with the option to elect certain practical expedients; or (ii) a retrospective approach with the cumulative effect of initially adopting asu 2014-09 recognized at the date of adoption (which includes additional footnote disclosures).  we are currently evaluating the impact of our pending adoption of asu 2014-09 on our consolidated financial statements and have not yet determined the method by which we will adopt the standard in 2017.

item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview our management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations ("md&a") includes the following: a business overview that provides a high level summary of our operating results and bookings trends that affect our business; a more detailed analysis of our results of operations; our liquidity and capital resources, which discusses key aspects of our statements of cash flows, changes in our balance sheets and our financial commitments; and a summary of our critical accounting policies and estimates we believe are important to understanding the assumptions and judgments incorporated in our reported financial results. our md&a should be read in conjunction with item 8, financial statements and supplementary data, of this annual report on form 10-k. the following discussion contains forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties. actual results may differ from those referred to herein due to a number of factors, including but not limited to risks described in the item 1a, risk factors, in this annual report on form 10-k.
business overview total revenues for fiscal 2014 were $789.0 million, an increase of 6% from $743.4 million in fiscal 2013. revenue in each of our segments increased, with applications, scores and tools increasing by 6%, 3% and 14% in fiscal 2014 compared to fiscal 2013, respectively. our revenues derived from clients outside the u.s. have generally grown, and may in the future grow more rapidly than our revenues from domestic clients. international revenues totaled $331.7 million for fiscal 2014, an increase of 13% from $294.0 million in fiscal 2013, representing 42% and 40% of total consolidated revenues in each of these years. a significant portion of our revenues are derived from the sale of products and services within the banking (including consumer credit) industry, and 74% and 73% of our revenues were derived from within this industry during fiscal 2014 and 2013, respectively. in addition, we derive a significant share of revenue from transactional or unit-based software license fees, transactional fees derived under scoring, network service or internal hosted software arrangements, annual software maintenance fees and annual license fees under long-term software license arrangements. arrangements with transactional or unit-based pricing accounted for approximately 67% and 69% of our revenues during fiscal 2014 and 2013, respectively.
operating income for fiscal 2014 was 161.9 million, an increase of $0.3 million from $161.6 million in fiscal 2013. operating margin decreased to 21% from 22% primarily attributable to our continued investment in the areas of cloud computing and saas, partially offset by a higher percentage of revenues derived from our higher-margin software products. net income for fiscal 2014 was $94.9 million, an increase of 5% from $90.1 million in fiscal 2013. diluted earnings per share for fiscal 2014 was $2.72, an increase of 10% from $2.48 in fiscal 2013.
we generate significant free cash flow used to enhance shareholder value through investments in long-term growth initiatives; acquisitions of relevant technologies and products that strengthen our portfolio and competitive position; and our share repurchase program.
during fiscal 2014, we continued to invest in our growth initiatives that expand our addressable markets. we introduced a full suite of applications for the fico® analytic cloud, expanding product offerings in our applications and tools segments to accommodate small-to-midsize companies that benefit from the affordability and simplicity of cloud-based solutions. for our scores segment, we introduced the fico® score open access program which allows our participating clients to provide their customers with a free fico® score along with materials to help them understand what affects their score. we have more than 30 million consumers with access to their free score through the fico® score open access program and with the addition of new participants we expect this to grow to more than 60 million in early 2015. in addition, we introduced the fico® custom credit education program where lenders can license enhanced credit education tools to include in their consumer financial education programs.
we continued to make acquisitions that deliver solutions to the financial services industry and adjacent vertical industries; our recent acquisitions of infocentricity and karmasphere are expected to benefit customers of all sizes and across all industries by leveraging cloud-based analytics modeling technology along with the big data analytics for hadoop technology capabilities.
we also returned significant cash to shareholders through our stock repurchase program. during fiscal 2014, we repurchased approximately 3.7 million shares for a total cost of $214.9 million. as of september 30, 2014, we had $250.0 million remaining under our current stock repurchase program.

bookings management uses bookings as an indicator of our business performance. bookings represent contracts signed in the current reporting period that generate current and future revenue streams. we consider contract terms, knowledge of the marketplace and experience with our customers, among other factors, when determining the estimated value of contract bookings.
bookings calculations have varying degrees of certainty depending on the revenue type and individual contract terms. our revenue types are transactional and maintenance, professional services and license. our estimate of bookings is as of the end of the period in which a contract is signed, and we do not update initial booking estimates in future periods for changes between estimated and actual results. actual revenue and the timing thereof could differ materially from our initial estimates. the following paragraphs discuss the key assumptions used to calculate bookings and the susceptibility of these assumptions to variability.
transactional and maintenance bookings we calculate transactional bookings as the total estimated volume of transactions or number of accounts under contract, multiplied by the contractual rate. transactional contracts generally span multiple years and require us to make estimates about future transaction volumes or number of active accounts. we develop estimates from discussions with our customers and examinations of historical data from similar products and customer arrangements. differences between estimated bookings and actual results occur due to variability in the volume of transactions or number of active accounts estimated. this variability is primarily caused by the following:
•   the health of the economy and economic trends in our customers' industries;
•   individual performance of our customers relative to their competitors; and
•   regulatory and other factors that affect the business environment in which our customers operate.
we calculate maintenance bookings directly from the terms stated in the contract.
professional services bookings we calculate professional services bookings as the estimated number of hours to complete a project multiplied by the rate per hour. we estimate the number of hours based on our understanding of the project scope, conversations with customer personnel and our experience in estimating professional services projects. estimated bookings may differ from actual results primarily due to differences in the actual number of hours incurred. these differences typically result from customer decisions to alter the mix of fico and customer resources used to complete a project.
license bookings licenses are sold on a perpetual or term basis and bookings generally equal the fixed amount stated in the contract.

transactional and maintenance bookings were 29% and 37% of total bookings for the years ended september 30, 2014 and 2013, respectively. professional services bookings were 47% and 41% of total bookings for the years ended september 30, 2014 and 2013, respectively. license bookings were 24% and 22% of total bookings for the years ended september 30, 2014 and 2013, respectively.
the weighted-average term of bookings achieved measures the average term over which the bookings are expected to be recognized as revenue. as the weighted-average term increases, the average amount of revenues expected to be realized in a quarter decreases; however, the revenues are expected to be recognized over a longer period of time. as the weighted-average term decreases, the average amount of revenues expected to be realized in a quarter increases; however, the revenues are expected to be recognized over a shorter period of time.
management regards the volume of bookings achieved, among other factors, as an important indicator of future revenues, but they are not comparable to, nor substituted for, an analysis of our revenues, and they are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties concerning timing and contingencies affecting product delivery and performance.
although many of our contracts contain non-cancelable terms, most of our bookings are transactional or service related and are dependent upon estimates such as volume of transactions, number of active accounts, or number of hours incurred. since these estimates cannot be considered fixed or firm, we do not believe it is appropriate to characterize bookings as backlog.
segment information we are organized into the following three reportable segments: applications, scores and tools. although we sell solutions and services into a large number of end user product and industry markets, our reportable business segments reflect the primary method in which management organizes and evaluates internal financial information to make operating decisions and assess performance. comparative segment revenues, operating income, and related financial information for the years ended september 30, 2014, 2013 and 2012 are set forth in note 17 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.

applications segment revenues increased $28.2 million in fiscal 2014 from fiscal 2013 primarily due to a $17.3 million increase in our fraud solutions, a $9.6 million increase in our customer communication solutions, a $5.0 million increase in our originations solutions, and a $4.8 million increase in our collections & recovery solutions. the increase was partially offset by a $5.3 million decrease in our marketing solutions and a $3.2 million decrease in our customer management solutions.
the increase in fraud solutions was primarily attributable to two large multi-year license transactions during fiscal 2014. the increase in customer communication solutions was primarily attributable to an increase in transactional revenues as a result of our growth in the mobile communication market. the increase in originations solutions was primarily attributable to an increase in license and services revenues. the increase in collections & recovery solutions was primarily attributable to an increase in services revenues. the decrease in marketing solutions was primarily attributable to the early termination of a large customer in fiscal 2013, partially offset by a large deal entered into in fiscal 2014 to develop customized software solutions for a new customer. the decrease in customer management solutions was primarily attributable to a decrease in license revenue.
applications segment revenues increased $51.5 million in fiscal 2013 from fiscal 2012 primarily due to a $51.1 million increase in our customer communications solutions and an $11.1 million increase in our collections & recovery solutions, partially offset by a $6.5 million decrease in our customer management solutions and a $3.5 million decrease in our marketing solutions.
the increase in customer communication solutions was attributable to our adeptra acquisition in september 2012. the increase in collections & recovery solutions was primarily attributable to our cr software acquisition in november 2012, partially offset by a decrease in revenues generated from our fico® debt managertm product. the decrease in customer management solutions was primarily attributable to a decrease in software revenue driven by a large license transaction in fiscal 2012. the decrease in marketing solutions was primarily attributable to the early termination of a large customer in december 2012.

cost of revenues cost of revenues consists primarily of employee salaries and benefits for personnel directly involved in developing, installing and supporting revenue products; travel costs; overhead costs; costs of computer service bureaus; internal network hosting costs; amounts payable to credit reporting agencies for scores; software costs; and expenses related to our consumer score services through myfico.com.
the fiscal year 2014 over 2013 increase of $19.8 million was primarily due to an $11.2 million increase in personnel and labor costs, a $5.3 million increase in outside services cost, and a $2.7 million increase in allocated facilities cost, partially offset by a $3.2 million decrease in direct materials. the increase in personnel and labor costs was primarily attributable to an increase in incentive cost, as well as an increase in salaries and benefits cost as a result of our increased headcount. the increase in outside services cost was primarily attributable to an increase in our billable consulting projects utilizing temporary resources. the increase in allocated facilities cost was primarily attributable to leased office space assumed from our acquisitions of cr software and infoglide in fiscal 2013, and infocentricity in fiscal 2014. the decrease in direct materials was primarily attributable to a decrease in software license sales that incur royalties cost. cost of revenues as a percentage of revenues was 31%, consistent with those incurred during fiscal 2013.
cost of revenues as a percentage of revenues increased to 31% during fiscal 2013 from 29% during fiscal 2012. the $31.5 million increase was primarily due to a $14.9 million increase in third-party software and data costs, an $11.2 million increase in personnel and labor costs, a $2.3 million increase in travel cost and a $1.8 million increase in outside services cost. the increase in third-party software and data costs was mainly related to integration of lower-margin products from our adeptra and cr software acquisitions in september and november 2012, respectively, as well as an increase in sales of our other products that require data acquisition. the increase in personnel and labor costs was primarily attributable to the increased headcount as a result of our recent acquisitions. the increase in travel cost was primarily attributable to an increase in services revenue requiring travel to client locations. the increase in outside services cost was due to an increase in use of external contractors as a result of increased services revenue.
in fiscal 2015, we expect cost of revenues as a percentage of revenues will be consistent with those incurred during fiscal 2014.
research and development research and development expenses include the personnel and related overhead costs incurred in the development of new products and services, including the research of mathematical and statistical models and the development of new versions of our products.
research and development expenses as a percentage of revenues increased to 11% during fiscal 2014 from 9% during fiscal 2013. the $16.5 million increase was attributable to an $11.5 million increase in personnel and labor costs, a $3.0 million increase in outside services cost, and a $2.0 million increase in allocated facilities cost, all driven by our continued investment in the areas of cloud computing and saas.
the fiscal year 2013 over 2012 increase of $7.4 million in research and development expenses was primarily attributable to an $8.5 million increase in personnel and labor costs, attributable to the increased headcount as a result of our recent acquisitions. research and development expenses as a percentage of revenues was 9% during the year ended september 30, 2013, consistent with those incurred during the year ended september 30, 2012.
in fiscal 2015, we expect that research and development expenditures as a percentage of revenues will be consistent with those incurred during fiscal 2014 as we continue to invest in the areas of cloud computing and saas.
selling, general and administrative selling, general and administrative expenses consist principally of employee salaries and benefits; travel costs; overhead costs; advertising and other promotional expenses; corporate facilities expenses; legal expenses; business development expenses and the cost of operating computer systems.
the fiscal year 2014 over 2013 increase of $9.8 million in selling, general and administrative expenses was primarily attributable to a $7.9 million increase in labor and personnel costs and a $2.3 million increase in marketing cost. the increase in labor and personnel costs was primarily due to an increase in stock-based compensation cost driven by the increase in our stock price, as well as an increase in incentive cost. the increase in marketing cost was primarily attributable to several new marketing programs implemented in fiscal 2014. selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues decreased to 35% for the year ended september 30, 2014 from 36% for the year ended september 30, 2013 primarily attributable to fico shifting resources to research and development efforts in the areas of cloud computing and saas.
32
selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues was 36% for the year ended september 30, 2013 as compared to 35% for the year ended september 30, 2012. the $29.9 million increase was primarily attributable to a $15.7 million increase in labor and personnel costs, a $4.4 million increase in equipment and software depreciation cost, a $3.3 million increase in travel cost and a $2.9 million increase in allocated facilities and infrastructure costs. the increase in labor and personnel costs was primarily due to the increased headcount as a result of our recent acquisitions. the increase in equipment and software depreciation cost was due to timing of fixed assets placed in service. the increase in travel cost was primarily due to increased non-revenue producing travel activities as a result of our recent acquisitions. the increase in allocated facilities and infrastructure costs was primarily due to increased resource requirement as a result of our recent acquisitions.
in fiscal 2015, we expect that selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues will be consistent with those incurred during fiscal 2014.
amortization of intangible assets amortization of intangible assets consists of amortization expense related to intangible assets recorded in connection with our acquisitions. our finite-lived intangible assets consist primarily of completed technology and customer contracts and relationships, which are being amortized using the straight-line method over periods ranging from five to fifteen years.
the fiscal 2014 over fiscal 2013 decrease in amortization expense of $1.6 million was primarily attributable to certain intangible assets associated with our dash and london bridge acquisitions becoming fully amortized in fiscal 2013, partially offset by the addition of intangible assets associated with our infoglide acquisition in fiscal 2013 and infocentricity acquisition in fiscal 2014.
the fiscal 2013 over fiscal 2012 increase in amortization expense of $6.6 million was attributable to the addition of intangible assets associated with our recent acquisitions of entiera, adeptra, cr software and infoglide, partially offset by certain intangible assets associated with our dash and london bridge acquisitions becoming fully amortized in january 2012 and may 2013, respectively.
in fiscal 2015, we expect amortization expense will be consistent with the amortization expense incurred in 2014 .
restructuring and acquisition-related in fiscal 2014, we incurred net charges totaling $4.1 million consisting of $0.2 million in facilities charges and $3.9 million in severance charges due to the elimination of 88 positions throughout the company. cash payments for all the restructuring charges will be paid by the end of the second quarter of our fiscal 2015. we also incurred $0.2 million in acquisition-related cost primarily associated with our infocentricity acquisition.
in fiscal 2013, we incurred $1.0 million in acquisition-related cost mainly associated with our cr software and infoglide acquisitions. we also incurred net charges totaling $2.5 million consisting of severance costs and costs for vacating excess leased space. cash payments for all the severance costs were paid during fiscal 2013. cash payments for all the facilities charges have been paid by the end of fiscal 2014.
in fiscal 2012, we incurred $1.1 million in acquisition-related cost in association with the adeptra and entiera acquisitions. we also eliminated 85 positions mainly within the product and technology organization of the company and incurred $4.0 million for severance costs. cash payments for all the severance costs had been paid by the end of fiscal 2013.

interest expense, net interest expense included primarily interest on the senior notes issued in may 2008 and july 2010, as well as interest and credit facility fees on the revolving line of credit. interest expense is netted with interest income, which is derived primarily
33
from the investment of funds in excess of our immediate operating requirements, on our consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income.
the fiscal 2014 over 2013 decrease in net interest expense of $1.7 million was primarily attributable to the $8.0 million and $49.0 million principal payment in may 2014 and 2013, respectively, on the senior notes issued in may 2008 resulting in lower average debt balance for fiscal 2014.
the fiscal 2013 over 2012 decrease in net interest expense of $1.2 million was primarily attributable to the $49.0 million and $8.0 million principal payment in may 2013 and 2012, respectively, on the senior notes issued in may 2008 resulting in lower average debt balance for fiscal 2013, partially offset by lower average investment balances during fiscal 2013.
in fiscal 2015, we expect that net interest expense will be lower than what we incurred during fiscal 2014 due to the $71.0 million principal payment expected in may 2015 on the senior notes issued in may 2008.
other income (expense), net other income (expense), net consists primarily of realized investment gains/losses, exchange rate gains/losses resulting from re-measurement of foreign-currency-denominated receivable and cash balances held by our various reporting entities into their respective functional currencies at period-end market rates, net of the impact of offsetting foreign currency forward contracts, and other non-operating items.
net other expense was $0.2 million in fiscal 2014, compared to net other income of 0.6 million in 2013. the change was primarily attributable to a nonrecurring charge related to our fixed assets balance as well as an increase in foreign currency exchange losses during fiscal 2014.
net other income was $0.6 million in fiscal 2013, compared to net other expense of $0.7 million in 2012. the change was primarily attributable to a decrease in foreign exchange losses, as well as a one-time vendor termination fee during fiscal 2012.
provision for income taxes our effective tax rates were 28.7%, 31.7% and 32.5% in fiscal 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively.
the decrease in our effective tax rate in fiscal 2014 compared to fiscal 2013 was due primarily to the favorable settlement of the fiscal 2010 - 2012 federal irs audits and secondly, due to a higher percentage of revenue in lower taxing jurisdictions.
the decrease in our effective tax rate in fiscal 2013 compared to fiscal 2012 was primarily due to the reenactment of the u.s. federal research and development credit in 2013, as well as the expiration of the u.s. federal research and development credit and a one-time tax impact of a legal entity restructuring charge in 2012.
as of september 30, 2014 the company has reported $49.9 million of unremitted earnings of the international subsidiaries in our consolidated income. u.s. income taxes have not been provided on undistributed earnings of international subsidiaries. it is our intention to reinvest these earnings permanently or to repatriate the earnings only when it is tax efficient to do so. the amount of the unrecognized deferred tax liability depends on judgment required to analyze the withholding tax due, the applicable tax law and related tax treaties, and factual circumstances in effect at the time of any such distribution, therefore, we believe it is not practicable at this time to reliably determine the amount of the unrecognized deferred tax liability related to the company's undistributed earnings. if circumstances change and it becomes apparent that some or all of the undistributed earnings of a subsidiary will be remitted in the next twelve months and income taxes have not been recognized by the parent entity, the parent entity shall accrue as an expense of the current period income taxes attributable to that remittance.

the increase in operating income between fiscal 2014 and 2013 of $0.3 million was primarily attributable to a $45.5 million increase in segment revenues and a $1.6 million decrease in amortization expense, partially offset by a $20.4 million increase in segment operating expenses, a $15.1 million increase in unallocated corporate expenses, a $10.5 million increase in share-based compensation expense and a $0.8 million increase in restructuring and acquisition-related expenses.
at the segment level, the $10.0 million increase in segment operating income was driven by a $28.4 million increase in our applications segment and a $12.0 million increase in our scores segment, partially offset by a $15.1 million increase in unallocated corporate expenses and a $15.3 million decrease in our tools segment.
the $28.4 million increase in applications segment operating income was attributable to a $28.2 million increase in segment revenues and a $0.2 million decrease in segment operating expenses. the increase in segment revenues was primarily attributable to two large multi-year license transactions in fraud solutions and increased transactional and services revenues in customer communication solutions. segment operating income as a percentage of segment revenues for applications increased to 34% from 30% primarily due to fico shifting resources to cloud computing mainly in the tools segment, a reduction in sales workforce as part of our restructuring during the first quarter of our fiscal 2014, as well as increased sales of higher-margin software products.
the $12.0 million increase in scores segment operating income was attributable to a $6.4 million decrease in segment operating expenses and a $5.6 million increase in segment revenues. segment operating income as a percentage of segment revenues for scores was increased to 76% from 72% mainly due to an increase in sales of our higher-margin software products, as well as decreased third-party data cost as a result of favorable terms in a renewed agreement with one credit reporting agency in may 2013.
the $15.3 million decrease in tools segment operating income was attributable primarily to a $27.0 million increase in segment operating expenses, partially offset by an $11.7 million increase in segment revenues. segment operating income as a percentage of segment revenues for tools decreased to 4% from 22% mainly due to an increase in the research and development efforts related to our cloud-based fico® decision management platform as well as our fico® model centraltm solution.
the $15.1 million increase in unallocated corporate expenses was primarily attributable to an increase in incentive cost.
the decrease in operating income between fiscal 2013 and 2012 of $6.8 million was primarily attributable to a $58.1 million increase in segment operating expenses, a $6.6 million increase in amortization expense, a $6.1 million increase in unallocated corporate expenses and a $4.6 million increase in share-based compensation expense, partially offset by a $67.0 million increase in segment revenues and a $1.6 million decrease in restructuring and acquisition-related expenses.
at the segment level, the $2.8 million increase in segment operating income was driven by a $6.7 million increase in our scores segment, a $2.0 million increase in our applications segment and a $0.2 million increase in our tools segment, partially offset by a $6.1 million increase in unallocated corporate expenses.
the $2.0 million increase in applications segment operating income was attributable to a $51.5 million increase in segment revenues, partially offset by a $49.5 million increase in segment operating expenses. the increases in both segment revenues and segment operating expenses were primarily related to our adeptra and cr software acquisitions. segment operating income as a percentage of segment revenues for applications decreased to 30% from 33% mainly due to increased sales of lower-margin products from our adeptra and cr software acquisitions.
the $6.7 million increase in scores segment operating income was attributable to a $5.2 million increase in segment revenues, primarily due to increased revenues generated from our myfico® business-to-consumer services and a $1.5 million decrease in segment operating expenses. segment operating income as a percentage of segment revenues for scores was 72% for fiscal 2013, materially consistent with fiscal 2012.
the $0.2 million increase in tools segment operating income was attributable primarily to a $10.3 million increase in segment revenues, partially offset by a $10.1 million increase in segment operating expenses. the increase in segment revenues was primarily due to an increase of services and software revenues related to our fico® blaze advisor® and fico® model centraltm products. segment operating income as a percentage of segment revenues for tools decreased to 22% from 25% mainly due to an increase in our lower-margin services revenues and third-party software product sales.

capital resources and liquidity outlook as of september 30, 2014, we had $105.1 million in cash and cash equivalents which included $83.8 million held off-shore by our foreign subsidiaries. we believe these balances, as well as available borrowings from our $200 million revolving line of credit and anticipated cash flows from operating activities, will be sufficient to fund our working and other capital requirements as well as the $71.0 million principal payment due in may 2015 on our senior notes issued in may 2008. under our current financing arrangements we have no other significant debt obligations maturing over the next twelve months. additionally, we do not anticipate the need to repatriate any undistributed earnings from our foreign subsidiaries for the foreseeable future.
in the normal course of business, we evaluate the merits of acquiring technology or businesses, or establishing strategic relationships with or investing in these businesses. we may elect to use available cash and cash equivalents to fund such activities in the future. in the event additional needs for cash arise, or if we refinance our existing debt, we may raise additional funds from a combination of sources, including the potential issuance of debt or equity securities. additional financing might not be available on terms favorable to us, or at all. if adequate funds were not available or were not available on acceptable terms, our ability to take advantage of unanticipated opportunities or respond to competitive pressures could be limited.

cash flows from operating activities our primary method for funding operations and growth has been through cash flows generated from operating activities. net cash provided by operating activities totaled $175.0 million in fiscal 2014 compared to $136.1 million in fiscal 2013. the $38.9 million increase was mainly attributable to a $40.4 million increase caused by the timing of receipts and payments in our ordinary course of business, including a $29.2 million increase caused by timing of payment on accrued compensation and employee benefits.
net cash provided by operating activities totaled $136.1 million in fiscal 2013 compared to $129.7 million in fiscal 2012. the $6.4 million increase, despite $1.9 million decrease in net income, was mainly attributable to an increase in non-cash charges to depreciation and amortization, deferred income taxes and share-based compensation, partially offset by a decrease caused by the timing of receipts and payments in our ordinary course of business.
cash flows from investing activities net cash used in investing activities totaled $19.8 million in fiscal 2014 compared to $35.0 million in fiscal 2013. the $15.2 million decrease was primarily attributable to a $25.6 million decrease in net cash used for acquisitions and an $11.6 million decrease in net cash used for purchases of property and equipment, partially offset by a $22.0 million decrease in proceeds from maturities of marketable securities.
net cash used in investing activities totaled $35.0 million in fiscal 2013 compared to $65.7 million in fiscal 2012. the $30.7 million decrease was primarily attributable to a $90.8 million decrease in net cash used for acquisitions, partially offset by a $61.6 million decrease in proceeds from sales and maturities of marketable securities, net of purchases.
cash flows from financing activities net cash used in financing activities totaled $130.4 million in fiscal 2014 compared to $86.6 million in fiscal 2013. the $43.8 million increase was primarily due to a $134.3 million increase in common stock repurchased and a $23.7 million

decrease in cash generated from stock option exercises, partially offset by a $72.7 million increase in proceeds, net of payments from our revolving line of credit and a $41.0 million decrease in payment on our senior notes.
net cash used in financing activities totaled $86.6 million in fiscal 2013 compared to $128.5 million in fiscal 2012. the $41.9 million decrease was primarily due to a $108.3 million decrease in common stock repurchased, partially offset by a $40.5 million decrease in cash generated from stock option exercises. in addition, there was a $26.0 million increase in payment on our senior notes and revolving line of credit, net of proceeds from revolving line of credit.
repurchases of common stock from time to time, we repurchase our common stock in the open market. during fiscal 2014, 2013 and 2012, we expended $214.9 million , $84.9 million and $184.3 million, respectively, in connection with our repurchase of common stock. in august 2012, our board of directors approved an open-ended stock repurchase program to acquire shares of our common stock up to an aggregate cost of $150.0 million in the open market or through negotiated transactions. following the completion of the august 2012 program, our board of directors approved another open-ended stock repurchase program in april 2014 to acquire shares of our common stock up to an aggregate cost of $150.0 million in the open market or through negotiated transactions. following the completion of the april 2014 program, our board of directors approved a new stock repurchase program in august 2014. the new program is open-ended and authorizes repurchases of shares of our common stock up to an aggregate cost of $250.0 million in the open market or in negotiated transactions. as of september 30, 2014, we had $250.0 million remaining under this authorization.
dividends we paid quarterly dividends of two cents per share during each of fiscal 2014, 2013 and 2012. our dividend rate is set by the board of directors on a quarterly basis taking into account a variety of factors, including among others, our operating results and cash flows, general economic and industry conditions, our obligations, changes in applicable tax laws and other factors deemed relevant by the board. although we expect to continue to pay dividends at the current rate, our dividend rate is subject to change from time to time based on the board's business judgment with respect to these and other relevant factors.
revolving line of credit we have a $200 million unsecured revolving line of credit with a syndicate of banks that expires on september 28, 2016. proceeds from the credit facility can be used for working capital and general corporate purposes and may also be used for the refinancing of existing debt, acquisitions, and the repurchase of the company's common stock. interest on amounts borrowed under the credit facility is based on (i) a base rate, which is the greater of (a) the prime rate and (b) the federal funds rate plus 0.50% or (ii) libor plus an applicable margin. the margin on libor borrowings ranges from 1.000% to 1.625% and is determined based on our consolidated leverage ratio. in addition, we must pay utilization fees if borrowings and commitments under the credit facility exceed 50% of the total credit facility commitment, as well as facility fees. the credit facility contains certain restrictive covenants including maintaining a maximum consolidated leverage ratio of 3.0 and a minimum fixed charge ratio of 2.5, and also contains other covenants typical of unsecured facilities. as of september 30, 2014, we had $99.0 million in borrowings outstanding at a weighted average interest rate of 1.285% and were in compliance with all financial covenants under this credit facility.
senior notes in may 2008, we issued $275 million of senior notes in a private placement to a group of institutional investors (the "2008 senior notes"). the 2008 senior notes were issued in four series with maturities ranging from 5 to 10 years. the remaining 2008 senior notes' weighted average interest rate is 7.0% and the weighted average maturity is 9.0 years. in addition, in july 2010, we issued $245 million of senior notes in a private placement to a group of institutional investors (the "2010 senior notes" and, with the 2008 senior notes, the "senior notes"). the 2010 senior notes were issued in four series with maturities ranging from 6 to 10 years. the 2010 senior notes' weighted average interest rate is 5.2% and the weighted average maturity is 8.0 years. the senior notes are subject to certain restrictive covenants that are substantially similar to those in the credit agreement for the revolving credit facility, including maintenance of consolidated leverage and fixed charge coverage ratios. the purchase agreements for the senior notes also include covenants typical of unsecured facilities. as of september 30, 2014 we were in compliance with all financial covenants under these purchase agreements.

(3)   represents unrecognized tax benefits related to uncertain tax positions. as we are not able to reasonably estimate the timing of the payments or the amount by which the liability will increase or decrease over time, the related balances have not been reflected in the section of the table showing payment by fiscal year.
off-balance sheet arrangements we do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future material effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures, or capital resources.
critical accounting policies and estimates we prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with u.s. generally accepted accounting principles. these accounting principles require management to make certain judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. we periodically evaluate our estimates including those relating to revenue recognition, goodwill and other intangible assets resulting from business acquisitions, share-based compensation, income taxes and contingencies and litigation. we base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable based on the specific circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of certain assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. actual results may differ from these estimates.
we believe the following critical accounting policies involve the most significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements:
revenue recognition software licenses software license fee revenue is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, software is made available to our customers, the fee is fixed or determinable and collection is probable. the determination of whether fees are fixed or determinable and collection is probable involves the use of assumptions. if at the outset of an arrangement we determine that the arrangement fee is not fixed or determinable, revenue is deferred until the arrangement fee becomes fixed or determinable, assuming all other revenue recognition criteria have been met. if at the outset of an arrangement we determine that collectability is not probable, revenue is deferred until the earlier of when collectability becomes probable or the receipt of payment. if there is uncertainty as to the customer's acceptance of our deliverables, revenue is not recognized until the earlier of receipt of customer acceptance, expiration of the acceptance period, or when we can demonstrate we meet the acceptance criteria. we evaluate contract terms and customer information to ensure that these criteria are met prior to our recognition of license fee revenue.
we use the residual method to recognize revenue when a software arrangement includes one or more elements to be delivered at a future date provided the following criteria are met: (i) vendor-specific objective evidence ("vsoe") of the fair value does not exist for one or more of the delivered items but exists for all undelivered elements, (ii) all other applicable
39
revenue recognition criteria are met and (iii) the fair value of all of the undelivered elements is less than the arrangement fee. vsoe of fair value is based on the normal pricing practices for those products and services when sold separately by us and customer renewal rates for post-contract customer support services. under the residual method, the fair value of the undelivered elements is deferred and the remaining portion of the arrangement fee is recognized as revenue. if evidence of the fair value of one or more undelivered elements does not exist, the revenue is deferred and recognized when delivery of those elements occurs or when fair value can be established. changes to the elements in a software arrangement, the ability to identify vsoe for those elements, the fair value of the respective elements, and change to a product's estimated life cycle could materially impact the amount of earned and unearned revenue.
revenues from post-contract customer support services, such as software maintenance, are recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the support period. the majority of our software maintenance agreements provide technical support as well as unspecified software product upgrades and releases when and if made available by us during the term of the support period.
transactional-based revenues transactional-based revenue is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, fees are fixed or determinable, and collection is probable. revenues from our credit scoring, data processing, data management and internet delivery services are recognized as these services are performed. revenues from transactional or unit-based license fees under software license arrangements, network service and internally-hosted software agreements are recognized based on minimum contractual amounts or on system usage that exceeds minimum contractual amounts. certain of our transactional-based revenues are based on transaction or active account volumes as reported by our clients. in instances where volumes are reported to us in arrears, we estimate volumes based on preliminary customer transaction information or average actual reported volumes for an immediate trailing period. differences between our estimates and actual final volumes reported are recorded in the period in which actual volumes are reported. we have not experienced significant variances between our estimates and actual reported volumes in the past and anticipate that we will be able to continue to make reasonable estimates in the future. if for some reason we were unable to reasonably estimate transaction volumes in the future, revenue may be deferred until actual customer data is received, and this could have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations.
consulting services we provide consulting, training, model development and software integration services under both hourly-based time and materials and fixed-priced contracts. revenues from these services are generally recognized as the services are performed. for fixed-price service contracts, we use a proportionate performance model with hours as the input method of attribution to determine progress towards completion, with consideration also given to output measures, such as contract milestones, when applicable. in such instances, management is required to estimate the total estimated hours of the project. adjustments to estimates are made in the period in which the facts requiring such revisions become known and, accordingly, recognized revenues and profits are subject to revisions as the contract progresses to completion. estimated losses, if any, are recorded in the period in which current estimates of total contract revenue and contract costs indicate a loss. if substantive uncertainty related to customer acceptance of services exists, we defer the associated revenue until the contract is completed. we have not experienced significant variances between our estimates and actual hours in the past and anticipate that we will be able to continue to make reasonable estimates in the future. if for some reason we are unable to accurately estimate the input measures, revenue would be deferred until the contract is complete, and this could have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations.
services that are sold in connection with software license arrangements generally qualify for separate accounting from the license element because they do not involve significant production, modification or customization of our products and are not otherwise considered to be essential to the functionality of our software. in arrangements where the professional services do not qualify for separate accounting from the license element, the combined software license and professional services revenue are recognized based on contract accounting using either the percentage-of-completion or completed-contract method.
hosting services we are an application service provider ("asp"), where we provide hosting services that allow customers access to software that resides on our servers. the asp model typically includes an up-front fee and a monthly commitment from the customer that commences upon completion of the implementation through the remainder of the customer life. the up-front fee is the initial setup fee, or the implementation fee. the monthly commitment includes, but is not limited to, a fixed monthly fee or a transactional fee based on system usage that exceeds monthly minimums. revenue is recognized from asp transactions when there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement, the service has been provided to the customer, the amount of fees is fixed or determinable and the collection of the company's fees is probable. we do not view the activities of signing the contract or
40
providing initial setup services as discrete earnings events. revenue is typically deferred until the date the customer commences use of our services, at which point the up-front fees are recognized ratably over the expected life of the customer relationship. asp transactional fees are recorded monthly as earned.
multiple-deliverable arrangements including non-software when we enter into a multiple-deliverable arrangement that includes non-software, each deliverable is accounted for as a separate unit of accounting if the following criteria are met: (i) the delivered item or items have value to the customer on a standalone basis and (ii) for an arrangement that includes a general right of return relative to the delivered item(s), delivery or performance of the undelivered item(s) is considered probable and substantially in our control. we consider a deliverable to have standalone value if we sell this item separately or if the item is sold by another vendor or could be resold by the customer; for example, we conclude professional services offered along with our saas subscription services typically have standalone value using this criteria. further, our revenue arrangements generally do not include a general right of return relative to delivered products. revenue for multiple element arrangements is allocated to the software and non-software deliverables based on a relative selling price. we use vsoe in our allocation of arrangement consideration when it is available. we define vsoe as a median price of recent standalone transactions that are priced within a narrow range, as defined by us. if a product or service is seldom sold separately, it is unlikely that we can determine vsoe. in circumstances when vsoe does not exist, we then assess whether we can obtain third-party evidence ("tpe") of the selling price. it may be difficult for us to obtain sufficient information on competitor pricing to substantiate tpe and therefore we may not always be able to use tpe. when we are unable to establish selling price using vsoe or tpe, we use estimated selling price ("esp") in our allocation of arrangement consideration. the objective of esp is to determine the price at which we would transact if the product or service were sold by us on a standalone basis. our determination of esp involves weighting several factors based on the specific facts and circumstances of each arrangement. the factors include, but are not limited to, geographies, market conditions, gross margin objectives, pricing practices and controls, customer segment pricing strategies and the product lifecycle.
gross vs. net revenue reporting we apply accounting guidance to determine whether we report revenue for certain transactions based upon the gross amount billed to the customer, or the net amount retained by us. in accordance with the guidance we record revenue on a gross basis for sales in which we have acted as the principal and on a net basis for those sales in which we have in substance acted as an agent or broker in the transaction.
business combinations accounting for our acquisitions requires us to recognize, separately from goodwill, the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed at their acquisition-date fair values. goodwill as of the acquisition date is measured as the excess of consideration transferred and the net of the acquisition-date fair values of the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed. while we use our best estimates and assumptions to accurately value assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date, our estimates are inherently uncertain and subject to refinement. as a result, during the measurement period, which may be up to one year from the acquisition date, we record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed with the corresponding offset to goodwill. upon the conclusion of the measurement period or final determination of the values of assets acquired or liabilities assumed, whichever comes first, any subsequent adjustments are recorded to our consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income.
accounting for business combinations requires our management to make significant estimates and assumptions, especially at the acquisition date, including our estimates for intangible assets, contractual obligations assumed, pre-acquisition contingencies and contingent consideration, where applicable. if we cannot reasonably determine the fair value of a pre-acquisition contingency (non-income tax related) by the end of the measurement period, we will recognize an asset or a liability for such pre-acquisition contingency if: (i) it is probable that an asset existed or a liability had been incurred at the acquisition date and (ii) the amount of the asset or liability can be reasonably estimated. although we believe the assumptions and estimates we have made in the past have been reasonable and appropriate, they are based in part on historical experience and information obtained from the management of the acquired companies and are inherently uncertain. subsequent to the measurement period, changes in our estimates of such contingencies will affect earnings and could have a material effect on our results of operations and financial position.
examples of critical estimates in valuing certain of the intangible assets we have acquired include but are not limited to: (i) future expected cash flows from software license sales, support agreements, consulting contracts, other customer contracts and acquired developed technologies and patents; (ii) expected costs to develop the in-process research and development into commercially viable products and estimated cash flows from the projects when completed, and; (iii) the acquired company's brand and competitive position, as well as assumptions about the period of time the acquired brand will continue to be used in
41
the combined company's product portfolio. unanticipated events and circumstances may occur that may affect the accuracy or validity of such assumptions, estimates or actual results.
in addition, uncertain tax positions and tax related valuation allowances assumed in connection with a business combination are initially estimated as of the acquisition date. we reevaluate these items quarterly based upon facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date with any adjustments to our preliminary estimates being recorded to goodwill provided that we are within the measurement period. subsequent to the measurement period or our final determination of the tax allowance's or contingency's estimated value, whichever comes first, changes to these uncertain tax positions and tax-related valuation allowances will affect our provision for income taxes in our consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income and could have a material impact on our results of operations and financial position.
valuation of goodwill and other intangible assets - impairment assessment our business acquisitions typically result in the recognition of goodwill and other intangible assets, which affects the amount of current and future period charges and amortization expense. goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired, including identified intangible assets, in connection with our business combinations. we amortize our finite-lived intangible assets over the estimated useful lives. goodwill is not amortized, but is assessed at least annually for impairment.
the determination of the value of these components of a business combination, as well as associated asset useful lives, requires management to make various estimates and assumptions. critical estimates in valuing certain of the intangible assets include but are not limited to: future expected cash flows from product sales and services, maintenance agreements, consulting contracts, customer contracts, and acquired developed technologies and patents or trademarks; the acquired company's brand awareness and market position, as well as assumptions about the period of time the acquired products and services will continue to be used in our product portfolio; and discount rates. management's estimates of fair value and useful lives are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable. estimates using different assumptions, or unanticipated events and circumstances could produce significantly different results.
we assess potential impairments of our intangible assets when there is evidence that events and circumstances related to our financial performance and economic environment indicate the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable. when impairment indicators are identified with respect to our previously recorded intangible assets with finite useful lives, we test for impairment using undiscounted cash flows. if such tests indicate impairment, then we measure and record the impairment as the difference between the carrying value of the asset and the fair value of the asset. significant management judgment is required in forecasting future operating results used in the preparation of the projected cash flows. should different conditions prevail, material write downs of net intangible assets could occur. we periodically review the estimated remaining useful lives of our acquired intangible assets. a reduction in our estimate of remaining useful lives, if any, could result in increased annual amortization expense in future periods.
we test goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit levels, which we have determined are the same as our reportable segments, at least annually during the fourth quarter of each fiscal year. the timing and frequency of our goodwill impairment test is based on an ongoing assessment of events and circumstances that would be an indicator of potential impairment of a reporting unit, with the fair value below its carrying value. the first step of the goodwill impairment test is a comparison of the fair value of a reporting unit to its carrying value. we estimate the fair values of our reporting units using a weighted combination of discounted cash flow valuation model (known as the income approach) and a comparison of our reporting units to guideline publicly-traded companies (known as the market approach). these methods require estimates of our future revenues, profits, capital expenditures, working capital, costs of capital and other relevant factors, as well as selecting appropriate guideline publicly-traded companies for each reporting unit. we evaluate historical trends, current budgets, operating plans, industry data, and other relevant factors when estimating these amounts. using assumptions that are different from those used in our estimates, but in each case reasonable, could produce significantly different results and materially affect the determination of fair value and/or goodwill impairment for each reporting unit. for example, if the economic environment impacts our forecasts beyond what we have anticipated, it could cause the fair value of a reporting unit to fall below its respective carrying value.
the key assumptions that require significant management judgment for the income approach include revenue growth rates and weighted average cost of capital. in our analysis, revenue growth rates were primarily based on third-party studies of industry growth rates for each of our reporting units. within each reporting unit, management refined these estimates based on their knowledge of the product, the needs of our customers and expected market opportunity. the weighted average cost of capital was determined based on publicly available data such as the long-term yield on u.s. treasury bonds, the expected rate of return on high quality bonds and the returns and betas of various equity instruments. as it relates to the market approach, there
42
is less management judgment in determining the fair value of our reporting units other than selecting which guideline publicly-traded companies are included in our peer group.
in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014 we performed our annual goodwill impairment test. in step one of that test we compared the estimated fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value. the estimated fair value of each of our reporting units substantially exceeded its respective carrying value in fiscal 2014, indicating the underlying goodwill of each reporting unit was not impaired as of our most recent testing date. accordingly, we were not required to complete the second step of the goodwill impairment test and recorded no goodwill impairment charges for the twelve months ended september 30, 2014.
as discussed above, estimates of fair value for all of our reporting units can be affected by a variety of external and internal factors. we believe that the assumptions and estimates utilized were appropriate based on the information available to management. the timing and recognition of impairment losses by us in the future, if any, may be highly dependent upon our estimates and assumptions.
share-based compensation we measure stock-based compensation cost at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and recognize it as expense, net of estimated forfeitures, over the vesting or service period, as applicable, of the stock award (generally three to four years). see note 14 for further discussion of our share-based employee benefit plans.
income taxes we estimate our income taxes based on the various jurisdictions where we conduct business, which involves significant judgment in determining our income tax provision. we estimate our current tax liability using currently enacted tax rates and laws and assess temporary differences that result from differing treatments of certain items for tax and accounting purposes. these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities recorded on our balance sheet using the currently enacted tax rates and laws that will apply to taxable income for the years in which those tax assets are expected to be realized or settled. we then assess the likelihood our deferred tax assets will be realized and to the extent we believe realization is not likely, we establish a valuation allowance. when we establish a valuation allowance or increase this allowance in an accounting period, we record a corresponding income tax expense in our consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income. in assessing the need for the valuation allowance, we consider future taxable income in the jurisdictions we operate; an analysis of our deferred tax assets and the periods over which they will be realizable; and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies. an increase in the valuation allowance would have an adverse impact, which could be material, on our income tax provision and net income in the period in which we record the increase.
we recognize and measure benefits for uncertain tax positions using a two-step approach. the first step is to evaluate the tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return by determining if the technical merits of the tax position indicate it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained upon audit, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes. for tax positions more likely than not of being sustained upon audit, the second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount more than 50% likely of being realized upon settlement. significant judgment is required to evaluate uncertain tax positions and they are evaluated on a quarterly basis. our evaluations are based upon a number of factors, including changes in facts or circumstances, changes in tax law, correspondence with tax authorities during the course of audits and effective settlement of audit issues. changes in the recognition or measurement of uncertain tax positions could result in material increases or decreases in our income tax expense in the period in which we make the change, which could have a material impact on our effective tax rate and operating results.
a description of our accounting policies associated with tax-related contingencies and valuation allowances assumed as part of a business combination is provided under "business combinations" above.
contingencies and litigation we are subject to various proceedings, lawsuits and claims relating to products and services, technology, labor, shareholder and other matters. we are required to assess the likelihood of any adverse outcomes and the potential range of probable losses in these matters. if the potential loss is considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated, we accrue a liability for the estimated loss. if the potential loss is considered less than probable or the amount cannot be reasonably estimated, disclosure of the matter is considered. the amount of loss accrual or disclosure, if any, is determined after analysis of each matter, and is subject to adjustment if warranted by new developments or revised strategies. due to uncertainties related to these matters, accruals or disclosures are based on the best information available at the time. significant judgment is required in both the assessment of likelihood and in the determination of a range of potential losses. revisions in the estimates of the potential liabilities could have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or consolidated results of operations.

new accounting pronouncements recently issued or adopted in july 2013, the financial accounting standards board (fasb) issued asu no. 2013-11, "presentation of an unrecognized tax benefit when a net operating loss carryforward, a similar tax loss, or a tax credit carryforward exists" ("asu 2013-11"). asu 2013-11 provides guidance for presentation of an unrecognized tax benefit, or a portion of an unrecognized tax benefit. asu 2013-11 provides that a benefit should be presented in the financial statements as a reduction to a deferred tax asset for a net operating loss carryforward, a similar tax loss, or a tax credit carryforward, except as follows. to the extent a net operating loss carryforward, a similar tax loss, or a tax credit carryforward is not available at the reporting date under the tax law of the applicable jurisdiction to settle any additional income taxes that would result from the disallowance of a tax position or the tax law of the applicable jurisdiction does not require the entity to use, and the entity does not intend to use, the deferred tax asset for such purpose, the unrecognized tax benefit should be presented in the financial statements as a liability and should not be combined with deferred tax assets. asu 2013-11 is effective for fiscal years and interim periods within those years, beginning on or after december 15, 2013, which means it will be effective for our fiscal year beginning october 1, 2014. we do not believe that adoption of asu 2013-11 will have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements.
in may 2014, the fasb issued asu no. 2014-09, "revenue from contracts with customers (topic 606)" ("asu 2014-09"). asu 2014-09 requires an entity to recognize the amount of revenue to which it expects to be entitled for the transfer of promised goods or services to customers. asu 2014-09 will replace most existing revenue recognition guidance in u.s. generally accepted accounting principles when it becomes effective and permits the use of either the retrospective or cumulative effect transition method. the guidance also requires additional disclosure about the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from customer contracts. early adoption is not permitted. asu 2014-09 is effective for fiscal years and interim periods within those years, beginning on or after december 15, 2016, which means it will be effective for our fiscal year beginning october 1, 2017. we have not yet selected a transition method and we are currently evaluating the impact that the updated standard will have on our consolidated financial statements.

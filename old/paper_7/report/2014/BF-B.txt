item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (md&a) is intended to help the reader understand brown-forman, our operations, and our current business environment. md&a is provided as a supplement to - and should be read in conjunction with - our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes contained in "item 8. financial statements and supplementary data."
volume and depletions when discussing volume, unless otherwise specified, we refer to "depletions," a term commonly used in the beverage alcohol industry. we define "depletions" as either (a) our shipments directly to retailers or wholesalers, or (b) shipments from our third-party distributor customers to retailers and wholesalers. because we generally record revenues when we ship our products to our customers, our reported sales for a period do not necessarily reflect actual consumer purchases during that period. we believe that our depletions measure volume in a way that more closely reflects consumer demand than our shipments to third-party distributor customers do.
volume is discussed on a nine-liter equivalent unit basis (nine-liter cases) unless otherwise specified. at times, we use a "drinks-equivalent" measure for volume when comparing single-serve rtd or ready-to-pour (rtp) brands to a parent spirits brand. "drinks-equivalent" depletions are rtd and rtp nine-liter cases converted to nine-liter cases of a parent brand on the basis of the number of drinks in one nine-liter case of the parent brand. to convert rtd volumes from a nine-liter case basis to a drinks-equivalent nine-liter case basis, rtd nine-liter case volumes are divided by 10, while rtp nine-liter case volumes are divided by 5.
non-gaap financial measures we use certain financial measures in this report that are not measures of financial performance under gaap. these non-gaap measures, which are defined below, should be viewed as supplements to (not substitutes for) our results of operations and other measures reported under gaap. the non-gaap measures we use in this report may not be defined and calculated by other companies in the same manner.
we present changes in certain income statement line-items that are adjusted to an "underlying" basis, which we believe assists in understanding both our performance from period to period on a consistent basis, and the trends of our business. non-gaap "underlying" measures include changes in (a) underlying net sales, (b) underlying cost of sales, (c) underlying gross profit, (d) underlying advertising expenses, (e) underlying selling, general and administrative expenses and (f) underlying operating income. to calculate each of these measures, we adjust for (a) foreign currency exchange, (b) if applicable, estimated net changes in trade inventories, and (c) the absence of hopland-based wine business. these adjustments are defined below.
•   "foreign exchange." we calculate the percentage change in our income statement line-items in accordance with gaap and adjust to exclude the cost or benefit of currency fluctuations. adjusting for foreign exchange allows us to understand our business on a constant dollar basis, as fluctuations in exchange rates can distort the underlying trend both positively and negatively. (in this report, "dollar" always means the u.s. dollar unless clearly denoted otherwise.) to eliminate the effect of foreign exchange fluctuations when comparing across periods, we translate current year results at prior-year rates.
•   "estimated net change in trade inventories" refers to the estimated net effect of changes in distributor inventories on changes in our measures. for each period being compared, we estimate the effect of distributor inventory changes on our results using depletion information provided to us by our distributors. we believe that this adjustment reduces the effect of varying levels of distributor inventories on changes in our measures and allows to understand better our underlying results and trends.
•   "absence of hopland-based wine business" refers to the exclusion of results from our divested hopland, california-based wine business, which we sold to viña concha y toro s.a in april 2011. included in this sale were the fetzer winery, bottling facility, and vineyards, as well as the fetzer brand and other hopland, california-based wines, including bonterra, little black dress, jekel, five rivers, bel arbor, coldwater creek, and sanctuary. although we sold these brands in april 2011, we retained them in our portfolio as agency brands through december 31, 2011. this adjustment allows for the comparison of our performance in prior periods without this business.
management uses "underlying" measures of performance to assist it in comparing and measuring our performance from period to period on a consistent basis, and in comparing our performance to that of our competitors. we also use underlying measures as metrics of management incentive compensation calculations. management also uses underlying measures in its planning and forecasting and in communications with the board of directors, stockholders, analysts and investors concerning our financial performance. we have provided reconciliations of the non-gaap measures adjusted to an "underlying" basis to their
22
nearest gaap measures in the tables below under "results of operations - year-over-year comparisons" and have consistently applied the adjustments within our reconciliations in arriving at each non-gaap measure.
we also use the following additional non-gaap financial measures:
"net debt" which is a non-gaap measure that refers to the sum of (a) long-term debt, (b) the current portion of long-term debt, and (c) short-term borrowings, less (d) cash and cash equivalents. management uses net debt as an additional measure of liquidity.
"return on average invested capital" refers to the sum of net income and after-tax interest expense, divided by average invested capital. average invested capital equals assets less liabilities, excluding interest-bearing debt and is calculated using the average of the most recent 13 month-end balances. after-tax interest expense equals interest expense multiplied by one minus our effective tax rate. we consider return on average invested capital to be a meaningful indicator of how effectively and efficiently we use invested capital in our business.

executive summary overview over the past several years, including fiscal 2014, we have made progress toward realizing the ambitions of our long-term strategy, which was first set forth in fiscal 2010 and has evolved along with our business since then. here is a discussion of recent developments:
•   we have further developed the jack daniel's trademark through innovations designed to create new demand for products from the world's foremost maker of american whiskey. these efforts resulted in the successful launch of jack daniel's tennessee honey and, more recently, in a series of ultra-premium-priced line extensions. at the same time, we have invested steadily in our core jack daniel's tennessee whiskey brand to drive its growth broadly around the world and to support our price increases during both fiscal 2013 and 2014.
we have been working to increase our production capacity for the jack daniel's family of brands so that we can satisfy expected future demand. in fiscal 2014, we completed construction of the jack daniel cooperage in decatur, alabama. we believe that we were already the largest maker of new whiskey barrels in the world before the new cooperage significantly added to our capacity. we believe that our ownership of new whiskey barrel manufacturing facilities is unique among our competitors, and that our control over this critical input to the whiskey-making process gives us a competitive advantage. we announced a major expansion of our distilling capacity last august, and we expect to complete construction of the new distillery on our property in lynchburg, tennessee during calendar 2015.
•   the recent growth of the jack daniel's family of brands is the most important measure of our progress toward becoming a global leader in whiskey. in addition, the growth of woodford reserve has also helped us move forward on this ambition, as this super-premium brand grew volume at a compound annual rate of more than 20% from fiscal 2010 to fiscal 2014 - more than doubling its volume and surpassing 300,000 nine-liter cases in april 2014. in june 2013, we announced a more than $35 million expansion at our woodford reserve distillery to support our expected growth. also during fiscal 2014, we completed a renovation of our visitors' center at the woodford reserve distillery to better serve the large and growing number of brand lovers who visit our distillery annually.
•   we divested our hopland-based wine brands in 2011, leaving us with a portfolio primarily focused on spirits. since then, we have pursued growth of our spirits portfolio mostly through innovation. from fiscal 2010 through fiscal 2014, we launched more than twice as many line extensions and new products as we launched in the seven years before 2010. not all of these have been or are expected to be successful, and some have been discontinued. but, in addition to jack daniel's tennessee honey, other successes include: southern comfort lime (introduced in fiscal 2011), woodford reserve double oaked (fiscal 2012) and jack daniel's winter jack (fiscal 2012). in april 2014, we began testing jack daniel's tennessee fire in three markets in the united states, and - though it is too early to assess results - we are encouraged about the potential for this most recent innovation from jack daniel's.
•   since 2010, we have pursued international growth in our larger, developed markets and with increasing focus in the emerging world. our most visible progress has been the evolution of our route-to-consumer in several key markets. we set up new distribution companies in three of our current top ten countries (germany, france, and turkey) and also in brazil, a market that we believe is among our most promising long-term growth opportunities. we have added substantially to our employee base outside the united states, mostly in markets where we evolved our route-to-consumer.
•   over the past five years, our capital deployment initiatives have been focused on (1) enabling the expected future growth of our existing businesses through investments in our production capacity (discussed above) and (2) returning cash to our shareholders. we have not made any material acquisitions during that time. from fiscal 2010 through 2014, we have returned over $2.5 billion to our shareholders through $988 million in regular quarterly dividends, $998 million in two special dividends, and $555 million through share repurchases.

2see "non-gaap financial measures" above for details on our use of "return on average invested capital," including how this measure is calculated and the reasons why we think this information is useful to readers.
in fiscal 2014 compared to fiscal 2013, we grew our underlying net sales by 6% (4% reported), increased underlying operating income by 11% (8% reported), and delivered an 11% increase in diluted earnings per share. we improved our margins in fiscal 2014, as we added 100 basis points to our gross margin and 90 basis points to our operating margin. these operating results were driven largely by our american whiskey portfolio, led by the jack daniel's family of brands, as many of our markets benefited from favorable category trends. our net sales growth was balanced geographically, as emerging markets, developed international markets, and the united states all made positive contributions. our return on average invested capital was essentially unchanged, even as we invested a record $126 million in fiscal 2014 in our capacity expansion projects and increased working capital related to our maturing whiskey inventory. in fiscal 2014, we returned $280 million in cash to our shareholders through dividend payments of $233 million and share repurchases of $47 million, while maintaining investment-grade credit ratings. we accomplished this while strengthening our balance sheet, reducing net debt by approximately $230 million to approximately $568 million as of april 30, 2014.
outlook looking ahead to fiscal 2015, we are optimistic about our prospects for continued net sales and operating income growth, and we expect to make further progress toward our strategic ambitions. we describe below the trends, developments, and uncertainties that we expect to affect our business.
•   favorable american whiskey trends. we believe that the market for american whiskey is growing faster than total distilled spirits globally and that premium american whiskey is among the best-performing components of the broader whiskey category. we face strong competition, and the size of the opportunity is bringing new entrants to the market. even so, we believe that our whiskey brands are poised to benefit from this trend, including jack daniel's tennessee whiskey and woodford reserve. furthermore, we believe that we are well-positioned to access emerging growth opportunities driven by consumer trends affecting the category, which include increased interest in flavored whiskeys and in craft whiskeys. we believe that we can benefit from these trends with our existing portfolio of american whiskeys, which includes, among others, jack daniel's tennessee honey, our highly successful flavored whiskey, and old forester, the world's
26
first bottled bourbon and a brand of distinctive character that savvy consumers are rediscovering. in addition, we expect to bring new products and line extensions to market when our assessment of opportunity supports it.
•   uncertain reaction to our pricing plans. our operating results have benefited from price increases for several of our brands, including, most importantly, jack daniel's tennessee whiskey, during fiscal years 2013 and 2014. higher pricing has contributed strongly to net sales growth, gross margin improvement, and operating profit improvement over the past two years. looking ahead, we believe that the environment remains suitable in many markets for us to increase prices. we plan to increase prices in fiscal 2015, but not as much as in fiscal years 2013 and 2014. in the united states, we expect that higher volumes will result from smaller price increases compared to fiscal years 2013 and 2014. overall, we believe that our balanced approach to pricing will continue to support net sales growth, but we are unsure how our customers and consumers will react - especially in those markets where we have increased prices recently. we may need to adjust prices if consumers react negatively or net sales growth is adversely affected.
•   impact of owned distribution operations in france. after more than a year of planning, establishing an appropriate infrastructure, and hiring about 70 new employees, we started operating our own distribution company in france in january 2014. our fiscal 2014 results reflected a negative effect on our diluted earnings per share of about $0.06 attributed to our distributor's full destocking in connection with transition of distribution to us. we present details about france in "fiscal 2014 market highlights" below. in fiscal 2015, we expect that our sales growth rate will benefit somewhat from our higher prices as we now sell directly to the trade (formerly, our prices were lower to allow for a third-party distributor's profit margin). correspondingly, our cost of sales will increase, reflecting in-market logistics expenses we now bear, and our sg&amp;a expenses will be higher due to the direct costs of our expanded team and related, higher, on-going administrative costs. we expect that the net effect will be positive and that our gross margin and operating margin will benefit to an extent.
•   uncertain impact of excise taxes and government regulations restricting trade in spirits and wine. from time to time, we face increases in excise taxes or duties on spirits, and we periodically face other regulatory measures that either restrict our ability to sell and market our brands responsibly or raise the cost of our doing so. in fiscal 2015, we are aware of several enacted (or proposed and likely-to-be-enacted) excise tax increases. whenever practicable, we increase our prices to the extent of those tax increases. we do not believe that any one known or expected excise tax increase will have a significant negative effect on our results, nor do we expect that they collectively will. but because excise tax increases can lead to inflation in consumer prices, the cumulative effect over time in a given market could soften demand for our products. for example, excise taxes increased 15% in poland in january 2014, and we believe that this development could negatively affect consumer demand and our results there.
•   emerging-market uncertainty. during fiscal 2014, we grew net sales in emerging markets, led by the jack daniel's family of brands, while our competition reported generally negative circumstances and results in emerging markets, particularly in china. we experienced challenges in our largest emerging market, mexico, but, collectively, our emerging markets have grown net sales consistently and at higher rates than our developed markets in recent years. we expect this to continue, but we are cautious about our growth outlook given the geopolitical uncertainty related to russia and ukraine. these two countries, and more broadly the emerging markets in eastern europe and central asia, have been important to our emerging markets net sales growth in recent years, including in fiscal 2014.
we believe that we are well-positioned to take advantage of the opportunities and to address the challenges related to the trends and uncertainties noted above. however, we may not succeed in taking full advantage of these opportunities, and any of these challenges could have a material adverse effect on our business.

1see "non-gaap financial measures" above for details on our use of "underlying change" in net sales, including how this measure is calculated and the reasons why we think this information is useful to readers.
the united states, our largest and most important market, accounted for 41% of our reported net sales in both fiscal 2014 and fiscal 2013. in fiscal 2014, net sales increased 4%, driven by the jack daniel's family of brands and woodford reserve. higher pricing on jack daniel's tennessee whiskey was the most significant overall contributor to net sales growth in the united states, while higher volumes for jack daniel's tennessee honey, woodford reserve, and gentleman jack were also key contributors to our net sales growth there.
europe accounted for 32% of our net sales in fiscal 2014, increasing from 30% in fiscal 2013. for fiscal 2014, reported net sales in europe were up 10%. after adjusting for the positive effect of a weaker dollar and the estimated reduction in net trade inventories (mostly attributed to our route-to-consumer change in france in fiscal 2014), underlying net sales in europe were up 11%. our underlying net sales growth in europe was broad-based and included gains in all of our largest markets, including the united kingdom, germany, poland, france, russia, and turkey. reported net sales in france declined as a result of decreased shipments corresponding to our former distributor's inventory reduction ahead of our route-to-consumer change. (see "outlook - impact of owned distribution operations in france" above.) we believe that our underlying net sales in europe grew largely because of higher consumer demand for our brands in most of europe. but in poland, our growth was partly driven by timing of our sales to wholesale and retail trade customers who, we believe, increased their inventories in advance of the january 2014 excise tax hike and our related price increase. we believe that customer inventories in poland remained somewhat elevated at the end of fiscal 2014.
australia accounted for 12% of our net sales in fiscal 2014, down from 14% in fiscal 2013. for fiscal 2014, reported net sales were down 8%, but underlying net sales were up 2% after adjusting for the negative effect of a weaker australian dollar.
28
underlying net sales growth was driven primarily by net sales of a third-party brand that we began representing as sales agent in australia during fiscal 2014, and volume increases for both jack daniel's rtds and jack daniel's 1907 whiskey, a standard-priced line extension sold exclusively in australia. net sales growth in australia was partially offset by lower volumes and pricing for jack daniel's tennessee honey, which suffered from weak consumer acceptance in fiscal 2014 in addition to a difficult comparison to its launch in this market last year.
net sales for our other markets constituted 15% of our total net sales in both fiscal 2014 and fiscal 2013. reported net sales grew 4% in fiscal 2014 and 6% on an underlying basis after adjusting for the negative effect of a stronger u.s. dollar and the positive effect of an estimated net increase in trade inventories. the increase in underlying net sales was driven by broad growth across most of our other markets, but primarily by brazil, japan, china, markets in southeast asia, and markets in africa. net sales declines in mexico and a few other markets partially offset these gains. in mexico, fiscal 2014 net sales declined because of (a) excess inventory of new mix and herradura held by our wholesale customers as we entered the fiscal year, thus reducing their demand in fiscal 2014, and (b) a difficult competitive environment related to the tequila category, exacerbated by a generally challenging economic environment.

2in addition to the brands separately listed here, the jack daniel's family of brands includes gentleman jack, jack daniel's single barrel, jack daniel's sinatratm select, jack daniel's no. 27 gold tennessee whiskey, jack daniel's 1907 tennessee whiskey, and jack daniel's tennessee rye whiskeys.
3jack daniel's rtd and rtp products include all rtd line extensions of jack daniel's, such as jack daniel's & cola, jack daniel's & diet cola, jack & ginger, jack daniel's country cocktails, gentleman jack & cola, and the seasonal jack daniel's winter jack rtp.
4includes chambord liqueur and flavored vodka, herradura, sonoma-cutrer, tuaca, and woodford reserve.
in fiscal 2014, the jack daniel's family of brands grew volumes 6% globally to nearly 14 million drinks-equivalent nine-liter cases across all expressions of the brand. reported net sales grew 6% while underlying net sales increased 8%, after adjusting for the negative effects of both foreign exchange and an estimated net decrease in trade inventories. in fiscal 2014, the jack daniel's family of brands grew at a faster rate than jack daniel's tennessee whiskey, primarily because of the contributions to growth made by our innovations, and most significantly due to the introduction of jack daniel's tennessee honey in several international markets as well as its continued growth in the united states and the united kingdom.
jack daniel's tennessee whiskey (jdtw) generates a significant percentage of our total net sales, and it is our top priority. as the world's fourth largest premium spirits brand measured by both volume and retail value, we believe that jdtw is one of the most valuable spirits brands in the world. jdtw grew volume for the 22nd consecutive year and outpaced the average volume growth of the top 25 premium spirits brands1 during calendar 2013. that achievement reinforces our belief in the brand's long-term appeal and sustainable growth potential. jdtw grew volumes 4% globally in fiscal 2014, an acceleration compared to its
30
growth rate of 3% in fiscal 2013, despite price increases in many markets in fiscal 2014. jdtw grew reported net sales 5% and underlying net sales 6%, at a faster rate than volume gains owing to price increases and favorable mix. the brand grew strongly in emerging markets, as exemplified by the double-digit volume growth in three of the four emerging markets among our top ten listed above: volume in russia increased 28%; mexico, 16%; and turkey, 11%. in the united states, volume decreased 1% but net sales grew due to price increases.
late in fiscal 2011, we introduced jack daniel's tennessee honey (jdth) in the united states. since then, we have introduced the brand in many other countries around the world, and jdth has become a significant contributor to our net sales growth. in fiscal 2014, the brand surpassed the 1 million cases milestone to become, we believe, one of only 20 brands selling more than 1 million cases in a 12-month period at an average retail value of of $25 or higher for a 750ml bottle. in fiscal 2014, jdth grew volumes by double digits in the united states, its largest market, and was named to impact's "hot brands" list2 for a third consecutive year. in the united kingdom, jdth's second largest market, the brand grew volumes nearly 50% compared to fiscal 2013, its year of introduction in that market. in addition, we successfully launched jdth in several of our largest international markets in fiscal 2014, including germany, russia, france, mexico, and japan. looking ahead, while jdth is now available in our largest markets, there remain many others where the brand has yet to be introduced, leaving room for us to continue its international expansion in fiscal 2015.

the jack daniel's rtds/rtp brands (jd rtds) grew volume 3% in fiscal 2014, while reported sales decreased 1% due to the negative foreign exchange effect of a weaker australian dollar. adjusted for foreign exchange and an estimated net increase in trade inventories, jd rtds grew underlying net sales 5% during fiscal 2014. four of our top five markets for jd rtds grew volumes and underlying net sales. australia, the brand's largest market, grew volumes and underlying net sales in the low single-digits despite a challenging economic and industry environment. the united states and the united kingdom both grew underlying net sales by double digits as these markets benefited from the broader introduction of our seasonal jack daniel's winter jack in fiscal 2014.
in fiscal 2014, we continued to introduce innovative new whiskeys from the jack daniel distillery, with a focus on ultra-premium line extensions. this year, we launched jack daniel's sinatratm select in the united states after its successful introduction with our travel retail customers in fiscal 2013. outside the united states, we introduced jack daniel's no. 27 gold tennessee whiskey to our travel retail customers in asia, setting the stage for a launch in select markets in fiscal 2015. underlying net sales of the original jack daniel's line extension gentleman jack - launched in 1988 - grew by double digits in fiscal 2014, driven equally by growth in the united states and in international markets. outside the united states, gentleman jack continued its international expansion, as both volumes and underlying net sales grew by double digits. underlying net sales also grew by double digits in the united states, as the brand was helped by its first-ever television advertising campaign, "the order of the gentleman."
in fiscal 2014, finlandia grew reported net sales by 3% and underlying net sales 4%, after adjusting for the effect of an estimated net reduction in trade inventories. finlandia's underlying net sales growth was primarily due to volume gains in poland, russia, and ukraine. in addition, finlandia's net sales growth benefited from better price/mix in fiscal 2014, as price increases in poland added to underlying net sales growth, but were partially offset by lower net pricing in russia.

the southern comfort family of brands volume declined 4% in fiscal 2014. reported net sales declined 5% while underlying net sales declined 2%, after adjusting for the negative effect of foreign exchange. our southern comfort business in the united states faced persistent consumer challenges affecting the liqueurs category generally, increased competition from flavored whiskeys, and continuing weakness experienced by many brands in the u.s. on-premise channel. these challenges led to declining volumes and net sales for the brand family in the united states, southern comfort's largest market. outside the united states, fiscal 2014 performance was mixed for southern comfort. the brand family grew net sales in the high single digits in the united kingdom, its second largest market, helped by volume growth in the off-premise channel and better net pricing. south africa also grew volumes and net sales as we launched a line of southern comfort rtds there during fiscal 2014. both markets benefited from investments in our award-winning advertising campaign. volumes and net sales declined in (a) germany, due to delays in the full roll-out of our promotional campaign, and (b) australia, where all of our brands were challenged by a difficult economic and industry environment.
in fiscal 2014, the performance of our two most important tequila brands, el jimador and herradura, was mixed across markets. in mexico, volumes and underlying net sales declined for both brands, but outside of mexico, both brands significantly grew volumes and underlying net sales. the net result for herradura was a small increase in underlying net sales, as growth outside of mexico offset declines in mexico. for el jimador, the net result was better, as el jimador's underlying net sales growth outside of mexico more than offset declines in mexico. as a result, el jimador's underlying net sales grew 3%, despite a 3% reduction in volumes. the united states is the most important market for both brands. in the united states, super-premium herradura grew volumes in the high single-digits and underlying net sales in the low double-digits to outpace its competitive set and gain market share, while el jimador grew volumes and underlying net sales in the high single-digits. we were encouraged by consumers' reaction to our new bottle for el jimador, which was introduced to the u.s. market during fiscal 2014 and, we believe, had a positive effect on our volumes and net sales growth. in the rest of the world, el jimador grew volumes 25% - its third consecutive year of volume growth above 20% outside of the united states and mexico. we remain focused on developing our tequila portfolio in the united states, where we see considerable potential for growth, strengthening our position in mexico, and continuing to build our presence in higher-value tequila markets throughout the world.
el jimador new mix, our market-leading rtd brand in mexico, had a difficult fiscal 2014, as volumes declined 13% and underlying net sales declined 9%, driven in part by higher customer inventory levels at the beginning of the fiscal year, which led to lower sales in fiscal 2014. in addition, new mix faced softer consumer demand as the brand was challenged by a difficult economic environment in mexico and by increased competition.
woodford reserve, our super-premium bourbon brand, surpassed the 300,000 nine-liter cases milestone in fiscal 2014 and grew volumes 24% (after growing 26% in fiscal 2013). the united states is by far the brand's most important market and was responsible for most of its growth during fiscal 2014. woodford reserve also gained momentum outside the united states, growing volumes 35%, driven by our travel retail business and some markets in europe where american whiskey trends are favorable, such as the united kingdom. during fiscal 2014, we substantially increased our advertising investment in woodford reserve and began advertising on television for the first time in the united states with our "woodford way" campaign. we believe that woodford reserve is a leader in the fast-growing super-premium american whiskey market in the united states and is poised for growth as interest in bourbon increases around the world. we plan to continue to devote substantial resources to woodford reserve to support its future growth potential.

fiscal 2014 compared to fiscal 2013
net sales of $3,946 million increased 4%, or $162 million, compared to fiscal 2013. underlying net sales growth was 6%, after adjusting for the negative effect of foreign exchange and the estimated net reduction in trade inventories. the negative effect on reported net sales growth of a weaker australian dollar more than offset the positive effect of generally stronger european currencies. the primary factor driving the estimated net reduction in trade inventories was decreased shipments corresponding to our former distributor's inventory reduction ahead of our route-to-consumer change in france.
the primary factors contributing to growth in underlying net sales were:
a.   more than half of the 3% of net sales growth attributed to price/mix was driven by the united states, primarily related to price increases for jdtw, jdth, and korbel. outside the united states, the primary markets contributing to net sales growth from price/mix were germany, poland, brazil, turkey, china, and france (which increased as a result of our route-to-consumer change during fiscal 2014).
b.   about half of the net sales growth attributed to volume was from jdtw, which grew broadly, but was led by (1) strong consumer-oriented growth in several large european markets, including germany, france, russia, turkey, and the united kingdom; (2) strong demand despite difficult economies in brazil and mexico; and (3) a motivated distribution partner and increased advertising investments in japan.
c.   jdth was the second-most-important contributor to volume-driven net sales growth, led by increases in the united states and the united kingdom, and also by volumes in several markets where we launched the brand in fiscal 2014, including mexico, germany, the czech republic, and france.
d.   our super-premium american whiskey brands, gentleman jack and woodford reserve, were the next-most-significant contributors to volume-based growth. the u.s. market drove much of the increase for woodford reserve, while growth of gentleman jack was driven equally by strong results in the united states and its continued expansion in our international markets.
e.   other recent innovations from jack daniel's, most importantly jack daniel's winter jack and jack daniel's sinatratm select among others, collectively contributed meaningfully to our net sales growth driven by volume. we believe that this result demonstrates the versatility of jack daniel's and its relevance to diverse consumers in various markets around the world.
the primary factors partially offsetting underlying net sales growth were:
a.   lower volumes in mexico for our tequila brands and new mix rtd, driven by (1) excess inventory of new mix and herradura held by our wholesale customers as we entered the fiscal year, and (2) lower consumer demand for our tequila brands in a difficult competitive and economic environment.
b.   lower volume and pricing for jdth in australia driven by weak consumer acceptance of the brand and a difficult comparison to our launch in that market last year.
c.   lower volume for the southern comfort family of brands, primarily in the united states, driven by weaker demand in the on-premise channel.
fiscal 2013 compared to fiscal 2012
net sales of $3,784 million increased 5%, or $170 million, compared to fiscal 2012. on an underlying basis, net sales increased by 8%. we continued to expand our international footprint, as reported net sales outside the united states grew faster
33
at 6% compared to 3% net sales growth in the united states. the year-over-year comparison of our net sales was negatively affected by the absence of approximately $83 million in net sales of hopland-based wine brands (which were included in fiscal 2012) due to the sale of this business line.
we attribute our 8% underlying growth in net sales during fiscal 2013 primarily to the strong performance of the jack daniel's family of brands and the performance of several other brands, including woodford reserve, finlandia, new mix, herradura, and agency brands. in fiscal 2013, net sales growth of the jack daniel's family of brands benefited from (a) volume growth and price increases of jack daniel's tennessee whiskey across many markets, including the united states; (b) expansion of jack daniel's tennessee honey to markets outside the united states and its continued growth in the united states; and (c) continued growth of line extensions, including gentleman jack and the line of jack daniel's rtds. these gains were partially offset by declines in net sales for a few brands, most notably southern comfort. our change in reported net sales was reduced by the negative effect of foreign exchange and the absence of hopland-based wine business. reported net sales benefited from an estimated increase in trade inventories in japan, the united states, and across many markets in europe.
we experienced the most significant growth in net sales on both a reported and an underlying basis in the united states, australia, germany, russia, mexico, the united kingdom, turkey, poland, and france, while net sales declined in some countries, including canada, china, and korea.

fiscal 2014 compared to fiscal 2013
cost of sales of $913 million increased $19 million, or 2%, during fiscal 2014. underlying cost of sales grew 3% after adjusting for the positive effect of the estimated reduction in net trade inventories. about two-thirds of the underlying increase in costs of sales was driven by growth in sales volumes, while the balance of the increase related to higher input costs, including higher expenses related to value-added packaging compared to the prior year.
fiscal 2013 compared to fiscal 2012
cost of sales of $894 million decreased $34 million, or 4%, during fiscal 2013. growth in sales volume resulted in cost of sales increases for the period, while higher transportation and input costs, including grain and glass, were mostly offset by lower value-added package expense and manufacturing efficiencies. additionally, the transition services agreement with the buyer of our hopland-based wines business expired on december 31, 2011, resulting in lower costs compared to the prior year. foreign exchange favorably affected reported cost of sales.

fiscal 2014 compared to fiscal 2013
gross profit of $2,078 million increased $122 million, or 6%, during fiscal 2014. underlying change in gross profit was higher at 8% after excluding the negative effects of both foreign exchange and the estimated reduction in net trade inventories. the increase resulted from the same factors that contributed to the increase in underlying net sales for the year. similarly, the increases in cost of goods for the year related to volume growth and somewhat higher input costs partially offset the underlying growth in gross profit.
gross margin improved to 52.7% in fiscal 2014, up 100 basis points from 51.7% in fiscal 2013. the increase in gross margin was primarily due to higher pricing and a favorable mix shift.
fiscal 2013 compared to fiscal 2012
gross profit of $1,955 million increased $160 million, or 9%, during fiscal 2013. gross profit was negatively affected by the absence of gross profit associated with the hopland-based wine business sale and foreign exchange. the increase resulted from the same factors that contributed to the increase in underlying net sales for the year. similarly, the increase in cost of goods for the year related to volume growth and new products partially offset the underlying growth in net sales.
gross margin improved to 51.7% in fiscal 2013 from 49.7% in fiscal 2012. approximately half of the improvement was derived from the absence of the lower-margin hopland-based wine business in our fiscal 2013 results. the other half of the gross margin increase was primarily due to higher pricing and a favorable mix shift.

underlying change in advertising                   8   %             6     %

reported change in advertising                     7   %             3     %
fiscal 2014 compared to fiscal 2013
advertising expenses of $436 million increased $27 million, or 7% on a reported basis. excluding the net positive effect of foreign exchange, underlying advertising expenses grew 8%. the increase in underlying advertising expenses was driven by:
a.   higher advertising for our super-premium american whiskeys, including notably woodford reserve in the united states and gentleman jack in the united states and internationally.
b.   advertising expenses to support jdth in markets where the brand was launched during fiscal 2014, including germany, mexico, and japan.
c.   increased advertising support for jdtw broadly across its many markets, and notably in our emerging markets, where we grew advertising expenses at a substantially higher rate than elsewhere.
these increases were partially offset by lower advertising expenses in australia, where we reduced our investments compared to fiscal 2013, when advertising expenses were elevated above normal levels because of new product launches, including the introduction of jdth.
fiscal 2013 compared to fiscal 2012
advertising expenses of $408 million increased $13 million, or 3% on a reported basis. excluding the positive effects of the absence the hopland-based wine business and of foreign exchange, underlying advertising expenses grew 6%. underlying advertising expenses growth was due in part to increased investments in media for southern comfort in the united states and support for the introduction of line extensions, notably jdth in the united kingdom, australia, and south africa and its continued growth in the united states. we also increased advertising investment in woodford reserve in the united states and our vodka portfolio in europe.

fiscal 2014 compared to fiscal 2013
sg&a expenses of $686 million increased $35 million, or 5% on a reported basis in fiscal 2014, while underlying sg&a growth was 6% after adjusting for the positive effect of foreign exchange. the most significant contributors to the year-over-year increase in underlying sg&a were: (a) inflation on salary and related expenses, and (b) costs related to setting up our distribution company in france and our new employees there.
fiscal 2013 compared to fiscal 2012
sg&a expenses of $650 million increased $40 million, or 7% on a reported basis in fiscal 2013, while underlying sg&a growth was 8% after adjusting for the positive effect of foreign exchange. inflation on salary- and benefit-related expenses, costs related to a leadership reorganization during fiscal 2013, and higher pension costs all contributed to the year-over-year increase in underlying sg&a expenses. during fiscal 2013, we also invested to enhance our organizational capabilities for our emerging markets - notably in china, india, and africa.

fiscal 2014 compared to fiscal 2013
operating income was $971 million in fiscal 2014, an increase of $73 million, or 8% compared to fiscal 2013. underlying operating income growth was 11% after adjusting for the negative effect of a reduction in estimated net trade inventories. the same factors that contributed to the growth in underlying gross profit also contributed to the growth in underlying operating income, partially offset by the factors that contributed to the growth in both advertising and sg&a expenses.
operating margin grew to 24.6% in fiscal 2014 from 23.7% in fiscal 2013. the same factors that drove the increase in our gross margin benefited our operating margin. in addition, our operating margin was helped by lower operating expense growth compared to gross profit growth.
fiscal 2013 compared to fiscal 2012
operating income was $898 million in fiscal 2013, an increase of $110 million, or 14% compared to fiscal 2012. underlying operating income growth was 13% after adjusting for (a) the unfavorable effect of foreign exchange, (b) the absence of operating income from the hopland-based wine business, and (c) the beneficial effect of an estimated increase in trade inventories. the same factors that contributed to the growth in underlying gross profit also contributed to the growth in underlying operating income, partially offset by the factors that contributed to the growth in both advertising and sg&a expenses.
operating margin grew to 23.7% in fiscal 2013 from 21.8% in fiscal 2012. the same factors that drove the increase in our gross margin improved our operating margin. in addition, our operating margin was improved by lower operating expense growth compared to gross profit growth.
fiscal 2014 compared to fiscal 2013
interest expense (net) decreased by $9 million compared to fiscal 2013, primarily due to the $9 million charge we recognized in fiscal 2013 for the early redemption of our $250 million 5% notes due february 1, 2014.
36
our effective tax rate for fiscal 2014 was 30.5%, 1.2 percentage points lower than the 31.7% rate in fiscal 2013. the decrease in our effective tax rate was driven primarily by an increase in the beneficial impact of foreign earnings at lower tax rates and by the favorable effect of higher u.s. tax benefits related to domestic manufacturing activities, partially offset by a reduction in benefits from discrete items.
diluted earnings per share were $3.06 in fiscal 2014, up 11% from $2.75 reported for fiscal 2013. this increase resulted from the same factors that contributed to the increase in operating income, as well as the lower net interest expense and a reduction in the effective tax rate.
fiscal 2013 compared to fiscal 2012
interest expense (net) increased by $5 million compared to fiscal 2012, due to a $9 million charge for the early redemption of our $250 million 5% notes due february 1, 2014, and higher levels of debt, offset by the absence of our $250 million 5.2% notes that matured on april 1, 2012.
our effective tax rate for fiscal 2013 was 31.7% compared to 32.5% in fiscal 2012. the decrease in our effective tax rate was driven primarily by the beneficial impact of increased foreign earnings, lower state income taxes, and benefits from discrete items.
diluted earnings per share were $2.75 in fiscal 2013, up 16% from the $2.37 reported for fiscal 2012, as adjusted for the 3-for-2 stock split effected in august 2012. this increase resulted from the same factors that contributed to the increase in operating income and the lower effective tax rate, but was negatively affected by higher net interest expense.
liquidity and capital resources our ability to generate cash from operations consistently is one of our most significant financial strengths. our strong cash flows enable us to invest in our people and our brands, make appropriate capital investments, pay dividends, make strategic acquisitions that we believe will enhance shareholder value, repurchase shares of common stock, and, from time to time, pay special dividends. investment-grade credit ratings (a2 by moody's, a+ by fitch, and a- by standard & poor's) provide us with financial flexibility when accessing global credit markets. we believe cash flows from operations are more than adequate to meet our expected operating and capital requirements.

change in cash and cash equivalents                 $(229   )           $(134   )          $233
cash and cash equivalents increased $233 million in fiscal 2014 compared to a decrease of $134 million in fiscal 2013, as an increase in cash from operations combined with a decrease in cash used for financing activities significantly exceeded an increase in cash used for investing activities compared to last year. cash provided by operations was $649 million, up from $537 million in fiscal 2013, reflecting higher earnings and a smaller increase in working capital.
cash used for investing activities increased $30 million during fiscal 2014, largely reflecting a higher level of capital spending, primarily related to the construction of the jack daniel cooperage in decatur, alabama, that began operations in april 2014.
cash used for financing activities was $288 million during fiscal 2014 compared to $576 million for the prior year. the fiscal 2014 amount consists largely of regular dividends of $233 million and share repurchases of $49 million (including $47
37
million under the share repurchase program discussed below). the fiscal 2013 amount of $576 consisted largely of dividend payments of $1,063 million (including $854 million related to a $4.00 per share special dividend paid in december 2012) offset partially by $747 million in proceeds from bonds issued in december 2012 to fund the special dividend payment. it also included the early redemption in february 2013 of $250 million of 5% notes.
in comparing fiscal 2013 to fiscal 2012, cash provided by operating activities increased $21 million, reflecting higher earnings offset partially by a larger increase in working capital. cash used for investing activities increased $29 million compared to fiscal 2012, primarily reflecting an increase in capital expenditures to expand production capacity at jack daniel distillery and sonoma-cutrer. cash used for financing activities decreased $86 million in fiscal 2013, as an increase in net proceeds from debt more than offset a net increase in cash paid to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. the impact on cash and cash equivalents as a result of exchange rate changes was an increase of $2 million in fiscal 2013 compared to a decrease of $15 million in fiscal 2012.
capital expenditures. investments in property, plant, and equipment were $58 million in fiscal 2012, $95 million in fiscal 2013, and $126 million in fiscal 2014. expenditures over the three-year period primarily included investments to maintain and expand capacity as well as improve production efficiency, reduce costs, and build our brands. capital investments were higher in fiscal 2014 compared to last year, reflecting increased spending on production operations to support the growing demand for the jack daniel's family of brands. an important element of this plan was completed in april 2014, when we opened the new jack daniel cooperage in decatur, alabama, significantly adding to our whiskey barrel-making capacity.
for fiscal 2015, we expect capital expenditures to be in a range of $120 million to $140 million, and that these investments will be funded by cash provided by operations. our capital spending plans for fiscal 2015 include investments to complete our capacity expansion at the jack daniel distillery and to substantially build up our versailles, kentucky, facilities to support the growth of woodford reserve. similar to fiscal 2014 and our expectation for fiscal 2015, we expect that fiscal 2016 capital spending will be relatively high compared to historical spending as we complete the final phase of our production capacity expansion at jack daniel's. we expect our capital expenditures to return to a more normal level going forward from fiscal 2017.

in addition to our cash and cash equivalent balances, we have access to several liquidity sources to supplement our cash flow from operations. one of those sources is our $1 billion commercial paper program that we regularly use to fund our short-term credit needs and to maintain our access to the capital markets. during fiscal 2014, our commercial paper borrowings averaged $467 million, with an average maturity of 36 days and an average interest rate of 0.22%. during fiscal 2013, our commercial paper borrowing averaged $308 million, with an average maturity of 44 days and an average interest rate of 0.21%. the average commercial paper borrowings were accompanied by corresponding increases in our average cash and cash equivalent balances. no commercial paper was outstanding at april 30, 2013 or 2014.
our commercial paper program is supported by cash and cash equivalent balances and available commitments under our currently undrawn $800 million bank credit facility that matures on november 20, 2018, which also serves as a source of liquidity. although unlikely, under extreme market conditions, one or more participating banks may not be able to fully fund our credit facility. further, we believe that the markets for investment-grade bonds and private placements are very accessible sources of long-term financing that could provide for any additional liquidity needs.
we have high credit standards when initiating transactions with counterparties and closely monitor our counterparty risks with respect to our cash balances and derivative contracts. if a counterparty's credit quality were to deteriorate below our credit standards, we would expect either to liquidate exposures or require the counterparty to post appropriate collateral.
as of april 30, 2014, we had total cash and cash equivalents of $437 million. of this amount, $256 million was held by foreign subsidiaries whose earnings we expect to reinvest indefinitely outside of the united states. we do not expect to need the

cash generated by those foreign subsidiaries to fund our domestic operations. however, in the unforeseen event that we repatriate cash from those foreign subsidiaries, we would be required to provide for and pay u.s. taxes on permanently repatriated funds.
as announced on may 21, 2014, our board of directors declared a regular quarterly cash dividend of $0.29 per share on our class a and class b common stock. stockholders of record on june 4, 2014, will receive the dividend on july 1, 2014.
as announced on september 25, 2013, our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to $250 million of our outstanding class a and class b common shares from october 1, 2013, through september 30, 2014, subject to market and other conditions. under this program, we may repurchase shares from time to time for cash in open market purchases, block transactions, and privately negotiated transactions in accordance with applicable federal securities laws. we can modify, suspend, or terminate this repurchase program at any time without prior notice. as of april 30, 2014, we have repurchased a total of 686,272 shares (24,800 of class a and 661,472 of class b) under this program for approximately $47 million, leaving $203 million available for additional repurchases through september 30, 2014. the average repurchase price per share, including broker commissions, was $68.03 for class a and $69.04 for class b.
we believe our current liquidity position is strong and sufficient to meet all of our future financial commitments. our $800 million bank credit facility's quantitative covenant requires our ratio of consolidated ebitda (as defined in the agreement) to consolidated interest expense to be at least 3 to 1. at april 30, 2014, with a ratio of 37 to 1, we were well within the covenant's parameters.
off-balance sheet arrangements as of april 30, 2014, we were not involved in any off-balance sheet arrangements, which have or are reasonably likely to have a material effect on our financial condition, results of operations or liquidity.
long-term obligations we have long-term obligations related to contracts, leases, borrowing arrangements, and employee benefit plans that we enter into in the normal course of business (see notes 4, 5, and 9 to our consolidated financial statements). the following table summarizes the amounts of those obligations as of april 30, 2014, and the years when those obligations must be paid:

1   excludes liabilities for tax uncertainties, as we cannot reasonably predict the ultimate amount or timing of settlement.
2   as of april 30, 2014, we have unfunded pension and other postretirement benefit obligations of $249 million. because we cannot determine the specific periods in which those obligations will be funded, the table above reflects no amounts related to those obligations other than the $17 million of expected contributions (including $10 million of expected discretionary contributions) in fiscal 2015.
3   as discussed in note 4 to our consolidated financial statements, we have obligations to purchase agave, a plant whose sap forms the raw material for tequila. as of april 30, 2014, based on current market prices, obligations under these contracts totaled $9 million. because we cannot determine the specific periods in which those obligations will be paid, the above table reflects only the total related to those obligations.
we expect to meet these obligations with internally generated funds.

critical accounting policies and estimates our financial statements reflect some estimates involved in applying the following critical accounting policies that entail uncertainties and subjectivity. using different estimates or policies could have a material effect on our operating results and financial condition.
goodwill and other intangible assets. we have obtained most of our brands by acquiring other companies. upon acquisition, the purchase price is first allocated to identifiable assets and liabilities, including intangible brand names and trademarks ("brand names"), based on estimated fair value, with any remaining purchase price recorded as goodwill. we do not amortize goodwill or intangible assets with indefinite lives. we consider all of our brand names to have indefinite lives.
we assess our goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment at least annually. if the fair value of an asset is less than its book value, we write it down to its estimated fair value. for goodwill, if the book value of its reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value, we measure for potential impairment by comparing the implied fair value of the reporting unit's goodwill, determined in the same manner as in a business combination, to the book value of the goodwill. we estimate the fair value of a reporting unit using discounted estimated future cash flows. we typically estimate the fair value of a brand name using an income approach, such as the "relief from royalty" method. we also consider market values for similar assets when available. considerable management judgment is necessary to estimate fair value, including making assumptions about future cash flows, discount rates, and royalty rates.
we have the option, prior to quantifying the fair value of a reporting unit or brand name, to evaluate qualitative factors to assess whether it is more likely than not that our goodwill or brand names are impaired. if we determine that is not the case, then we are not required to quantify the fair value. considerable management judgment is also required to make that assessment.
based on our assumptions, we believe none of our goodwill or other intangibles are impaired. further, we estimate the fair values to substantially exceed the carrying values of all of our intangible assets other than the chambord brand name.
the estimated fair value of the chambord brand name exceeded its book value of $116 million by approximately $21 million as of january 31, 2014, its test date for impairment. although the brand is growing outside the united states, and a significant portion of brand value relates to those international markets, we have lower expectations for the brand in the core u.s. market. additionally, the estimated fair value of the chambord brand name relies in part on our ability to grow the brand in key markets through product innovation.
the estimated fair value of the tuaca brand name exceeded its book value of $24 million by approximately $12 million as of april 30, 2014, its test date for impairment. although the estimated fair value exceeds book value by a substantial amount, a significant portion of brand value relates to the core u.s. market where sales of tuaca started declining five years ago, with declines accelerating in last two years.
future events, such as a failure of product innovation and other plans to increase sales, or changes in the assumptions used to estimate the fair value of these brand names could significantly change their estimated fair values, which could result in future impairment charges. for example, a 100-basis-point increase in our cost of capital, a key assumption in which a small change can have a significant effect, would decrease the estimated fair value of the chambord brand name by $27 million and result in a non-cash impairment charge of $6 million. that same increase in assumed cost of capital would decrease the estimated fair value of the tuaca brand name by $7 million, but would result in no impairment charge.
pension and other postretirement benefits. we sponsor various defined benefit pension plans as well as postretirement plans providing retiree health care and retiree life insurance benefits. benefits are based on factors such as years of service and compensation level during employment. we expense the benefits expected to be paid over employees' expected service. this requires us to make assumptions to determine the net benefit expense and obligations, such as interest rates, return on plan assets, the rate of salary increases, expected service, and health care cost trend rates.
the assets, obligations, and assumptions used to measure pension and retiree medical expenses are determined at the beginning of the year ("measurement date"). because obligations are measured on a discounted basis, the discount rate is a significant assumption. it is based on interest rates for high-quality, long-term corporate debt at each measurement date. the expected return on pension plan assets reflects expected capital market returns for each asset class, which are based on historical returns, adjusted for the expected effects of diversification and active management (net of fees) of the assets. the other assumptions also reflect our historical experience and management's best judgment regarding future expectations.
we review our assumptions on each annual measurement date. as of april 30, 2014, we have increased the weighted-average discount rate for pension obligations from 4.08% to 4.46%, and for other postretirement benefit obligations from 4.36% to 4.67%. our expected return on plan assets of 7.50% has not changed. using these assumptions, we estimate our pension and postretirement
40
benefit expense for fiscal 2015 will be approximately $43 million, compared to $49 million for fiscal 2014. a decrease/increase of 25 basis points in the assumed discount rate would increase/decrease the fiscal 2015 expense by approximately $3 million. a decrease/increase of 25 basis points in the assumed return on plan assets would increase/decrease the fiscal 2015 expense by approximately $1 million.
income taxes. our effective tax rate is based on our income and the statutory tax rates in the many jurisdictions where we do business. in fiscal 2014, our effective income tax rate was 30.5%, compared to 31.7% in fiscal 2013. the decrease in our effective tax rate was driven primarily by an increase in the beneficial impact of foreign earnings at lower tax rates and by the favorable effect of higher u.s. tax benefits related to domestic manufacturing activities, partially offset by a reduction in benefits from discrete items.
significant judgment is required in evaluating our tax positions. we establish liabilities when some positions are likely to be challenged and may not succeed, despite our belief that our tax return positions are fully supportable. we adjust these liabilities in light of changing circumstances, such as the progress of a tax audit. we believe current liabilities are appropriate for all known contingencies, but this situation could change.
years can elapse before we can resolve a particular matter for which we have established a tax liability. although predicting the final outcome or the timing of resolution of any particular tax matter can be difficult, we believe our liabilities reflect the likely outcome of known tax contingencies. unfavorable settlement of any particular issue could require use of our cash; conversely, a favorable resolution could result in either reduced cash tax payments, or the reversal of previously established liabilities, or some combination of these, which could reduce our effective tax rate.

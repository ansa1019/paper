business strategy
(all registrants except ppl energy supply)
the strategy for the regulated businesses of wpd, ppl electric, lke, lg&e and ku is to provide efficient, reliable and safe operations and strong customer service, maintain constructive regulatory relationships and achieve timely recovery of costs.  these regulated businesses also focus on providing competitively priced energy to customers and achieving stable, long-term growth in earnings and rate base, or rav, as applicable.  both rate base and rav are expected to grow for the foreseeable future as a result of significant capital expenditure programs to maintain existing assets and to improve system reliability and, for lke, lg&e and ku, to comply with federal and state environmental regulations related to coal-fired electricity generation facilities.  future rav for wpd will also be affected by riio-ed1, effective april 1, 2015, as the recovery period for assets placed in service after that date will be extended from 20 to 45 years, with a transitional arrangement that will gradually change the life over the price control period that will result in an average life of 35 years for rav additions during riio-ed1.  the rav balance at march 31, 2015 will continue to be recovered over 20 years.  in addition, incentive targets have been adjusted in riio-ed1, resulting in lower overall incentive revenues available to be earned.  see "financial
42
and operational developments - other financial and operational developments - riio-ed1 - fast tracking" below for additional information.
for the u. s. regulated businesses, recovery of capital project costs is attained through various rate-making mechanisms, including periodic base rate case proceedings, ferc formula rate mechanisms, and other regulatory agency-approved recovery mechanisms.  in kentucky, the kpsc has adopted a series of regulatory mechanisms (ecr, dsm, glt, fuel adjustment clause, gas supply clause and recovery on certain construction work-in-progress) that reduce regulatory lag and provide for timely recovery of and a return on, as appropriate, prudently incurred costs.  in pennsylvania, the ferc transmission formula rate, dsic mechanism and other recovery mechanisms are in place to reduce regulatory lag and provide for timely recovery of and a return on, as appropriate, prudently incurred costs.
for the u.k. regulated businesses, during the rate review period applicable for the eight year period beginning april 1, 2015, 80% of network related expenditures are added to the rav and, together with adjustments for inflation and a return on the rav, recovered through allowed revenue over 35 years (45 years for additions after april 1, 2023); rav is intended to represent expenditures that have a long-term benefit to wpd (similar to capital projects for the u.s. regulated businesses) with other expenditures being recovered in the current year.  the rav balance at march 31, 2015 will continue to be recovered over 20 years.
(ppl)
earnings generated by ppl's u.k. subsidiaries are subject to foreign currency translation risk.  the u.k. subsidiaries also have currency exposure to the u.s. dollar to the extent they have u.s. dollar denominated debt.  to manage these risks, ppl generally uses contracts such as forwards, options and cross currency swaps that contain characteristics of both interest rate and foreign currency exchange contracts.
(ppl and ppl energy supply)
in june 2014, ppl and ppl energy supply executed definitive agreements with affiliates of riverstone to combine their competitive power generation businesses into a new, stand-alone, publicly traded company named talen energy.  under the terms of the agreements, at closing, ppl will spin off to ppl shareowners a newly formed entity, talen energy holdings, inc. (holdco), which at such time will own all of the membership interests of ppl energy supply and all of the common stock of talen energy.  immediately following the spinoff, holdco will merge with a special purpose subsidiary of talen energy, with holdco continuing as the surviving company to the merger and as a wholly owned subsidiary of talen energy and the sole owner of ppl energy supply.  substantially contemporaneous with the spinoff and merger, rjs power will be contributed by its owners to become a subsidiary of talen energy.  following completion of these transactions, ppl shareowners will own 65% of talen energy and affiliates of riverstone will own 35%.  ppl will have no continuing ownership interest in, control of, or affiliation with talen energy.
see "item 1. business," "item 1a. risk factors" and "financial and operational developments - other financial and operational developments - anticipated spinoff of ppl energy supply" below for additional information.
the strategy for ppl energy supply is to optimize the value from its competitive generation asset and marketing portfolios while mitigating near-term volatility in both cash flows and earnings.  ppl energy supply endeavors to do this by matching energy supply with load, or customer demand, under contracts of varying durations with creditworthy counterparties to capture profits while effectively managing exposure to energy and fuel price volatility, counterparty credit risk and operational risk.  ppl energy supply is focused on maintaining profitability and positive cash flow during this current period of low energy and capacity prices.
(all registrants)
to manage financing costs and access to credit markets, and to fund capital expenditures, a key objective of the registrants is to maintain targeted credit profiles and liquidity positions.  in addition, the registrants have financial and operational risk management programs that, among other things, are designed to monitor and manage exposure to earnings and cash flow volatility related to, as applicable, changes in energy and fuel prices, interest rates, counterparty credit quality and the operating performance of generating units.  to manage these risks, ppl generally uses contracts such as forwards, options, swaps and insurance contracts.

2015 outlook
(ppl)
higher earnings are expected in 2015 compared with 2014, after adjusting for special items, certain dissynergies reflected in the corporate and other category previously recorded in the supply segment, and earnings from the supply segment.  the factors underlying these projections by segment and subsidiary registrant are discussed below (on an after-tax basis).
(ppl's u.k. regulated segment)
higher earnings are projected in 2015 compared with 2014, primarily driven by lower income taxes and a more favorable foreign currency exchange rate, partially offset by lower utility revenue.
(ppl's kentucky regulated segment and lke, lg&e and ku)
higher earnings are projected in 2015 compared with 2014, primarily driven by anticipated electric and gas base rate increases and returns on additional environmental capital investments, partially offset by higher operation and maintenance expense, higher depreciation and higher financing costs.
44
(ppl's pennsylvania regulated segment and ppl electric)
lower earnings are projected in 2015 compared with 2014, primarily driven by higher operation and maintenance expense, higher depreciation and higher financing costs, partially offset by higher transmission margins and returns on distribution improvement capital investments.
(ppl's supply segment and ppl energy supply)
in anticipation of the spinoff of ppl energy supply, no forward looking information, including an earnings forecast, is being provided for ppl's supply segment and ppl energy supply for 2015.
(ppl's corporate and other category)
lower costs are projected in 2015 compared with 2014, primarily driven by the reduction of dissynergies related to the supply business spinoff through corporate restructuring efforts and lower income taxes.
(all registrants)
earnings in future periods are subject to various risks and uncertainties.  see "forward-looking information," "item 1. business," "item 1a. risk factors," the rest of this item 7, and notes 1, 6 and 13 to the financial statements (as applicable) for a discussion of the risks, uncertainties and factors that may impact future earnings.
other financial and operational developments economic and market conditions
(all registrants except ppl electric)
the businesses of ppl energy supply, lke, lg&e and ku are subject to extensive federal, state and local environmental laws, rules and regulations, including those pertaining to coal combustion residuals, ghg, effluent limitation guidelines and mats.  see "financial condition - environmental matters" below for additional information on these requirements.  these and other stringent environmental requirements, combined with low energy margins for competitive generation, have led several energy companies, including ppl, ppl energy supply, lke, lg&e and ku, to announce plans to either temporarily or permanently close or place in long-term reserve status, and/or impair certain of their coal-fired generating plants.
(ppl and ppl energy supply)
as a result of current economic and market conditions, the announced transaction with affiliates of riverstone to form talen energy, ppl energy supply's current sub-investment grade credit rating and talen energy's expected sub-investment grade credit rating, ppl energy supply continues to monitor its business and operational plans, including capital and operation and maintenance expenditures, its hedging strategies and potential plant modifications to burn lower cost fuels.  see "margins - changes in non-gaap financial measures - unregulated gross energy margins" below for additional information on energy margins.  2014 energy margins were lower compared to 2013 due to a higher average hedge price in 2013, partially offset by higher pricing on unhedged generation.
(ppl, lke, lg&e and ku)
as a result of the environmental requirements discussed above, lke projects $2.2 billion ($1.1 billion each at lg&e and ku) in capital investment over the next five years and anticipates retiring five coal-fired units (three at lg&e in 2015 and two at ku in 2016) with a combined summer capacity rating of 724 mw (563 mw at lg&e and 161 mw at ku).  ku retired a 71 mw coal-fired unit at the tyrone plant in february 2013 and a 12 mw gas-fired unit at the haefling plant in december 2013.  the retirement of these units is not expected to have a material impact on the financial condition or results of operations of ppl, lke, lg&e and ku.  see note 8 to the financial statements for additional information regarding the anticipated retirement of these units as well as the construction of a ngcc in kentucky expected to be operational in may 2015 and a 10 mw solar facility expected to be operational in 2016.
the kpsc has adopted a series of regulatory mechanisms (ecr, dsm, glt, fuel adjustment clause, gas supply clause and recovery on certain construction work-in-progress) that provide for timely recovery of prudently incurred costs (including
45
costs associated with environmental requirements).  the kentucky utility businesses are impacted by changes in customer usage levels, which can be driven by a number of factors including weather conditions and economic factors that impact the load utilized by customers.
(all registrants)
the registrants cannot predict the impact that future economic and market conditions and regulatory requirements may have on their financial condition or results of operations.
labor union agreements
(ppl, ppl energy supply and ppl electric)
ppl, ppl energy supply and ppl electric finalized a new three-year labor agreement with ibew local 1600 in may 2014 and the agreement was ratified in early june 2014.  as part of efforts to reduce operations and maintenance expenses, the new agreement offered a one-time voluntary retirement window to certain bargaining unit employees.  as a result, for the year ended december 31, 2014, the following total separation benefits have been recorded.
ppl energy ppl          supply      ppl electric pension benefits              $13             $11                $2
severance compensation          7               6                 1
total separation benefits     $20             $17                $3
number of employees           123             105                17
the separation benefits are included in "other operation and maintenance" on the statement of income.  the liability for pension benefits is included in "accrued pension obligations" on the balance sheet at december 31, 2014.  all of the severance compensation was paid in 2014.  the remaining terms of the new labor agreement are not expected to have a significant impact on the financial results of ppl, ppl energy supply or ppl electric.
anticipated spinoff of ppl energy supply
(ppl, ppl energy supply and ppl electric)
following the announcement of the transaction to form talen energy as discussed in "item 1. business - general - anticipated spinoff of ppl energy supply", efforts were initiated to identify the appropriate staffing for talen energy and for ppl and its subsidiaries following completion of the spinoff.  organizational plans and staffing selections were substantially completed in 2014.
the new organizational plans identify the need to resize and restructure the organizations.  as a result, during 2014, charges for employee separation benefits were recorded in "other operation and maintenance" on the statement of income and in "other current liabilities" on the balance sheet as follows.
ppl energy        ppl

ppl   supply          electric separation benefits     $36   $16             $1
number of positions     306   112             14
the separation benefits incurred include cash severance compensation, lump sum cobra reimbursement payments and outplacement services.  most separations and payment of separation benefits are expected to occur in 2015.
additional employee-related costs to be incurred primarily include accelerated stock-based compensation and pro-rated performance-based cash incentive and stock-based compensation awards primarily for ppl energy supply employees and for ppl employees who will become ppl energy supply employees in connection with the transaction.  these costs will primarily be recognized at the spinoff closing date.  ppl and ppl energy supply estimate these additional costs will be in the range of $30 million to $40 million.
46
(ppl)
as a result of the spinoff announcement, ppl recorded $50 million of deferred income tax expense in 2014 to adjust valuation allowances on deferred tax assets primarily for state net operating loss carryforwards that were previously supported by the future earnings of ppl energy supply.
in addition, ppl recorded $27 million of third-party costs in 2014 related to this transaction.  of these costs, $19 million were primarily for investment bank advisory, legal and accounting fees to facilitate the transaction, and are recorded in "other income (expense) - net" on the statement of income.  an additional $8 million of consulting and other costs were incurred to ready the new talen energy organization and reconfigure the remaining ppl service functions.  these costs are recorded in "other operation and maintenance" on the statement of income.  ppl currently estimates a range of total third-party costs that will ultimately be incurred of between $60 million and $70 million.
the assets and liabilities of ppl energy supply will continue to be classified as "held and used" on ppl's balance sheet until the closing of the transaction.  in conducting its annual goodwill impairment assessment in the fourth quarter of 2014 for its supply segment reporting unit, ppl determined that the estimated fair value of ppl energy supply exceeded its carrying value and no impairment was recognized.  however, an impairment loss could be recognized by ppl at the spinoff date if the aggregate carrying amount of ppl energy supply's assets and liabilities exceeds its aggregate fair value at that date.  ppl cannot predict whether an impairment loss will be recorded at the spinoff date.
(ppl energy supply)
in accordance with business combination accounting guidance, ppl energy supply will treat the combination with rjs power as an acquisition and ppl energy supply will be considered the acquirer of rjs power.
montana hydro sale (ppl and ppl energy supply)
in november 2014, ppl montana completed the sale to northwestern of 633 mw of hydroelectric generating facilities located in montana for approximately $900 million in cash.  as a result of the sale, ppl and ppl energy supply recorded gains of $237 million ($137 million after-tax) and $306 million ($206 million after-tax), included in "income (loss) from discontinued operations (net of income taxes)" on the 2014 statement of income.  see note 8 to the financial statements for additional information including the components of discontinued operations.
(ppl)
ofgem review of line loss calculation in march 2014, ofgem issued its final decision on the dpcr4 line loss incentives and penalties mechanism.  as a result, during the first quarter of 2014, wpd increased its existing liability by $65 million for over-recovery of line losses with a reduction to "utility" revenues on the statement of income.  in june 2014, wpd applied for judicial review of certain of ofgem's decisions related to closing out the dpcr4 line loss mechanism but was denied permission to apply for judicial review and wpd now considers the matter closed.  the recorded liability at december 31, 2014 was $99 million.  the total recorded liability will be refunded to customers from april 1, 2015 through march 31, 2019.  see note 6 to the financial statements for additional information.
riio-ed1 - fast tracking in february 2014, wpd elected to accept the decision of ofgem to set the real cost of equity to be used during the riio-ed1 period at 6.4% compared to 6.7% proposed by wpd, and remain in the fast-track process.  the change in the cost of equity is not expected to have a significant impact on ppl's results of operations.  also, in february 2014, ofgem published formal confirmation that wpd's business plans submitted by its four dnos were accepted as submitted, or "fast-tracked," for the eight-year price control period starting april 1, 2015.  fast tracking affords several benefits to the wpd dnos including the ability to collect additional revenue equivalent to 2.5% of total annual expenditures during the eight-year price control period, or approximately $43 million annually, greater revenue certainty and a higher level of cost savings retention.  the period to challenge the fast tracking expired in june 2014 and no third parties have filed objections.  see "item 1. business - segment information - u.k. regulated segment" for additional information on riio-ed1.
47
distribution revenue reduction in december 2013, wpd and other u.k. dnos announced agreements with the u.k. department of energy and climate change and ofgem to a reduction of £5 per residential customer of electricity distribution revenues that otherwise would have been collected in the regulatory year beginning april 1, 2014.  full recovery of the revenue reduction, together with the associated carrying cost, was expected to occur during the regulatory year beginning april 1, 2015 for three of the wpd dnos, and over the eight year riio-ed1 regulatory period for the fourth dno.  however, in july 2014, ofgem decided that full recovery will occur for all wpd dnos in the regulatory year beginning april 1, 2016.  earnings for the u.k. regulated segment were adversely affected by $31 million in 2014.  ppl projects earnings in 2015 will be adversely affected by $15 million and earnings for 2016 will be positively affected by $32 million with the remainder to be recovered in later periods.
2011 equity units in march 2014, ppl capital funding remarketed $978 million of 4.32% junior subordinated notes due 2019 that were originally issued in april 2011 as a component of ppl's 2011 equity units.  in connection with the remarketing, ppl capital funding retired $228 million of the 4.32% junior subordinated notes due 2019 and issued $350 million of 2.189% junior subordinated notes due 2017 and $400 million of 3.184% junior subordinated notes due 2019.  simultaneously the newly issued junior subordinated notes were exchanged for $350 million of 3.95% senior notes due 2024 and $400 million of 5.00% senior notes due 2044.  in may 2014, ppl issued 31.7 million shares of common stock at $30.86 per share to settle the 2011 purchase contracts.  ppl received net cash proceeds of $978 million, which were used to repay short-term debt and for general corporate purposes.
kerr dam project arbitration decision and impairment (ppl energy supply)
ppl montana previously held a joint operating license issued for the kerr dam project, which was sold to northwestern as part of the montana hydro sale in november 2014.  between 2015 and 2025, the confederated salish and kootenai tribes of the flathead nation (the tribes) have the option to purchase, hold and operate the kerr dam project.  in march 2014, an arbitration panel issued its final decision holding that the conveyance price payable by the tribes for the kerr dam project is $18 million.  as a result of the decision and the tribes having given notice of their intent to exercise the option, in the first quarter of 2014 ppl energy supply recorded an impairment charge of $18 million ($10 million after-tax) to reduce the carrying amount to its fair value.  see note 16 to the financial statements for additional information on the impairment.  additionally, as a result of a guarantee included in the sale agreement with northwestern, if the tribes exercise their option and purchase the kerr dam project for $18 million as expected, ppl montana must pay northwestern $12 million, which is recorded as a liability on the balance sheet at december 31, 2014.
susquehanna turbine blade inspection (ppl and ppl energy supply)
ppl susquehanna continues to make modifications to address the causes of turbine blade cracking at the ppl susquehanna nuclear plant first identified in 2011.  unit 1 completed its planned refueling and turbine inspection outage in june 2014 and installed newly designed shorter last stage blades on one of the low pressure turbines.  this change allowed unit 1 to run with reduced blade vibration and no cracking during 2014.  in the first, second and third quarters of 2014, unit 2 was shut down for blade inspection and replacement, as well as additional maintenance.  the financial impact of the unit 2 outages was not material.  based on the positive experience on unit 1, the same short blade modification will be installed on two of the three turbines on unit 2 during the scheduled refueling outage in spring 2015.  ppl susquehanna continues to monitor blade performance and work with the turbine manufacturer to identify and resolve the issues causing blade cracking.
regional transmission expansion plan (ppl and ppl electric)
in july 2014, ppl electric announced that it had submitted a proposal to pjm to build a new regional transmission line.  as currently proposed, ppl electric is pursuing approval of this project from pennsylvania, new jersey, new york and maryland.  the proposed line would run from western pennsylvania into new york and new jersey and also south into maryland, covering approximately 725 miles.  the proposed line would enhance the ability to move power inter-regionally and intra-regionally improving reliability and cost effectiveness.  as proposed, the project would begin in 2017 and the line would be in operation between 2023 and 2025.  the project is estimated to cost $4 billion to $6 billion and requires numerous approvals from ferc, pjm and new york independent system operator.  there can be no assurance, however, that the project will be approved as proposed.  additionally, ppl electric is continuing to study the project and may modify it in the future.

in its december 28, 2012 final rate case order, the puc directed ppl electric to file a proposed sder.  in march 2013, ppl electric filed its proposed sder with the puc and, as part of that filing, requested recovery of the 2012 qualifying storm costs related to hurricane sandy.  in april 2014, the puc issued a final order approving the sder with a january 1, 2015 effective date and initially including actual storm costs compared to collections from december 2013 through november 2014.  as a result of the order, ppl electric reduced its 2013 regulatory liability by $12 million related to collections in excess of costs incurred from january 1, 2013 to november 30, 2013 that are not required to be refunded to customers.  also, as part of the order, ppl electric was authorized to recover hurricane sandy storm damage costs through the sder over a three-year period beginning january 2015.  on june 20, 2014, the office of consumer advocate (oca) filed a petition for review of the april 2014 order with the commonwealth court of pennsylvania.  on december 3, 2014, the oca filed a complaint against ppl electric's initial sder filing.  in january 2015, the puc issued a final order closing the investigation and modifying the effective date of the sder to february 1, 2015.  see "pennsylvania activities - storm damage expense rider" in note 6 to the financial statements for additional information.
ferc wholesale formula rates (lke and ku)
in september 2013, ku filed an application with the ferc to adjust the formula rate under which ku provides wholesale requirements power sales to 12 municipal customers.  among other changes, the application requests an amended formula whereby ku would charge cost-based rates with a subsequent true-up to actual costs, replacing the current formula which does not include a true-up.  ku's application proposed an authorized return on equity of 10.7%.  certain elements, including the new formula rate, became effective april 23, 2014, subject to refund.  in april 2014, nine municipalities submitted notices of termination, under the original notice period provisions, to cease taking power under the wholesale requirements contracts.  such terminations are to be effective in 2019, except in the case of one municipality with a 2017 effective date.  in addition, a tenth municipality has a previously settled termination date of 2016.  in july 2014, ku agreed on settlement terms with the two municipal customers that did not provide termination notices and filed the settlement proposal with the ferc for its approval.  in august 2014, the ferc issued an order on the interim settlement agreement allowing the proposed rates to become effective pending a final order.  if approved, the settlement agreement will resolve the rate case with respect to these two municipalities, including an authorized return on equity of 10% or the return on equity awarded to other parties in this case, whichever is lower.  also in july 2014, ku made a contractually required filing with the ferc that addressed certain rate recovery matters affecting the nine terminating municipalities during the remaining term of their contracts.  ku and the terminating municipalities continue settlement discussions in this proceeding.  ku cannot currently predict the outcome of its ferc applications regarding its wholesale power agreements with the municipalities.
rate case proceedings (lke, lg&e and ku)
on november 26, 2014, lg&e and ku filed requests with the kpsc for increases in annual base electricity rates of approximately $30 million at lg&e and approximately $153 million at ku and an increase in annual base gas rates of approximately $14 million at lg&e.  the proposed base rate increases would result in electricity rate increases of 2.7% at lg&e and 9.6% at ku and a gas rate increase of 4.2% at lg&e and would become effective in july 2015.  lg&e's and ku's applications each include a request for authorized returns-on-equity of 10.50%.  the applications are based on a forecasted test year of july 1, 2015 through june 30, 2016.  a number of parties have been granted intervention requests in the proceedings.  a hearing on the applications is scheduled to commence on april 21, 2015.  lg&e and ku cannot predict the outcome of these proceedings.

·   see "margins - changes in non-gaap financial measures" for an explanation of kentucky gross margins.

·   higher other operation and maintenance in 2014 compared with 2013 primarily due to $14 million of higher expenses due to the timing and scope of scheduled generation maintenance outages, $9 million of higher bad debt expense and higher storm expenses of $8 million.

·   higher depreciation in 2014 compared with 2013 due to additions to pp&amp;e, net.

·   higher depreciation in 2013 compared with 2012 primarily due to environmental costs related to the 2005 and 2006 ecr plans now being included in base rates. as a result, $51 million of depreciation associated with those environmental projects is shown as depreciation in 2013. depreciation for these ecr plans was included in kentucky gross margins in 2012 and 2011. this increase was partially offset by lower depreciation due to revised rates that were effective january 1, 2013. both events are the result of the 2012 rate case proceedings.

·   higher interest expense in 2014 compared with 2013 primarily due to $22 million of higher expense resulting from the issuance of $500 million of first mortgage bonds in november 2013 and higher short-term debt balances partially offset by a $10 million loss on extinguishment of debt in 2013 related to the remarketing of the ppl capital funding junior subordinated notes component of the 2010 equity units and simultaneous exchange into senior notes in the second quarter of 2013, and a $5 million decrease due to lower rates on the related senior notes as compared with the junior subordinated notes.

·   see "margins - changes in non-gaap financial measures" for an explanation of pennsylvania gross delivery margins.

·   lower other operation and maintenance for 2014 compared with 2013, primarily due to $16 million of lower payroll related expenses due to lower headcount, less maintenance projects and more focus on capital work in 2014.

lower other operation and maintenance for 2013 compared with 2012, primarily due to lower storm costs of $25 million and lower support group costs of $10 million, partially offset by $12 million increased vegetation management costs.

·   higher depreciation for both periods primarily due to transmission pp&amp;e additions as well as additions related to the ongoing efforts to ensure the reliability of the delivery system and the replacement of aging infrastructure.

·   higher interest expense for both periods primarily due to the issuance of first mortgage bonds in july 2013 and june 2014.

·   higher income taxes in 2014 compared with 2013, primarily due to higher pre-tax income which increased income taxes by $46 million and tax benefits related to federal and state income tax reserves of $8 million in 2013.

higher income taxes in 2013 compared with 2012, primarily due to higher pre-tax income which increased income taxes by $47 million, partially offset by $8 million of income tax return adjustments primarily recorded in 2012, largely related to changes in flow-through regulated tax depreciation.

the following after-tax loss, which management considers a special item, also impacted the pennsylvania regulated segment's results.

margins non-gaap financial measures management utilizes the following non-gaap financial measures as indicators of performance for its businesses.
·   "kentucky gross margins" is a single financial performance measure of the electricity generation, transmission and distribution operations of the kentucky regulated segment, lke, lg&amp;e and ku, as well as kentucky regulated segment's, lke's and lg&amp;e's distribution and sale of natural gas. in calculating this measure, fuel, energy purchases and certain variable costs of production (recorded as "other operation and maintenance" on the statements of income) are deducted from revenues. in addition, certain other expenses, recorded as "other operation and maintenance", "depreciation" and "taxes, other than income" on the statements of income, associated with approved cost recovery mechanisms are offset against the recovery of those expenses, which are included in revenues. these mechanisms allow for direct recovery of these expenses and, in some cases, returns on capital investments and performance incentives. as a result, this measure represents the net revenues from electricity and gas operations.

·   "pennsylvania gross delivery margins" is a single financial performance measure of the electricity delivery operations of the pennsylvania regulated segment and ppl electric, which includes transmission and distribution activities. in calculating this measure, utility revenues and expenses associated with approved recovery mechanisms, including energy provided as a plr, are offset with minimal impact on earnings. costs associated with these mechanisms are recorded in "energy purchases," "other operation and maintenance," which is primarily act 129 costs, and "taxes, other than income," which is primarily gross receipts tax. this performance measure includes plr energy purchases by ppl electric from ppl energyplus, which are reflected in "plr intersegment utility revenue (expense)" in the reconciliation table below (in "energy purchases from affiliate" in ppl electric's reconciliation table). as a result, this measure represents the net revenues from the pennsylvania regulated segment's and ppl electric's electricity delivery operations.

57
·   "unregulated gross energy margins" is a single financial performance measure of the competitive energy activities of the supply segment and ppl energy supply, which are managed on a geographic basis. in calculating this measure, energy revenues, including operating revenues associated with certain businesses classified as discontinued operations, are offset by the cost of fuel, energy purchases, certain other operation and maintenance expenses, primarily ancillary charges, gross receipts tax, recorded in "taxes, other than income," and operating expenses associated with certain businesses classified as discontinued operations. this performance measure is relevant due to the volatility in the individual revenue and expense lines on the statements of income that comprise "unregulated gross energy margins." this volatility stems from a number of factors, including the required netting of certain transactions with isos and significant fluctuations in unrealized gains and losses. such factors could result in gains or losses being recorded in either "unregulated wholesale energy," "unregulated retail energy" or "energy purchases" on the statements of income. this performance measure includes plr revenues from energy sales to ppl electric by ppl energyplus, which are reflected in "plr intersegment utility revenue (expense)" in the reconciliation table below (in "unregulated wholesale energy to affiliate" in ppl energy supply's reconciliation table). "unregulated gross energy margins" excludes adjusted energy-related economic activity, which includes the changes in fair value of positions used to economically hedge a portion of the economic value of the competitive generation assets, full-requirement sales contracts and retail activities. this economic value is subject to changes in fair value due to market price volatility of the input and output commodities (e.g., fuel and power) prior to the delivery period that was hedged. adjusted energy-related economic activity includes the ineffective portion of qualifying cash flow hedges and premium amortization associated with options. unrealized gains and losses related to this activity are deferred and included in "unregulated gross energy margins" over the delivery period of the item that was hedged or upon realization.

these measures are not intended to replace "operating income," which is determined in accordance with gaap, as an indicator of overall operating performance.  other companies may use different measures to analyze and report their results of operations.  management believes these measures provide additional useful criteria to make investment decisions.  these performance measures are used, in conjunction with other information, by senior management and ppl's board of directors to manage the operations, analyze actual results compared with budget and, in certain cases, to measure certain corporate financial goals used to determine variable compensation.
reconciliation of non-gaap financial measures the following tables contain the components from the statement of income that are included in the non-gaap financial measures and a reconciliation to ppl's "operating income" for the years ended december 31.

kentucky gross margins kentucky gross margins increased in 2014 compared with 2013, primarily due to returns on additional environmental capital investments of $55 million ($27 million at lg&e and $28 million at ku) and higher volumes of $13 million ($5 million at lg&e and $8 million at ku).  the change in volumes was driven by unusually cold weather in the first quarter of 2014.
kentucky gross margins increased in 2013 compared with 2012, primarily due to higher base rates of $102 million ($44 million at lg&e and $58 million at ku), environmental cost recoveries added to base rates of $53 million ($3 million at lg&e and $50 million at ku), returns from additional environmental capital investments of $34 million ($16 million at lg&e and $18 million at ku), higher fuel recoveries of $18 million ($7 million at lg&e and $11 million at ku) and higher volumes of $6 million ($9 million higher at ku, partially offset by $3 million lower at lg&e).
the increase in base rates was the result of new kpsc rates effective january 1, 2013 at lg&e and ku.  the environmental cost recoveries added to base rates were due to the transfer of the 2005 and 2006 ecr plans into base rates as a result of the 2012 kentucky rate cases for lg&e and ku.  this transfer results in depreciation and other operation and maintenance expenses associated with the 2005 and 2006 ecr plans being excluded from kentucky gross margins in 2013, although the recovery of such costs remain in kentucky gross margins through base rates.
pennsylvania gross delivery margins distribution distribution margins increased in 2014 compared with 2013, primarily due to an $18 million favorable effect of distribution improvement capital investments and a $12 million benefit from a change in estimate of a regulatory liability."
distribution margins increased in 2013 compared with 2012, primarily due to a $53 million favorable effect of price, largely comprised of higher base rates, effective january 1, 2013, a $15 million impact of weather, primarily due to the adverse effect of mild weather in 2012 and higher volumes of $5 million.
transmission transmission margins increased for both periods, primarily due to increased capital investments.
unregulated gross energy margins eastern u.s.
eastern margins decreased in 2014 compared with 2013, primarily due to lower baseload energy prices of $354 million and lower capacity prices of $34 million, partially offset by net gains on commodity positions of $75 million, favorable asset performance of $70 million, $38 million related to weather as discussed below and gas optimization of $26 million.
during the first quarter of 2014, the pjm region experienced unusually cold weather conditions, higher demand and congestion patterns causing rising natural gas and electricity prices in spot and near-term forward markets.  due to these market dynamics, ppl energy supply captured opportunities on unhedged generation, which were primarily offset by under hedged full-requirement sales contracts and retail electric.
eastern margins decreased in 2013 compared with 2012, primarily due to $435 million of lower baseload energy prices, partially offset by $198 million of higher capacity prices and $100 million of increased nuclear generation volume.
western u.s.
western margins decreased in 2014 compared with 2013, primarily due to lower wholesale energy prices.
western margins decreased in 2013 compared with 2012, primarily due to $69 million of lower wholesale energy prices and $15 million of lower net economic availability of coal and hydroelectric units.

$24             $(12)
(a)   relates to expenses associated with ppl electric's puc-approved energy efficiency and conservation plan with programs starting in 2010. these expenses are recovered in customer rates. the decrease in 2013 compared with 2012 results from the number of programs and the timing of such programs. phase 1 of act 129 closed in may 2013. phase 2 programs began in june 2013.

(b)   the increase in 2013 compared with 2012 was due to increased activities related to maintaining and increasing system reliability for both the transmission and distribution systems.

(c)   the decrease in 2014 compared with 2013 was due to lower headcount, less maintenance work and more focus on capital projects in 2014.

(d)   the increase in 2014 compared with 2013 was due to more storm events. the 2012 expenses were unusually high due to hurricane sandy expenses.

(e)   the increase in 2014 compared with 2013 was primarily due to project expenses, including refueling outage expenses.

(f)   the decrease in 2014 compared with 2013 was primarily due to a $65 million impairment charge in 2013 related to the corette plant and the elimination of $20 million of rent expense associated with the colstrip lease which was terminated in december 2013. the increase in 2013 compared with 2012 was primarily due to the $65 million impairment charge in 2013 related to the corette plant, partially offset by lower fossil and hydroelectric expenses of $24 million, largely driven by lower outage expenses in 2013. see note 16 to the financial statements for additional information on the corette plant impairment.

(g)   the increase in 2013 compared with 2012 was primarily due to vegetation management.

(h)   the decrease in 2014 compared with 2013 was primarily due to lower amortization of prior period losses and an increase in expected asset returns.

loss on lease termination a $697 million charge was recorded in 2013 for the termination of the colstrip operating lease to facilitate the sale of the montana hydroelectric generating facilities.  see note 8 to the financial statements for additional information.

(a)   a result of the 2012 rate case.

(b)   lower depreciation expense in 2014 due to the impairment recorded at ppl montana for the corette plant and the write-down of assets in conjunction with the termination of the operating lease at the colstrip facility, both of which occurred in 2013.

(a)   the increase in 2014 compared with 2013 was primarily due to debt issuances at wpd (west midlands) in october 2013, lg&amp;e and ku in november 2013 and ppl electric in june 2014 and july 2013. partially offsetting the increase was repayment of debt at ppl energy supply in july and december 2013.

the increase in 2013 compared with 2012 was primarily due to debt issuances at ppl capital funding in march 2013, june 2012 and october 2012, ppl electric in july 2013 and august 2012, and wpd (east midlands) in april 2012. partially offsetting the increase was the repayment of ppl energy supply debt in july 2013.

(b)   includes afudc. the increase in 2014 compared with 2013 was primarily due to the holtwood hydroelectric expansion project placed in service in november 2013.

(a)   the valuation allowances recorded on ppl's state deferred tax assets primarily relate to pennsylvania net operating loss carryforwards. pennsylvania requires that each corporation file a separate income tax return and has significant annual limitations on the deduction for net operating loss carryforwards. currently, pennsylvania allows an annual maximum deduction equal to the greater of $4 million or 25% of taxable income. legislation enacted in 2013 increased the annual maximum deduction to the greater of $5 million or 30% of taxable income for tax years beginning in 2015.

as a result of the ppl energy supply spinoff announcement, ppl recorded $50 million of deferred income tax expense during 2014 to adjust the valuation allowance on deferred tax assets primarily for state net operating loss carryforwards that were previously supported by the earnings of ppl energy supply.

during 2013 and 2012, ppl recorded $24 million and $9 million of state deferred income tax expense related to a deferred tax valuation allowance primarily due to a decrease in projected future taxable income over the remaining carryforward period of pennsylvania net operating losses.

(b)   changes in state apportionment resulted in reductions to the future estimated state tax rate at december 31, 2014 and 2012, and an increase to the future estimated state tax rate at december 31, 2013. ppl recorded an insignificant deferred tax benefit in 2014, a $15 million deferred tax expense in 2013 and a $19 million deferred tax benefit in 2012 related to its state deferred tax liabilities.

(c)   in may 2013, the u.s. supreme court reversed the december 2011 ruling, by the u.s. court of appeals for the third circuit, concerning the creditability of u.k. windfall profits tax for u.s. federal income tax purposes. as a result of this decision, ppl recorded a tax benefit of $44 million during 2013. see note 5 to the financial statements for additional information.

ppl recorded a tax benefit of $7 million during 2013 and $6 million during 2012 to federal and state income tax reserves related to stranded cost securitization. the reserve balance at december 31, 2013 related to stranded costs securitization was zero.

(d)   during 2012, ppl recorded $16 million in federal and state income tax expense related to the filing of the 2011 federal and state income tax returns. of this amount, $5 million relates to the reversal of prior years' state income tax benefits related to regulated depreciation. ppl changed its method of accounting for repair expenditures for tax purposes effective for its 2008 tax year.

(e)   during 2014, ppl recorded $47 million of income tax expense primarily attributable to taxable dividends.

during 2013, ppl recorded $28 million income tax expense resulting from increased taxable dividends offset by a $19 million income tax benefit associated with a ruling obtained from the irs impacting the recalculation of 2010 u.k. earnings and profits that was reflected on an amended 2010 u.s. tax return.

during 2012, ppl recorded a $23 million adjustment to federal income tax expense related to the recalculation of 2010 u.k. earnings and profits.

(f)   the u.k.'s finance act 2013, enacted in july 2013, reduced the u.k. statutory income tax rate from 23% to 21% effective april 1, 2014 and from 21% to 20% effective april 1, 2015. as a result, ppl reduced its net deferred tax liabilities and recognized a $97 million deferred tax benefit in 2013 related to both rate decreases.

the u.k.'s finance act 2012, enacted in july 2012, reduced the u.k. statutory income tax rate from 25% to 24% retroactive to april 1, 2012 and from 24% to 23% effective april 1, 2013. as a result, ppl reduced its net deferred tax liabilities and recognized a $75 million deferred tax benefit in 2012 related to both rate decreases.

see note 5 to the financial statements for additional information on income taxes.
income (loss) from discontinued operations (net of income taxes)
income (loss) from discontinued operations (net of income taxes) primarily includes the results of operations of the montana hydroelectric generating facilities for all periods presented.  see "discontinued operations - montana hydro sale" in note 8 to the financial statements for additional information.  income (loss) from discontinued operations (net of income taxes) increased by $120 million in 2014 compared with 2013 primarily due to the gain on the sale of the montana hydroelectric generating facilities, and decreased by $6 million in 2013 compared with 2012 primarily due to lower energy margins due to lower energy prices.

excluding special items, earnings in 2014 compared with 2013 decreased, primarily due to lower margins resulting from lower energy and capacity prices, partially offset by favorable baseload asset performance, gains on certain commodity positions, net benefits of unusually cold weather in the first quarter of 2014 and lower financing costs.
excluding special items, earnings in 2013 compared with 2012 decreased, primarily due to lower baseload energy prices and higher depreciation, partially offset by higher capacity prices, higher nuclear generation volume and lower operation and maintenance expense.

(a)   the decrease in 2014 compared with 2013 was primarily due to a $65 million impairment charge in 2013 related to the corette plant and the elimination of $20 million of rent expense associated with the colstrip lease which was terminated in december 2013. the increase in 2013 compared with 2012 was primarily due to the $65 million impairment charge in 2013 related to the corette plant, partially offset by lower fossil and hydroelectric expenses of $24 million, largely driven by lower outage expenses in 2013. see note 16 to the financial statements for additional information on the corette plant impairment.

(b)   the increase in 2014 compared with 2013 was primarily due to project expenses, including refueling outage expenses.

66
(c)   the decrease in 2013 compared with 2012 was primarily due to smgt filing under chapter 11 of the u.s. bankruptcy code. $11 million of receivables billed to smgt were fully reserved in 2012.

loss on lease termination a $697 million charge was recorded in 2013 for the termination of the colstrip operating lease to facilitate the sale of the montana hydroelectric generating facilities.  see note 8 to the financial statements for additional information.
depreciation depreciation decreased by $2 million in 2014 compared with 2013, primarily due to decreases of $15 million from the impairment recorded at ppl montana for the corette plant and the write-down of assets in conjunction with the termination of the operating lease at the colstrip facility, both of which occurred in 2013.  these decreases were partially offset by increases of $13 million from pp&e additions in part due to the completed ppl holtwood project in 2013.  see note 16 to the financial statements for additional information on the corette impairment and note 8 to the financial statements for information on the colstrip operating lease termination.
depreciation increased by $27 million in 2013 compared with 2012 primarily due to net pp&e additions.
taxes, other than income taxes, other than income increased by $4 million in 2014 compared with 2013 due to an $8 million increase in state gross receipts tax offset by a $4 million decrease in state capital stock tax.
other income (expense) - net other income (expense) - net decreased by $2 million in 2014 compared with 2013 and increased by $13 million in 2013 compared with 2012.  the decrease in 2014 compared with 2013 resulted from 2013 including a gain of $8 million related to adjustments to liabilities for a ppl energy supply former mining subsidiary partially offset by a $5 million increase in 2014 in net earnings on ndt funds.  the increase in 2013 compared with 2012 primarily related to the former mining subsidiary's gains discussed above.

(a)   the decrease in 2014 compared with 2013 was primarily due to the repayment of debt in july and december 2013.

(b)   the increase in 2014 compared with 2013 was primarily due to the holtwood hydroelectric expansion project placed in service in november 2013.

(a)   changes in state apportionment resulted in reductions to the future estimated state tax rate at december 31, 2014 and 2012, and an increase to the future estimated state tax rate at december 2013. ppl energy supply recorded an insignificant deferred tax benefit in 2014, a $15 million deferred tax expense in 2013, and a $19 million deferred tax benefit in 2012 related to its state deferred tax liabilities.

67
(b)   during 2013 and 2012, ppl energy supply recorded deferred tax benefits related to investment tax credits on progress expenditures for the holtwood hydroelectric plant expansion. see note 8 to the financial statements for additional information.

(c)   during 2013, ppl energy supply reversed $3 million in tax benefits related to a 2008 change in method of accounting for certain expenditures for tax purposes and recorded $4 million in federal tax expense related to differences in over (under) payment interest rates applied to audit claims as a result of the u.s. supreme court decision related to windfall profits tax.

see note 5 to the financial statements for additional information on income taxes.

income (loss) from discontinued operations (net of income taxes)
income (loss) from discontinued operations (net of income taxes) primarily includes the results of operations of the montana hydroelectric generating facilities for all periods presented.  see "discontinued operations - montana hydro sale" in note 8 to the financial statements for additional information.  income (loss) from discontinued operations (net of income taxes) increased by $191 million in 2014 compared with 2013 primarily due to the gain on the sale of the montana hydroelectric generating facilities, and decreased by $14 million in 2013 compared with 2012 primarily due to lower energy margins due to lower energy prices.

excluding a special item, pre-tax earnings in 2014 compared with 2013 increased, primarily due to returns on additional transmission and distribution improvement capital investments, lower other operation and maintenance expense and a benefit from a change in estimate of a regulatory liability, partially offset by higher interest expense and depreciation.
pre-tax earnings in 2013 compared with 2012 increased, primarily due to higher distribution base rates that became effective january 1, 2013, returns on additional transmission capital investments, and lower operation and maintenance expense due to lower storm costs, partially offset by higher depreciation.

margins
"pennsylvania gross delivery margins" is a non-gaap financial performance measure that management utilizes as an indicator of the performance of its business.  see ppl's "results of operations - margins" for information on why management believes this measure is useful and for explanations of the underlying drivers of the changes between periods.
the following tables contain the components from the statements of income that are included in this non-gaap financial measure and a reconciliation to "operating income."

earnings in 2014 compared with 2013 decreased primarily due to higher operation and maintenance expense driven by the timing and scope of scheduled generation maintenance outages, higher bad debt expense, storm-related expenses, higher financing costs and higher depreciation expense partially offset by returns on additional environmental capital investments and higher sales volumes.  the changes in sales volumes were driven by unusually cold weather in the first quarter of 2014.
excluding special items, earnings in 2013 compared with 2012 increased primarily due to higher electricity and gas base rates that went into effect january 1, 2013 and returns on additional environmental capital investments.
the table below quantifies the changes in the components of net income between these periods, which reflect amounts classified as margins and certain items that management considers special on separate lines within the table and not in their respective statement of income line items.  see ppl's "results of operations - segment earnings - kentucky regulated segment" for details of the special items.

margins
"margins" is a non-gaap financial performance measure that management utilizes as an indicator of the performance of its business.  see ppl's "results of operations - margins" for an explanation of why management believes this measure is useful and the underlying drivers of the changes between periods.  within ppl's discussion, lke's margins are referred to as "kentucky gross margins."
the following tables contain the components from the statements of income that are included in this non-gaap financial measure and a reconciliation to "operating income."

earnings in 2014 compared with 2013 increased primarily due to returns on additional environmental capital investments and higher sales volume partially offset by higher operation and maintenance driven by storm-related expenses, financing costs, depreciation and income tax expense.  the changes in sales volume were driven by unusually cold weather in the first quarter of 2014.
earnings in 2013 compared with 2012 increased primarily due to higher electricity and gas base rates that went into effect january 1, 2013 and returns on additional environmental capital investments.

(a)   a result of the 2012 rate case.

other income (expense) - net other income (expense) - net increased by $5 million in 2013 compared with 2012 primarily due to losses from the eei investment recorded in 2012.  the eei investment was fully impaired in the fourth quarter of 2012.
76
other-than-temporary impairments other-than-temporary impairments decreased by $25 million in 2013 compared with 2012 due to a $25 million pre-tax impairment of the eei investment in 2012.  see notes 1 and 16 to the financial statements for additional information.
interest expense interest expense increased by $7 million in 2014 compared with 2013 primarily due to the issuance of $250 million of first mortgage bonds in november 2013.
income taxes income taxes increased by $54 million in 2013 compared with 2012 primarily due to the change in pre-tax income.

(ppl and ppl energy supply)
a significant portion of ppl's supply segment and ppl energy supply's operating cash flows is derived from its competitive baseload generation activities.  see note 8 to the financial statements for information on the anticipated spinoff of ppl energy supply, expected to occur during the second quarter of 2015.  ppl energy supply employs a formal hedging program for its baseload generation fleet, the objective of which is to provide a reasonable level of near-term cash flow and earnings certainty while preserving upside potential over the medium term to benefit from power price increases.  see note 17 to the financial statements for further discussion.  despite ppl energy supply's hedging practices, future cash flows from operating activities are influenced by energy and capacity prices and, therefore, will fluctuate from period to period.
78
ppl's and ppl energy supply's contracts for the sale and purchase of electricity and fuel often require cash collateral or cash equivalents (e.g. letters of credit), or reductions or terminations of a portion of the entire contract through cash settlement, in the event of a downgrade of ppl's or its subsidiaries' or ppl energy supply's or its subsidiaries' credit ratings or adverse changes in market prices.  for example, in addition to limiting its trading ability, if ppl's or its subsidiaries' ratings were lowered to below "investment grade" or a further downgrade of ppl energy supply's or its subsidiaries' credit ratings and there was a 10% adverse movement in energy prices, ppl and ppl energy supply estimate that, based on their december 31, 2014 positions, they would have been required to post additional collateral of approximately $427 million for ppl and approximately $321 million for ppl energy supply with respect to electricity and fuel contracts.  ppl and ppl energy supply had adequate liquidity sources at december 31, 2014 if they would have been required to post this additional collateral.  ppl and ppl energy supply have in place risk management programs that are designed to monitor and manage exposure to volatility of cash flows related to changes in energy and fuel prices, interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates, counterparty credit quality and the operating performance of generating units.
(ppl)
ppl had a $546 million increase in cash provided by operating activities in 2014 compared with 2013.
·   net income improved by $606 million between the periods. however, this included an additional $478 million of net non-cash benefits, including a $426 million charge in 2013 to terminate the operating lease arrangement for interests in the colstrip facility in montana and acquire the previously leased interests, a $411 million decrease in unrealized losses on hedging activities, and a $246 million pre-tax gain in 2014 on the sale of the montana hydroelectric generation facilities. these non-cash benefits were partially offset by a $568 million increase in deferred income tax expense. the net $128 million increase from net income and non-cash adjustments in 2014 compared with 2013 reflects the $271 million payment in december 2013, to terminate the operating lease arrangement for interests in the colstrip facility in montana and acquire the previously leased interests, partially offset by a decline in unregulated gross energy margins in 2014.

·   the $440 million increase in cash from changes in working capital was partially due to an increase in taxes payable (primarily due to increased taxable income in 2014), a change in uncertain tax positions between the periods, lower returns of counterparty collateral and changes in accounts receivable and unbilled revenue.

·   the $166 million decrease in cash from other operating activities was partially due to net proceeds of $104 million for settlement in 2013 of forward starting interest rate swaps.

ppl had a $93 million increase in cash from operating activities in 2013 compared with 2012.
·   net income declined by $400 million between the periods, but included net non-cash charges of $545 million. these net non-cash charges included a charge of $426 million in 2013 to terminate the operating lease arrangement for interests in the colstrip facility in montana and acquire the previously leased interests, $209 million of higher unrealized losses on hedging activities and $135 million of changes to the wpd line loss accrual. these non-cash charges were partially offset by a $352 million decrease in deferred income taxes. the net $145 million increase from net income and non-cash adjustments between the periods was primarily due to higher revenues and margins from regulated utility operations, partially offset by the $271 million payment in december 2013 to terminate the operating lease arrangement for interests in the colstrip facility and acquire the previously leased interests and lower unregulated gross energy margins.

·   the $332 million decrease in cash from changes in working capital was primarily due to increases in accounts receivable (primarily due to extended payment terms at lg&amp;e and ku, higher rates and colder weather in 2013 at lg&amp;e, ku and ppl electric and increases at ppl energy supply's mechanical contracting business) and changes to certain tax-related accounts.

·   the $236 million increase in cash provided by other operating activities was partially due to net proceeds of $104 million for settlement in 2013 of forward starting interest rate swaps.

(ppl energy supply)
ppl energy supply had a $52 million increase in cash provided by operating activities in 2014 compared with 2013.
79
·   net income improved by $639 million between the periods, however, this included an additional $656 million of net non-cash benefits, including a $315 million pre-tax gain in 2014 on the sale of the montana hydroelectric generation facilities, a $426 million charge in 2013 to terminate the operating lease arrangement for interests in the montana colstrip facility and acquire the previously leased interests, and $167 million of lower unrealized losses on hedging activities. these non-cash benefits were partially offset by a $270 million decrease in deferred income tax benefits. the net $17 million decline from net income and non-cash adjustments in 2014 compared with 2013 reflects lower unregulated gross energy margins, higher operation and maintenance expenses and other factors. cash provided by operating activities in 2014 included a $176 million payment to ppl in november 2014 to satisfy the tax liability related to the gain on the sale of the ppl montana hydroelectric facilities. cash provided by operating activities in 2013 included a $271 million payment in december in connection with terminating the operating lease arrangement for interests in the montana colstrip facility and acquiring the previously leased interests.

·   pension funding was $78 million lower in 2014.

ppl energy supply had a $374 million decrease in cash from operating activities in 2013 compared with 2012.  net income declined by $704 million between the periods, but included net non-cash charges of $313 million.  these net non-cash charges included a charge of $426 million in 2013 to terminate the operating lease arrangement for interests in the montana colstrip facility and acquire the previously leased interests associated with the lease termination, $212 million of higher unrealized losses on hedging activities, and a $65 million charge in 2013 for the impairment of the corette facility.  these non-cash charges were partially offset by a $448 million decline in deferred income taxes.  the net $391 million decline from net income and non-cash adjustments in 2013 compared with 2012 was primarily due to a $271 million payment in december 2013, also in connection with terminating the operating lease arrangement for interests in the montana colstrip facility and acquiring the previously leased interests.  the decrease in cash between the periods also reflects lower unregulated gross energy margins in 2013 compared with 2012.
(ppl electric)
ppl electric had a $90 million increase in cash provided by operating activities in 2014 compared with 2013.
·   net income improved by $54 million between the periods. however, this included an additional $53 million of net non-cash benefits, primarily due to a decrease in deferred income tax expense.

·   pension funding was $70 million lower in 2014.

ppl electric had a $134 million increase in cash from operating activities in 2013 compared with 2012.
·   net income improved by $73 million between the periods and included net non-cash charges of $31 million. the $104 million increase in cash in 2013 versus 2012 was primarily due to higher distribution base rates that became effective january 1, 2013 and higher transmission margins from additional capital investments.

·   the $52 million increase in cash from other operating activities was partially due to changes in certain tax-related accounts.

(lke)
lke had a $79 million increase in cash provided by operating activities in 2014 compared with 2013.
·   lke's non-cash components of net income included a $195 million increase in deferred income taxes primarily due to an increase in accelerated tax depreciation over book depreciation as a result of additional assets in service in 2014.

·   the decrease in cash from working capital was driven primarily by an increase in income tax receivable and a decrease of income tax payable from ppl as a result of the use of excess tax depreciation deductions, and an increase in inventory due to increased coal purchases in anticipation of a cold december similar to that of 2013, partially offset by decreases in accounts receivable and unbilled revenues due to extended payment terms, higher rates and colder december weather in 2013.

·   the decrease in cash from lke's other operating activities was driven primarily by $86 million in proceeds from the settlement of interest rate swaps received in 2013.

80
lke had a $176 million increase in cash provided by operating activities in 2013 compared with 2012.
·   lke's non-cash components of net income included a $121 million increase in deferred income taxes primarily due to utilization of net operating losses.

·   the decrease in cash from working capital was driven primarily by increases in accounts receivable and unbilled revenues due to extended payment terms, higher rates and colder december weather in 2013, offset by an increase in accounts payable due to timing of fuel purchase commitments and payments.

·   the increase in cash from lke's other operating activities was driven primarily by $86 million in proceeds from the settlement of interest rate swaps.

(lg&e)
lg&e had a $5 million increase in cash provided by operating activities in 2014 compared with 2013.
·   lg&amp;e's non-cash components of net income included a $92 million increase in deferred income taxes primarily due to an increase in accelerated tax depreciation over book depreciation as a result of additional assets in service in 2014.

·   the decrease in cash from working capital was driven primarily by an increase in income tax receivable from lke as a result of the use of excess tax depreciation deductions, and an increase in accounts receivable from affiliates, partially offset by decreases in accounts receivable and unbilled revenues due to extended payment terms, higher rates and colder december weather in 2013.

·   the decrease in cash from lg&amp;e's other operating activities was driven primarily by $43 million in proceeds from the settlement of interest rate swaps received in 2013.

lg&e had a $61 million increase in cash provided by operating activities in 2013 compared with 2012.
·   the increase in cash from working capital was driven primarily by an increase in accounts payable due to timing of fuel purchase commitments and payments and an increase in accrued taxes due to decreased payments for property taxes in 2013, partially offset by increases in accounts receivable and unbilled revenues due to extended payment terms, higher rates and colder december weather in 2013, and higher fuel and underground gas storage inventory in 2013 attributable to an increase in fuel and natural gas prices.

·   the increase in cash from lg&amp;e's other operating activities was driven primarily by $43 million in proceeds from the settlement of interest rate swaps received in 2013.

(ku)
ku had a $71 million increase in cash provided by operating activities in 2014 compared with 2013.

·   the decrease in cash from working capital was driven primarily by an increase in income tax receivable and a decrease of income tax payable from lke as a result of the use of excess tax depreciation deductions, and an increase in inventory due to increased coal purchases in anticipation of a cold december similar to that of 2013, partially offset by decreases in accounts receivable and unbilled revenues due to extended payment terms, higher rates and colder december weather in 2013 and an increase in accounts payable to affiliates.

·   the decrease in cash from ku's other operating activities was driven primarily by $43 million in proceeds from the settlement of interest rate swaps received in 2013.

(ppl)
for ppl, in 2014 compared with 2013, the decrease in "expenditures for pp&e" was partially due to expenditures made in 2013 for the holtwood hydroelectric expansion project at ppl energy supply and construction of cane run unit 7 for both lg&e and ku, partially offset by expenditures made in 2014 at wpd (primarily due to projects to enhance system reliability and the effect of foreign currency exchange rates).  "acquisitions & divestitures, net" reflects the 2014 sale of ppl montana's hydroelectric generation facilities.  see note 8 to the financial statements for additional information.  the change in "other investing activities" was the result of investing inflow of $164 million, in 2014, from u.s. department of treasury grants for the rainbow and holtwood hydroelectric expansion projects.
for ppl, in 2013 compared with 2012, the change in "expenditures for pp&e" was due to increased spending on projects to enhance system reliability at wpd and ppl electric, the susquehanna-roseland transmission project at ppl electric, environmental air projects at lg&e's mill creek and ku's ghent plants, construction of cane run unit 7 for both lg&e and ku and coal combustion residuals projects at ku's ghent and e.w. brown plants.  the change in "restricted cash and cash equivalent activity" was primarily related to margin deposit returns in 2012 at ppl energy supply.

(ppl)
in 2014, ppl required $1.05 billion less cash from financing activities primarily due to improvements in cash from operations of $546 million and the proceeds of $164 million from the u.s. department of treasury grants (as described in "investing activities" above)  and the use of cash on hand which helped support the significant capital expenditure programs of its subsidiaries.
in 2013, ppl required $1.6 billion additional cash from financing activities primarily to support the significant capital expenditure programs of its subsidiaries.  financing needs were partially mitigated by $93 million of additional cash provided by operating activities.
(ppl energy supply)
in 2014, financing activities included distributions of $836 million to ppl of the proceeds from the ppl montana hydroelectric generation facilities sale, net of a tax liability payment discussed in "operating activities" above, and proceeds from the u.s. department of treasury ppl holtwood tax grant (see note 8 to the financial statements for information on these transactions.  both receipts are included within "investing activities" above.).
in 2013, financing activities included net capital contributions of $1.1 billion from ppl to ppl energy supply to fund the debt maturities discussed below, to repay short-term debt and to terminate the operating lease arrangement for interests in the montana colstrip facility and acquire the previously leased interests.  debt repayments included the $300 million debt maturity and the $437 million repayment of outstanding debt related to the acquisition of the previously leased lower mt. bethel facility.
(ppl electric)
in 2014, ppl electric required $75 million less cash from financing activities to support its significant capital expenditure program, primarily due to the receipt of $150 million on notes receivable from affiliates (as described in "investing activities" above) and improvements in cash from operations of $90 million.

in comparing 2013 with 2012, cash provided by financing activities increased as a result of the long-term debt issuance at lg&e and ku and higher capital contributions from ppl.  the proceeds from the issuance of long-term debt were mainly used for capital expenditures related to environmental air projects and the construction of cane run unit 7.
84
(lg&e)
in comparing 2014 with 2013, cash provided by financing activities increased due to an increase in short-term debt to fund capital expenditures and an increase in contributions from lke, offset by the $250 million of long-term debt issued in november 2013.

forecasted sources of cash
(all registrants)
the registrants expect to continue to have adequate liquidity available from operating cash flows, cash and cash equivalents, credit facilities and commercial paper issuances.  additionally, subject to market conditions, the registrants and their subsidiaries may access the capital markets, and ppl electric, lke, lg&e and ku anticipate receiving equity contributions from their parent or member in 2015.  as a result of the proposed spinoff of ppl energy supply to form talen energy, ppl energy supply does not expect to receive cash equity contributions from its member in 2015.  additionally, under the terms
85
of the spinoff agreements with affiliates of riverstone, ppl energy supply is generally prohibited from making distributions or other payments to ppl or any ppl affiliate that is not a subsidiary of ppl energy supply, with the exception of specific distributions and other payments set forth in the spinoff agreements.  these exceptions are generally limited to a planned distribution from ppl energy supply to ppl during the first quarter of 2015 in an amount not to exceed $191 million.
credit facilities the registrants maintain credit facilities to enhance liquidity, provide credit support and provide a backstop to commercial paper programs.  amounts borrowed under these credit facilities are reflected in "short-term debt" on the balance sheets.  at december 31, 2014, the total committed borrowing capacity under credit facilities and the use of this borrowing capacity were:

(a)   the syndicated credit facilities, as well as ku's letter of credit facility, each contain a financial covenant requiring debt to total capitalization not to exceed 65% for ppl energy supply and 70% for ppl capital funding, ppl electric, lke, lg&amp;e and ku, as calculated in accordance with the facility, and other customary covenants. see note 7 to the financial statements for additional information regarding these credit facilities.

(b)   the commitments under the domestic credit facilities are provided by a diverse bank group, with no one bank and its affiliates providing an aggregate commitment of more than the following percentages of the total committed capacity: ppl - 10%, ppl energy supply - 9%, ppl electric - 6%, lke - 21%, lg&amp;e - 7% and ku - 37%.

(c)   each company pays customary fees under its respective syndicated credit facility, as does ku under its letter of credit facility, and borrowings generally bear interest at libor-based rates plus an applicable margin.

(d)   the facilities contain financial covenants to maintain an interest coverage ratio of not less than 3.0 times consolidated earnings before income taxes, depreciation and amortization and total net debt not in excess of 85% of its rav, calculated in accordance with the credit facility.

(e)   at december 31, 2014, the unused capacity under the u.k. committed credit facilities was approximately $1.4 billion. the commitments under the u.k.'s credit facilities are provided by a diverse bank group with no one bank providing more than 13% of the total committed capacity.

in addition to the financial covenants noted in the table above, the credit agreements governing the above credit facilities contain various other covenants.  failure to comply with the covenants after applicable grace periods could result in acceleration of repayment of borrowings and/or termination of the agreements.  the registrants monitor compliance with the covenants on a regular basis.  at december 31, 2014, the registrants were in compliance with these covenants.  at this time, the registrants believe that these covenants and other borrowing conditions will not limit access to these funding sources.
as a result of the proposed spinoff transaction, ppl energy supply has syndicated a $1.85 billion credit facility which is currently fully committed.  this syndicated credit facility will replace the existing $3 billion ppl energy supply syndicated credit facility and will be effective upon closing of the spinoff transaction.  see "item 1. business" and "financial and operational developments - other financial and operational developments - anticipated spinoff of ppl energy supply" above for additional information.
during the second quarter of 2014, ppl energy supply's corporate credit rating was lowered to below investment grade.  at december 31, 2014, the additional collateral posted as a result of the downgrade was $190 million.  ppl energy supply primarily issued letters of credit under its credit facilities noted above to post the required collateral.  ppl energy supply continues to have adequate access to the capital markets and adequate capacity under its credit facilities and does not expect a material change in its financing costs as a result of the downgrade.

long-term debt and equity securities
(ppl)
ppl and its subsidiaries currently plan to incur, subject to market conditions, approximately $2.2 billion of long-term indebtedness in 2015, of which $600 million is to refinance existing long-term debt.
ppl also plans to issue approximately $200 million of common stock in 2015.
the remaining proceeds will be used to fund capital expenditures and for general corporate purposes.
(ppl energy supply)
subject to market conditions, ppl energy supply may issue long-term debt securities in 2015 to fund its current debt maturity obligations or for general corporate purposes, if necessary.
(ppl electric)
ppl electric currently plans to issue, subject to market conditions, approximately $450 million of long-term indebtedness in 2015, the proceeds of which will be used to fund capital expenditures and for general corporate purposes.
(lke, lg&e and ku)
87
lg&e and ku currently plan to issue, subject to market conditions, approximately $550 million for lg&e and $500 million for ku, of first mortgage bond indebtedness in 2015, the proceeds of which will be used to refinance $500 million of maturing first mortgage bonds for lg&e and ku ($250 million each), to fund capital expenditures and for general corporate purposes.  lke plans to refinance its $400 million bond maturing in 2015 with proceeds from an intercompany loan from a ppl affiliate.
contributions from parent/member (all registrants except ppl)
from time to time, ppl energy supply's and lke's members or the parents of ppl electric, lg&e and ku make capital contributions to subsidiaries.  the proceeds from these contributions are used to fund capital expenditures and for other general corporate purposes and, in the case of lke, to make contributions to its subsidiaries.  ppl energy supply does not expect to receive cash equity contributions from its member in 2015.
forecasted uses of cash
(all registrants)
in addition to expenditures required for normal operating activities, such as purchased power, payroll, fuel and taxes, the registrants currently expect to incur future cash outflows for capital expenditures, various contractual obligations, payment of dividends on its common stock, distributions by ppl energy supply and lke to their members, and possibly the purchase or redemption of a portion of debt securities.
capital expenditures the table below shows the registrants' current capital expenditure projections for the years 2015 through 2019.  expenditures for the domestic regulated utilities are expected to be recovered through rates, pending regulatory approval.

(b)   assumes interest payments through stated maturity or earlier put dates. for ppl, ppl energy supply, lke, lg&amp;e and ku the payments herein are subject to change, as payments for debt that is or becomes variable-rate debt have been estimated and for ppl, payments denominated in british pounds sterling have been translated to u.s. dollars at a current foreign currency exchange rate.

(c)   see note 9 to the financial statements for additional information.

(d)   the amounts include agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding and specify all significant terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed, minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. primarily includes as applicable, the purchase obligations of electricity, coal, nuclear fuel and limestone as well as certain construction expenditures, which are also included in the capital expenditures table presented above. financial swaps (for ppl and ppl energy supply) and open purchase orders that are provided on demand with no firm commitment are excluded from the amounts presented.

(e)   the amounts for ppl include wpd's contractual deficit pension funding requirements arising from actuarial valuations performed in march 2013. the u.k. electricity regulator currently allows a recovery of a substantial portion of the contributions relating to the plan deficit. the amounts also include contributions made or committed to be made in 2015 for ppl's and lke's u.s. pension plans (for ppl energy supply, ppl electric, lg&amp;e and ku includes their share of these amounts). based on the current funded status of these plans, except for wpd's plans, no cash contributions are required. see note 11 to the financial statements for a discussion of expected contributions.

(f)   at december 31, 2014, total unrecognized tax benefits of $20 million for ppl and $15 million for ppl energy supply were excluded from this table as management cannot reasonably estimate the amount and period of future payments. see note 5 to the financial statements for additional information.

(g)   represents contracts to purchase coal, natural gas and natural gas transportation. see note 13 to the financial statements for additional information.

(h)   represents future minimum payments under ovec power purchase agreements through june 2040. see note 13 to the financial statements for additional information.

dividends/distributions
(ppl)
ppl views dividends as an integral component of shareowner return and expects to continue to pay dividends in amounts that are within the context of maintaining a capitalization structure that supports investment grade credit ratings.  future dividends will be declared at the discretion of the board of directors and will depend upon future earnings, cash flows, financial and legal requirements and other relevant factors at the time.  subject to certain exceptions, ppl may not declare or pay any cash dividend or distribution on its capital stock during any period in which ppl capital funding defers interest payments on its 2007 series a junior subordinated notes due 2067 or 2013 series b junior subordinated notes due 2073.  at december 31, 2014, no interest payments were deferred.
(all registrants except ppl)
from time to time, as determined by their respective board of directors or board of managers, the registrants pay dividends or distributions, as applicable, to their respective shareholders or members.  ppl energy supply expects to distribute to its member an amount not to exceed $191 million in the first quarter of 2015.  certain of the credit facilities of ppl energy supply, ppl electric, lke, lg&e and ku include minimum debt covenant ratios that could effectively restrict the payment of dividends or distributions.  see "forecasted sources of cash" above for information on additional restrictions on ppl energy supply's ability to make distributions to its member, ppl.
(all registrants)
see note 7 to the financial statements for these and other restrictions related to distributions on capital interests for the registrants and their subsidiaries.
purchase or redemption of debt securities the registrants will continue to evaluate outstanding debt securities and may decide to purchase or redeem these securities depending upon prevailing market conditions and available cash.
rating agency actions moody's, s&p and fitch have periodically reviewed the credit ratings of the debt of the registrants and their subsidiaries.  based on their respective independent reviews, the rating agencies may make certain ratings revisions or ratings affirmations.  in january 2015, fitch withdrew its ratings for ppl, ppl capital funding, ppl energy supply, ppl electric, lke, lg&e, and ku.
a credit rating reflects an assessment by the rating agency of the creditworthiness associated with an issuer and particular securities that it issues.  the credit ratings of the registrants and their subsidiaries are based on information provided by the registrants and other sources.  the ratings of moody's, s&p and fitch are not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold any securities of the registrants or their subsidiaries.  such ratings may be subject to revisions or withdrawal by the agencies at any time and should be evaluated independently of each other and any other rating that may be assigned to the securities.  the credit ratings of the registrants and their subsidiaries affect their liquidity, access to capital markets and cost of borrowing under their credit facilities.
the following table sets forth the registrants' and their subsidiaries' credit ratings for outstanding debt securities or commercial paper programs as of december 31, 2014.

ratings triggers
(ppl)
as discussed in note 7 to the financial statements, certain of wpd's senior unsecured notes may be put by the holders to the issuer for redemption if the long-term credit ratings assigned to the notes are withdrawn by any of the rating agencies (moody's, s&p, or fitch) or reduced to a non-investment grade rating of ba1 or bb+ in connection with a restructuring event.  a restructuring event includes the loss of, or a material adverse change to, the distribution licenses under which wpd (east midlands), wpd (south west), wpd (south wales) and wpd (west midlands) operate and would be a trigger event for each company.  these notes totaled £3.8 billion (approximately $5.9 billion) nominal value at december 31, 2014.
(all registrants except ppl electric)
various derivative and non-derivative contracts, including contracts for the sale and purchase of electricity and fuel, commodity transportation and storage, interest rate and foreign currency instruments (for ppl), contain provisions that require the posting of additional collateral, or permit the counterparty to terminate the contract, if ppl's, ppl energy supply's, lke's, lg&e's or ku's or their subsidiaries' credit rating, as applicable, were to fall below investment grade. see note 17 to the financial statements for a discussion of "credit risk-related contingent features," including a discussion of the potential additional collateral requirements for ppl, ppl energy supply, lke and lg&e for derivative contracts in a net liability position at december 31, 2014.
guarantees for subsidiaries (ppl and ppl energy supply)
ppl and ppl energy supply guarantee certain consolidated affiliate financing arrangements.  some of the guarantees contain financial and other covenants that, if not met, would limit or restrict the consolidated affiliates' access to funds under these financing arrangements, accelerate maturity of such arrangements or limit the consolidated affiliates' ability to enter into certain transactions.  at this time, ppl and ppl energy supply believe that these covenants will not limit access to relevant funding sources.  see note 13 to the financial statements for additional information about guarantees.
off-balance sheet arrangements (all registrants)
the registrants have entered into certain agreements that may contingently require payment to a guaranteed or indemnified party.  see note 13 to the financial statements for a discussion of these agreements.
risk management market risk
(all registrants)
see notes 1, 16, and 17 to the financial statements for information about the registrants' risk management objectives, valuation techniques and accounting designations.

the forward-looking information presented below provides estimates of what may occur in the future, assuming certain adverse market conditions and model assumptions.  actual future results may differ materially from those presented.  these disclosures are not precise indicators of expected future losses, but only indicators of possible losses under normal market conditions at a given confidence level.
commodity price risk (non-trading)
(ppl, lke, lg&e, and ku)
lg&e's and ku's retail electric and natural gas rates and municipal wholesale electric rates are set by regulatory commissions and the fuel costs incurred are directly recoverable from customers.  as a result, lg&e and ku are subject to commodity price risk for only a small portion of on-going business operations.  lg&e and ku sell excess economic generation to maximize the value of the physical assets at times when the assets are not required to serve lg&e's or ku's customers.  see note 17 to the financial statements for additional information.
(ppl and ppl electric)
ppl electric is exposed to market price and volumetric risks from its obligation as plr.  the puc has approved a cost recovery mechanism that allows ppl electric to pass through to customers the cost associated with fulfilling its plr obligation.  this cost recovery mechanism substantially eliminates ppl electric's exposure to market price risk.  ppl electric also mitigates its exposure to volumetric risk by entering into full-requirement energy supply contracts for the majority of its plr obligations.  these supply contracts transfer the volumetric risk associated with the plr obligation to the energy suppliers.
(ppl and ppl energy supply)
ppl energy supply segregates its non-trading activities into two categories:  hedge activity and economic activity.  transactions that are accounted for as hedge activity qualify for hedge accounting treatment.  the economic activity category includes transactions that address a specific risk, but were not eligible for hedge accounting or for which hedge accounting was not elected.  this activity includes the changes in fair value of positions used to hedge a portion of the economic value of ppl energy supply's competitive generation assets and full-requirement sales and retail contracts.  this economic activity is subject to changes in fair value due to market price volatility of the input and output commodities (e.g., fuel and power).  although they do not receive hedge accounting treatment, these transactions are considered non-trading activity.  see note 17 to the financial statements for additional information.
to hedge the impact of market price volatility on ppl energy supply's energy-related assets, liabilities and other contractual arrangements, ppl energy supply both sells and purchases physical energy at the wholesale level under ferc market-based tariffs throughout the u.s. and enters into financial exchange-traded and over-the-counter contracts.  ppl energy supply's non-trading commodity derivative contracts range in maturity through 2019.
the following tables sets forth the changes in the net fair value of non-trading commodity derivative contracts at december 31.  see notes 16 and 17 to the financial statements for additional information.

ppl energy supply sells electricity, capacity and related services and buys fuel on a forward basis to hedge the value of energy from its generation assets.  if ppl energy supply were unable to deliver firm capacity and energy or to accept the delivery of fuel under its agreements, under certain circumstances it could be required to pay liquidating damages.  these damages would be based on the difference between the market price and the contract price of the commodity.  depending on price changes in the wholesale energy markets, such damages could be significant.  extreme weather conditions, unplanned power plant outages, transmission disruptions, nonperformance by counterparties (or their counterparties) with which it has energy contracts and other factors could affect ppl energy supply's ability to meet its obligations, or cause significant increases in the market price of replacement energy.  although ppl energy supply attempts to mitigate these risks, there can be no assurance that it will be able to fully meet its firm obligations, that it will not be required to pay damages for failure to perform, or that it will not experience counterparty nonperformance in the future.

interest rate risk (all registrants)
the registrants and their subsidiaries issue debt to finance their operations, which exposes them to interest rate risk.  the registrants and their subsidiaries utilize various financial derivative instruments to adjust the mix of fixed and floating interest rates in their debt portfolios, adjust the duration of their debt portfolios and lock in benchmark interest rates in anticipation of future financing, when appropriate.  risk limits under the risk management program are designed to balance risk exposure to volatility in interest expense and changes in the fair value of the debt portfolios due to changes in the absolute level of interest rates.
the following interest rate hedges were outstanding at december 31.

foreign currency risk (ppl)
ppl is exposed to foreign currency risk, primarily through investments in u.k. affiliates.  in addition, ppl's domestic operations may make purchases of equipment in currencies other than u.s. dollars.  see note 1 to the financial statements for additional information regarding foreign currency translation.
ppl has adopted a foreign currency risk management program designed to hedge certain foreign currency exposures, including firm commitments, recognized assets or liabilities, anticipated transactions and net investments.  in addition, ppl enters into financial instruments to protect against foreign currency translation risk of expected earnings.
the following foreign currency hedges were outstanding at december 31.

ndt funds - securities price risk (ppl and ppl energy supply)
in connection with certain nrc requirements, ppl susquehanna maintains trust funds to fund certain costs of decommissioning the ppl susquehanna nuclear plant (susquehanna).  at december 31, 2014, these funds were invested primarily in domestic equity securities and fixed-rate, fixed-income securities and are reflected at fair value on the balance sheets.  the mix of securities is designed to provide returns sufficient to fund susquehanna's decommissioning and to compensate for inflationary increases in decommissioning costs.  however, the equity securities included in the trusts are exposed to price fluctuation in equity markets, and the values of fixed-rate, fixed-income securities are primarily exposed to changes in interest rates.  ppl actively monitors the investment performance and periodically reviews asset allocation in accordance with its nuclear decommissioning trust policy statement.  at december 31, 2014, a hypothetical 10% increase in interest rates and a 10% decrease in equity prices would have resulted in an estimated $73 million reduction in the fair value of the trust assets, compared with $66 million at december 31, 2013.  see notes 16 and 20 to the financial statements for additional information regarding the ndt funds.
(all registrants)
defined benefit plans - securities price risk see "application of critical accounting policies - defined benefits" for additional information regarding the effect of securities price risk on plan assets.
98
credit risk credit risk is the risk that the registrants would incur a loss as a result of nonperformance by counterparties of their contractual obligations.  the registrants maintain credit policies and procedures with respect to counterparty credit (including requirements that counterparties maintain specified credit ratings) and require other assurances in the form of credit support or collateral in certain circumstances in order to limit counterparty credit risk.  however, the registrants, as applicable, have concentrations of suppliers and customers among electric utilities, financial institutions and other energy marketing and trading companies.  these concentrations may impact the registrants' overall exposure to credit risk, positively or negatively, as counterparties may be similarly affected by changes in economic, regulatory or other conditions.
(ppl and ppl energy supply)
ppl energy supply includes the effect of credit risk on its fair value measurements to reflect the probability that a counterparty will default when contracts are out of the money (from the counterparty's standpoint).  in this case, ppl energy supply would have to sell into a lower-priced market or purchase in a higher-priced market.  when necessary, ppl energy supply records an allowance for doubtful accounts to reflect the probability that a counterparty will not pay for deliveries ppl energy supply has made but not yet billed, which are reflected in "unbilled revenues" on the balance sheets.
(ppl and ppl electric)
in 2013, the puc approved ppl electric's plr procurement plan for the period of june 2013 through may 2015.  to date, ppl electric has conducted all of its planned competitive solicitations.  in 2014, ppl electric filed a request with the puc for approval of ppl electric's plr procurement plan for the period of june 2015 through may 2017, which was approved in january 2015.
under the standard supply master agreement (the agreement) for the competitive solicitation process, ppl electric requires all suppliers to post collateral if their credit exposure exceeds an established credit limit.  in the event a supplier defaults on its obligation, ppl electric would be required to seek replacement power in the market.  all incremental costs incurred by ppl electric would be recoverable from customers in future rates.  at december 31, 2014, most of the successful bidders under all of the solicitations had an investment grade credit rating from s&p, and were not required to post collateral under the agreement.  a small portion of bidders were required to post an insignificant amount of collateral under the agreement.  there is no instance under the agreement in which ppl electric is required to post collateral to its suppliers.
see notes 13, 14, 16 and 17 to the financial statements for additional information on the competitive solicitation process, the agreement, credit concentration and credit risk.
foreign currency translation (ppl)
the value of the british pound sterling fluctuates in relation to the u.s. dollar.  in 2014, changes in this exchange rate resulted in a foreign currency translation loss of $290 million, which primarily reflected a $680 million decrease to pp&e and goodwill offset by a decrease of $390 million to net liabilities.  in 2013, changes in this exchange rate resulted in a foreign currency translation gain of $150 million, which primarily reflected a $330 million increase to pp&e and goodwill offset by an increase of $180 million to net liabilities.  in 2012, changes in this exchange rate resulted in a foreign currency translation gain of $99 million, which primarily reflected a $181 million increase to pp&e offset by an increase of $82 million to net liabilities.  the impact of foreign currency translation is recorded in aoci.
(all registrants)
related party transactions the registrants are not aware of any material ownership interests or operating responsibility by senior management in outside partnerships, including leasing transactions with variable interest entities, or other entities doing business with the registrants.  see note 14 to the financial statements for additional information on related party transactions for ppl energy supply, ppl electric, lke, lg&e and ku.
99
acquisitions, development and divestitures the registrants from time to time evaluate opportunities for potential acquisitions, divestitures and development projects.  development projects are reexamined based on market conditions and other factors to determine whether to proceed with the projects, sell, cancel or expand them, execute tolling agreements or pursue other options.  see note 8 to the financial statements for information on significant activities.
(ppl and ppl energy supply)
see note 8 to the financial statements for information on the anticipated spinoff of ppl energy supply and the completed montana hydro sale.
environmental matters
(all registrants except ppl electric)
extensive federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations are applicable to ppl's, ppl energy supply's, lke's, lg&e's and ku's air emissions, water discharges and the management of hazardous and solid waste, as well as other aspects of the registrants' businesses.  the cost of compliance or alleged non-compliance cannot be predicted with certainty but could be material.  in addition, costs may increase significantly if the requirements or scope of environmental laws or regulations, or similar rules, are expanded or changed.  costs may take the form of increased capital expenditures or operating and maintenance expenses, monetary fines, penalties or other restrictions.  many of these environmental law considerations are also applicable to the operations of key suppliers, or customers, such as coal producers and industrial power users, and may impact the cost for their products or their demand for the registrants' services.
the following is a discussion of the more significant environmental matters.  see note 13 to the financial statements and "item 1. business - environmental matters" for additional information on environmental matters.
climate change physical effects associated with climate change could include the impact of changes in weather patterns, such as storm frequency and intensity, and the resultant potential damage, as applicable, to the registrants' generation assets, electricity transmission and delivery systems, as well as impacts on the registrants' customers.  in addition, changed weather patterns could potentially reduce annual rainfall in areas where ppl, ppl energy supply, lke, lg&e and ku have hydroelectric generating facilities or where river water is used to cool their fossil and nuclear (as applicable) powered generators.  the registrants cannot currently predict whether their businesses will experience these potential risks or estimate the cost of their related consequences.
in june 2013, president obama released his climate action plan which reiterates the goal of reducing ghg emissions in the u.s. through such actions as regulating power plant emissions, promoting increased use of renewables and clean energy technology, and establishing more restrictive energy efficiency standards.  additionally, the climate action plan calls for the u.s. to prepare for the impacts of climate change.  requirements related to this could affect the registrants and others in the industry as modifications may be needed to electricity delivery systems to improve the ability to withstand major storms in order to meet those requirements.  as further described below, the epa has proposed rules pursuant to this directive, which it expects to finalize in the second or third quarter of 2015.  the epa has also announced that it will be developing a federal implementation plan which would apply to any states that fail to submit an acceptable state implementation plan.  the administration's increase in its estimate of the "social cost of carbon" (which is used to calculate benefits associated with proposed regulations) from $23.80 to $38 per metric ton for 2015 may also lead to more costly regulatory requirements.
in january 2014, the epa issued a revised proposal to regulate carbon dioxide emissions from new power plants.  the proposed limits for coal-fired plants can only be achieved through carbon capture and sequestration, a technology that is not presently commercially viable and, therefore, effectively preclude the construction of new coal-fired plants.  the proposed standards for new gas-fired plants may also not be continuously achievable.  the preclusion of new coal-fired plants and the compliance difficulties posed for new gas-fired plants could have a significant industry-wide impact.
the epa has also issued a proposed regulation addressing carbon dioxide emissions from existing power plants.  the existing plant proposal contains stringent, state-specific rate-based reduction goals to be achieved in two phases (2020-2029 and 2030 and beyond).  the regulation of carbon dioxide emissions from existing plants could have a significant industry-wide impact depending on the structure and stringency of the final rule and state implementation plans.

waters of the united states on april 21, 2014, the epa and the u.s. army corps of engineers published a proposed rule that could greatly expand the clean water act definition of waters of the united states.  if the definition is expanded as proposed, permits and other regulatory requirements may be imposed for many matters presently not covered (including vegetation management for transmission lines and activities affecting storm water conveyances and wetlands), the implications of which could be significant.  the epa plans to make certain changes to the proposed regulation based on comments received.  the u.s. house and senate are considering legislation to block this regulation.  until a final rule is issued, the registrants cannot predict the outcome of the pending rulemaking.
coal combustion residuals (ccrs)
in june 2010, the epa proposed two approaches to regulating the disposal and management of ccrs (as either hazardous or non-hazardous) under the rcra.  on december 19, 2014, the epa issued its pre-publication version of the rule regulating coal combustion residuals (ccrs), imposing extensive new requirements, including location restrictions, design and operating standards, groundwater monitoring and corrective action requirements and closure and post-closure care requirements on ccr impoundments and landfills that are located on active power plants and are not closed.  under the rule, the epa will regulate ccrs as non-hazardous under subtitle d of rcra and allow beneficial use of ccrs with some restrictions.  the ccr rule will become effective six months after publication in the federal register with publication expected in early 2015.  ppl expects that its plants using surface impoundments for management and disposal of ccrs or the past management of ccrs and continued use to manage waste waters will be most impacted by this rule.  the rule's specific closure requirements for ccr impoundments and landfills may require increases to aros for these facilities at the registrants' coal-fired plants.
ppl, ppl energy supply, lke, lg&e and ku cannot predict how this rule will impact their facilities, but the financial and operational impact could be significant.
effluent limitation guidelines (elgs)
in june 2013, the epa published proposed regulations to revise discharge limitations for steam electric generation wastewater permits.  the proposed limitations are based on the epa review of available treatment technologies and their capacity for reducing pollutants and include new requirements for fly ash and bottom ash transport water and metal cleaning waste waters, as well as new limits for scrubber wastewater and landfill leachate.  the epa's proposed elg regulations also contain some requirements that would affect the inspection and operation of ccr facilities, if finalized as proposed.  the proposal contains several alternative approaches, some of which could significantly impact ppl's, ppl energy supply's, lke's, lg&e's and ku's coal-fired plants.  the final regulation is expected to be issued by the third or fourth quarter of 2015.  at the present time, ppl, ppl energy supply, lke, lg&e and ku are unable to predict the outcome of this matter or estimate a range of reasonably possible costs, but the costs could be significant.  pending finalization of the elgs, certain states (including pennsylvania and kentucky) and environmental groups are proposing more stringent technology-based limits in permit renewals.  depending on the final limits imposed, the costs of compliance could vary significantly from the current capital expenditures projections as discussed in "capital expenditures" above and costs could be imposed ahead of federal timelines.
clean water act 316(b)
the epa's final 316(b) rule for existing facilities became effective on october 14, 2014, and regulates cooling water intake structures and their impact on aquatic organisms.  states are allowed considerable authority to interpret the rule.  the rule requires existing facilities to choose between several options to reduce the impact to aquatic organisms that become trapped against water intake screens (impingement) and to determine the intake structure's impact on aquatic organisms pulled through a plant's cooling water system (entrainment).  plants already equipped with closed-cycle cooling, an acceptable option, would likely not incur substantial costs.  once-through systems would likely require additional technology to comply with the rule.  mill creek unit 1 and brunner island (all units) are the only units expected to be impacted.  ppl, ppl energy supply, lke, lg&e and ku are evaluating compliance strategies but do not presently expect the compliance costs to be material.
101
mats in february 2012, the epa finalized the mats rule requiring fossil-fuel fired plants to reduce emissions of mercury and other hazardous air pollutants by april 16, 2015.  the rule was challenged by industry groups and states, and was upheld by the d.c. circuit court in april 2014.  on november 25, 2014, the u.s. supreme court granted a petition for review of the rule.  the rule provides for a three-year compliance deadline with the potential for a one-year extension as provided under the statute.  lg&e, ku and ppl energy supply have received compliance extensions for certain plants.  ppl, ppl energy supply, lke, lg&e and ku are generally well-positioned to comply with mats, primarily due to recent investments in environmental controls at ppl energy supply and approved ecr plans to install additional controls at some of lg&e's and ku's kentucky plants.
with respect to ppl energy supply's pennsylvania plants, ppl energy supply believes that installation of chemical additive systems and other controls may be necessary at certain coal-fired plants, the capital cost of which is not expected to be significant.  ppl energy supply continues to analyze the potential impact of mats on operating costs.  ppl energy supply is retrofitting the scrubbers at its colstrip, montana plant, the cost of which is not expected to be significant.  ppl energy supply will suspend operations at the corette plant by april 2015 and the plant is expected to be retired in august 2015 due to expected market conditions and costs to comply with the mats requirements.  the corette plant asset group was determined to be impaired in december 2013.  see "application of critical accounting policies - asset impairment (excluding investments)" for additional information.
lg&e's and ku's anticipated retirements of generating units at the cane run and green river plants in 2015 and 2016 are in response to mats and other environmental regulations.  the retirement of these units is not expected to have a material impact on the financial condition or results of operations of ppl, lke, lg&e or ku.
csapr the epa's csapr addresses the interstate transport of fine particulates and ozone.  in accordance with an october 2014 u.s. court of appeals decision, csapr establishes interstate allowance trading programs for sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide emissions from fossil-fueled plants in two phases:  phase 1 in 2015 and phase 2 in 2017.  sulfur dioxide emissions are subject to an annual trading program and nitrogen oxide emissions are subject to annual and ozone season programs.  oral arguments pertaining to outstanding challenges to the epa's csapr will be heard before the d.c. circuit court on february 25, 2015.
although ppl, ppl energy supply, lke, lg&e and ku do not anticipate incurring significant costs to comply with these programs, changes in market or operating conditions could result in impacts that are higher than anticipated.
regional haze under the epa's regional haze programs (developed to eliminate man-made visibility degradation by 2064), states are required to make reasonable progress every decade through the application, among other things, of best available retrofit technology (bart) on power plants commissioned between 1962 and 1977.  to date, the focus of regional haze regulation has been on the western u.s.  as for the eastern u.s., the epa determined that region-wide reductions under the csapr trading program could, in most instances, be utilized under state programs to satisfy bart requirements for sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides.  however, the epa's determination is being challenged by environmental groups and others.
lg&e's mill creek units 3 and 4 are required to reduce sulfuric acid mist emissions because they were determined to have a regional haze impact.  these reductions are required in the regional haze state implementation plan that the kentucky division for air quality submitted to the epa.  lg&e is currently installing sorbent injection technology to comply with these reductions, the costs of which are not expected to be significant.
in montana, the epa finalized a federal implementation plan (fip) of the regional haze rules in september 2012, with stricter emissions limits for ppl energy supply's colstrip units 1 & 2 based on the installation of new controls (no limits or additional controls were specified for colstrip units 3 & 4), and stricter emission limits for the corette plant (which are not based on additional controls).  the cost of the additional controls for colstrip units 1 & 2 could be significant.  ppl energy supply is meeting the stricter permit limits at corette without any significant changes to operations, although other requirements have led to the planned suspension of operations at corette beginning in april 2015 (see "mats" discussion above).  both ppl and environmental groups have appealed the final fip to the u.s. court of appeals for the ninth circuit and litigation is ongoing.
102
national ambient air quality standards in 2008, the epa revised the national ambient air quality standard for ozone.  as a result, states in the ozone transport region (otr), including pennsylvania, are required by the clean air act to impose additional reductions in nitrogen oxide emissions based upon reasonably available control technologies.  the padep is finalizing a rule requiring nitrogen oxide reductions for fossil-fueled plants.  the padep is expected to finalize this rule in early 2015.  the epa proposed to further strengthen the ozone standard in november 2014, which could lead to further nitrogen oxide reductions, particularly for ppl, ppl energy supply, lke, lg&e, and ku fossil-fueled plants within the otr.  the epa is under court order to finalize the standard by october 1, 2015.  states are also obligated to address interstate transport issues associated with new ozone standards through the establishment of "good neighbor" state implementation plans for those states that are found to contribute significantly to another states' non-attainment.  the epa recently sent a policy memo to state agencies to facilitate the development of these plans, including modeling data showing which states are contributing.  the implementation of such plans could have an impact on the structure and stringency of csapr phase 2 reductions (discussed above).
in 2010, the epa finalized a new, more stringent ambient air standard for sulfur dioxide and required states to identify areas that meet the standard and areas that are in "non-attainment".  in july 2013, the epa finalized non-attainment designations for parts of the country, including part of jefferson county in kentucky and part of yellowstone county in montana.  attainment is due for both areas by 2018.  states are working to finalize designations for other areas and in april 2014, the epa proposed timeframes for completing these designations.  ppl, ppl energy supply, lke, lg&e and ku anticipate that some of the measures required for compliance with the csapr, the mats, or the regional haze rules (as discussed above), such as upgraded or new sulfur dioxide scrubbers at certain plants and, in the case of lg&e and ku, the previously announced retirement of coal-fired generating units at the cane run, green river and tyrone plants, will help to achieve compliance with the new sulfur dioxide standard.  if additional reductions were to be required, the financial impact could be significant.  the short-term impact on the corette plant from the epa's final designation of part of yellowstone county in montana as non-attainment is not expected to be significant, as the plant's operations will be suspended by april 2015 and the plant is expected to be retired in august 2015.  in addition, mdeq recently submitted a request to the epa for a determination that this area is in attainment. if the epa agrees with this request, then the deadlines associated with non-attainment would be suspended.
in december 2012, the epa finalized a new, more stringent, annual national ambient air quality standard for fine particulates.  the rules were challenged by the d.c. circuit court and upheld in may 2014.  final designations for the 2012 particulate standard were published in january 2015 identifying non-attainment areas in pennsylvania and kentucky.  ppl energy supply plants in pennsylvania are not expected to be required to make further reductions towards achieving attainment.  in kentucky, mitigation in jefferson county is expected to be supported by projects already underway at cane run and mill creek and in northern kentucky by projects at ghent and trimble county.  states have until 2021 to achieve attainment in non-attainment areas.

defined benefits
(all registrants)
certain of the registrants' subsidiaries sponsor or participate in, as applicable, various qualified funded and non-qualified unfunded defined benefit pension plans and both funded and unfunded other postretirement benefit plans.  these plans are applicable to the majority of the registrants' employees (based on eligibility for their applicable plans).  the registrants and certain of their subsidiaries record an asset or liability to recognize the funded status of all defined benefit plans with an offsetting entry to aoci or in the case of ppl electric, lg&e and ku, regulatory assets and liabilities for amounts that are expected to be recovered through regulated customer rates.  consequently, the funded status of all defined benefit plans is fully recognized on the balance sheets.  see note 11 to the financial statements for additional information about the plans and the accounting for defined benefits.
a summary of plan sponsors by registrant and whether a registrant or its subsidiaries sponsor (s) or participate in and receives allocations (p) from those plans is shown in the table below.

management makes certain assumptions regarding the valuation of benefit obligations and the performance of plan assets.  when accounting for defined benefits, delayed recognition in earnings of differences between actual results and expected or estimated results is a guiding principle.  annual net periodic defined benefit costs are recorded in current earnings based on estimated results.  any differences between actual and estimated results are recorded in aoci, or in the case of ppl electric, lg&e and ku, regulatory assets and liabilities, for amounts that are expected to be recovered through regulated customer rates.  these amounts in aoci or regulatory assets and liabilities are amortized to income over future periods.  the delayed recognition allows for a smoothed recognition of costs over the working lives of the employees who benefit under the plans.  the primary assumptions are:
·   discount rate - the discount rate is used in calculating the present value of benefits, which is based on projections of benefit payments to be made in the future. the objective in selecting the discount rate is to measure the single amount that, if invested at the measurement date in a portfolio of high-quality debt instruments, would provide the necessary future cash flows to pay the accumulated benefits when due.

·   expected return on plan assets - management projects the long-term rates of return on plan assets that will be earned over the life of the plan. these projected returns reduce the net benefit costs the registrants record currently.

·   rate of compensation increase - management projects employees' annual pay increases, which are used to project employees' pension benefits at retirement.

·   health care cost trend rate - management projects the expected increases in the cost of health care.

in addition to the economic assumptions above that are evaluated annually, management must also make assumptions regarding the life expectancy of employees covered under their defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans.  at december 31, 2014, the plan sponsors adopted the new mortality tables issued by the society of actuaries in october 2014 (rp-2014 base tables) for all u.s. defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans.  in addition, plan sponsors updated the basis for estimating projected mortality improvements and selected the irs bb-2d two-dimensional improvement scale on a generational basis for all u.s. defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans.  these new mortality assumptions reflect the recognition of both improved life expectancies and the expectation of continuing improvements in life expectancies.  the use of the new base tables and improvement scale resulted in an increase
104
to u.s. defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit obligations, an increase to future expense and a decrease to funded status.
for the year ended december 31, 2014, ppl's u.s. defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans incurred actuarial losses of $621 million primarily due to the decrease in discount rates and updated mortality assumptions partially offset by asset gains in excess of assumed rates of return.
(ppl)
in selecting the discount rate for its u.k. pension plans, wpd starts with a cash flow analysis of the expected benefit payment stream for its plans.  these plan-specific cash flows are matched against a spot-rate yield curve to determine the assumed discount rate, which uses an iboxx british pounds sterling denominated corporate bond index as its base.  from this base, those bonds with the lowest and highest yields are eliminated to develop an appropriate subset of bonds.  an individual bond matching approach, which is used for the u.s. pension plans as discussed below, is not used for the u.k. pension plans because the universe of bonds in the u.k. is not deep enough to adequately support such an approach.
(all registrants)
in selecting the discount rates for u.s. defined benefit plans, the plan sponsors start with a cash flow analysis of the expected benefit payment stream for their plans.  the plan-specific cash flows are matched against the coupons and expected maturity values of individually selected bonds.  this bond matching process begins with the full universe of aa-rated non-callable (or callable with make-whole provisions) bonds, serving as the base from which those with the lowest and highest yields are eliminated to develop an appropriate subset of bonds.  individual bonds are then selected based on the timing of each plan's cash flows and parameters are established as to the percentage of each individual bond issue that could be hypothetically purchased and the surplus reinvestment rates to be assumed.
to determine the expected return on plan assets, plan sponsors project the long-term rates of return on plan assets using a best-estimate of expected returns, volatilities and correlations for each asset class.  each plan's specific current and expected asset allocations are also considered in developing a reasonable return assumption.
in selecting a rate of compensation increase, plan sponsors consider past experience in light of movements in inflation rates.
the following table provides the weighted-average assumptions used for discount rate, expected return on plan assets and rate of compensation increase at december 31.

in selecting health care cost trend rates, plan sponsors consider past performance and forecasts of health care costs.  at december 31, 2014, the health care cost trend rates for all plans were 7.2% for 2015, gradually declining to an ultimate trend rate of 5.0% in 2020.

asset impairment (excluding investments)
(all registrants except ppl electric)
impairment analyses are performed for long-lived assets that are subject to depreciation or amortization whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that a long-lived asset's carrying amount may not be recoverable.  for these long-lived assets classified as held and used, such events or changes in circumstances are:
·   a significant decrease in the market price of an asset;

·   a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which an asset is being used or in its physical condition;

·   a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate;

·   an accumulation of costs significantly in excess of the amount originally expected for the acquisition or construction of an asset;

·   a current period operating or cash flow loss combined with a history of losses or a forecast that demonstrates continuing losses; or

·   a current expectation that, more likely than not, an asset will be sold or otherwise disposed of significantly before the end of its previously estimated useful life.

for a long-lived asset classified as held and used, an impairment is recognized when the carrying amount of the asset is not recoverable and exceeds its fair value.  the carrying amount is not recoverable if it exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset.  if the asset is impaired, an impairment loss is recorded to adjust the asset's carrying amount to its estimated fair value.  management must make significant judgments to estimate future cash flows, including the useful lives of the assets, the forward prices for revenue and fuel components in the markets where the assets are utilized, the amount of capital and operations and maintenance spending and management's intended use of the assets.  alternate courses of action are considered to recover the carrying amount of a long-lived asset, and estimated cash flows from the "most likely" alternative are used to assess impairment whenever one alternative is clearly the most likely outcome.  if no alternative is clearly the most likely, then a probability-weighted approach is used taking into consideration estimated cash flows from the alternatives.  for assets tested for impairment as of the balance sheet date, the estimates of future cash flows used in that test consider the likelihood of possible outcomes that existed at the balance sheet date, including an assessment of the likelihood of a future sale of the assets.  that assessment is not revised based on events that occur after the balance sheet date.  changes in assumptions and estimates could result in materially different results than those identified and recorded in the financial statements.
(ppl and ppl energy supply)
in september 2012, ppl energy supply announced its intention, beginning in april 2015, to place the corette coal-fired plant in montana in long-term reserve status, suspending the plant's operation, due to expected market conditions and the costs to comply with mats requirements.  ppl energy supply had been monitoring the plant for potential impairment since this announcement and until the fourth quarter of 2013, no impairment was indicated as various price scenarios allowed for recovery of the asset.  during the fourth quarter of 2013, in connection with the completion of its annual business planning process, management updated its fundamental view for long-term power and gas prices.  based upon this fundamental view, management altered its expectations regarding the probability that the corette plant would operate subsequent to its initially being placed in long-term reserve status.  as a result, based on an undiscounted cash flow analysis, the carrying amount for corette was determined to no longer be recoverable.  ppl energy supply performed an internal analysis using an income approach based on discounted cash flows to assess the fair value of the corette asset group.  assumptions used in the fair
107
value assessment were forward energy prices, expectations for demand for energy in corette's market and expected operation and maintenance and capital expenditures that were consistent with assumptions used in the business planning process.  through this analysis, ppl energy supply determined the fair value of the asset group to be negligible.  this resulted in ppl and ppl energy supply recording an impairment charge of $65 million, or $39 million after-tax for the corette plant and related excess emission allowances.  ppl energy supply now expects to retire the corette plant in august 2015.
ppl montana held a joint operating license issued for the kerr dam project.  the license extends until 2035 and, between 2015 and 2025, the confederated salish and kootenai tribes of the flathead nation (the tribes) have the option to purchase, hold and operate the kerr dam project.  the parties submitted the issue of the appropriate amount of the conveyance price to arbitration in february 2013.  in march 2014, the arbitration panel issued its final decision holding that the conveyance price payable by the tribes to ppl montana was $18 million.  as a result of the decision, ppl energy supply performed a recoverability test on the kerr dam project.  ppl energy supply performed an internal analysis using an income approach based on discounted cash flows (a ppl proprietary model) to assess the fair value of the kerr dam project.  assumptions used in the ppl proprietary model were the conveyance price, forward energy price curves, forecasted generation, and forecasted operation and maintenance expenditures that were consistent with assumptions used in the business planning process and a market participant discount rate.  through this analysis, ppl energy supply determined the fair value of the kerr dam project to be $29 million at march 31, 2014, resulting in ppl and ppl energy supply recording an impairment charge of $18 million, or $10 million after-tax. the kerr dam project was included in the sale of the montana hydroelectric facilities and the assets were removed from the balance sheet.
the depressed levels of energy and capacity prices in pjm, as well as management's forward view of these prices using its fundamental pricing models, has put pressure on the recoverability assessment of ppl energy supply's investment in its pennsylvania coal-fired generation assets.  in the fourth quarter of 2013, after updating its fundamental pricing models in conjunction with the annual business planning process, management tested the brunner island and montour plants for impairment and concluded neither plant was impaired as of december 31, 2013.  the recoverability assessment is very sensitive to forward energy and capacity price assumptions, as well as forecasted operation and maintenance and capital spending.  therefore, a further decline in forecasted long-term energy or capacity prices or changes in environmental laws requiring additional capital or operation and maintenance expenditures, could negatively impact ppl energy supply's operations of these facilities and potentially result in future impairment charges for some or all of the carrying value of these plants.  there were no events or changes in circumstances that indicated a recoverability assessment was required to be performed in 2014.  the carrying value of the pennsylvania coal-fired generation assets tested was $2.6 billion as of december 31, 2014 ($1.4 billion for brunner island and $1.2 billion for montour).
see note 13 to the financial statements for additional information on mats and other environmental requirements for coal-fired generation plants.
(all registrants, except ppl electric)
for a long-lived asset classified as held for sale, an impairment exists when the carrying amount of the asset (disposal group) exceeds its fair value less cost to sell.  if the asset (disposal group) is impaired, an impairment loss is recorded to adjust the carrying amount to its fair value less cost to sell.  a gain is recognized in future periods for any subsequent increase in fair value less cost to sell, but not in excess of the cumulative impairment previously recognized.
for determining fair value, quoted market prices in active markets are the best evidence.  however, when market prices are unavailable, ppl, ppl energy supply, lke, lg&e and ku consider all valuation techniques appropriate under the circumstances and for which market participant inputs can be obtained.  generally discounted cash flows are used to estimate fair value, which incorporates market participant inputs when available.  discounted cash flows are calculated by estimating future cash flow streams and determining the present value of the cash flow streams using risk adjusted discount rates.
goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level.  ppl has determined its reporting units to be at the same level as its reportable segments.  ppl energy supply, lke, lg&e and ku each operate within a single reportable segment and single reporting unit.  a goodwill impairment test is performed annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the reporting unit may be greater than the reporting unit's fair value.  additionally, goodwill is tested for impairment after a portion of goodwill has been allocated to a business to be disposed of.
108
ppl, ppl energy supply, lke, lg&e and ku may elect either to initially make a qualitative evaluation about the likelihood of an impairment of goodwill or to bypass the qualitative evaluation and test goodwill for impairment using a two-step quantitative test.  if the qualitative evaluation (referred to as "step zero") is elected and the assessment results in a determination that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than the carrying amount, the two-step quantitative impairment test is not necessary.
when the two-step quantitative impairment test is elected or required as a result of the step zero assessment, in step one, ppl, ppl energy supply, lke, lg&e and ku determine whether a potential impairment exists by comparing the estimated fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount, including goodwill, on the measurement date.  if the estimated fair value exceeds its carrying amount, goodwill is not considered impaired.  if the carrying amount exceeds the estimated fair value, the second step is performed to measure the amount of impairment loss, if any.
the second step of the quantitative test requires a calculation of the implied fair value of goodwill, which is determined in the same manner as the amount of goodwill in a business combination.  that is, the estimated fair value of a reporting unit is allocated to all of the assets and liabilities of that reporting unit as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination and the estimated fair value of the reporting unit was the price paid to acquire the reporting unit.  the excess of the estimated fair value of a reporting unit over the amounts assigned to its assets and liabilities is the implied fair value of goodwill.  the implied fair value of the reporting unit's goodwill is then compared with the carrying amount of that goodwill.  if the carrying amount exceeds the implied fair value, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess.  the loss recognized cannot exceed the carrying amount of the reporting unit's goodwill.
ppl (for its u.k. regulated and kentucky regulated segments), and individually, lke, lg&e and ku elected to perform the qualitative step zero evaluation of goodwill in the fourth quarter of 2014.  these evaluations considered the excess of fair value over the carrying value of each reporting unit that was calculated during step one of the quantitative impairment tests performed in the fourth quarter of 2012, and the relevant events and circumstances that occurred since those tests were performed including:
·   current year financial performance versus the prior year,

·   changes in planned capital expenditures,

·   the consistency of forecasted free cash flows,

·   earnings quality and sustainability,

·   changes in market participant discount rates,

·   changes in long-term growth rates,

·   changes in ppl's market capitalization, and

·   the overall economic and regulatory environments in which these regulated entities operate.

based on the overall favorable results of these evaluations, management did not conclude it was more likely than not that the fair value of these reporting units were less than their carrying values.  as such, the two-step quantitative impairment test was not performed.
ppl (for its supply segment) and ppl energy supply elected to bypass step zero.  therefore, the goodwill for these reporting units was tested for impairment using the quantitative test in the fourth quarter of 2014, and no impairment was recognized.  management used both discounted cash flows and market multiples, which required significant assumptions, to estimate the fair value of the reporting units.  a decrease in the forecasted cash flows of 10%, an increase in the discount rate by 0.25%, or a 10% decrease in the market multiples would not have resulted in an impairment of goodwill for these reporting units.
loss accruals (all registrants)
losses are accrued for the estimated impacts of various conditions, situations or circumstances involving uncertain or contingent future outcomes.  for loss contingencies, the loss must be accrued if (1) information is available that indicates it is probable that a loss has been incurred, given the likelihood of the uncertain future events, and (2) the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated.  accounting guidance defines "probable" as cases in which "the future event or events are likely to occur."  the accrual of contingencies that might result in gains is not recorded unless recovery is assured.  potential loss contingencies for environmental remediation, litigation claims, regulatory penalties and other events are continuously assessed.
109
the accounting aspects of estimated loss accruals include (1) the initial identification and recording of the loss, (2) the determination of triggering events for reducing a recorded loss accrual, and (3) the ongoing assessment as to whether a recorded loss accrual is sufficient.  all three of these aspects require significant judgment by management.  internal expertise and outside experts (such as lawyers and engineers) are consulted, as necessary, to help estimate the probability that a loss has been incurred and the amount (or range) of the loss.
for ppl, see note 6 to the financial statements for a discussion of the ofgem review of line loss calculation, including the $65 million increase to this liability recorded in 2014.
certain other events have been identified that could give rise to a loss, but that do not meet the conditions for accrual.  such events are disclosed, but not recorded, when it is "reasonably possible" that a loss has been incurred.  accounting guidance defines "reasonably possible" as cases in which "the future event or events occurring is more than remote, but less than likely to occur."
when an estimated loss is accrued, the triggering events for subsequently adjusting the loss accrual are identified, where applicable.  the triggering events generally occur when new information becomes known, the contingency has been resolved and the actual loss is settled or written off, or when the risk of loss has diminished or been eliminated.  the following are some of the triggering events that provide for the adjustment of certain recorded loss accruals:
·   allowances for uncollectible accounts are reduced when accounts are written off after prescribed collection procedures have been exhausted, a better estimate of the allowance is determined or underlying amounts are ultimately collected.

·   environmental and other litigation contingencies are reduced when the contingency is resolved and actual payments are made, a better estimate of the loss is determined or the loss is no longer considered probable.

·   actions or decisions by certain regulators could result in a better estimate of a previously recorded loss accrual.

loss accruals are reviewed on a regular basis to assure that the recorded potential loss exposures are appropriate.  this involves ongoing communication and analyses with internal and external legal counsel, engineers, business unit management and other parties.
see notes 6 and 13 to the financial statements for disclosure of loss contingencies accrued and other potential loss contingencies that have not met the criteria for accrual.
asset retirement obligations
(all registrants except ppl electric)
aro liabilities are required to be recognized for legal obligations associated with the retirement of long-lived assets.  the initial obligation is measured at its estimated fair value.  an aro must be recognized when incurred if the fair value of the aro can be reasonably estimated.  an equivalent amount is recorded as an increase in the value of the capitalized asset and amortized to expense over the useful life of the asset.  until the obligation is settled, the liability is increased, through the recognition of accretion expense in the statement of income, for changes in the obligation due to the passage of time.
(ppl, lke, lg&e and ku)
in the case of lg&e and ku, because costs of removal are collected in rates, the depreciation and accretion expenses related to an aro are recorded as a regulatory asset, such that there is no earnings impact.
(all registrants except ppl electric)
see note 19 to the financial statements for additional information on aros.
in determining aros, management must make significant judgments and estimates to calculate fair value.  fair value is developed using an expected present value technique based on assumptions of market participants that considers estimated retirement costs in current period dollars that are inflated to the anticipated retirement date and then discounted back to the date the aro was incurred.  changes in assumptions and estimates included within the calculations of the fair value of aros could result in significantly different results than those identified and recorded in the financial statements.  estimated aro costs and settlement dates, which affect the carrying value of the aro and the related capitalized asset, are reviewed
110
periodically to ensure that any material changes are incorporated into the latest estimate of the aro.  any change to the capitalized asset, positive or negative, is generally amortized over the remaining life of the associated long-lived asset.
at december 31, 2014, the total recorded balances and information on the most significant recorded aros were as follows.

income taxes (all registrants)
significant management judgment is required in developing the provision for income taxes, primarily due to the uncertainty related to tax positions taken or expected to be taken in tax returns, valuation allowances on deferred tax assets and whether the undistributed earnings of wpd are considered indefinitely reinvested.
significant management judgment is required to determine the amount of benefit recognized related to an uncertain tax position.  tax positions are evaluated following a two-step process.  the first step requires an entity to determine whether, based on the technical merits supporting a particular tax position, it is more likely than not (greater than a 50% chance) that the tax position will be sustained.  this determination assumes that the relevant taxing authority will examine the tax position and is aware of all the relevant facts surrounding the tax position.  the second step requires an entity to recognize in the financial statements the benefit of a tax position that meets the more-likely-than-not recognition criterion.  the benefit recognized is measured at the largest amount of benefit that has a likelihood of realization, upon settlement, that exceeds 50%.  management considers a number of factors in assessing the benefit to be recognized, including negotiation of a settlement.
on a quarterly basis, uncertain tax positions are reassessed by considering information known as of the reporting date.  based on management's assessment of new information, a tax benefit may subsequently be recognized for a previously unrecognized tax position, a previously recognized tax position may be derecognized, or the benefit of a previously recognized tax position may be remeasured.  the amounts ultimately paid upon resolution of issues raised by taxing authorities may differ materially from the amounts accrued and may materially impact the financial statements in the future.
at december 31, 2014, it was reasonably possible that during the next 12 months the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits could increase or decrease by as much as the following.
increase      decrease

ppl                                       $20
ppl energy supply                          15
these potential changes could result from subsequent recognition, derecognition and/or changes in the measurement of uncertain tax positions related to the timing and utilization of tax credits and the related impact on alternative minimum tax and other credits, the timing and/or valuation of certain deductions, intercompany transactions and unitary filing groups.  the events that could cause these changes are direct settlements with taxing authorities, litigation, legal or administrative guidance by relevant taxing authorities and the lapse of an applicable statute of limitation.  in addition, for ppl, this change could also relate to the creditability of foreign taxes and the timing and utilization of foreign tax credits.  for ppl electric, lke, lg&e and ku, no significant changes in unrecognized tax benefits are projected over the next 12 months.
111
the balance sheet classification of unrecognized tax benefits and the need for valuation allowances to reduce deferred tax assets also require significant management judgment.  unrecognized tax benefits are classified as current to the extent management expects to settle an uncertain tax position by payment or receipt of cash within one year of the reporting date.  valuation allowances are initially recorded and reevaluated each reporting period by assessing the likelihood of the ultimate realization of a deferred tax asset.  management considers a number of factors in assessing the realization of a deferred tax asset, including the reversal of temporary differences, future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies.  any tax planning strategy utilized in this assessment must meet the recognition and measurement criteria utilized to account for an uncertain tax position.  management also considers the uncertainty posed by political risk and the effect of this uncertainty on the various factors that management takes into account in evaluating the need for valuation allowances.  the amount of deferred tax assets ultimately realized may differ materially from the estimates utilized in the computation of valuation allowances and may materially impact the financial statements in the future.
see note 5 to the financial statements for income tax disclosures, including management's conclusion that the undistributed earnings of wpd are considered indefinitely reinvested.  based on this conclusion, ppl global does not record u.s. income taxes on wpd's undistributed earnings.
regulatory assets and liabilities
(ppl)
wpd operates in an incentive-based regulatory structure under distribution licenses granted by ofgem.  wpd's electricity distribution revenues are set every five years (changing to every eight years beginning on april 1, 2015) through price controls that are not directly based on cost recovery.  therefore, wpd is not subject to accounting for the effects of certain types of regulation as prescribed by gaap and does not record regulatory assets and liabilities.
(all registrants except ppl energy supply)
ppl electric, lg&e and ku, are subject to cost-based rate regulation.  as a result, the effects of regulatory actions are required to be reflected in the financial statements.  assets and liabilities are recorded that result from the regulated ratemaking process that may not be recorded under gaap for non-regulated entities.  regulatory assets generally represent incurred costs that have been deferred because such costs are probable of future recovery in regulated customer rates.  regulatory liabilities are recognized for amounts expected to be returned through future regulated customer rates.  in certain cases, regulatory liabilities are recorded based on an understanding or agreement with the regulator that rates have been set to recover costs that are expected to be incurred in the future, and the regulated entity is accountable for any amounts charged pursuant to such rates and not yet expended for the intended purpose.
management continually assesses whether the regulatory assets are probable of future recovery by considering factors such as changes in the applicable regulatory and political environments, the ability to recover costs through regulated rates, recent rate orders to other regulated entities, and the status of any pending or potential deregulation legislation.  based on this continual assessment, management believes the existing regulatory assets are probable of recovery.  this assessment reflects the current political and regulatory climate at the state and federal levels, and is subject to change in the future.  if future recovery of costs ceases to be probable, the regulatory asset would be written-off.  additionally, the regulatory agencies can provide flexibility in the manner and timing of recovery of regulatory assets.
at december 31, 2014, regulatory assets and regulatory liabilities were recorded as reflected in the table below.  all regulatory assets are either currently being recovered under specific rate orders, represent amounts that are expected to be recovered in future rates or benefit future periods based upon established regulatory practices.

revenue recognition - unbilled revenue (ppl electric, lke, lg&e and ku)
revenues related to the sale of energy are recorded when service is rendered or when energy is delivered to customers.  because customers are billed on cycles which vary based on the timing of the actual meter reads taken throughout the month, estimates are recorded for unbilled revenues at the end of each reporting period.  such unbilled revenue amounts reflect estimates of the deliveries to customers since the date of the last reading of their meters.  the unbilled revenue estimates reflect consideration of factors including daily load models, estimated usage for each customer class, the effect of current and different rate schedules, the meter read schedule, the billing schedule, actual weather data and where applicable, the impact of weather normalization or other regulatory provisions of rate structures.  at december 31, unbilled revenues recorded on the balance sheets were as follows.

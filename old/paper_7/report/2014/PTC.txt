item 7.   management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations forward-looking statements statements in this annual report about anticipated financial results and growth, as well as about the development of our products and markets, are forward-looking statements that are based on our current plans and assumptions. important information about the bases for these plans and assumptions and factors that may cause our actual results to differ materially from these statements is contained below and in item 1a. "risk factors" of this annual report.
unless otherwise indicated, all references to a year reflect our fiscal year that ends on september 30.
executive overview in 2014 we made significant investments in the internet of things (iot) space with our acquisitions of thingworx and axeda, which we believe has established us as a leader in the fast-growing market for smart, connected products. our iot solutions, combined with strong product offerings in our core cad, plm, alm, and slm markets, positions us to deliver new customer opportunities and accelerate growth in 2015 and beyond. from a financial perspective, in 2014 we achieved 5% revenue growth and 13% earnings per share (eps) growth (20% non-gaap eps growth) and we continued to deliver on our margin expansion strategy. we achieved operating margins of 14.5% (25% on a non-gaap basis) compared to 10% in 2013 (22% on a non-gaap basis). the improvement in operating margin reflects continued vigilance on cost controls and cost savings from restructuring actions, increased sales productivity, improvements in services gross margins, and lower restructuring charges. these favorable effects on operating margin were partially offset by incremental costs from acquired businesses, investments we are making in our iot business, and annual merit salary increases for employees.
we delivered gaap eps of $1.34 for 2014, up from $1.19 for 2013, and non-gaap eps of $2.17, up from $1.81 in 2013. our gaap results reflect tax benefits of $18 million in 2014 and $37 million in 2013 related to the reversal of a portion of the valuation allowance on net deferred tax assets in the u.s. and a foreign jurisdiction as a result of accounting for acquisitions, and an $8 million tax benefit in 2013 associated with accounting for our u.s. pension plan. non-gaap measures are reconciled to gaap results under results of operations - non-gaap measures below.
for 2014, total revenue was up 5% year over year. on an organic basis, excluding revenue of $23 million from businesses acquired in 2014 and the fourth quarter of 2013, total revenue was up 3% year over year.  total license revenue for 2014 was $370 million, an increase of 7% year over year.  on an organic basis (excluding license revenue of $8 million from acquired businesses), total license revenue was up 5% year over year.  our revenue in 2014 was adversely impacted by volatility in the global manufacturing industry. from a geographic perspective, organic license revenue in the americas and europe in 2014 was strong, with double digit growth over 2013 in europe, following declines in both regions from 2012 to 2013. we saw declines in japan license revenue in 2014, following double digit growth in 2013, due in part to unfavorable movements in the yen and higher large deals in japan in 2013. we saw double digit year-over-year declines in license revenue in the pacific rim following modest growth in 2013. we believe results in the pacific rim, including china, were impacted by adverse macroeconomic conditions in that region. our service revenue in 2014 was flat year over year, down 3% on an organic basis, which is in part due to expansion of our service partner program, under which certain service opportunities are referred to partners.  our support revenue in 2014 was up 6% year over year, up 5% on an organic basis.
we generated $305 million of cash from operations in 2014, up 36% from $225 million in 2013, and we borrowed $354 million under our credit facility to fund acquisitions and stock repurchases. we used $324 million of cash to acquire thingworx, atego and axeda and $225 million to repurchase stock. at september 30, 2014, the balance outstanding under our credit facility was $612 million and we had $408 million available to borrow under the revolving loan portion of our credit facility, the availability of which is limited based on financial covenants in the facility. we ended 2014 with $294 million of cash, up from $242 million at the end 2013.
acquisitions
12
as discussed above, we acquired thingworx, inc. in the second quarter of 2014 for approximately $112 million and axeda corporation in the fourth quarter of 2014 for approximately $166 million. thingworx is a small but highly-innovative creator of an award-winning platform to build and run applications designed to leverage the iot. axeda is a developer of solutions to securely connect machines and sensors to the cloud. axeda had historical annualized revenue of approximately $25 million.
as part of our strategy to supplement and expand our other businesses, we also acquired atego group limited, a european-based developer of model-based systems and software engineering applications for approximately $46 million in cash on june 30, 2014. atego enhances our portfolio of alm and plm solutions and strengthens our commitment to supporting our customers' systems engineering initiatives. atego had historical annualized revenue of approximately $20 million. in the aggregate, these 2014 acquisitions contributed $10 million to our 2014 revenue.
expanded share repurchase authorization and expanded credit facility on august 4, 2014, we announced a capital allocation strategy that over time is expected to return approximately 40% of free cash flow to shareholders while still enabling us to invest in organic and new growth opportunities.  as part of this strategy, our board of directors has authorized us to repurchase up to $600 million of our common shares through september 30, 2017. under this authorization, we borrowed $125 million under our credit facility to repurchase shares of our common stock in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014 under an accelerated share repurchase (asr) agreement.
additionally, in the fourth quarter of 2014, we entered into a new $1.5 billion credit facility with a syndicate of existing and new banks consisting of a $500 million term loan and a $1 billion revolving loan facility. the new facility, which replaced our previous $1.0 billion credit facility, matures on september 15, 2019.
restructuring of our workforce in the fourth quarter of 2014, in support of integrating businesses acquired in the past year and the continued evolution of our business model, we committed to a plan to restructure our workforce and recorded a restructuring charge of $27 million attributable to termination benefits associated with 283 employees which will primarily be paid in fiscal 2015. we expect that the annualized cost savings of the restructuring actions will be approximately $30 million, which effect is contemplated in our financial targets for fiscal 2015.
future expectations, strategies and risks the slowdown in the global manufacturing industry, uncertainty about the economic environment and volatility in foreign currency exchange rates are headwinds for revenue growth in fiscal 2015. while we saw indications of improvements in global manufacturing economic conditions in 2014, recent economic indicators raise renewed concerns about the economic climate, particularly in europe, china and japan. because of this level of uncertainty, and current unfavorable euro and yen to u.s. dollar exchange rates relative to 2014, we expect only modest revenue growth in 2015. we expect an increase in non-gaap operating margin to 26% through a combination of: (1) increasing our non-gaap professional services gross margin toward our longer-term goal of 20% by 2018; (2) further expanding our professional services partner ecosystem to reduce professional services revenue as a percentage of total revenue; (3) enhancing sales force productivity and efficiency; (4) implementing solutions that require shorter sales cycles and less professional services; (5) continued vigilance on cost control; and (6) driving revenue growth across our existing markets while capitalizing on new opportunities, such as the trend toward smart, connected products and the internet of things.
for 2015, we expect year-over-year revenue to grow 0% to 2%. this revenue goal includes perpetual license & subscription solutions revenue growth of 4% to 10%, support revenue growth of approximately 1%, and a decline in professional services revenue of approximately 6%. our 2015 earnings goals are to achieve non-gaap operating margin expansion of 100 basis points, from 25% in 2014 to 26% in 2015 (expansion of gaap operating margins from approximately 14% in 2014 to 16% in 2015) and non-gaap earnings per share of $2.33 to $2.40 (gaap earnings per share of $1.33 to $1.40). if economic conditions do not improve or deteriorate further, or if foreign currency exchange rates relative to the u.s. dollar differ significantly from our current assumed rates, our results could differ materially from our targets. our targets assume rates of $1.25 usd to one euro and 115 yen to one usd.
our 2015 targets exclude settlement losses related to the termination of our u.s. pension plan. while we expect to complete the termination process by september 30, 2015, the amount of the losses and timing of the charge is subject to the timing of regulatory approvals and the projected benefit obligations and assets in the plan measured as of the dates the settlements occur. we currently estimate the pre-tax settlement losses to be approximately $65 million.
13
also, our results have been impacted, and we expect will continue to be impacted, by our ability to close large transactions. the amount of revenue, particularly license revenue, attributable to large transactions, and the number of such transactions, may vary significantly from quarter to quarter based on customer purchasing decisions and macroeconomic conditions. our growth rates have become increasingly dependent on adoption of our solutions by large direct customers. such transactions tend to be larger in size and may have long lead times as they often follow a lengthy product selection and evaluation process. this may cause volatility in our results.
a majority of our software license sales to date have been perpetual licenses, where customers own the software license and revenue is recognized at the time of sale. due to evolving customer preferences as well as acquisitions we have made in the iot and cloud services space, a small but growing percentage of our business consists of ratably recognized subscriptions. under a subscription, customers do not own the software but pay a periodic fee for the right to use our software, including access to technical support. while we expect a significant majority of our customer base to continue to purchase our software solutions under a perpetual licensing arrangement, we are also offering subscription pricing as an option for most products starting in 2015. through 2014 we reported revenue by three lines of business: (1) license; (2) service; and (3) support. beginning in the first quarter of 2015 we plan to report revenue as follows: (1) perpetual license & subscription solutions (which includes subscription revenue and cloud services); (2) support; and (3) professional services. previously, cloud services revenue was reported in services revenue. the revenue targets below reflect this revised reporting structure. if a greater percentage of our customers elect our subscription offering than our base case assumption, it will have an adverse impact on revenue, operating margin, cash flow and eps growth relative to our targets above.
impact of an investigation in china we have been cooperating to provide information to the u.s. securities and exchange commission and the department of justice concerning payments and expenses by certain of our business partners in china and/or by employees of our chinese subsidiary that raise questions concerning compliance with laws, including the u.s. foreign corrupt practices act. our internal review is ongoing and we continue to respond to requests for information from these agencies, including a subpoena issued to the company by the sec. we cannot predict when or how this matter may be resolved. resolution of this matter could include fines and penalties; however we are unable to estimate an amount that could be associated with any resolution and, accordingly, we have not recorded a liability for this matter. if resolution of this matter includes substantial fines or penalties, this could materially impact our results for the period in which the associated liability is recorded or such amounts are paid. further, any settlement or other resolution of this matter could have collateral effects on our business in china, the united states and elsewhere.
we terminated certain employees and business partners in china in connection with this matter, which may have an adverse impact on our level of sales in china. revenue from china has historically represented 5% to 7% of our total revenue.
revenue, operating margin, earnings per share and cash flow the following table shows the financial measures that we consider the most significant indicators of the performance of our business. in addition to providing operating income, operating margin, and diluted earnings per share as calculated under generally accepted accounting principles ("gaap"), it shows non-gaap operating income, operating margin, and diluted earnings per share for the reported periods. these non-gaap measures exclude fair value adjustments related to acquired deferred revenue, acquired deferred costs, stock-based compensation expense, amortization of acquired intangible assets expense, acquisition-related and pension plan termination costs, restructuring charges, certain identified gains or charges included in non-operating other income (expense) and the related tax effects of the preceding items, as well as the tax items identified. these non-gaap measures provide investors another view of our operating results that is aligned with management budgets and with performance criteria in our incentive compensation plans. management uses, and investors should use, non-gaap measures in conjunction with our gaap results. we discuss the non-gaap measures in detail under non-gaap measures below.

(2)   income taxes for non-gaap diluted earnings per share reflect the tax effects of non-gaap adjustments which are calculated by applying the applicable tax rate by jurisdiction to the non-gaap adjustments described in non-gaap measures, and also exclude the following non-operating income and tax items: gaap diluted earnings per share in 2014 includes (i) tax benefits of $18.1 million related to the release of a portion of the valuation allowance as a result of deferred tax liabilities established for acquisitions recorded in 2014 and (ii) a tax charge of $3.5 million to establish valuation allowances against net deferred tax assets in two foreign jurisdictions. gaap diluted earnings per share in 2013 includes (i) tax benefits of $36.7 million related to the release of a portion of the valuation allowance as a result of deferred tax liabilities established for acquisitions recorded in 2013, (ii) tax benefits of $3.2 million relating to the final resolution of a long standing tax litigation matter and completion of an international jurisdiction tax audit, (iii) a tax benefit of $7.9 million related to the release of a portion of the valuation allowance in the u.s. as a result of a pension gain (decrease in unrecognized actuarial loss) recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income, and (iv) a tax benefit of $2.6 million relating to a tax audit in a foreign jurisdiction of an acquired company. gaap diluted earnings per share in 2013 also includes a gain on investment of $0.6 million and a legal settlement gain of $5.1 million. the gaap loss per share in 2012 includes (i) a net tax charge of $124.5 million recorded in the fourth quarter to establish a valuation allowance against our u.s. net deferred tax assets, (ii) $5.4 million, net primarily related to foreign tax credits which would be fully realized on a non-gaap basis, (iii) $3.3 million primarily related to acquired legal entity integration activities, and (iv) $1.4 million related to the impact from a reduction in the statutory tax rate in japan on deferred tax assets from a litigation settlement.
results of operations acquisitions
15
in 2014, we acquired thingworx (on december 30), atego (on june 30) and axeda (on august 11). these acquisitions added $9.8 million ($11.0 million on a non-gaap basis) to our 2014 revenue. in 2013, we completed the acquisitions of servigistics, enigma and netideas. servigistics (acquired on october 2, 2012), enigma and netideas (both acquired in the fourth quarter of 2013) added $94.9 million ($97.9 million on a non-gaap basis) to our 2013 revenue, substantially all of which is included in slm revenue.
impact of foreign currency exchange on results of operations approximately two thirds of our revenue and half of our expenses are transacted in currencies other than the u.s. dollar. currency translation affects our reported results because we report our results of operations in u.s. dollars. changes in currency exchange rates, particularly for the yen and the euro, compared to the prior year increased revenue and decreased expenses in 2014, with lower revenue and expenses in japan offset by higher revenue and expenses in europe, and reduced both revenue and expenses in 2013. if actual reported results were converted into u.s. dollars based on the corresponding prior year's foreign currency exchange rates, 2014 and 2013 revenue would have been lower by $2.1 million and higher by $18.2 million, respectively, and expenses would have been higher by $0.9 million and $8.8 million, respectively. the net impact on year-over-year results would have been a decrease in operating income of $3.0 million in 2014 and an increase in operating income of $9.4 million in 2013. the results of operations, revenue by line of business and revenue by geographic region in the tables that follow present both actual percentage changes year over year and percentage changes on a constant currency basis.
revenue revenue is reported below by line of business (license, service and support), by solution area (cad, extended plm (eplm) and slm & iot) and by geographic region (americas, europe, pacific rim and japan).
results include combined revenue from direct sales and our channel.
the tables below reflect total revenue, which is organic revenue plus revenue from acquired businesses. the references to organic revenue in 2014 and comparisons to 2013 in the discussion below exclude revenue from our 2014 acquisitions of axeda, atego and thingworx and our acquisitions of enigma and netideas in the fourth quarter of 2013. organic revenue in 2013 and comparisons to 2012 in the discussion below exclude revenue from our 2013 acquisitions of servigistics, enigma and netideas. as servigistics was acquired at the beginning of 2013, it is not excluded from organic revenue in 2014.

license revenue the amount of license revenue attributable to large transactions, and the number of such transactions, may vary significantly from period to period and by geographic region. we had six transactions with license revenue in excess of $5 million in 2014 (four in the americas and two in europe), three in 2013 (two in japan and one in the americas) and four in 2012 (two in the americas and two in europe).
2014 compared to 2013
in 2014, compared to the year-ago period, license revenue was up 7% and organic license revenue grew 5%. license revenue in 2014 from axeda, atego, thingworx, enigma and netideas was $8.1 million.
license revenue was strongest in europe with 29% year-over-year growth (26% on a constant currency basis) and our cad and eplm businesses, offsetting year-over-year declines in the pacific rim region, which was down 17%, and the slm business. cad license revenue of $169 million represented our strongest year since 2011 - driven by double digit year-over-year growth in creo modules and upgrades, training software, and certain heritage products. we expect more subdued growth in cad revenue in 2015. eplm license revenue of $162 million grew 8% year over year on a reported and constant currency basis, and 7% on an organic constant currency basis. scm saw strong double digit license growth, plm license sales increased by 5%, and the increase in alm was comparable to the overall performance of eplm on an organic constant currency basis. slm license revenue declined 22% year over year on a reported and constant currency basis, and 27% on an organic constant currency basis. slm license revenue in 2014 was affected by a slower-than-expected rebuild of our pipeline after a strong 2013. looking ahead to 2015, we believe our slm business can reach double digit license growth.
changes in foreign currency exchange rates favorably impacted license revenue by $0.6 million in 2014 compared to 2013.
2013 compared to 2012
the decline in license revenue in 2013 reflected year-over-year declines of 2% in the americas and 12% in europe. these declines were partially offset by growth in japan of 32% (58% on a constant currency basis) and an increase in the pacific rim of 3%. results reflected softness in europe resulting in lower license revenue from large license transactions, particularly sales of eplm products which we attribute to macroeconomic conditions in that region.
organic license revenue in 2013 was down 9% on a year-over-year basis. license revenue from businesses acquired in 2013, which was the primary contributor to growth in slm license revenue in 2013, was $26.8 million.

changes in foreign currency exchange rates unfavorably impacted license revenue by $6.1 million in 2013 compared to 2012.
service revenue consulting and training services engagements typically result from sales of new licenses, particularly of our eplm and slm solutions. expanding our service partner program, under which service engagements are referred to third party service providers, is part of our overall margin expansion strategy. additionally, over time, we anticipate implementing solutions that require less services. as a result, we do not expect that the amount of services we deliver will increase proportionately with license revenue increases. consulting and cloud services revenue has represented approximately 85% of total service revenue and training revenue has represented approximately 15% of total services revenue.
2014 compared to 2013
year over year, service revenue in 2014 was flat, down 3% on an organic basis. in 2014, our consulting service revenue was flat year over year (down 4% on an organic basis). year over year, training revenue was up 2% ($0.8 million) in 2014.
changes in foreign currency exchange rates favorably impacted service revenue by $0.9 million in 2014 compared to 2013.
2013 compared to 2012
year over year, service revenue for 2013 was down overall and on an organic basis. organic service revenue was down 13% ($37.7 million); service revenue from businesses acquired in 2013 was $37.0 million, which was the primary contributor to growth in slm service revenue in 2013. year over year, our organic consulting service revenue was down 14% from 2013 to 2012. year over year, our organic training business was down 6%. we attribute the declines in organic total service revenue and consulting service revenue to lower license revenue and to success in expanding our service partner program.
changes in foreign currency exchange rates unfavorably impacted service revenue by $2.7 million in 2013 compared to 2012.
support revenue support revenue is comprised of contracts to maintain new and/or previously purchased software. we saw steady growth in support revenue in 2013 and 2014.
2014 compared to 2013
excluding seats added with our 2014 acquisitions, total seats under maintenance were up 8% as of the end of 2014 compared to the end of 2013, with cad and eplm support seats up 1% and 8%, respectively. total support revenue increased 6% ($37.6 million) in 2014 compared to 2013, with organic support revenue up 5% ($32.5 million). support revenue from businesses acquired in 2014 and the fourth quarter of 2013 was $5.6 million.
changes in foreign currency exchange rates favorably impacted support revenue by $0.6 million in 2014 compared to 2013.
2013 compared to 2012
organic support revenue increased 2% ($11.6 million) in 2013 compared to 2012. support revenue from businesses acquired in 2013 was $31.1 million,which was the primary contributor to growth in slm support revenue in 2013.
changes in foreign currency exchange rates unfavorably impacted support revenue by $9.4 million in 2013 compared to 2012.
revenue from individual customers we enter into customer contracts that may result in revenue being recognized over multiple reporting periods. accordingly, revenue recognized in a current period may be attributable to contracts entered into during the current period or in prior periods. license and/or service revenue of $1 million or more recognized from individual customers in a single quarter during the fiscal year from contracts entered into during that quarter and/or a prior quarter is shown in the table below. the amount of revenue, particularly license revenue, attributable to such large transactions, and the number of such transactions, may vary significantly from quarter to quarter based on customer purchasing decisions, the completion of large services engagements commenced in previous quarters and macroeconomic conditions.

a significant percentage of our annual revenue comes from large customers in the broader manufacturing space. as a result, license revenue growth in our core cad and eplm products historically has correlated to growth in broader measures of the global manufacturing economy including gdp, industrial production and manufacturing pmi. current indicators suggest the us manufacturing economy is in the early stages of recovery, though the pace and timing remain uncertain. nearly 60% of our annual revenue is outside the us, where manufacturing indicators appear to be weaker. gdp and pmi data in the eurozone and japan suggest manufacturing economies in those regions are slowing, while manufacturing activity in china remains subdued versus earlier levels. for 2015, our financial targets assume a slower rate of growth in the manufacturing economies of europe, japan, and the pacific rim relative to the u.s.

gross margin as a percentage of total revenue in 2014 compared to the year-ago period reflects higher license and services margins. the increases in our gaap service gross margin since 2012 were due in part to improved consulting margin. service margins have improved due to cost reductions, improved efficiencies and a reduction in the amount of direct services that we perform through expansion of our service partner program. service margin in 2014 reflects improvements in the first half of the year offset by a decrease in the second half due in part to excess capacity, which we addressed with our restructuring actions in the fourth quarter. additionally, we are making investments in select strategic customer engagements, which we expect to continue to unfavorably impact service margins in the first half of 2015. service revenue comprised 22% of our total revenue in 2014 compared to 23% in 2013 and 24% in 2012.
gross margin as a percentage of total revenue in 2013 compared to the year-ago period reflects higher service margins, partially offset by lower license margins primarily attributable to lower license revenue and higher amortization of acquired purchased software.

(2)   headcount at september 30, 2014 included approximately 250 employees with termination dates after september 30, 2014 that were included in our fourth quarter of 2014 restructuring actions.
2014 compared to 2013
costs and expenses in 2014, compared to 2013, decreased primarily as a result of:
•   restructuring charges, which were $23.8 million lower in 2014; and
•   cost savings resulting from restructuring actions in 2013.
these cost decreases were offset by:
21
•   costs from acquired businesses (approximately 300 employees);
•   investments we are making in the internet of things solutions area of our business;
•   company-wide merit pay increases totaling approximately $12 million on an annualized basis, which were effective february 1, 2014;
•   increased amortization of acquired intangible assets, which was $5.2 million higher in 2014; and
•   increased acquisition-related and pension plan termination costs, which were $3.2 million higher.
2013 compared to 2012
costs and expenses in 2013 compared to 2012 increased primarily as a result of the following:
•   restructuring charges of $52.2 million in 2013 compared to $24.9 million in 2012, primarily for severance and other related costs associated with the termination of approximately 550 employees;
•   an increase in employee headcount as a result of our acquisitions in 2013 (an aggregate of approximately 485 employees);
•   company-wide merit pay increases effective on february 1, 2012 (approximately $11 million on an annualized basis), which resulted in an increase in salary expense across all functional organizations;
•   acquisition-related costs (included in general and administrative) of $9.9 million, which were $6.0 million higher than 2012; and
•   increased amortization of acquired intangible assets, primarily related to our acquisition of servigistics.
these cost increases were partially offset by cost savings associated with restructuring actions in 2012 and 2013 and the impact of foreign currency movements which favorably impacted costs and expenses by $8.8 million in 2013.

total compensation, benefit costs and travel costs were 5% ($4.0 million) higher in 2013 compared to 2012 due to higher headcount.

amortization of acquired intangible assets reflects the amortization of acquired non-product related intangible assets, primarily customer and trademark-related intangible assets, recorded in connection with completed acquisitions. the increase in amortization of acquired intangible assets in 2014 includes our acquisitions of axeda and atego in the fourth quarter of 2014, our acquisition of thingworx in the second quarter of 2014 and our acquisitions of enigma and netideas in the fourth quarter of 2013.
the increase in amortization of acquired intangible assets in 2013 was primarily due to our acquisition of servigistics.

in september 2014, in support of integrating businesses acquired in the past year and the continued evolution of our business model, we committed to a plan to restructure our workforce and recorded a restructuring charge of $26.8 million attributable to termination benefits associated with 283 employees which will primarily be paid in fiscal 2015. we expect that the annualized cost savings of the restructuring actions will be approximately $30 million, which effect is contemplated in our financial targets for fiscal 2015. in addition, in 2014 we recorded restructuring charges of $1.6 million, primarily associated with the completion of the restructuring actions initiated in the fourth quarter of 2013.
in 2013, to improve profitability, we implemented restructuring actions and recorded restructuring charges of $52.2 million, including $50.9 million for severance and related costs associated with approximately 550 employees and $1.3 million related to facility consolidations. these restructuring actions were substantially completed in 2013 and resulted in $16 million per quarter reduction in operating expenses (which was reflected in our results for 2014).
to reduce costs and to realign our business, in 2012, we implemented a restructuring of our business and recorded restructuring charges of $24.9 million, primarily for severance and related costs associated with approximately 210 employees. we realized approximately $13 million of operating expense savings from these reductions in 2012.
in 2014, 2013 and 2012, we made cash payments related to restructuring charges of $20.6 million, $37.2 million and $20.9 million, respectively. at september 30, 2014, accrued expenses for unpaid restructuring charges totaled $26.4 million, which we expect to pay within the next twelve months.

foreign currency net losses: foreign currency net losses include costs of hedging contracts, certain realized and unrealized foreign currency transaction gains or losses, and foreign exchange gains or losses resulting from the required period-end currency re-measurement of the assets and liabilities of our subsidiaries that use the u.s. dollar as their functional currency. because a large portion of our revenue and expenses is transacted in foreign currencies, we engage in hedging transactions involving the use of foreign currency forward contracts to reduce our exposure to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates. foreign currency losses in 2012 included $0.8 million related to mks legal entity mergers.
interest income: interest income represents earnings on the investment of our available cash balances and interest on financing provided to customers as described in note b summary of significant accounting policies of "notes to consolidated financial statements" in this annual report.
interest expense: interest expense is primarily related to interest on borrowings under our credit facility. the increase in interest expense in 2014 and 2013, compared to the respective prior year, is due to higher average amounts outstanding under our credit facility in those years. we had $612 million outstanding under the credit facility at september 30, 2014, compared to $258 million at september 30, 2013 and $370 million at september 30, 2012, which included $230 million in proceeds drawn from our credit facility in the fourth quarter of 2012 to finance the servigistics acquisition (which closed on october 2, 2012). the balance outstanding at september 30, 2014 reflects amounts borrowed in 2014 for our acquisitions of thingworx and axeda, and $125 million borrowed in the fourth quarter of 2014 to finance our accelerated share repurchase transaction. the average interest rate on amounts outstanding under the credit facility was 1.6% in 2014, 1.7% in 2013 and 1.8% in 2012.
other income (expense), net: the change in other income (expense), net in 2014 and 2013, compared to 2012, was due primarily to a legal settlement gain of $5.1 million recorded in 2013.

in 2014, our effective tax rate was lower than the 35% statutory federal income tax rate due to our corporate structure in which our foreign taxes are at a net effective tax rate lower than the u.s. rate and the reversal of a portion of our valuation allowance against net deferred tax assets described below. other factors impacting the rate include foreign withholding taxes of $5.1 million and the establishment of a valuation allowance totaling $3.5 million in two foreign subsidiaries.
in 2013, our effective tax rate was lower than the 35% statutory federal income tax rate due, in large part, to the reversal of a portion of the valuation allowance against deferred tax assets (primarily the u.s.). we recorded benefits of $36.7 million resulting from 2013 acquisitions, as described below, and a benefit of $7.9 million related to the release of a valuation allowance as a result of a pension gain recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income in equity.  additionally, our 2013 tax provision reflects a $2.0 million provision related to a research and development (r&d) cost sharing prepayment by a foreign subsidiary to the u.s. a similar prepayment was made in 2012, resulting in a $7.8 million provision in that year. this impact was offset by a corresponding increase in our valuation allowance in the u.s. other factors impacting the rate include our corporate structure in which our foreign taxes are at an effective tax rate lower than the u.s. rate, foreign withholding taxes of $6.0 million and non-cash tax benefits of $5.3 million recorded as a result of the conclusion of tax audits in several foreign jurisdictions.
acquisitions in 2014 and 2013 were accounted for as business combinations.  assets acquired, including the fair value of acquired tangible assets, intangible assets and assumed liabilities were recorded, and we recorded net deferred tax liabilities of $21.6 million and $38.7 million in 2014 and 2013, respectively, primarily related to the tax effect of the acquired intangible assets that are not deductible for income tax purposes.  these deferred tax liabilities reduced our net deferred tax asset balance and resulted in a tax benefit of $18.1 million and $36.7 million in 2014 and 2013, respectively, to decrease our valuation allowance in jurisdictions where we have recorded a valuation allowance.  as these decreases in the valuation allowance are not part of the accounting for business combinations (the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed), they were recorded as an income tax benefit.
in 2012, our effective tax rate was higher than the 35% statutory federal income tax rate due primarily to the recording of a $124.5 million charge to the income tax provision related to the establishment of a valuation allowance on u.s. net deferred tax assets as described below. this increase was offset in part as a result of our corporate structure in which our foreign taxes are at an effective tax rate lower than the u.s. rate. our 2012 provision included a non-cash charge of $4.2 million related to the restructuring of our canadian operations that resulted in a change in the tax status of the foreign legal entity and a non-cash charge of $1.4 million related to the impact of a japanese legislative change on our japan entity's deferred tax assets. these charges were excluded from our non-gaap earnings per share (see non-gaap measures below). additionally, our 2012 tax provision reflects a $7.8 million provision related to a research and development cost sharing prepayment by a foreign subsidiary to the u.s. a comparable prepayment was made in 2011.
in the fourth quarter of 2012, we recorded a $124.5 million non-cash charge to the income tax provision to establish a valuation allowance against substantially all of our u.s. net deferred tax assets. we weighed all available evidence, both positive and negative, and concluded that it was more likely than not (a likelihood of more than 50 percent) that substantially all of our u.s. deferred tax assets will not be realized. the realization of deferred tax assets, including carryforwards and deductible temporary differences, depends on the existence of sufficient taxable income of the same character during the carryback or carryforward period. we considered all sources of taxable income available to realize the deferred tax assets, including the future reversal of existing temporary differences, future taxable income exclusive of reversing temporary differences and carryforwards, taxable income in prior carryback years and tax-planning strategies.
on september 30, 2014, we executed a business realignment in which intellectual property was transferred between two wholly-owned foreign subsidiaries.  the realignment allows us to more efficiently manage the distribution of our products to european customers. there was no impact to the tax provision for this transaction in 2014.  however, we expect this realignment to result in an annual tax benefit of approximately $15 million to $20 million for the next several years, declining annually thereafter through 2021.
in the normal course of business, ptc and its subsidiaries are examined by various taxing authorities, including the internal revenue service (irs) in the united states. we regularly assess the likelihood of additional assessments by tax
26
authorities and provide for these matters as appropriate. we are currently under audit by tax authorities in several jurisdictions. audits by tax authorities typically involve examination of the deductibility of certain permanent items, limitations on net operating losses and tax credits. although we believe our tax estimates are appropriate, the final determination of tax audits and any related litigation could result in material changes in our estimates.
our future effective income tax rate may be materially impacted by the amount of income taxes associated with our foreign earnings, which are taxed at rates different from the u.s. federal statutory income tax rate, as well as the timing and extent of the realization of deferred tax assets and changes in the tax law. further, our tax rate may fluctuate within a fiscal year, including from quarter to quarter, due to items arising from discrete events, including settlements of tax audits and assessments, the resolution or identification of tax position uncertainties, and acquisitions of other companies.
non-gaap measures the non-gaap measures presented in the above discussion of our results of operations and the respective most directly comparable gaap measures are:
•   non-gaap revenue-gaap revenue
•   non-gaap gross margin-gaap gross margin
•   non-gaap operating income-gaap operating income
•   non-gaap operating margin-gaap operating margin
•   non-gaap net income-gaap net income (loss)
•   non-gaap diluted earnings per share-gaap diluted earnings (loss) per share the non-gaap measures exclude fair value adjustments related to acquired deferred revenue, acquired deferred costs, stock-based compensation expense, amortization of acquired intangible assets expense, acquisition-related charges, restructuring charges, pension plan termination-related costs, identified discrete items included in non-operating other income (expense), net and the related tax effects of the preceding items, and any other identified tax items. these items are normally included in the comparable measures calculated and presented in accordance with gaap.
fair value of acquired deferred revenue is a purchase accounting adjustment recorded to reduce acquired deferred revenue to the fair value of the remaining obligation.
stock-based compensation expense is non-cash expense relating to stock-based awards issued to executive officers, employees and outside directors, consisting of restricted stock, stock options and restricted stock units.
amortization of acquired intangible assets expense is a non-cash expense that is impacted by the timing and magnitude of our acquisitions. we believe the assessment of our operations excluding these costs is relevant to our assessment of internal operations and comparisons to the performance of other companies in our industry.
charges included in general and administrative expenses include acquisition-related charges and pension plan termination-related costs. acquisition-related charges include direct costs of potential and completed acquisitions and expenses related to acquisition integration activities, including transaction fees, due diligence costs, severance and professional fees. in addition, subsequent adjustments to our initial estimated amount of contingent consideration associated with specific acquisitions are included within acquisition-related charges. these costs are not considered part of our normal operations as the occurrence and amount will vary depending on the timing and size of acquisitions. in the second quarter of 2014, we began the process of terminating a u.s. pension plan. costs associated with the termination are not considered part of our ongoing operations.
restructuring charges include excess facility restructuring charges and severance costs resulting from reductions of personnel driven by modifications to our business strategy and not as part of our normal operations. these costs may vary in size based on our restructuring plan.
we use these non-gaap measures, and we believe that they assist our investors, to make period-to-period comparisons of our operational performance because they provide a view of our operating results without items that are not, in our view, indicative of our core operating results. we believe that these non-gaap measures help illustrate underlying trends in our business, and we use the measures to establish budgets and operational goals, communicated internally and externally, for managing our business and evaluating our performance. we believe that providing non-gaap measures affords investors a view of our operating results that may be more easily compared to the results of peer companies. in addition, compensation of our executives is based in part on the performance of our business based on these non-gaap measures.
27
the items excluded from the non-gaap measures often have a material impact on our financial results and such items often recur. accordingly, the non-gaap measures included in this annual report should be considered in addition to, and not as a substitute for or superior to, the comparable measures prepared in accordance with gaap.
the following tables reconcile each of these non-gaap measures to its most closely comparable gaap measure on our financial statements.

(1)   represents acquisition-related charges and costs of $0.4 million in 2014 related to terminating a u.s. pension plan.
(2)   non-operating gain (loss) adjustments: in 2013, we recorded a $0.6 million gain on an investment related to an acquisition and a legal settlement gain of $5.1 million. in 2012, we recorded $0.8 million of foreign currency losses related to mks legal entity mergers.
(3)   income tax adjustments reflect the tax effects of non-gaap adjustments which are calculated by applying the applicable tax rate by jurisdiction to the non-gaap adjustments listed above, and also include any identified tax items. in the fourth quarter of 2012, a valuation allowance was established against our u.s. net deferred tax assets and in the fourth quarter of 2014 a valuation allowance was established against net deferred tax assets in two foreign jurisdictions. as the u.s. is profitable on a non-gaap basis, the non-gaap tax provision is being calculated assuming there is no u.s. valuation allowance. additionally, the following identified tax items have been excluded from the non-gaap tax results. gaap diluted earnings per share in 2014 includes (i) tax benefits of $18.1 million related to the release of a portion of the valuation allowance as a result of deferred tax liabilities established for acquisitions recorded in 2014 and (ii) a tax charge of $3.5 million to establish a valuation allowance against net deferred tax assets in two foreign jurisdictions. gaap diluted earnings per share in 2013 includes (i) tax benefits of $36.7 million related to the release of a portion of the valuation allowance as a result of deferred tax liabilities established for acquisitions recorded in 2013, (ii) tax benefits of $3.2 million relating to the final resolution of a long standing tax litigation matter and completion of an international jurisdiction tax audit, (iii) a tax benefit of $7.9 million related to the release of a portion of the valuation allowance in the u.s. as a result of a pension gain (decrease in unrecognized actuarial loss) recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income and (iv) a tax benefit of $2.6 million relating to a tax audit in a foreign jurisdiction of an acquired company. the gaap loss per share in 2012 includes (i) a net tax charge of $124.5 million recorded in the fourth quarter to establish a valuation allowance against our u.s. net deferred tax asset, (ii) $5.4 million, net primarily related to foreign tax credits which would be fully realized on a non-gaap basis, (iii) $3.3 million primarily related to acquired legal entity integration activities, and (iv) $1.4 million related to the impact from a reduction in the statutory tax rate in japan on deferred tax assets from a litigation settlement.
(4)   gaap weighted average shares outstanding for 2012 of 118.7 million shares excludes the effect of stock-based compensation awards due to a gaap net loss in 2012.
(5)   diluted earnings per share impact of non-gaap adjustments is calculated by dividing the dollar amount of the non-gaap adjustment by the diluted weighted average shares outstanding for the respective year. non-gaap weighted average shares for 2012 of 121.0 million shares includes the dilutive effect of stock-based compensation awards of 2.3 million shares due to non-gaap net income in 2012.
critical accounting policies and estimates we have prepared our consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america. in preparing our financial statements, we make estimates, assumptions and judgments that can have a significant impact on our reported revenues, results of operations, and net income, as well as on the value of certain assets and liabilities on our balance sheet. these estimates, assumptions and judgments are necessary because future events and their effects on our results and the value of our assets cannot be determined with certainty, and are made based on our historical experience and on other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. these estimates may change as new events occur or additional information is obtained, and we may periodically be faced with uncertainties, the outcomes of which are not within our control and may not be known for a prolonged period of time.
the accounting policies, methods and estimates used to prepare our financial statements are described generally in note b summary of significant accounting policies of "notes to consolidated financial statements" in this annual report. the most important accounting judgments and estimates that we made in preparing the financial statements involved:
•   revenue recognition;
•   accounting for income taxes;
•   valuation of assets and liabilities acquired in business combinations;
•   valuation of goodwill;
•   accounting for pensions; and
•   legal contingencies.
a critical accounting policy is one that is both material to the presentation of our financial statements and requires us to make subjective or complex judgments that could have a material effect on our financial condition and results of operations. critical accounting policies require us to make assumptions about matters that are uncertain at the time of the estimate, and different estimates that we could have used, or changes in the estimates that are reasonably likely to occur, may have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations. because the use of estimates is inherent in the financial reporting process, actual results could differ from those estimates.
30
accounting policies, guidelines and interpretations related to our critical accounting policies and estimates are generally subject to numerous sources of authoritative guidance and are often reexamined by accounting standards rule makers and regulators. these rule makers and/or regulators may promulgate interpretations, guidance or regulations that may result in changes to our accounting policies, which could have a material impact on our financial position and results of operations.
revenue recognition we exercise judgment and use estimates in connection with determining the amounts of software license and services revenues to be recognized in each accounting period.
our primary judgments involve the following:
•   determining whether collection is probable;
•   assessing whether the fee is fixed or determinable;
•   determining whether service arrangements, including modifications and customization of the underlying software, are not essential to the functionality of the licensed software and thus would result in the revenue for license and service elements of an agreement being recorded separately; and
•   determining the fair value of services and support elements included in multiple-element arrangements, which is the basis for allocating and deferring revenue for such services and support.
we derive revenues from three primary sources: (1) software licenses, (2) support and (3) services.
we recognize revenue when: (1) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, (2) delivery has occurred (generally, fob shipping point or electronic distribution), (3) the fee is fixed or determinable, and (4) collection is probable.
our software is distributed primarily through our direct sales force. in addition, we have an indirect distribution channel through alliances with resellers. revenue arrangements with resellers are recognized on a sell-through basis; that is, when we deliver the product to the end-user customer. we record consideration given to a reseller as a reduction of revenue to the extent we have recorded revenue from the reseller. we do not offer contractual rights of return, stock balancing, or price protection to our resellers, and actual product returns from them have been insignificant to date. as a result, we do not maintain reserves for reseller product returns.
at the time of each sale transaction, we must make an assessment of the collectability of the amount due from the customer. revenue is only recognized at that time if management deems that collection is probable. in making this assessment, we consider customer credit-worthiness and historical payment experience. at that same time, we assess whether fees are fixed or determinable and free of contingencies or significant uncertainties. in assessing whether the fee is fixed or determinable, we consider the payment terms of the transaction, including transactions with payment terms that extend beyond our customary payment terms, and our collection experience in similar transactions without making concessions, among other factors. we have periodically provided financing to credit-worthy customers with payment terms up to 24 months. if the fee is determined not to be fixed or determinable, revenue is recognized only as payments become due from the customer, provided that all other revenue recognition criteria are met. our software license arrangements generally do not include customer acceptance provisions. however, if an arrangement includes an acceptance provision, we record revenue only upon the earlier of (1) receipt of written acceptance from the customer or (2) expiration of the acceptance period.
our software arrangements often include implementation and consulting services that are sold under consulting engagement contracts or as part of the software license arrangement. when we determine that such services are not essential to the functionality of the licensed software, we record revenue separately for the license and service elements of these arrangements, provided that appropriate evidence of fair value exists for the undelivered services (see discussion below). generally, we consider that a service is not essential to the functionality of the software based on various factors, including if the services may be provided by independent third parties experienced in providing such consulting and implementation in coordination with dedicated customer personnel and whether the services result in significant modification or customization of the software functionality. when consulting services qualify for separate accounting, consulting revenues under time and materials billing arrangements are recognized as the services are performed. consulting revenues under fixed-priced contracts are generally recognized as the services are performed using a proportionate performance model with hours or costs as the input method of attribution. when we provide consulting services considered essential to the functionality of the software, the arrangement does not qualify for separate accounting of the license and service elements, and the license revenue is recognized together with the consulting services using the percentage-of-completion method of contract accounting. under such arrangements, consideration is recognized as the services are performed as measured by an observable input. in these circumstances, we separate license revenue from service revenue for income statement presentation by allocating vendor specific objective evidence (vsoe) of fair value of the consulting services as service revenue and the residual portion as license revenue. under the percentage-of-completion method, we estimate the stage of completion of contracts with fixed or
31
"not to exceed" fees based on hours or costs incurred to date as compared with estimated total project hours or costs at completion. adjustments to estimates to complete are made in the periods in which facts resulting in a change become known. when total cost estimates exceed revenues, we accrue for the estimated losses when identified. the use of the proportionate performance and percentage-of-completion methods of accounting require significant judgment relative to estimating total contract costs or hours (hours being a proxy for costs), including assumptions relative to the length of time to complete the project, the nature and complexity of the work to be performed and anticipated changes in salaries and other costs.
we generally use the residual method to recognize revenue from software arrangements that include one or more elements to be delivered at a future date when evidence of the fair value of all undelivered elements exists, and the elements of the arrangement qualify for separate accounting as described above. under the residual method, the fair value of the undelivered elements (i.e., support and services) based on vsoe is deferred and the remaining portion of the total arrangement fee is allocated to the delivered elements (i.e., software license). if evidence of the fair value of one or more of the undelivered elements does not exist, all revenues are deferred and recognized when delivery of all of those elements has occurred or when fair values can be established. we determine vsoe of the fair value of services and support revenue based upon our recent pricing for those elements when sold separately. for certain transactions, vsoe of the fair value of support revenue is determined based on a substantive support renewal clause within a customer contract. our current pricing practices are influenced primarily by product type, purchase volume, sales channel and customer location. we review services and support sold separately on a periodic basis and update, when appropriate, our vsoe of fair value for such elements to ensure that it reflects our recent pricing experience.
generally, our contracts are accounted for individually. however, when contracts are closely interrelated and dependent on each other, it may be necessary to account for two or more contracts as one to reflect the substance of the group of contracts.
for subscription-based licenses, license revenue is recognized ratably over the term of the arrangement. in limited circumstances, where the right to use the software license is contingent upon current payments of support, fees for software license and support are recognized ratably over the initial support term.
support contracts generally include rights to unspecified upgrades (when and if available), telephone and internet-based support, updates and bug fixes. support revenue is recognized ratably over the term of the support contract on a straight-line basis.
reimbursements of out-of-pocket expenditures incurred in connection with providing consulting services are included in service revenue, with the offsetting expense recorded in cost of service revenue.
training services include on-site and classroom training. training revenues are recognized as the related training services are provided.
accounting for income taxes as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements, we are required to calculate our income tax expense based on taxable income by jurisdiction. there are many transactions and calculations about which the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain; as a result, our calculations involve estimates by management. some of these uncertainties arise as a consequence of revenue-sharing, cost-reimbursement and transfer pricing arrangements among related entities and the differing tax treatment of revenue and cost items across various jurisdictions. if we were compelled to revise or to account differently for our arrangements, that revision could affect our tax liability.
the income tax accounting process also involves estimating our actual current tax liability, together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes. these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities, which are included within our consolidated balance sheets. we must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and, to the extent we believe that it is more likely than not that all or a portion of our deferred tax assets will not be realized, we must establish a valuation allowance as a charge to income tax expense.
as of september 30, 2014, we have a valuation allowance of $144.0 million against net deferred tax assets in the u.s. and a valuation allowance of $33.5 million against net deferred tax assets in certain foreign jurisdictions. in the fourth quarter of 2012, we recorded a $124.5 million non-cash charge to the income tax provision to establish a valuation allowance against substantially all of our u.s. net deferred tax assets. we weighed all available evidence, both positive and negative, and concluded that it was more likely than not (a likelihood of more than 50 percent) that substantially all of our u.s. deferred tax assets will not be realized. the realization of deferred tax assets, including carryforwards and deductible temporary differences, depends on the existence of sufficient taxable income of the same character during the carryback or carryforward period. we considered all sources of taxable income available to realize the deferred tax assets, including the future reversal of existing
32
temporary differences, future taxable income exclusive of reversing temporary differences and carryforwards, taxable income in prior carryback years and tax-planning strategies.
the valuation allowance recorded against net deferred tax assets of certain foreign jurisdictions is established primarily for our net operating loss carryforwards, the majority of which do not expire. there are limitations imposed on the utilization of such net operating losses that could further restrict the recognition of any tax benefits.
we have not provided for u.s. income taxes or foreign withholding taxes on foreign unrepatriated earnings as it is our current intention to permanently reinvest these earnings outside the u.s. unless it can be done with no significant tax cost. if we decide to change this assertion in the future to repatriate any additional non-u.s. earnings, we may be required to establish a deferred tax liability on such earnings.
in the normal course of business, ptc and its subsidiaries are examined by various taxing authorities, including the internal revenue service (irs) in the united states. we regularly assess the likelihood of additional assessments by tax authorities and provide for these matters as appropriate. we are currently under audit by tax authorities in several jurisdictions. audits by tax authorities typically involve examination of the deductibility of certain permanent items, limitations on net operating losses and tax credits. although we believe our tax estimates are appropriate, the final determination of tax audits and any related litigation could result in material changes in our estimates.
valuation of assets and liabilities acquired in business combinations in accordance with business combination accounting, we allocate the purchase price of acquired companies to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values. determining these fair values requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions, especially with respect to intangible assets.
our identifiable intangible assets acquired consist of developed technology, core technology, tradenames, customer lists and contracts, and software support agreements and related relationships. developed technology consists of products that have reached technological feasibility. core technology represents a combination of processes, inventions and trade secrets related to the design and development of acquired products. customer lists and contracts and software support agreements and related relationships represent the underlying relationships and agreements with customers of the acquired company's installed base. we have generally valued intangible assets using a discounted cash flow model. critical estimates in valuing certain of the intangible assets include but are not limited to:
•   future expected cash flows from software license sales, customer support agreements, customer contracts and related customer relationships and acquired developed technologies and trademarks and trade names;
•   expected costs to develop the in-process research and development into commercially viable products and estimating cash flows from the projects when completed;
•   the acquired company's brand awareness and market position, as well as assumptions about the period of time the acquired brand will continue to be used by the combined company; and
•   discount rates used to determine the present value of estimated future cash flows.
in addition, we estimate the useful lives of our intangible assets based upon the expected period over which we anticipate generating economic benefits from the related intangible asset.
net tangible assets consist of the fair values of tangible assets less the fair values of assumed liabilities and obligations. except for deferred revenues, net tangible assets were generally valued by us at the respective carrying amounts recorded by the acquired company, if we believed that their carrying values approximated their fair values at the acquisition date. the values assigned to deferred revenue reflect an amount equivalent to the estimated cost plus an appropriate profit margin to perform the services related to the acquired company's software support contracts.
in addition, uncertain tax positions and tax related valuation allowances assumed in connection with a business combination are initially estimated as of the acquisition date and we reevaluate these items quarterly with any adjustments to our preliminary estimates being recorded to goodwill provided that we are within the measurement period (up to one year from the acquisition date) and we continue to collect information in order to determine their estimated values. subsequent to the measurement period or our final determination of the estimated value of uncertain tax positions or tax related valuation allowances, whichever comes first, changes to these uncertain tax positions and tax related valuation allowances will affect our provision for income taxes in our consolidated statement of operations.
our estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable at that time, but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable. assumptions may be incomplete or inaccurate, and unanticipated events and circumstances may occur, which may affect the accuracy or validity of such assumptions, estimates or actual results.
33
when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of a finite-lived intangible asset may not be recoverable, we perform an assessment of the asset for potential impairment. this assessment is based on projected undiscounted future cash flows over the asset's remaining life. if the carrying value of the asset exceeds its undiscounted cash flows, we record an impairment loss equal to the excess of the carrying value over the fair value of the asset, determined using projected discounted future cash flows of the asset.
valuation of goodwill our goodwill totaled $1,012.5 million and $769.1 million as of september 30, 2014 and 2013, respectively. we have two operating segments: (1) software products and (2) services. we assess goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level. our reporting units are determined based on the components of our operating segments that constitute a business for which discrete financial information is available and for which operating results are regularly reviewed by segment management. our reporting units are consistent with our operating segments. as of september 30, 2014 and 2013, goodwill and acquired intangible assets in the aggregate attributable to our software products reportable segment was $1,283.0 million and $979.3 million, respectively, and attributable to our services reportable segment was $66.4 million and $62.9 million, respectively. we test goodwill for impairment in the third quarter of our fiscal year, or on an interim basis if an event occurs or circumstances change that would, more likely than not, reduce the fair value of a reporting segment below its carrying value. factors we consider important (on an overall company basis and reportable segment basis, as applicable) that could trigger an impairment review include significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results, significant changes in our use of the acquired assets or a significant change in the strategy for our business, significant negative industry or economic trends, a significant decline in our stock price for a sustained period, or a reduction of our market capitalization relative to net book value.
we completed our annual goodwill impairment review as of june 28, 2014 and concluded that no impairment charge was required as of that date. to conduct our test of goodwill, the fair value of each reporting unit is compared to its carrying value. if the reporting unit's carrying value exceeds its fair value, we record an impairment loss equal to the difference between the carrying value of goodwill and its implied fair value. we estimate the fair values of our reporting units using discounted cash flow valuation models. those models require estimates of future revenues, profits, capital expenditures, working capital, terminal values based on revenue multiples, and discount rates for each reporting unit. we estimate these amounts by evaluating historical trends, current budgets, operating plans and industry data. the estimated fair value of each reporting unit was more than double its carrying value as of june 28, 2014.
accounting for pensions we sponsor several u.s. and international pension plans. we make assumptions that are used in calculating the expense and liability of these plans. these key assumptions include the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets and the discount rate used to determine the present value of benefit obligations. in selecting the expected long-term rate of return on assets, we consider the average future rate of earnings expected on the funds invested to provide for the benefits under the pension plan. this includes considering the plans' asset allocations and the expected returns likely to be earned over the life of the plans. the discount rate reflects the estimated rate at which an amount that is invested in a portfolio of high-quality debt instruments would provide the future cash flows necessary to pay benefits when they come due. the actuarial assumptions used by us may differ materially from actual results due to changing market and economic conditions or longer or shorter life spans of the participants. our actual results could differ materially from those we estimated, which could require us to record a greater amount of pension expense in future years and/or require higher than expected cash contributions.
we maintain a u.s. defined benefit pension plan (the plan) that covers certain persons who were employees of computervision corporation (acquired by us in 1998). benefits under the plan were frozen in 1990. in the second quarter of 2014, we began the process of terminating the plan, which will include settling plan liabilities by offering lump sum distributions to plan participants and purchasing annuity contracts to cover vested benefits. we expect to complete the termination process by september 30, 2015.
as of september 30, 2014, we have valued the projected benefit obligations for our u.s. plan based on the present value of estimated costs to settle the liabilities through a combination of lump sum payments to beneficiaries and purchasing annuities from an insurance company. this reflects an estimate of how many participants we expect will accept a lump sum offering, and an estimate of lump sum pay-outs for those participants based on the current lump sum rates approved by the irs. liabilities expected to be settled through the purchase of annuity contracts have been estimated based on future benefit payments, discounted based on current interest rates that correspond to the liability pay-outs, adjusted to reflect a premium that would be assessed by the insurer. we expect to settle the liabilities by the end of fiscal 2015. as the liabilities are settled, losses (currently estimated to be approximately $65 million) will be recognized up to the amount of unamortized losses in accumulated other comprehensive income, based on the projected benefit obligations measured as of the dates the settlements occur. prior to settling the liabilities, we will contribute such additional amounts (currently estimated to be approximately $25
34
million) as may be necessary to fully fund the plan. such contributions are expected to be made concurrent with settling the liabilities but may be made earlier at our discretion.
as of september 30, 2014 and 2013, the u.s. discount rate was determined using a bond-matching tool. under this tool, discount rates are derived by identifying a theoretical settlement portfolio of high quality bonds sufficient to provide for the pension plan's projected benefit payments. a single rate is then determined that results in a discounted value of the plan's benefit payments that equates to the market value of the selected bonds. in determining our u.s. pension cost for 2014, 2013 and 2012, we used a discount rate of 4.90%, 4.00% and 4.50%, respectively, and an expected return on plan assets of 7.25% for all three years.
certain of our international subsidiaries (principally germany) also sponsor pension plans. accounting and reporting for these plans requires the use of country-specific assumptions for discount rates and expected rates of return on assets. we apply a consistent methodology in determining the key assumptions that, in addition to future experience assumptions such as mortality rates, are used by our actuaries to determine our liability and expense for each of these plans. the discount rate for germany was selected with reference to a spot-rate yield curve based on the yields of aa-rated euro-denominated corporate bonds. in addition, our actuarial consultants determine the expense and liabilities of the plan using other assumptions for future experience, such as mortality rates. in determining our pension cost for 2014, 2013 and 2012, we used weighted average discount rates of 3.3%, 3.4% and 4.8%, respectively, and weighted average expected returns on plan assets of 5.7%, 5.4% and 5.4%, respectively. in 2014, 2013 and 2012, our actual return on plan assets for all plans was $15.9 million, $13.6 million and $16.5 million, respectively. if actual returns are below our expected rates of return, it will impact the amount and timing of future contributions and expense for these plans. we expect lower rates of return in 2015 because we transferred u.s. plan assets from equities to fixed income securities in 2014 in contemplation of terminating the plan and distributing assets from the plan.
as of september 30, 2014 and 2013, our plans in total were underfunded, representing the difference between our projected benefit obligation and fair value of plan assets, by $61.2 million and $50.1 million, respectively. the projected benefit obligation as of september 30, 2014 was determined using a discount rate of 3.8% for the u.s. plan and a weighted average discount rate of 2.4% for our international plans. the most sensitive assumptions used in calculating the expense and liability of our pension plans are the discount rate and the expected return on plan assets. total gaap net periodic pension cost was $3.3 million in 2014 and we expect it to be approximately $8 million in 2015. the increase in gaap pension cost in 2015 is due primarily to lower expected returns on u.s. plan assets as described above. a 50 basis point change to our discount rate and expected return on plan assets assumptions would have changed our pension expense for the year ended september 30, 2014 by approximately $1 million. a 50 basis point decrease in our discount rate assumptions would increase our projected benefit obligation as of september 30, 2014 by approximately $16 million.
legal contingencies we are periodically subject to various legal claims and involved in various legal proceedings. we routinely review the status of each significant matter and assess our potential financial exposure. if the potential loss from any matter is considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated, we record a liability for the estimated loss. significant judgment is required in both the determination of probability and the determination as to whether the amount of an exposure is reasonably estimable. because of inherent uncertainties related to these legal matters, we base our loss accruals on the best information available at the time. further, estimates of this nature are highly subjective, and the final outcome of these matters could vary significantly from the amounts that have been included in the accompanying consolidated financial statements. as additional information becomes available, we reassess our potential liability and may revise our estimates. such revisions could have a material impact on future quarterly or annual results of operations.

we invest our cash with highly rated financial institutions and in diversified domestic and international money market mutual funds. the portfolio is invested in short-term instruments to ensure cash is available to meet requirements as needed. at september 30, 2014, cash and cash equivalents totaled $293.7 million, up from $241.9 million at september 30, 2013, reflecting $304.6 million in operating cash flow, $353.8 million of net amounts borrowed under our credit facility ($110 million borrowed in the first quarter of 2014 for our acquisition of thingworx, $295 million borrowed in the fourth quarter for our acquisition of axeda and our accelerated share repurchase transaction, net of amounts repaid in the second and third quarters of 2014), partially offset by $323.5 million used for our acquisitions of axeda, atego and thingworx and $224.9 million used to repurchase common shares outstanding.
cash provided by operating activities cash provided by operating activities was $304.6 million in 2014, compared to $224.7 million in 2013 and $218.0 million in 2012. cash provided by operations was higher due to higher earnings (pre-tax income was $186.1 million in 2014 compared to $126.2 million in 2013 and $120.7 million in 2012), lower restructuring payments ($20.6 million in 2014, compared to $37.2 million in 2013 and $20.9 million in 2012) and lower income tax payments. cash paid for income taxes was $25.5 million, $35.4 million and $53.0 million in 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively.
accounts receivable days sales outstanding was 58 days as of september 30, 2014 compared to 60 days as of september 30, 2013 and 61 days as of september 30, 2012. we periodically provide financing with payment terms up to 24 months to credit-worthy customers. other assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets include non-current receivables from customers related to extended payment term contracts totaling $13.5 million and $17.0 million at september 30, 2014 and 2013, respectively. we periodically transfer future payments under customer contracts to third-party financial institutions on a non-recourse basis. we sold $24.5 million of receivables in 2014 compared to $17.0 million in 2013 and $14.3 million in 2012.

in both the second and fourth quarters of 2014, we refinanced our credit facility as described in credit facility below. we incurred $7.9 million and $1.9 million of origination costs in 2014 and 2012, respectively, in connection with entering into and amending the new and previous credit facilities. in 2014, we borrowed $280 million to finance acquisitions and $125 million to repurchase shares under an accelerated share repurchase transaction. in 2012, we borrowed $230 million to finance our acquisition of servigistics. proceeds from issuance of common stock reflects stock option exercises. stock option exercises totaled 0.1 million shares in 2014, 0.5 million shares in 2013 and 2.3 million shares in 2012. as of september 30, 2014, stock options outstanding had gross exercise prices totaling approximately $0.1 million. accordingly, assuming no additional stock options are granted, future proceeds from option exercises will be immaterial.
share repurchase authorization our articles of organization authorize us to issue up to 500 million shares of our common stock. our board of directors has periodically authorized the repurchase of shares of our common stock. we were authorized to repurchase up to $100 million worth of shares with cash from operations for each of our fiscal years 2014, 2013 and 2012. additionally, on august 4, 2014, our board of directors authorized us to repurchase up to an additional $600 million of our common stock through september 30, 2017.  we intend to use cash from operations and borrowings under our credit facility to make such repurchases.  pursuant to this repurchase authorization, in the fourth quarter we entered into the $125 million accelerated share repurchase agreement described below.  we repurchased 5.1 million shares at a cost of $224.9 million in 2014 (including $37.5 million held by the bank pending final settlement of the asr described below), 3.1 million shares at a cost of $74.9 million in 2013 and 1.6 million shares at a cost of $35.0 million in 2012. all shares of our common stock repurchased are automatically restored to the status of authorized and unissued.
on august 14, 2014, we entered into an accelerated share repurchase ("asr") agreement with a major financial institution ("bank"). the asr allows us to buy a large number of shares immediately at a purchase price determined by an average market price over a period of time. under the asr, we agreed to purchase $125.0 million of our common stock, in total, with an initial delivery of 2,300,210 shares ("initial shares") of our common stock to us by the bank. the initial shares represent the number of shares at the current market price equal to 70% of the total fixed purchase price of $125.0 million. the repurchased shares were retired and returned to an unissued status. the remainder of the total purchase price of $37.5 million reflects the value of the stock held by the bank pending final settlement and, accordingly, was recorded as a reduction to additional paid-in capital. final settlement of the asr will occur no later than february 17, 2015 at the bank's discretion. upon settlement of the asr, the total shares repurchased by us will be determined based on a share price equal to the daily volume weighted-average price ("vwap") of our common stock during the term of the asr program, less a fixed per share discount amount. at settlement, the bank will deliver additional shares to us in the event total shares are greater than the 2,300,210 shares initially delivered, and we will issue additional shares or cash to the bank, at our option, in the event total shares are less than the shares initially delivered. as of september 30, 2014, based on the vwap of our common stock for the period august 14, 2014 through september 30, 2014, settlement of the asr would have resulted in 982,419 additional shares delivered by the bank to us.
credit facility in september 2014, we entered into a multi-currency credit facility with a syndicate of sixteen banks for which jpmorgan chase bank, n.a. acts as administrative agent. the credit facility replaced a credit facility with the same banks entered into in january 2014. we expect to use the credit facility for general corporate purposes, including acquisitions of businesses, share repurchases and working capital requirements. as of september 30, 2014, the fair value of our credit facility approximates our book value.
the credit facility consists of a $500 million term loan and a $1 billion revolving loan commitment, and may be increased by an additional $250 million (in the form of revolving loans or term loans, or a combination thereof) if the existing or additional lenders are willing to make such increased commitments. the revolving loan commitment does not require amortization of principal. the term loan requires prepayment of principal at the end of each calendar quarter. the revolving loan and term loan may be repaid in whole or in part prior to the scheduled maturity dates at our option without penalty or premium. the credit facility matures on september 15, 2019, when all remaining amounts outstanding will be due and payable in full. we are required to make principal payments under the term loan of $25 million, $50 million, $50 million, $75 million and $300 million in 2015, 2016, 2017, 2018 and 2019, respectively.
ptc is the sole borrower under the credit facility. the obligations under the credit facility are guaranteed by ptc's material domestic subsidiaries and 65% of the voting equity interests of ptc's material first-tier foreign subsidiaries are pledged as collateral for the obligations.
as of september 30, 2014, we had $611.9 million outstanding under the credit facility comprised of the $500 million term loan and a $111.9 million revolving loan.
37
the credit facility limits ptc's and its subsidiaries' ability to, among other things: incur additional indebtedness; incur liens or guarantee obligations; pay dividends (other than to ptc) and make other distributions; make investments and enter into joint ventures; dispose of assets; and engage in transactions with affiliates, except on an arms-length basis. under the credit facility, ptc and its material domestic subsidiaries may not invest cash or property in, or loan to, ptc's foreign subsidiaries in aggregate amounts exceeding $75 million for any purpose and an additional $150 million for acquisitions of businesses. in addition, under the credit facility, ptc and its subsidiaries must maintain the following financial ratios:
•   a leverage ratio, defined as consolidated funded indebtedness to consolidated trailing four quarters ebitda, of no greater than 3.00 to 1.00 at any time; and
•   a fixed charge coverage ratio, defined as the ratio of consolidated trailing four quarters ebitda less consolidated capital expenditures to consolidated fixed charges, of no less than 3.50 to 1.00 at any time.
as of september 30, 2014, our leverage ratio was 1.82 to 1.00, our fixed charge coverage ratio was 17.70 to 1.00 and we were in compliance with all financial and operating covenants of the credit facility. as of september 30, 2014, we had approximately $408 million available to borrow under the credit facility within our covenant limits. on november 17, 2014, we borrowed an additional $35 million under our credit facility for short-term cash requirements, including the payment of fiscal 2014 incentive compensation.
any failure to comply with the financial or operating covenants of the credit facility would prevent ptc from being able to borrow additional funds, and would constitute a default, permitting the lenders to, among other things, accelerate the amounts outstanding, including all accrued interest and unpaid fees, under the credit facility and to terminate the credit facility. a change in control of ptc, as defined in the agreement, also constitutes an event of default, permitting the lenders to accelerate the indebtedness and terminate the credit facility.
for a description of additional terms and conditions of the credit facility, including limitations on our ability to undertake certain actions, see note h debt in "notes to consolidated financial statements" in this annual report.
expectations for fiscal 2015
we believe that existing cash and cash equivalents, together with cash generated from operations, and amounts available under our credit facility will be sufficient to meet our working capital and capital expenditure requirements through at least the next twelve months and to meet our known long-term capital requirements. in 2015, we expect to repurchase $125 million of our stock and repay $100 million of borrowings under our credit facility.
we evaluate possible strategic transactions on an ongoing basis and at any given time may be engaged in discussions or negotiations with respect to possible strategic transactions. our expected uses of cash could change, our cash position could be reduced and we may incur additional debt obligations to the extent we complete additional acquisitions.
as described in note m pension plans in "notes to consolidated financial statements" in this annual report, we have begun the process of terminating our u.s. pension plan. we expect to contribute an additional $25 million to the plan in 2015 to complete the termination. additionally, we expect to make voluntary contributions to a non-u.s. plan of $20 million in 2015, $10 million of which was contributed in october 2014.
at september 30, 2014, we had cash and cash equivalents of $72.9 million in the united states, $76.0 million in europe, $99.1 million in the pacific rim (including india), $21.2 million in japan and $24.4 million in other non-u.s. countries. as of september 30, 2014, we had an outstanding intercompany loan receivable of $29.6 million. this amount can be repaid with cash generated by our foreign subsidiaries and repatriated to the u.s. without future tax cost. additionally, we are evaluating several feasible strategies that can be employed to repatriate foreign earnings, at minimal tax cost.
contractual obligations at september 30, 2014, our contractual obligations were as follows:

(4)   these obligations relate to our u.s. and international pension plans. these liabilities are not subject to fixed payment terms. payments have been estimated based on the plans' current funded status, planned employer contributions and actuarial assumptions. in addition, we may, at our discretion, make additional voluntary contributions to the plans. see note m pension plans of "notes to consolidated financial statements" in this annual report for further discussion.
(5)   as of september 30, 2014, we had recorded total unrecognized tax benefits of $15.0 million. this liability is not subject to fixed payment terms and the amount and timing of payments, if any, which we will make related to this liability, are not known. see note g income taxes of "notes to consolidated financial statements" in this annual report for additional information.
as of september 30, 2014, we had letters of credit and bank guarantees outstanding of approximately $3.6 million (of which $0.9 million was collateralized), primarily related to our corporate headquarters lease in needham, massachusetts.
off-balance sheet arrangements we have not created, and are not party to, any special-purpose or off-balance sheet entities for the purpose of raising capital, incurring debt or operating parts of our business that are not consolidated (to the extent of our ownership interest therein) into our financial statements. we have not entered into any transactions with unconsolidated entities whereby we have subordinated retained interests, derivative instruments or other contingent arrangements that expose us to material continuing risks, contingent liabilities, or any other obligation under a variable interest in an unconsolidated entity that provides financing, liquidity, market risk or credit risk support to us.
recent accounting pronouncements revenue recognition in may 2014, the financial accounting standards board (the fasb) issued accounting standards update (asu) no. 2014-09, revenue from contracts with customers: topic 606 (asu 2014-09), to supersede nearly all existing revenue recognition guidance under u.s. gaap. the core principle of asu 2014-09 is to recognize revenues when promised goods or services are transferred to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration that is expected to be received for those goods or services. asu 2014-09 defines a five step process to achieve this core principle and, in doing so, it is possible more judgment and estimates may be required within the revenue recognition process than required under existing u.s. gaap including identifying performance obligations in the contract, estimating the amount of variable consideration to include in the transaction price and allocating the transaction price to each separate performance obligation. asu 2014-09 is effective for us in our first quarter of fiscal 2018 using either of two methods: (i) retrospective to each prior reporting period presented with the option to elect certain practical expedients as defined within asu 2014-09; or (ii) retrospective with the cumulative effect of

initially applying asu 2014-09 recognized at the date of initial application and providing certain additional disclosures as defined per asu 2014-09. we are currently evaluating the impact of our pending adoption of asu 2014-09 on our consolidated financial statements.
presentation of an unrecognized tax benefit when a net operating loss carryforward, a similar tax loss, or a tax credit carryforward exists in july 2013, the fasb issued asu no. 2013-11, income taxes (topic 740)-presentation of an unrecognized tax benefit when a net operating loss carryforward, a similar tax loss, or a tax credit carryforward exists. asu 2013-11 generally requires that an unrecognized tax benefit, or a portion of an unrecognized tax benefit, shall be presented in the financial statements as a reduction to a deferred tax asset for a net operating loss carryforward, a similar tax loss, or a tax credit carryforward. asu 2013-11 is effective for us in our first quarter of fiscal 2015. we are currently evaluating the impact of our pending adoption of asu 2013-11 on our consolidated financial statements.

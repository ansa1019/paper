item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations this management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations, or md&a, should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto that appear elsewhere in this annual report on form 10-k. see "risk factors" elsewhere in this annual report on form 10-k for a discussion of certain risks associated with our business. the following discussion contains forward-looking statements. the forward-looking statements do not include the potential impact of any mergers, acquisitions, divestitures or other events that may be announced after the date hereof.
overview we provide cloud services for delivering, optimizing and securing online content and business applications. we primarily derive income from sales of services to customers executing contracts with terms of one year or longer. we believe that this emphasis on longer-term contracts generally allows us to have a consistent and predictable base level of revenue which is important to our financial success. we have been able to increase our revenue and profitability in recent years because we have expanded our customer base and increased the amount and value of services, features and functionalities that our customers purchase. these achievements have enabled us to limit the impact of customer cancellations and terminations and price reductions resulting from contract renewals. continuing these trends requires that we compete effectively in the marketplace on the basis of the quality, price and overall attractiveness of our services and technology.
our revenue is impacted primarily by factors such as the timing and variability of customer-specific one-time events, the prices we are able to charge for our services, the amount of traffic we serve on our network and the impact of seasonal variations on our business. we have observed the following trends related to our revenue in recent years:
•   on a consistent basis, we have increased committed recurring revenue by adding new customers and increasing sales of incremental services to our existing customers. we have also experienced increases in the rate of traffic delivered to our customers that use our solutions for video, gaming, social media and software downloads. these increases have offset the price reductions discussed below and losses of customers to competitors or in-house solutions.
•   the unit prices paid by some of our customers have declined, reflecting the impact of competition. these price reductions have primarily impacted customers for which we deliver high volumes of traffic over our network.
22
•   we have experienced variations in certain types of revenue from quarter to quarter; in particular, we experience higher revenue in the fourth quarter of the year for some of our solutions as a result of the holiday season. we also experience lower revenue in the summer months, particularly in europe, from both e-commerce and media customers because overall internet use declines during that time. in addition, we experience quarterly variations in revenue attributable to the nature and timing of software and gaming releases by our customers using our software download solutions.
our profitability is also impacted by our expense levels, including direct costs to support our revenue, such as co-location and bandwidth costs, and expenses incurred to support strategic initiatives that we anticipate will generate revenue in the future. we have observed the following trends related to our profitability in recent years:
•   we have increased headcount to support our revenue growth and strategic initiatives, and as a result, our payroll and related compensation costs have increased. during the year ended december 31, 2014, we hired an additional 1,200 employees, including approximately 200 employees who were part of the acquisition of prolexic technologies, inc., or prolexic, in the first quarter of 2014. during 2013, we increased our headcount by more than 800 employees, which is net of approximately 70 employees who were part of the divestiture of our advertising decisions solutions, or ads, business in the first quarter of 2013. as of december 31, 2014, we had 5,105 employees. we expect to continue to hire additional employees and expand globally in support of our strategic initiatives.
•   network bandwidth costs represent a significant portion of our cost of revenue. historically, we have been able to mitigate increases in these costs by reducing our network bandwidth costs per unit and investing in internal-use software development to improve the performance and efficiency of our network. our total bandwidth costs may increase in the future as a result of expected higher traffic levels, but we believe such costs would be partially offset by anticipated continued reductions in bandwidth costs per unit and efficiency measures we take.
•   co-location costs also represent a significant portion of our cost of revenue. by improving our internal-use software and managing our hardware deployments to enable us to use servers more efficiently, we have been able to manage the growth of co-location costs. we expect to continue to scale our network in the future and will need to manage our co-location costs to maintain current levels of profitability.
•   effective january 1, 2013, we increased the expected average useful lives of our network assets, primarily servers, from three to four years to reflect software and hardware related initiatives to manage our global network more efficiently. this change decreased depreciation expense related to our network equipment during 2014 and 2013, as compared to 2012. conversely, we expect to continue to enhance and add functionality to our service offerings, which increases our internal-use software development costs attributable to employees working on such projects.
•   we have been able to reduce our tax rate in recent years as a result of available tax credits and other one-time items. however, we do not expect these one-time items to be consistently available to us in the future.
in february 2014, we completed the acquisition of prolexic. prolexic was slightly dilutive to our earnings per share for the year ended december 31, 2014. revenue and expenses from the acquired operations have been included in our earnings since the acquisition date of february 18, 2014. also in february 2014, we completed an offering of $690.0 million in par value of convertible senior notes. the notes do not bear regular interest, but have an effective interest rate of 3.2% attributable to the conversion feature.
during 2013 we completed two acquisitions, and in 2012 we completed four acquisitions. although our financial statements include revenue and expenses of the acquired companies following their acquisitions, the impact was not material, individually or in the aggregate, to our consolidated financial results. in the first quarter of 2013, we also divested our ads business.

the increase in our revenue from 2013 to 2014 was driven by continued strong demand for our services across all of our major solutions and geographies. in particular, we experienced the addition of new customers, increased sales of incremental services to our existing customers and amounts earned for traffic usage in excess of committed amounts as well as customer-specific one-time events. in addition, the acquisition of prolexic during the first quarter of 2014 contributed to increased revenue. these contributions to higher revenue were partially offset by lost committed recurring revenue and price declines.
the increase in our revenue from 2012 to 2013 was also driven by increased demand for our services, partially offset by the divestiture of ads in the first quarter of 2013.
for the year ended december 31, 2014, resellers accounted for 25% of revenue as compared to 21% and 22% of revenue, respectively, for the years ended december 31, 2013 and 2012. for the years ended december 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, no single customer accounted for 10% or more of revenue.
effective in the first quarter of 2014, we elected to revise our method for determining the split of revenue derived from our operations located outside the u.s. previously, revenue was split based on our invoicing location and has been revised to reflect the location in which the sale originated. prior period amounts have been revised to reflect the new method. for the years ended december 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, approximately 27% of our revenue was derived from our operations located outside of the u.s. no single country outside of the u.s. accounted for 10% or more of revenue during any of these periods. during 2014, we experienced strong revenue growth from our operations in the asia pacific region and continued improvement in revenue growth from our operations in europe, the middle east and africa, primarily driven by growth across all of our major solutions.

changes in foreign currency exchange rates negatively impacted our revenue by $7.8 million during 2014 as compared to 2013. changes in foreign currency exchange rates negatively impacted our revenue by $15.0 million during 2013 as compared to 2012.
during the first quarter of 2015, we elected to revise the presentation of our revenue solution categories, primarily related to how we present product-specific services revenue. historically, product-specific services were classified as service and support solutions revenue. beginning in the first quarter of 2015, product-specific services will be classified in their respective product solution categories.

the increases in media delivery solutions revenue for 2014 as compared to 2013, and 2013 as compared to 2012, were due to strong demand across most of our customer base, including from our largest, most strategic customers. during 2014, we experienced particularly strong growth from our social media, gaming, video and software download customers.
the increases in performance and security solutions revenue for 2014 as compared to 2013, and 2013 as compared to 2012, were due to increases in demand from both new and existing customers, particularly for our web performance and cloud security solutions. additionally, the increase for 2014 as compared to 2013 was partially attributable to the acquisition of prolexic.
the increases in the service and support solutions revenue for 2014 as compared to 2013, and 2013 as compared to 2012, were due to increases in sales of our services and support offerings due to strong service attachment rates - increased purchases of professional services to support the integration and use of our core solutions - for both customers of our core media delivery and performance and security solutions. we also experienced increases in 2014 as compared to 2013 as a result of event-driven revenues as our customers relied on our service professionals to help them execute live media events.
the ads business was divested in the first quarter of 2013, which had a modest negative impact on 2014 and 2013 revenue as compared to 2012.

as a percentage of revenue                                                             31.1     %                32.4     %                                  32.4     %                38.6     %
the increase in total cost of revenue for 2014 as compared to 2013 was primarily due to increases in:
•   payroll and related costs of service personnel due to headcount growth to support our service and support solutions revenue growth, as well as headcount growth related to our network operations to support our other solution categories and from acquisitions;
•   amounts paid to network providers for bandwidth fees to support the increase in traffic served on our network; and
•   depreciation and amortization of network equipment and internal-use software as we continued to invest in our infrastructure and release internally developed software onto our network.
the net decrease in cost of revenue for 2013 as compared to 2012 was primarily due to decreases in:
•   depreciation expense of network equipment in place as of january 1, 2013 of approximately $39.0 million, reflecting the increase in the expected average useful lives of our network assets, primarily servers, from three to four years to reflect software and hardware related initiatives to manage our global network more efficiently; and
•   cost of revenue of our ads business, included in supporting services, which we divested in january 2013; these expenses were $1.6 million and $24.2 million for the years ended december 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively.
the net decrease for 2013 as compared to 2012 was partially offset by increases in payroll and related costs of service personnel due to headcount growth, amounts paid to network providers for bandwidth fees to support the increase in traffic served on our network and amortization of internal-use software as we continued to invest in our infrastructure.
we have long-term purchase commitments for bandwidth usage and co-location services with various network and internet service providers. our minimum commitments related to bandwidth usage and co-location services may vary from period to period depending on the timing and length of contract renewals with our service providers. see note 10 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10-k for details regarding our bandwidth usage and co-location services purchase commitments.
we believe that cost of revenue will increase during 2015 as compared to 2014. we expect to deploy more servers and deliver more traffic on our network, which will result in higher expenses associated with the increased traffic and additional co-location fees; however, such costs are likely to be partially offset by lower bandwidth costs per unit and continued efficiency in network deployment. additionally, during 2015, we anticipate amortization of internal-use software development costs as compared to 2014 to increase, along with increased payroll and related costs associated with our network and professional services personnel and related expenses. we plan to continue to make investments in our network in the expectation that our customer base will continue to expand.

the increases in research and development expenses for 2014 as compared to 2013, and 2013 as compared to 2012, were due to increases in payroll and related costs as a result of continued growth in headcount to support investments in new product development, partially offset by increases in capitalized salaries and related costs.
research and development costs are expensed as incurred, other than certain internal-use software development costs eligible for capitalization. these development costs consist of payroll and related costs for personnel and external consulting expenses involved in the development of internal-use software used to deliver our services and operate our network. for the years ended december 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, we capitalized $13.7 million, $11.5 million and $8.9 million, respectively, of stock-based compensation. these capitalized internal-use software development costs are amortized to cost of revenue over their estimated useful lives, which is generally two years.
we believe that research and development expenses will increase in absolute dollars during 2015 as compared to 2014 as we expect to continue to hire additional development personnel in order to make improvements to our core technology and support the development of new services and engineering innovation.

the increases in sales and marketing expenses for 2014 as compared to 2013, and 2013 as compared to 2012, were primarily due to higher payroll and related costs, as we invested in our sales and marketing organization, and to an increase in marketing programs and related costs in support of our go-to-market capacity and ongoing geographic expansion. other expenses, which consisted primarily of sales and marketing events and related travel expenses, increased as we grew our sales and marketing organization.
we believe that sales and marketing expenses will increase in absolute dollars during 2015 as compared to 2014, due to an expected increase in payroll and related costs as a result of anticipated continued headcount growth primarily with respect to our direct sales team and corporate marketing function.

general and administrative expenses include costs of our finance, human resources, information technology, legal and administrative network infrastructure functions, in addition to our facility-related costs and depreciation of facility-related capital assets. the increases in general and administrative expenses for 2014 as compared to 2013, and 2013 as compared to 2012, were primarily due to the expansion of company infrastructure to support investments in engineering, go-to-market capacity and enterprise expansion initiatives. in particular, we increased general and administrative headcount and expanded our facility footprint, which collectively increased payroll and related costs, facilities-related costs and depreciation and amortization. in addition, acquisition-related costs increased for 2014 as compared to 2013 due to the acquisition of prolexic. conversely, acquisition-related costs for 2013 as compared to 2012 decreased due to the acquisitions of cotendo, inc., blaze software, inc., fastsoft, inc., or fastsoft, and verivue, inc., or verivue, in 2012, with no corresponding acquisitions of the same magnitude in 2013.
during 2015, we expect general and administrative expenses to increase in absolute dollars as compared to 2014 due to anticipated higher payroll and related costs and facilities-related costs attributable to increased hiring, investment in information technology and planned facility expansion.

the increase in amortization of acquired intangible assets during 2014 as compared to 2013 was due to the acquisition of prolexic. the increase in amortization of acquired intangible assets during 2013 as compared to 2012 was due to the amortization of assets related to the acquisition of strategic network assets from at&t services, inc. and also a full year of amortization from the acquisitions occurring in 2012, which was partially offset by the write-off of intangible assets recorded as part of the divestiture of ads in 2013 and the completion of amortization of intangible assets acquired in previous years.
based on acquired intangible assets at december 31, 2014, future amortization is expected to be approximately $26.8 million, $25.2 million, $23.1 million, $16.2 million and $12.6 million for the years ending december 31, 2015, 2016, 2017, 2018 and 2019, respectively. the decrease in expected amortization is due to the finalization of amortization of acquired intangible assets acquired in earlier years, in addition to the deceleration in recognition due to the pattern in which we amortize intangible assets.

the 2014 restructuring charges consisted of severance and related expenses as a result of the acquisition of prolexic, in addition to a fee for a facility contract termination. during 2013, we recorded a restructuring charge for leasehold improvements that were no longer in use as a result of an early lease termination. in addition, we incurred severance and relocation expenses for employees impacted by the closing of the facility. in 2012, we recorded restructuring charges related to work force reductions in connection with the 2012 acquisitions of fastsoft and verivue. we do not expect to incur additional restructuring charges as a result of any of these actions.

for the year ended december 31, 2014, our effective income tax rate was lower than the federal statutory tax rate mainly due to the federal research and development credit, a state tax benefit from software development activities, the domestic production activities deduction and the composition of income in foreign jurisdictions with lower tax rates; partially offset by state income taxes and the effects of accounting for stock-based compensation in accordance with the authoritative guidance for share-based payments. for the year ended december 31, 2013, our effective income tax rate was lower than the federal statutory rate mainly due to the retroactive adoption of the domestic production activities deduction, the reinstatement of the federal research and development credit, which included a one-time retroactive impact for fiscal 2012, and the composition of income in foreign jurisdictions with lower tax rates; partially offset by state income taxes. for the year ended december 31, 2012, our effective income tax rate was higher than the federal statutory tax rate mainly due to state income tax expense and the effects of accounting for stock-based compensation in accordance with the authoritative guidance for share-based payments; partially offset by the composition of income in foreign jurisdictions with lower tax rates.
the increase in the provision for income taxes for the year ended december 31, 2014 as compared to the same period in 2013 was mainly due to the increase in operating income and a change in the composition of projected income in different jurisdictions, partially offset by the reinstatement of the federal research and development credit, the federal domestic production activities deduction and state software development activities benefit. the increase in the provision for income taxes for the year ended december 31, 2013 as compared to the same period in 2012 was mainly due to the increase in operating income, partially offset by the domestic production activities deduction, the federal research and development credit and a change in the composition of projected income in different jurisdictions.
our effective income tax rate may fluctuate between fiscal years and from quarter to quarter due to items arising from discrete events, such as tax benefits from the disposition of employee equity awards, settlements of tax audits and assessments and tax law changes. our effective income tax rate is also impacted by, and may fluctuate in any given period because of, the composition of income in foreign jurisdictions where tax rates differ depending on the local statutory rates.
non-gaap financial measures in addition to providing financial measurements based on generally accepted accounting principles in the united states, or gaap, we publicly discuss additional financial measures that are not prepared in accordance with gaap, or non-gaap financial measures. management uses non-gaap financial measures, in addition to gaap financial measures, to understand and compare operating results across accounting periods, for financial and operational decision making, for planning and forecasting purposes and to evaluate our financial performance. these non-gaap financial measures are: non-gaap income from operations, non-gaap operating margin, non-gaap net income, non-gaap net income per diluted share, adjusted ebitda and adjusted ebitda margin, as discussed below.
management believes that these non-gaap financial measures reflect our ongoing business in a manner that allows for meaningful comparisons and analysis of trends in our business, as they exclude expenses and gains that may be infrequent, unusual in nature or otherwise not reflective of our ongoing operating results. management also believes that these non-gaap financial measures provide useful information to investors in understanding and evaluating our operating results and future prospects in the same manner as management and in comparing financial results across accounting periods and to those of peer companies.
the non-gaap financial measures do not replace the presentation of our gaap financial measures and should only be used as a supplement to, not as a substitute for, our financial results presented in accordance with gaap.
the non-gaap adjustments, and our basis for excluding them from non-gaap financial measures, are outlined below:
•   amortization of acquired intangible assets - we have incurred amortization of intangible assets, included in our gaap financial statements, related to various acquisitions we made. the amount of an acquisition's purchase price
30
allocated to intangible assets and term of its related amortization can vary significantly and are unique to each acquisition; therefore, we exclude amortization of acquired intangible assets from our non-gaap financial measures to provide investors with a consistent basis for comparing pre- and post-acquisition operating results.
•   stock-based compensation and amortization of capitalized stock-based compensation - although stock-based compensation is an important aspect of the compensation paid to our employees and executives, the expense varies with changes in the stock price and market conditions at the time of grant, varying valuation methodologies, subjective assumptions and the variety of award types. this makes the comparison of our current financial results to previous and future periods difficult to interpret; therefore, we believe it is useful to exclude stock-based compensation and amortization of capitalized stock-based compensation from our non-gaap financial measures in order to highlight the performance of our core business and to be consistent with the way investors evaluate our performance and compare our operating results to peer companies.
•   acquisition-related costs - acquisition-related costs include transaction fees, due diligence costs and other one-time direct costs associated with strategic activities. in addition, subsequent adjustments to our initial estimated amount of contingent consideration associated with specific acquisitions are included within acquisition-related costs. these amounts are impacted by the timing and size of the acquisitions. we exclude acquisition-related costs from our non-gaap financial measures to provide a useful comparison of our operating results to prior periods and to our peer companies because such amounts vary significantly based on the magnitude of our acquisition transactions.
•   restructuring charges - we have incurred restructuring charges that are included in our gaap financial statements, primarily related to workforce reductions and estimated costs of exiting facility lease commitments. we exclude these items from our non-gaap financial measures when evaluating our continuing business performance as such items are not consistently recurring and do not reflect expected future operating expense, nor provide meaningful insight into the fundamentals of current or past operations of our business.
•   benefit from adoption of software development activities - we recognized a benefit to non-income-related tax expense associated with the adoption of software development activities. we exclude this item from our non-gaap financial measures because transactions of this nature occur infrequently and are not considered part of our core business operations.
•   gains and other activity related to divestiture of a business - we recognized a gain and other activity related to the divestiture of our ads business. we exclude gains and other activity related to divestiture of a business from our non-gaap financial measures because transactions of this nature occur infrequently and are not considered part of our core business operations.
•   amortization of debt discount and issuance costs and amortization of capitalized interest expense - in february 2014, we issued $690 million of convertible senior notes due 2019 with a coupon interest rate of 0%. the imputed interest rate of the convertible senior notes was approximately 3.2%. this is a result of the debt discount recorded for the conversion feature that is required to be separately accounted for as equity, thereby reducing the carrying value of the convertible debt instrument. the debt discount is amortized as interest expense together with the issuance costs of the debt which are recorded as an asset in the consolidated balance sheet. all of our interest expense is comprised of these non-cash components and is excluded from management's assessment of our operating performance because management believes the non-cash expense is not indicative of ongoing operating performance.
•   loss on investments and legal settlements - we have incurred losses from the impairment of certain investments and the settlement of legal matters. we believe excluding these amounts from non-gaap financial measures is useful to investors as they occur infrequently and are not representative of our core business operations.
•   income tax effect of non-gaap adjustments and certain discrete tax items - the non-gaap adjustments described above are reported on a pre-tax basis. the income tax effect of non-gaap adjustments is the difference between gaap and non-gaap income tax expense. non-gaap income tax expense is computed on non-gaap pre-tax income (gaap pre-tax income adjusted for non-gaap adjustments) and excludes certain discrete tax items (such as recording or release of valuation allowances), if any. we believe that applying the non-gaap adjustments and their related income tax effect allows us to highlight income attributable to our core operations.

non-gaap net income per diluted share is calculated as non-gaap net income divided by diluted weighted average common shares outstanding. gaap diluted weighted average shares outstanding are adjusted in non-gaap per share calculations for the shares that would be delivered to us pursuant to the note hedge transactions entered into in connection with the issuance of $690.0 million in par value of convertible senior notes due 2019. under gaap, shares delivered under hedge transactions are not considered offsetting shares in the fully diluted share calculation until they are delivered. however, we would receive a benefit from the note hedge transactions and would not allow the dilution to occur, so management believes that adjusting for this benefit provides a meaningful view of net income per share. until our weighted average stock price is greater than $89.56, the initial conversion price, there will be no difference between our gaap and non-gaap diluted weighted average common shares outstanding.

we consider adjusted ebitda to be another important indicator of the operational strength and performance of our business and a good measure of our historical operating trends. adjusted ebitda eliminates items that are either not part of our core operations or do not require a cash outlay. we define adjusted ebitda as gaap net income excluding the following items: interest income; income taxes; depreciation and amortization of tangible and intangible assets; stock-based compensation; amortization of capitalized stock-based compensation; restructuring charges; acquisition-related costs; certain gains and losses on investments; benefit from adoption of software development activities; gains and other activity related to divestiture of a business; foreign exchange gains and losses; loss on early extinguishment of debt; amortization of debt discount and issuance costs; amortization of capitalized interest expense; gains and losses on legal settlements; and other non-recurring or unusual items that may arise from time to time. adjusted ebitda margin represents adjusted ebitda stated as a percentage of revenue.

impact of foreign currency exchange rates on revenue revenue from our international operations has historically been an important contributor to our total revenue. consequently, our revenue results have been impacted, and management expects they will continue to be impacted, by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. for example, when the local currencies of our foreign subsidiaries weaken, our consolidated results stated in u.s. dollars are negatively impacted.
because exchange rates are an important factor in understanding period-to-period comparisons, management believes the presentation of the impact of foreign currency exchange rates on revenue enhances the understanding of our revenue results and evaluation of performance in comparison to prior periods. the information presented is calculated by translating current period results using the same average foreign currency exchange rates per month from the comparative period.

liquidity and capital resources to date, we have financed our operations primarily through public and private sales of debt and equity securities and cash generated by operations. as of december 31, 2014, our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, which primarily consisted of corporate bonds and u.s. government agency securities, totaled $1.6 billion. we place our cash investments in instruments that meet high quality credit standards, as specified in our investment policy. our investment policy is also designed to limit the amount of our credit exposure to any one issue or issuer and advance goals of preserving principal and maintaining adequate liquidity at all times.
changes in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities are dependent upon changes in, among other things, working capital items such as deferred revenue, accounts payable, accounts receivable and various accrued expenses, as well as changes in our capital and financial structure due to common stock repurchases, debt repurchases and issuances, stock option exercises, purchases and sales of marketable securities and similar events. we believe our strong balance sheet and cash position are important competitive differentiators that provide the financial flexibility necessary to pursue acquisitions and other investments at opportune times. we expect to continue to consider strategic investments intended to strengthen our business on an ongoing basis.
as of december 31, 2014, we had cash and cash equivalents of $144.3 million held in accounts outside the u.s. an immaterial amount of these funds would be subject to u.s. federal taxation if repatriated, with such tax liability partially offset by foreign tax credits. the remainder of our cash and cash equivalents held outside the u.s. are subject to, or offset by, inter-company obligations to our parent company in the u.s. and, therefore, are not subject to u.s. federal taxation. as a result, we do not believe our liquidity is materially impacted by the amount of cash and cash equivalents held in accounts outside the u.s.

the increase in cash provided by operating activities for the year ended december 31, 2014 as compared to 2013, and 2013 as compared to 2012, was primarily due to increased profitability and the resulting cash collections from customers, offset by payments of working capital. cash paid for income taxes also impacted cash flows provided by operating activities, which were $166.2 million, $63.5 million and $94.8 million for the years ended december 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. during 2014 and 2012, we paid taxes related to our acquisitions which increased cash paid for taxes during those years. in addition, we changed the way we scheduled estimated u.s federal tax payments which caused cash paid for taxes to decrease during 2013 as compared to both 2014 and 2012. the increase in our profitability has also generally had the impact of increasing cash paid for income taxes during recent years.
we expect cash provided by operating activities to increase in 2015 due to an expected increase in cash collections related to anticipated higher revenue, partially offset by an anticipated increase in operating expenses that require cash outlays, such as salaries and commissions.

the increase in cash used in investing activities for the year ended december 31, 2014 as compared to 2013, primarily relates to the acquisition of prolexic, with no corresponding acquisitions of the same magnitude in 2013. the increase also relates to the increase in net purchases of marketable securities as a result of the investment of the proceeds of our convertible senior notes issuance. additionally, expenditures for internal-use software increased as we continued to invest in our network with the goal of enhancing and adding functionality to our service offerings.
the decrease in cash used in investing activities for the year ended december 31, 2013 as compared to 2012, primarily related to the four acquisitions we completed in 2012 (see note 8 to the consolidated financial statements), with no corresponding acquisitions of the same magnitude in 2013. the decrease also relates to the timing of purchases and sales of marketable securities, offset by an increase in our capital expenditures.

cash provided by financing activities for the year ended december 31, 2014 was primarily the result of the convertible senior notes issued in february 2014 and related note hedge and warrant transactions. concurrently with the convertible senior notes issuance, we also repurchased $62.0 million of our common stock, which contributed to the increase in repurchases of common stock as compared to 2013.
the increase in cash used in financing activities during the year ended december 31, 2013 as compared to 2012, was the result of an increase in repurchases of our common stock, partially offset by an increase in proceeds received from our stock-based compensation plans.
in october 2013, the board of directors authorized a $750.0 million share repurchase program, effective from october 16, 2013 through december 31, 2016. the goal of the program is to offset dilution from our equity compensation plans. during the years ended december 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, we repurchased 4.6 million, 3.9 million and 4.4 million shares of our common stock, respectively, at an average price per share of $58.02, $41.16 and $32.45, respectively, pursuant to the current repurchase program, as well as prior programs approved by the board of directors.
repurchases under the share repurchase program will be executed in the open market subject to rule 10b-18 promulgated under the exchange act. subject to applicable securities laws requirements, we may choose to suspend or discontinue the repurchase program at any time. any purchases made under the program will be reflected as an increase in cash used in financing activities.

convertible senior notes in february 2014, we issued $690.0 million par value of convertible senior notes due 2019 and entered into related convertible note hedge and warrant transactions. the terms of the notes, hedge and warrant transactions are discussed more fully in note 11 to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10-k. we intend to use the net proceeds of the offering for share repurchases in addition to the $62.0 million in repurchases discussed above, working capital and general corporate purposes, including potential acquisitions and other strategic transactions.
liquidity outlook we believe, based on our present business plan, that our current cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities balances and our forecasted cash flows from operations will be sufficient to meet our foreseeable cash needs for at least the next 12 months. our foreseeable cash needs include our planned capital expenditures, salaries related to increased hiring, investments in information technology and facility expansion, as well as anticipated share repurchases, lease and purchase commitments and settlements of other long-term liabilities.

in accordance with the authoritative guidance for accounting for uncertainty in income taxes, as of december 31, 2014, we had unrecognized tax benefits of $41.1 million, including $7.7 million of accrued interest and penalties. we believe it is reasonably possible $4.3 million of our unrecognized tax benefits may be recognized by the end of 2015 as a result of ongoing audits. the settlement period for the remaining amount is unknown.
letters of credit as of december 31, 2014, we had outstanding $8.3 million in irrevocable letters of credit issued by us in favor of third party beneficiaries, primarily related to facility leases. these irrevocable letters of credit, which are not included in the table of contractual obligations above, are unsecured and are expected to remain in effect, in some cases, until january 2024.
off-balance sheet arrangements we have entered into various indemnification arrangements with third parties, including vendors, customers, landlords, our officers and directors, shareholders of acquired companies and third party licensees of our technology. generally, these indemnification agreements require us to reimburse losses suffered by third parties due to various events, such as lawsuits arising from patent or copyright infringement or our negligence. these indemnification obligations are considered off-balance sheet arrangements in accordance with the authoritative guidance for guarantor's accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees, including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others. to date, we have not encountered material costs as a result of such obligations and have not accrued any significant liabilities related to such indemnification obligations in our financial statements. see note 10 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10-k for further discussion of these indemnification agreements.

legal matters we are party to litigation that we consider routine and incidental to our business. management does not currently expect the results of any of these litigation matters to have a material effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition or cash flows.
we are conducting an internal investigation, with the assistance of outside counsel, relating to sales practices in a country outside the u.s. that represented less than 1% of our revenue in each of the years ended december 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012. the internal investigation includes a review of compliance with the requirements of the u.s. foreign corrupt practices act and other applicable laws and regulations by employees in that market.  in february 2015, we voluntarily contacted the u.s. securities and exchange commission and department of justice to advise both agencies of this internal investigation. as of the filing of this annual report on form 10-k, we cannot predict the outcome of this matter. no provision with respect to this matter has been made in our consolidated financial statements.
recent accounting pronouncements in may 2014, the financial accounting standards board issued updated guidance and disclosure requirements for recognizing revenue. the new revenue recognition standard provides a five-step analysis of transactions to determine when and how revenue is recognized.  the core principle is that a company should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. this guidance will be effective for us on january 1, 2017 and may be applied retrospectively to each period presented or as a cumulative-effect adjustment as of the date of adoption.  we are evaluating the potential impact of adopting this new accounting guidance.
application of critical accounting policies and estimates overview our md&a is based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with gaap. these principles require us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, cash flow and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. our estimates include those related to revenue recognition, accounts receivable and related reserves, valuation and impairment of marketable securities, capitalized internal-use software development costs, goodwill and acquired intangible assets, income tax reserves, impairment and useful lives of long-lived assets and stock-based compensation. we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances at the time such estimates are made. actual results may differ from these estimates. for a complete description of our significant accounting policies, see note 2 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10-k.
definitions we define our critical accounting policies as those policies that require us to make subjective estimates and judgments about matters that are uncertain and are likely to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. our estimates are based upon assumptions and judgments about matters that are highly uncertain at the time an accounting estimate is made and applied and require us to assess a range of potential outcomes.
review of critical accounting policies and estimates revenue recognition revenue is recognized only when the price is fixed or determinable, persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, the service is performed and collectability of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured.
we primarily derive revenue from the sale of services to customers executing contracts with terms of one year or longer. these contracts generally commit the customer to a minimum of monthly, quarterly or annual level of usage and specify the rate at which the customer must pay for actual usage above the monthly, quarterly or annual minimum. for contracts with a monthly commitment, we recognize the monthly minimum as revenue each month, provided that an enforceable contract has been signed by both parties, the service has been delivered to the customer, the fee for the service is fixed or determinable and collection is reasonably assured. should a customer's usage of our service exceed the monthly minimum, we recognize revenue for such excess usage in the period of the additional usage. for annual or other non-monthly period revenue commitments, we recognize revenue monthly based upon the customer's actual usage each month of the commitment period and only recognize any remaining committed amount for the applicable period in the last month thereof.
we typically charge customers an integration fee when the services are first activated. the integration fees are recorded as deferred revenue and recognized as revenue ratably over the estimated life of the customer arrangement. we also derive revenue from services sold as discrete, non-recurring events or based solely on usage. for these services, we recognize revenue once the event or usage has occurred.
when more than one element is contained in a revenue arrangement, we determine the fair value for each element in the arrangement based on vendor-specific objective evidence, or vsoe, for each respective element, including any renewal rates for services contractually offered to the customer. elements typically included in our multiple element arrangements consist of our core services - the delivery of content, applications and software over the internet - as well as mobile and security solutions and enterprise professional services. these elements have value to our customers on a stand-alone basis in that they can be sold separately by another vendor. generally, there is no right of return relative to these services.
we typically use vsoe to determine the fair value of our separate elements. all stand-alone sales of professional services are reviewed to establish the average stand-alone selling price for those services. for our core services, the fair value is the price charged for a single deliverable on a per unit basis when it is sold separately.
for arrangements in which we are unable to establish vsoe, third party evidence, or tpe, of the fair value of each element is determined based upon the price charged when the element is sold separately by another vendor. for arrangements in which we are unable to establish vsoe or tpe for each element, we use the best estimate of selling price, or besp, to determine the fair value of the separate deliverables. we estimate besp based upon a management-approved price list and pre-established discount levels for each solution that takes into consideration volume, geography and industry lines. we allocate arrangement consideration across the multiple elements using the relative selling price method.
at the inception of a customer contract, we make an estimate as to that customer's ability to pay for the services provided. we base our estimate on a combination of factors, including the successful completion of a credit check or financial review, our collection experience with the customer and other forms of payment assurance. upon the completion of these steps, we recognize revenue monthly in accordance with our revenue recognition policy. if we subsequently determine that collection from the customer is not reasonably assured, we record an allowance for doubtful accounts and bad debt expense for all of that customer's unpaid invoices and cease recognizing revenue for continued services provided until cash is received from the customer. changes in our estimates and judgments about whether collection is reasonably assured would change the timing of revenue or amount of bad debt expense that we recognize.
we also sell our services through a reseller channel. assuming all other revenue recognition criteria are met, we recognize revenue from reseller arrangements based on the reseller's contracted non-refundable minimum purchase commitments over the term of the contract, plus amounts sold by the reseller to its customers in excess of the minimum commitments. amounts attributable to this excess usage are recognized as revenue in the period in which the service is provided.
from time to time, we enter into contracts to sell our services or license our technology to unrelated enterprises at or about the same time we enter into contracts to purchase products or services from the same enterprises. if we conclude that these contracts were negotiated concurrently, we record as revenue only the net cash received from the vendor, unless the product or service received has a separate and identifiable benefit and the fair value to us of the vendor's product or service can be objectively established.
we may from time to time resell licenses or services of third parties. we record revenue for these transactions on a gross basis when we have risk of loss related to the amounts purchased from the third party and we add value to the license or service, such as by providing maintenance or support for such license or service. if these conditions are present, we recognize revenue when all other revenue recognition criteria are satisfied.
deferred revenue represents amounts billed to customers for which revenue has not been recognized. deferred revenue primarily consists of the unearned portion of monthly billed service fees, prepayments made by customers for future periods, deferred integration and activation set-up fees and amounts billed under customer arrangements with extended payment terms.
accounts receivable and related reserves trade accounts receivable are recorded at the invoiced amounts and do not bear interest. in addition to trade accounts receivable, our accounts receivable balance includes unbilled accounts that represent revenue recorded for customers that is typically billed within one month. we record reserves against our accounts receivable balance. these reserves consist of allowances for doubtful accounts and revenue from certain customers on a cash-basis. increases and decreases in the allowance for doubtful accounts are included as a component of general and administrative expense in the consolidated statements of operations. increases in the reserve for cash-basis customers are recorded as reduction of revenue. the reserve for cash-basis customers increases as services are provided to customers for which collection is no longer reasonably assured. the reserve decreases and revenue is recognized when and if cash payments are received.
estimates are used in determining these reserves and are based upon our review of outstanding balances on a customer-specific, account-by-account basis. the allowance for doubtful accounts is based upon a review of customer receivables from prior sales with collection issues where we no longer believe that the customer has the ability to pay for prior services provided. we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers. if such an evaluation indicates that payment is no longer reasonably assured for services provided, any future services provided to that customer will result in creation of a cash basis reserve until we receive consistent payments.
valuation and impairment of marketable securities we measure the fair value of our financial assets and liabilities at the end of each reporting period. fair value is defined as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. we have certain financial assets and liabilities recorded at fair value (principally cash equivalents and short- and long-term marketable securities) that have been classified as level 1, 2 or 3 within the fair value hierarchy. fair values determined by level 1 inputs utilize quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that we can access at the reporting date. fair values determined by level 2 inputs utilize data points other than quoted prices included within level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly. fair values determined by level 3 inputs are based on unobservable data points for the asset or liability.
marketable securities are considered to be impaired when a decline in fair value below cost basis is determined to be other-than-temporary. we periodically evaluate whether a decline in fair value below cost basis is other-than-temporary by considering available evidence regarding these investments including, among other factors, the duration of the period that, and extent to which, the fair value is less than cost basis, the financial health of and business outlook for the issuer, including industry and sector performance and operational and financing cash flow factors, overall market conditions and trends and our intent and ability to retain our investment in the security for a period of time sufficient to allow for an anticipated recovery in market value. once a decline in fair value is determined to be other-than-temporary, a write-down is recorded and a new cost basis in the security is established. assessing the above factors involves inherent uncertainty. write-downs, if recorded, could be materially different from the actual market performance of marketable securities in our portfolio if, among other things, relevant information related to our investments and marketable securities was not publicly available or other factors not considered by us would have been relevant to the determination of impairment.
impairment and useful lives of long-lived assets we review our long-lived assets, such as property and equipment and acquired intangible assets, for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable. events that would trigger an impairment review include a change in the use of the asset or forecasted negative cash flows related to the asset. when such events occur, we compare the carrying amount of the asset to the undiscounted expected future cash flows related to the asset. if this comparison indicates that impairment is present, the amount of the impairment is calculated as the difference between the carrying amount and the fair value of the asset. if a readily determinable market price does not exist, fair value is estimated using discounted expected cash flows attributable to the asset. the estimates required to apply this accounting policy include forecasted usage of the long-lived assets, the useful lives of these assets and expected future cash flows. changes in these estimates could materially impact results from operations.
effective january 1, 2013, we increased the expected average useful lives of our network assets, primarily servers, from three to four years to reflect software and hardware related initiatives to manage our global network more efficiently. this change was recorded prospectively and decreased depreciation expense on network assets by approximately $21.1 million and $45.7 million and increased net income by approximately $15.5 million and $33.6 million for the years ended december 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. the change also increased both basic and diluted net income per share by $0.09 for the year ended december 31, 2014 and $0.19 and $0.18, respectively, for the years ended december 31, 2013.
goodwill and acquired intangible assets we test goodwill for impairment on an annual basis, as of december 31, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired. we have concluded that we have one reporting unit and that our chief operating decision maker is our chief executive officer and the executive management team. we have assigned the entire balance of goodwill to our one reporting unit. the fair value of the reporting unit was based on our market capitalization as of each of december 31, 2014 and 2013, and it was substantially in excess of the carrying value of the reporting unit at each date.
acquired intangible assets consist of completed technologies, customer relationships, trademarks and trade names, non-compete agreements and acquired license rights. we engaged third party valuation specialists to assist us with the initial measurement of the fair value of acquired intangible assets. acquired intangible assets, other than goodwill, are amortized over their estimated useful lives based upon the estimated economic value derived from the related intangible assets.
income taxes our provision for income taxes is comprised of a current and a deferred portion. the current income tax provision is calculated as the estimated taxes payable or refundable on tax returns for the current year. the deferred income tax provision is calculated for the estimated future tax effects attributable to temporary differences and carryforwards by using expected tax rates in effect in the years during which the differences are expected to reverse or the carryforwards are expected to be realized.
we currently have net deferred tax assets, comprised of net operating loss, or nol, carryforwards, tax credit carryforwards and deductible temporary differences. our management periodically weighs the positive and negative evidence to determine if it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will be realized. in determining our net deferred tax assets and valuation allowances, annualized effective tax rates and cash paid for income taxes, management is required to make judgments and estimates about domestic and foreign profitability, the timing and extent of the utilization of net operating loss carryforwards, applicable tax rates, transfer pricing methodologies and tax planning strategies. judgments and estimates related to our projections and assumptions are inherently uncertain; therefore, actual results could differ materially from our projections.
we have recorded certain tax reserves to address potential exposures involving our income tax positions. these potential tax liabilities result from the varying application of statutes, rules, regulations and interpretations by different taxing jurisdictions. our estimate of the value of our tax reserves contains assumptions based on past experiences and judgments about the interpretation of statutes, rules and regulations by taxing jurisdictions. it is possible that the costs of the ultimate tax liability or benefit from these matters may be more or less than the amount that we estimated.
uncertainty in income taxes is recognized in our financial statements using a two-step process to determine the amount of tax benefit to be recognized. first, the tax position must be evaluated to determine the likelihood that it will be sustained upon external examination. if the tax position is deemed more-likely-than-not to be sustained, the tax position is then assessed to determine the amount of benefit to recognize in the financial statements. the amount of the benefit that may be recognized is the largest amount that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement.
accounting for stock-based compensation we issue stock-based compensation awards including stock options, restricted stock units and deferred stock units. we measure the fair value of these awards at the grant date and recognize such fair value as expense over the vesting period. we have selected the black-scholes option pricing model to determine the fair value of stock option awards. determining the fair value of stock-based awards at the grant date requires judgment, including estimating the expected life of the stock awards and the volatility of the underlying common stock. our assumptions may differ from those used in prior periods. changes to the assumptions may have a significant impact on the fair value of stock-based awards, which could have a material impact on our financial statements. judgment is also required in estimating the amount of stock-based awards that are expected to be forfeited. should our actual forfeiture rates differ significantly from our estimates, our stock-based compensation expense and results of operations could be materially impacted. in addition, for awards that vest and become exercisable only upon achievement of specified performance conditions, we make judgments and estimates each quarter about the probability that such performance conditions will be met or achieved. changes to the estimates we make from time to time may have a significant impact on our stock-based compensation expense and could materially impact our result of operations.
capitalized internal-use software costs we capitalize salaries and related costs, including stock-based compensation, of employees and consultants who devote time to the development of internal-use software development projects, as well as interest expense related to our senior convertible notes. capitalization begins during the application development stage, once the preliminary project stage has been completed. if a project constitutes an enhancement to previously-developed software, we assess whether the enhancement is significant and creates additional functionality to the software, thus qualifying the work incurred for capitalization. once the project is available for general release, capitalization ceases and we estimate the useful life of the asset and begin amortization. we periodically assess whether triggering events are present to review internal-use software for impairment. changes in our estimates related to internal-use software would increase or decrease operating expenses or amortization recorded during the period.

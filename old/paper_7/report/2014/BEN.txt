item 7.   management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations.
forward-looking statements the following discussion and analysis of the results of operations and financial condition of franklin resources, inc. ("franklin") and its subsidiaries (collectively, the "company") should be read in conjunction with the "forward-looking statements" section set forth in part i and the "risk factors" section set forth in item 1a of part i of this annual report on form 10-k and in any more recent filings with the u.s. securities and exchange commission (the "sec"), each of which describe these risks, uncertainties and other important factors in more detail.
overview we are a global investment management organization and derive our operating revenues and net income from providing investment management and related services to investors in jurisdictions worldwide through products that include investment funds and institutional, high net-worth and separately-managed accounts (collectively, our "sponsored investment products" or "sips"). in addition to investment management, our services include fund administration, sales, distribution, marketing, shareholder servicing, trustee, custody and other fiduciary services. our sips and investment management and related services are distributed or marketed to the public globally under seven distinct brand names: franklin®, templeton®, mutual series®, bissett®, fiduciary trusttm, darby®, balanced equity management® and k2®. we offer a broad range of sips under equity, hybrid, fixed-income and cash management funds and accounts, including alternative investment products, that meet a wide variety of specific investment needs of individual and institutional investors. we also provide sub-advisory services to certain investment products sponsored by other companies which may be sold to the public under the brand names of those other companies or on a co-branded basis.
the level of our revenues depends largely on the level and relative mix of assets under management ("aum"). as noted in the "risk factors" section set forth above in item 1a of part i of this annual report on form 10-k, the amount and mix of our aum are subject to significant fluctuations and can negatively impact our revenues and income. the level of our revenues also depends on mutual fund sales and the number of mutual fund shareholder accounts. the fees charged for our services are based on contracts with our sips or our clients. these arrangements could change in the future.
during the fiscal year ended september 30, 2014 ("fiscal year 2014"), the global equity financial markets provided strong returns, evidenced by increases of 20% in the s&p 500 index and 13% in the msci world index. the overall market performance benefited from an improved global outlook for much of the year, but was tempered by the crisis in ukraine and economic slowdowns in china and europe. volatility increased during our fourth fiscal quarter, as global concerns more than offset the positive u.s. outlook, lowering the overall performance for the year. the prospect of interest rate increases also led to strengthening of the u.s. dollar during the fourth quarter. the global bond markets were uneven throughout the year as the barclays global aggregate index increased 1%. the overall market improvement benefited our aum, fee revenues, operating income and net income, all of which increased from the prior fiscal year.
our total aum at september 30, 2014 was $898.0 billion, 6% higher than at september 30, 2013, primarily driven by $69.2 billion of market appreciation, partially offset by a $6.8 billion decrease due to foreign exchange revaluation and $4.6 billion of net new outflows. the increase in simple monthly average aum ("average aum") for fiscal year 2014 was higher, at 10%, as market depreciation in the fourth quarter led to a decrease in the amount of total aum at year end.
the business and regulatory environments in which we operate globally remain complex, uncertain and subject to change. we are subject to various laws, rules and regulations globally that impose restrictions, limitations and registration, reporting and disclosure requirements on our business and add complexity to our global compliance operations. in september 2014, franklin deregistered as a bank holding company with the board of governors of the federal reserve system.
uncertainties regarding economic stabilization and improvement remain for the foreseeable future. as we continue to confront the challenges of the current economic and regulatory environments, we remain focused on the investment performance of our sips and on providing high quality customer service to our clients. while we are focused on expense

management, we will also seek to attract, retain and develop employees and invest strategically in systems and technology that will provide a secure and stable environment. we will continue to seek to protect and further our brand recognition while developing and maintaining broker/dealer and client relationships. the success of these and other strategies may be influenced by the factors discussed in the "risk factors" section in part i of this annual report.

1    defined as operating income divided by total operating revenues.
operating income increased in fiscal year 2014 primarily due to a 10% increase in investment management fees, which was driven by a 10% increase in average aum, partially offset by a 4% increase in operating expenses. net income attributable to franklin resources, inc. increased $234.1 million primarily due to the increase in operating income.
operating income increased in the fiscal year ended september 30, 2013 ("fiscal year 2013") primarily due to a 14% increase in investment management fees, which was driven by a 15% increase in average aum, partially offset by a lower effective management fee rate. net income attributable to franklin resources, inc. increased $218.8 million as the increase in operating income was partially offset by lower investment and other income.
in july 2013, a three-for-one split of the company's common stock was distributed to common stockholders in the form of a stock dividend. share and per share data for all prior periods presented have been adjusted retroactively to reflect the stock split.
diluted earnings per share increased in fiscal years 2014 and 2013 consistent with the increases in net income and the impacts of 1% decreases in diluted average common shares outstanding primarily resulting from the repurchase of shares of our common stock.

aum at september 30, 2014 increased 6% from september 30, 2013, primarily due to $69.2 billion of market appreciation, as strong positive returns in global markets resulted in valuation increases in all long-term investment objectives, partially offset by a $6.8 billion decrease due to foreign exchange revaluation and $4.6 billion of net new outflows. average aum also benefited from market appreciation, increasing 10% during fiscal year 2014.
aum at september 30, 2013 increased 13% from september 30, 2012, primarily due to $66.1 billion of market appreciation and $24.3 billion of net new flows. strong positive returns in global markets resulted in valuation increases in all long-term investment objectives with the exception of tax-free fixed-income, which was negatively impacted by investor concerns regarding the economic outlook for certain municipalities. the net new flows were primarily driven by inflows in global/international fixed-income products. average aum benefited from the same factors, increasing 15% during fiscal year 2013.
average aum is generally more indicative of trends in revenue for providing investment management and fund administration services than the year-over-year change in ending aum.

1    includes impact of foreign exchange revaluation.
aum increased $53.3 billion or 6% during fiscal year 2014, primarily due to $62.4 billion of market appreciation and other, which is net of a $6.8 billion decrease due to the impact of foreign exchange revaluation, partially offset by $4.6 billion of net new outflows. the market appreciation occurred in all long-term investment objectives, and reflected positive returns in global markets, as evidenced by increases in the msci world and s&p 500 indexes of 13% and 20%. the foreign exchange revaluation was primarily due to strengthening of the u.s. dollar against the canadian dollar, euro and australian dollar. long-term sales decreased 11% to $192.6 billion from the prior year primarily due to lower sales of global/international fixed-income products, partially offset by higher sales of equity products. long-term redemptions increased 4% to $197.5 billion primarily due to higher redemptions in equity and hybrid products, partially offset by lower redemptions in tax-free fixed-income products.
aum increased $94.8 billion or 13% during fiscal year 2013, primarily driven by $66.1 billion of market appreciation and other and $24.3 billion of net new flows. the market appreciation primarily resulted from equity and

hybrid products, consistent with increases in the msci world and s&p 500 indexes of 21% and 19%. long-term sales increased 26% to $215.6 billion from the prior year, primarily due to higher sales of global/international fixed-income and hybrid products. long-term redemptions increased 10% to $190.0 billion due to higher redemptions in all investment objectives with the exception of hybrid, which had an $11.1 billion redemption from an institutional advisory account in the prior year.

the mix of average aum in the united states sales region remained consistent at 65% for fiscal years 2014, 2013 and 2012.
due to the global nature of our business operations, investment management and related services may be performed in locations unrelated to the sales region.
investment performance overview a key driver of our overall success is the long-term investment performance of our sips. a standard measure of the performance of these investment products is the percentage of aum exceeding benchmarks and peer group medians. the investment performance of our taxable fixed-income products has been strong with aum frequently outperforming the benchmarks and peer group medians for the one-, three-, five- and ten-year periods ended september 30, 2014. our global/international fixed-income funds generated notable results with at least 88% of aum exceeding the benchmarks and at least 93% of aum exceeding the peer group medians for all four periods presented, as did our hybrid products with at least 81% of aum exceeding the benchmarks and at least 92% of aum exceeding the peer group medians for all four periods. in addition, 100% of aum in our tax-free fixed-income products exceeded the peer group median for the ten-year period. the performance of our global/international equity products has also been solid with at least 44% of aum exceeding the benchmarks and peer group medians for the three-, five- and ten-year periods; however, the performance of our united states equity products has mostly lagged the benchmarks and peer group medians during the periods presented.

aum measured in the benchmark and peer group rankings represents 90% and 85% of our total aum as of september 30, 2014. the benchmark comparisons are based on each fund's return as compared to a market index that has been selected to be generally consistent with the investment objectives of the fund.
for products with multiple share classes, rankings for the primary share class are applied to the entire product. private equity funds, certain privately-offered emerging market and real estate funds, cash management funds and funds acquired in fiscal year 2013 are not included. certain other funds and products were also excluded because of limited benchmark or peer group data. had this data been available, the results may have been different. these results assume the reinvestment of dividends, are based on data available as of october 16, 2014 and are subject to revision. while we remain focused on achieving strong long-term performance, our future benchmark and peer group rankings may vary from our past performance.

investment management fees investment management fees are generally calculated under contractual arrangements with our sips and the products for which we provide sub-advisory services as a percentage of the market value of aum. annual rates vary by investment objective and type of services provided. rates for products sold outside of the u.s. are generally higher than for u.s. products because they are structured to compensate for certain distribution costs.
investment management fees increased $494.3 million and $612.7 million in fiscal years 2014 and 2013, primarily due to 10% and 15% increases in average aum. average aum increased in both years in all sales regions and across all long-term investment objectives with the exception of tax-free fixed-income in fiscal year 2014.
our effective investment management fee rate (investment management fees divided by average aum) was 62.7 basis points for fiscal years 2014 and 2013, and 63.2 basis points for fiscal year 2012. the rate for fiscal year 2014 remained unchanged as the impacts of higher performance fees, a slightly higher weighting of higher fee products in the u.s. equity objective and a change in the pricing structure in canada were offset by the impacts of slightly higher weightings of aum in u.s. products and in lower fee products in the global/international equity and fixed-income objectives. the pricing structure change in canada resulted in the bundling of investment management and servicing fees effective january 1, 2014. the rate decrease in fiscal year 2013 primarily resulted from fee rebates, which were included in distribution expense in the prior year.
performance-based investment management fees were $50.9 million, $20.1 million and $13.6 million for fiscal years 2014, 2013 and 2012, with the increases primarily related to fund of hedge funds products.

1   u.s. industry asset-weighted average management fee rates were calculated using information available from lipper, a thomson reuters company, as of september 30, 2014, 2013 and 2012 and include all u.s.-registered open-end funds that reported expense data to lipper as of the funds' most recent annual report date, and for which expenses were equal to or greater than zero. as defined by lipper, management fees include fees from providing advisory and fund administration services. the averages combine retail and institutional funds data and include all share classes and distribution channels, without exception. variable annuity and fund-of-funds products are not included. the increase in average rates in the hybrid objective reflects the addition of alternative products to this category.
our actual effective investment management fee rates are generally higher than the u.s. industry average rates as we actively manage our products and have a higher level of international aum, both of which generate higher fees. changes to our effective investment management fee rates in the u.s. have not varied significantly from changes in industry rates, however the changes in our rates during fiscal year 2014 were less than the changes in the industry rates.
our product offerings and global operations are diverse. as such, the impact of future changes in the market value of aum on investment management fees will be affected by the relative mix of investment objective, geographic region, distribution channel and investment vehicle of the assets.

sales and distribution fees we earn fees from the sale of certain classes of sips on which investors pay a commission at the time of purchase ("commissionable sales"). sales commissions are reduced or eliminated on some share classes and for some sale transactions depending upon the amount invested and the type of investor. therefore, sales fees will change with the overall level of gross sales, the size of individual transactions, and the relative mix of sales between different share classes and types of investors.
globally, our mutual funds and certain other products generally pay us distribution fees in return for sales, marketing and distribution efforts on their behalf. specifically, the majority of u.s.-registered mutual funds, with the exception of certain of our money market mutual funds, have adopted distribution plans under rule 12b-1 (the "rule 12b-1 plans") promulgated under the investment company act of 1940. the rule 12b-1 plans permit the mutual funds to pay us for marketing, marketing support, advertising, printing and sales promotion services relating to the distribution of their shares, subject to the rule 12b-1 plans' limitations on amounts based on average daily net aum. similar arrangements exist for the distribution of our non-u.s. funds.
we pay substantially all of our sales and distribution fees to the financial advisers and other intermediaries who sell our sips to the public on our behalf. see the description of sales, distribution and marketing expenses below.
sales and distribution fees by revenue driver are presented below.

asset-based distribution fees increased $130.2 million in fiscal year 2014 primarily due to a 6% increase in the related average aum and a higher mix of equity and hybrid aum. equity and hybrid products typically generate higher distribution fees than fixed-income products. asset-based distribution fees increased $170.3 million in fiscal year 2013 primarily due to a 12% increase in the related average aum.
sales-based fees decreased $98.9 million in fiscal year 2014 primarily due to a 10% decrease in total commissionable sales, as well as a lower mix of u.s. product commissionable sales. sales-based fees increased $84.9 million in fiscal year 2013 primarily due to an 18% increase in total commissionable sales, partially offset by a lower mix of u.s. product sales. u.s. products typically generate higher sales fees than non-u.s. products. commissionable sales represented 12% of total sales for fiscal years 2014 and 2013, and 13% for fiscal year 2012.
contingent sales charges are earned from investor redemptions within a contracted period of time. these charges are levied only on certain shares sold without a front-end sales charge, and vary with the mix of redemptions of these shares.
shareholder servicing fees we receive shareholder servicing fees as compensation for providing transfer agency services, which include providing customer statements, transaction processing, customer service and tax reporting. these fees are generally fixed charges per shareholder account that vary with the particular type of fund and the service being rendered. in some instances, we charge sips these fees based on the level of aum. in the u.s., transfer agency service agreements provide that accounts closed in a calendar year generally remain billable at a reduced rate through the second quarter of the following calendar year. in canada, such agreements that were in place through december 31, 2013 provided that accounts closed in the calendar year remain billable for four months after the end of the calendar year. accordingly, the level of fees varies with the change in open accounts and the level of closed accounts that remain billable. approximately 1.2 million accounts closed in the u.s. during calendar years 2013 and 2012. a change to the pricing

structure in canada effective january 1, 2014 resulted in the bundling of investment management and servicing fees, therefore shareholder servicing fees are no longer charged to sips in canada.
other services include tax planning and preparation for individual and trust clients, for which fees are primarily account based, and trustee services, for which fees are based on the level of aum.
shareholder servicing fees decreased $22.6 million in fiscal year 2014, primarily due to the change in fee structure in canada. the canada decrease of $33.0 million was partially offset by a $4.7 million increase from sips in the u.s. primarily due to a 6% increase in active accounts, and increases of $3.2 million in trustee services fees and $1.9 million from sips in europe, both primarily due to higher levels of related aum.
shareholder servicing fees increased $1.2 million in fiscal year 2013 primarily due to a $5.5 million increase in fees from a 7% increase in active accounts in the u.s., a $4.4 million increase in fees in europe primarily due to higher levels of aum and a $1.3 million increase in other services fees, substantially offset by a $7.6 million decrease in fees from closed accounts in the u.s. that remained billable at a reduced rate and a $2.4 million decrease in fees from a 6% decrease in billable shareholder accounts in canada.
other, net other, net revenue increased $4.3 million and $13.4 million in fiscal years 2014 and 2013, primarily due to $6.6 million and $17.1 million increases in interest and dividend income from consolidated sips, partially offset by $3.9 million decreases in banking-related net revenues in both years as we wound down and terminated our banking business. the increase in fiscal year 2014 also includes $0.8 million from higher custody fees. during fiscal year 2014 we ceased accepting deposits and originating loans, and deregistered as a bank holding company.

sales, distribution and marketing sales, distribution and marketing expenses primarily consist of payments to financial advisers, broker/dealers and other third parties for providing services to investors in our sips, including marketing support services. sales expenses are determined as percentages of sales and are incurred from the same commissionable sales transactions that generate sales fee revenues. distribution expenses are determined as percentages of aum and are incurred from assets that generate either distribution fees or higher levels of investment management fees. marketing support expenses are based on aum, sales or a combination thereof. also included is the amortization of deferred sales commissions related to up-front commissions on shares sold without a front-end sales charge to investors. the deferred sales commissions are amortized over the periods in which commissions are generally recovered from related revenues.

asset-based expenses increased $158.3 million in fiscal year 2014 primarily due to distribution expense increases of $98.7 million related to u.s. products and $49.6 million related to non-u.s. products. the distribution expense increases primarily resulted from higher related average aum of 7% in the u.s and 3% internationally, and a higher mix of equity and hybrid products globally, which have higher expense rates than fixed-income products.
asset-based expenses increased $202.0 million in fiscal year 2013 primarily due to distribution expense increases of $102.3 million related to non-u.s. products and $90.8 million related to u.s. products. the distribution expense increases primarily resulted from higher related average aum of 15% internationally and 9% in the u.s. the non-u.s. product expense increase was partially offset by a $47.4 million decrease related to fee rebates. the u.s. product expenses were also impacted by a slightly higher mix of class c assets, which have higher expense rates than other u.s. product classes.
distribution expenses, which are typically higher for non-u.s. products, are generally not directly correlated with distribution fee revenues due to international fee structures which provide for recovery of certain distribution costs through investment management fees.
sales-based expenses decreased $102.0 million in fiscal year 2014 primarily due to a 10% decrease in total commissionable sales, as well as a lower mix of u.s. product commissionable sales. sales-based expenses increased $92.3 million in fiscal year 2013 primarily due to an 18% increase in total commissionable sales, partially offset by a lower mix of u.s. product sales. u.s. products typically generate higher sales commissions than non-u.s. products.
amortization of deferred sales commissions decreased $10.2 million in fiscal year 2014 primarily due to lower sales of u.s. class c shares, which are sold without a front-end sales charge to investors. amortization of deferred sales commissions increased $8.1 million in fiscal year 2013 primarily due to higher sales of u.s. class c shares.
compensation and benefits compensation and benefit expenses increased $83.4 million in fiscal year 2014 due to increases in salaries, wages and benefits, and variable compensation. salaries, wages and benefits increased $49.9 million primarily due to higher staffing levels and annual merit salary adjustments that were effective december 1, 2013. variable compensation increased $33.5 million primarily due to higher bonus expense based on our performance.
compensation and benefit expenses increased $129.0 million in fiscal year 2013 due to increases in variable compensation and salaries, wages and benefits. variable compensation increased $71.2 million primarily due to higher bonus expense based on our performance. salaries, wages and benefits increased $57.8 million primarily due to higher staffing levels and annual merit salary adjustments that were effective december 1, 2012, partially offset by a $6.8 million decrease in severance benefits related to employee terminations.
variable compensation as a percentage of compensation and benefits was 39% for fiscal years 2014 and 2013, and 38% for fiscal year 2012. at september 30, 2014, our global workforce had increased to approximately 9,300 employees from approximately 9,000 employees at september 30, 2013.
we continue to place a high emphasis on our pay for performance philosophy. as such, any changes in the underlying performance of our sips or changes in the composition of our incentive compensation offerings could have an impact on compensation and benefit expenses going forward. however, in order to attract and retain talented individuals, our level of compensation and benefit expenses may increase more quickly or decrease more slowly than our revenue.

information systems and technology information systems and technology expenses increased $25.2 million and $8.2 million in fiscal years 2014 and 2013 primarily due to higher investments in strategic technology projects for operational purposes and higher external data service costs.

occupancy we conduct our worldwide operations using a combination of leased and owned facilities. occupancy expenses include rent and other facilities-related costs including depreciation and utilities.
occupancy expenses increased $3.5 million and $4.3 million in fiscal years 2014 and 2013 primarily due to increases in rent expense and building maintenance costs. higher property taxes also contributed to the increase in fiscal year 2014.
general, administrative and other general, administrative and other operating expenses primarily consist of fund-related service fees payable to external parties, corporate travel and entertainment, advertising and promotion costs, professional fees, and other miscellaneous expenses. effective january 1, 2014, we assumed responsibility for certain operating expenses of our canadian funds in exchange for an aum-based administration fee.
general, administrative and other operating expenses increased $48.3 million in fiscal year 2014 primarily due to canadian fund expenses, higher levels of third-party servicing and professional fees, and consulting fees related to private equity performance fees. the increase due to canadian fund expenses was $17.4 million. third-party servicing fees increased $15.7 million primarily due to a pricing structure change and higher subadvisory expenses. professional fees increased $8.4 million due to various corporate activities including the winding down of our private banking business. we incurred $7.6 million of consulting fees related to private equity performance fees in fiscal year 2014.
general, administrative and other operating expenses increased $34.0 million in fiscal year 2013 primarily due to the acquisition of k2 advisors holdings, llc ("k2") and higher levels of general business activity. the k2 acquisition resulted in a $9.5 million increase in amortization of intangible assets and a $7.7 million increase in the related contingent consideration liability. higher business activity levels resulted in increases of $5.1 million in corporate travel expenses, $4.5 million in advertising and promotion expenses and $3.4 million in professional fees.
we are committed to investing in advertising and promotion in response to changing business conditions, and to advance our products where we see continued or potential new growth opportunities. as a result of potential changes in our strategic marketing campaigns, the level of advertising and promotion expenditures may increase more rapidly, or decrease more slowly, than our revenues.

investment and other income, net consists primarily of income (losses) from equity method investees; realized gains (losses) on sale of available-for-sale investment securities; gains (losses) on investments of consolidated sips, trading investment securities, and assets and liabilities of consolidated variable interest entities ("vies"); foreign currency exchange gains (losses) and dividend and interest income.
other income, net increased $83.1 million in fiscal year 2014 primarily due to $32.1 million of foreign currency exchange net gains as the u.s. dollar strengthened against the euro as compared to $30.9 million of net losses in the prior year, and $7.1 million of net gains from changes in the fair value of the assets and liabilities of consolidated collateralized loan obligations ("clos") as compared to $16.0 million of net losses in the prior year.
other income, net decreased $57.7 million in fiscal year 2013 primarily due to market volatility that resulted in net losses and lower net gains on certain investments, foreign currency exchange losses, lower dividend income, and higher interest expense, partially offset by net gains from securities held by consolidated sips and higher realized gains on available-for-sale investment securities. changes in the fair value of the assets and liabilities of consolidated clos resulted in $16.0 million of net losses as compared to $25.6 million of net gains in the prior year, and lower market valuations resulted in a $26.0 million decrease in net gains on trading investment securities. additionally, the u.s. dollar weakened against the euro, resulting in foreign currency exchange net losses of $30.9 million as compared to $7.1 million of net gains in the prior year. dividend income decreased $11.7 million primarily due to a higher mix of investments in short duration fixed-income sips with lower yields. interest expense increased $10.2 million primarily due to debt issued in september 2012 and costs related to early redemption of previously issued debt. these changes were partially offset by $42.4 million of net gains from securities held by consolidated sips as compared to $15.9 million of net losses in the prior year, and a $9.9 million increase in realized gains on available-for-sale investment securities.
significant portions of the net gains (losses) of consolidated clos and sips are offset in noncontrolling interests in our consolidated statements of income.
our investments in sips include initial cash investments made in the course of launching mutual fund and other investment product offerings, as well as investments for other business reasons. the market conditions that impact our aum similarly affect the investment income earned or losses incurred on our sips investments.

investments of consolidated sips and vies are generally assigned a classification in the table above based on the investment objective of the consolidated entity holding the securities. other investments include $521.4 million of investments in equity method investees that hold securities that are subject to market valuation risks and primarily have a global/international equity investment objective.
taxes on income as a multi-national corporation, we provide many of our services from locations outside the u.s. some of these jurisdictions have lower tax rates than the u.s. the mix of pre-tax income subject to these lower rates, when aggregated with income originating in the u.s., produces a lower overall effective income tax rate than existing u.s. federal and state income tax rates.
our effective income tax rate for fiscal year 2014 was 29.3% as compared to 28.3% in fiscal year 2013 and 28.5% in fiscal year 2012. the rate increase in fiscal year 2014 was primarily due to higher earnings in higher tax jurisdictions, partially offset by higher net income attributable to noncontrolling interests. the decrease in fiscal year 2013 was primarily due to net income attributable to noncontrolling interests as compared to net losses in the prior year, partially offset by the impact of changes in state tax legislation in the prior year.
in certain countries our income is subject to reduced tax rates due to tax rulings. one of these rulings expired on september 30, 2014 and was replaced with a new ruling at a higher tax rate on october 1, 2014. the higher tax rate is expected to result in an increase to future years' income tax expense, with an estimated increase of approximately $25 million in fiscal year 2015. however, it is reasonably possible that the increase in fiscal year 2015 may be offset by the recognition of tax benefits as a result of the expiration of statutes of limitations in various u.s. and non-u.s. tax jurisdictions.
48
the effective income tax rate for future reporting periods will continue to reflect the relative contributions of non-u.s. earnings that are subject to reduced tax rates and that are not currently included in u.s. taxable income. changes in tax rates in these jurisdictions may affect our effective income tax rate and net income.
liquidity and capital resources cash flows were as follows:

net cash provided by operating activities increased in fiscal year 2014 primarily due to higher net income, a higher increase in other liabilities primarily resulting from the consolidation impact of short positions of consolidated sips, and a lower increase in receivables, prepaid expenses and other. these increases were partially offset by a net increase in trading securities of consolidated sips, a lower increase in commissions payable, and a lower increase in income taxes payable. net cash provided by investing activities increased mainly due to lower purchases, net of liquidations, of investments by consolidated vies. net cash used in financing activities decreased primarily due to lower dividends paid on common stock, payments on debt in the prior year, and higher subscriptions in consolidated sips by noncontrolling interests, partially offset by a decrease in deposits and higher repurchases of common stock.
net cash provided by operating activities increased in fiscal year 2013 primarily due to a lower net increase in trading securities, higher net income and an increase in income taxes payable as compared to a decrease in the prior year. net cash provided by investing activities decreased mainly due to lower liquidations of investments, cash recognized due to consolidation of a vie in the prior year, and lower proceeds from the sale of loans. net cash used in financing activities increased primarily due to payments on debt as compared to proceeds from issuance of debt in the prior year and higher dividends paid on common stock, partially offset by lower repurchases of common stock.
the assets and liabilities of our consolidated vies and consolidated sips attributable to third-party investors do not impact our liquidity and capital resources. we have no right to these consolidated entities' assets, other than our direct equity investment in them, and/or investment management fees earned from them. the debt holders of these consolidated entities have no recourse to our assets beyond the level of our direct investment, therefore we bear no other risks associated with the entities' liabilities. accordingly, the assets and liabilities of our consolidated vies and consolidated sips, other than our direct investments in them, are excluded from the amounts and discussion below.

our liquid assets and debt consisted of the following:

liquidity liquid assets consist of cash and cash equivalents, receivables and certain investments. cash and cash equivalents primarily consist of cash on hand, deposits with financial institutions, money market funds, securities of u.s. government-sponsored enterprises and the u.s. treasury, and time deposits. liquid investments consist of trading and available-for-sale securities, investments in equity method investees consisting of mutual fund sips, direct investments in redeemable consolidated sips, and time deposits with maturities greater than three months.
cash and cash equivalents at september 30, 2014 increased primarily due to net cash provided by operating and investing activities, partially offset by net cash used in financing activities. the percentages of cash and cash equivalents held by our u.s. and non-u.s. operations were 36% and 64% at september 30, 2014, and 37% and 63% at september 30, 2013.
we utilize a significant portion of our liquid assets to satisfy operational and regulatory requirements and fund capital contributions relating to our sips. certain of our subsidiaries are required by our internal policy or regulation to maintain minimum levels of capital which are partially maintained by retaining cash and cash equivalents. as a result, such subsidiaries may be restricted in their ability to transfer cash to their parent companies. also, as a multi-national corporation, we operate in various locations outside of the u.s. certain of our non-u.s. subsidiaries are subject to regulatory or contractual repatriation restrictions or requirements. such restrictions and requirements limit our ability to transfer cash between various international jurisdictions, including repatriation to the u.s. should we require more capital in the u.s. than is generated domestically, we could elect to reduce the level of discretionary activities, such as share repurchases, or we could elect to repatriate future earnings from non-u.s. jurisdictions or raise capital through debt or equity issuance. certain of these alternatives could result in higher effective tax rates, increased interest expense or other dilution to our earnings. at september 30, 2014, our u.s. and non-u.s. subsidiaries held $1,716.8 million and $2,047.7 million of liquid assets to satisfy operational and regulatory requirements and fund capital contributions to our sips, as compared to $1,864.7 million and $2,178.7 million held at september 30, 2013. included in these amounts were u.s. and non-u.s. liquid assets that were restricted from transfer to franklin and other subsidiaries of $86.8 million and $354.5 million at september 30, 2014 and $551.0 million and $334.6 million at september 30, 2013.
capital resources we believe that we can meet our present and reasonably foreseeable operating cash needs and future commitments through existing liquid assets, continuing cash flows from operations, the ability to issue debt or equity securities and borrowing capacity under our uncommitted private placement program.
in prior fiscal years, we issued senior unsecured and unsubordinated notes for general corporate purposes, to redeem outstanding notes and to finance an acquisition. at september 30, 2014, $1,198.2 million of the notes were outstanding with an aggregate face value of $1,200.0 million. the notes consist of $250.0 million issued at a fixed
50
interest rate of 3.125% per annum which mature in 2015, $300.0 million issued at a fixed interest rate of 1.375% per annum which mature in 2017, $350.0 million issued at a fixed interest rate of 4.625% per annum which mature in 2020 and $300.0 million issued at a fixed interest rate of 2.800% per annum which mature in 2022.
interest on the notes is payable semi-annually. the notes contain an optional redemption feature that allows us to redeem each series of notes prior to maturity in whole or in part at any time, at a make-whole redemption price. the indentures governing the notes contain limitations on our ability and the ability of our subsidiaries to pledge voting stock or profit participating equity interests in our subsidiaries to secure other debt without similarly securing the notes equally and ratably. the indentures also include requirements that must be met if we consolidate or merge with, or sell all of our assets to, another entity. as of september 30, 2014, we were in compliance with the covenants of the notes.
at september 30, 2014, we had $500.0 million of short-term commercial paper available for issuance under an uncommitted private placement program which has been inactive since april 2012. in july 2014, we closed our account at the federal reserve bank of new york resulting in the termination of our bank lines of credit under the federal reserve system and our ability to borrow through the secured federal reserve bank short-term discount window. these closures are a result of the termination of our banking activities, and are not expected to have a material impact on our future liquidity.
our ability to access the capital markets in a timely manner depends on a number of factors, including our credit rating, the condition of the global economy, investors' willingness to purchase our securities, interest rates, credit spreads and the valuation levels of equity markets. if we are unable to access capital markets in a timely manner, our business could be adversely impacted.
uses of capital we expect that our main uses of cash will be to invest in and grow our business, acquire shares of our common stock, invest in our sips, fund property and equipment purchases, pay operating expenses of the business, enhance technology infrastructure and business processes, pay stockholder dividends and repay and service debt.
we declare and pay dividends on a quarterly basis. we declared regular cash dividends of $0.48 per share ($0.12 per share for each quarter) in fiscal year 2014, and regular cash dividends of $0.39 per share ($0.097 per share for each of the first three quarters and $0.10 per share for the fourth quarter) and a special cash dividend of $1.00 per share in fiscal year 2013. we currently expect to continue paying comparable regular cash dividends on a quarterly basis to holders of our common stock depending upon earnings and other relevant factors.
we maintain a stock repurchase program to manage our equity capital with the objective of maximizing shareholder value. our stock repurchase program is effected through regular open-market purchases and private transactions in accordance with applicable laws and regulations. during fiscal years 2014 and 2013, we repurchased 11.5 million and 10.5 million shares of our common stock at a cost of $622.2 million and $491.0 million. in december 2013, our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to 30.0 million additional shares of our common stock under the stock repurchase program. at september 30, 2014, 29.8 million shares remained available for repurchase under the program, which is not subject to an expiration date.
during fiscal year 2014, we redeemed $3.2 million, net of investments, from our sips. during fiscal year 2013, we invested $17.8 million, net of redemptions, in our sips.
in november 2012, we acquired an ownership interest of approximately 69% of k2. the purchase consideration included a $182.9 million cash investment in k2, which was primarily used to retire $176.5 million of debt immediately following the acquisition.
the funds that we manage have their own resources available for purposes of providing liquidity to meet shareholder redemptions, including securities that can be sold or provided to investors as in-kind redemptions, and lines of credit. while we have no contractual obligation to do so, we may voluntarily elect to provide the funds with direct or indirect financial support based on our business objectives.

__________________
1   purchase obligations include contractual amounts that will be due to purchase goods and services to be used in our operations and may be canceled at earlier times than those indicated under certain conditions that may include termination fees.
2   committed capital contributions relate to discretionary commitments to invest in sips and other investment products. generally, the timing of the funding of these commitments is unknown as they are callable on demand at any time prior to the expiration of the commitment periods.
3   contingent consideration liabilities primarily relate to the company's commitment to acquire the remaining interests in k2.
the debt holders of consolidated vies and consolidated sips have no recourse to our assets beyond the level of our direct investments, therefore we bear no risks associated with these entities' liabilities and have not included them in the table above. see note 12 - variable interest entities and consolidated sponsored investment products, in the notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 of part ii of this form 10-k.
at september 30, 2014, our consolidated balance sheet includes liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits of $118.2 million and related accrued interest of $18.0 million (see note 13 - taxes on income in the notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 of part ii of this form 10-k). the amounts of unrecognized tax benefits and related interest that are expected to be paid in the next twelve months are insignificant. however, because of the high degree of uncertainty regarding the timing of future cash outflows of liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits, a reasonable estimate of the period of cash payments beyond the next twelve months from the balance sheet date of september 30, 2014 cannot be made. consequently, unrecognized tax benefits have not been included in the table above.
critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america, which require the use of estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented. these estimates, judgments and assumptions are affected by our application of accounting policies. actual results may differ from those estimates under different assumptions. described below are the accounting policies that we believe are most critical to understanding our results of operations and financial position. for additional information about our accounting policies, see note 1 - significant accounting policies in the notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 of part ii of this form 10-k.
consolidation we consolidate our subsidiaries and sips in which we have a controlling financial interest. we have a controlling financial interest when we own a majority of the voting interest in an entity or are the primary beneficiary of a vie. we also consolidate non-vie limited partnerships and similar structures that we control.
52
a vie is an entity in which the equity investment holders have not contributed sufficient capital to finance its activities or the equity investment holders do not have defined rights and obligations normally associated with an equity investment. the assessment of whether an entity is a vie or voting interest entity ("voe") involves judgment and analysis on a structure by structure basis. when performing the assessment we consider factors such as the entity's legal organization and capital structure, the rights of the equity investment holders and our contractual involvement with and ownership interest in the entity. our vies are all investment entities and our variable interests consist of our equity ownership in and/or investment management fees earned from these entities.
a limited partnership or similar structure entity for which we are the general partner or managing member, our aggregate investment is not substantive and the limited partners or other investors do not have the substantive ability to remove us as the general partner or managing member or otherwise participate in the decision making of the entity is a vie. otherwise the entity is a voe and we are presumed to control the entity unless the limited partners or other investors have the substantive ability to remove us as the general partner or managing member or otherwise participate in the decision-making of the entity.
we use two models for determining whether we are the primary beneficiary of vies. for all vies with the exception of clos, we are the primary beneficiary if we have the majority of the risks or rewards of ownership, which we determine using expected cash flows scenarios. for clos, we are the primary beneficiary if we have the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the vie's economic performance and the obligation to absorb losses of or right to receive benefits from the vie that could potentially be significant to the vie.
under both models, the key estimates and assumptions used in the analyses include the amount of aum, investment management fee rates, the life of the investment product, prepayment rates, and the discount rate. these estimates and assumptions are subject to variability. for example, aum is impacted by market volatility and the level of sales, redemptions, contributions, withdrawals and dividend reinvestments of mutual fund shares that occur daily. in addition, third-party purchases and redemptions, which are outside of our control, can impact our evaluation. collateralized assets of clos are impacted by market volatility and prepayment rates. there is judgment involved in assessing whether we have the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact vies' economic performance and the obligation to absorb losses of or right to receive benefits from vies that could potentially be significant to the vies. as of september 30, 2014, we were the primary beneficiary of three clos and two other sip vies.

fair value measurements we use a three-level fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value based on whether the inputs to those valuation techniques are observable or unobservable. the three levels of fair value hierarchy are set forth below. our assessment of the hierarchy level of the assets or liabilities measured at fair value is determined based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety. transfers between levels are recognized at the end of each quarter.
level 1   unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
level 2   observable inputs other than level 1 quoted prices, such as non-binding quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active; or inputs other than quoted prices that are observable or corroborated by observable market data. level 2 quoted prices are generally obtained from two independent third-party brokers or dealers, including prices derived from model-based valuation techniques for which the significant assumptions are observable in the market or corroborated by observable market data. quoted prices are validated through price variance analysis, subsequent sales testing, stale price review, price comparison across pricing vendors and due diligence reviews of third-party vendors.
level 3   unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity. these inputs require significant management judgment and reflect our estimation of assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability.
the fair values for level 3 assets and liabilities are determined using various methodologies in accordance with our global valuation and pricing policy which defines valuation and pricing conventions for each security type. when available, we measure fair value based on the reported net asset value ("nav") of underlying investments or independent third-party broker or dealer price quotes. these inputs are evaluated for reasonableness through various procedures which include due diligence reviews of the third parties, price comparisons across pricing vendors, stale price reviews and subsequent sales testing. if these inputs are not available, we primarily employ a market-based method, using purchase multiples observed for comparable third-party transactions, valuations of comparable entities, projected operating results of the investee entity or subsequent financing transactions entered into by the investee entity. if the inputs for a market-based method are not available, we utilize an income-based method, which considers the net present value of anticipated future cash flows of the investment. a discount may be applied due to the nature or duration of any restrictions on the disposition of the investment. we review and approve the market-based and income-based methods on a periodic basis for changes that would impact the unobservable inputs incorporated into the valuation process. the fair value measurements from these methods are further validated through price variance analysis, subsequent sales testing and market comparable sales.
we record a substantial amount of our investments at fair value or amounts that approximate fair value on a recurring basis. fair values are estimated for disclosure purposes for financial instruments that are not measured at fair value.
as of september 30, 2014, level 3 assets represented 20% of total assets measured at fair value, substantially all of which related to investments of consolidated sips in equity and debt securities of entities and funds that are not traded in active markets. level 3 liabilities, comprised of contingent consideration liabilities and debt of consolidated vies, represented 15% of total liabilities measured at fair value at september 30, 2014. there were insignificant transfers into and out of level 3 during fiscal year 2014.
following are descriptions of the significant assets and liabilities measured at fair value, including the fair value methodologies used and hierarchy levels.
investment securities, trading consist primarily of non-consolidated sips and to a lesser extent, debt securities. the fair value of the sips is determined based on their published nav and they are classified as level 1. the fair value of the debt securities is primarily determined using independent third-party broker or dealer price quotes, and they are classified level 2.
54
investment securities, available-for-sale consist primarily of non-consolidated sips, securities of u.s. states and political subdivisions, securities of the u.s. treasury and federal agencies, corporate debt securities, mortgage-backed securities, and other equity securities. the fair value of the sips is determined based on their published nav and they are classified as level 1. the fair value of the debt securities is primarily determined using independent third-party broker or dealer price quotes and they are classified as level 2. the fair value of other equity securities, which consist primarily of non-sponsored investment products, is determined based on their published nav, and they are classified as level 1.
investment securities, available-for-sale are evaluated for other-than-temporary impairment on a quarterly basis when the cost of an investment exceeds its fair value. we consider many factors, including the severity and duration of the decline in fair value below cost, our intent and ability to hold the security for a period of time sufficient for an anticipated recovery in fair value, and the financial condition and specific events related to the issuer.
investments of consolidated sips consist of trading securities and other investments that are not generally traded in active markets. the fair value of the trading securities is determined using quoted market prices, or independent third-party broker or dealer price quotes if quoted market prices are not available. these securities are classified as level 1 or level 2. the quoted market prices may be adjusted if events occur, such as significant price changes in u.s.-traded market proxies after the close of corresponding foreign markets, trade halts or suspensions, or unscheduled market closures. the market proxies consist of correlated country-specific exchange-traded securities such as futures, american depositary receipts indices or exchange-traded funds. the price adjustments are primarily determined based on third-party factors derived from model-based valuation techniques for which the significant assumptions are observable in the market.
the investments that are not generally traded in active markets consist of debt and equity securities of entities in emerging markets and fund products. the fair values of the debt and equity securities are determined using significant unobservable inputs in either a market-based or income-based approach and they are classified as level 3. the fair value of the fund products is determined using nav as a practical expedient. these investments are classified as level 2 if they are redeemable without restriction on at least a quarterly basis, or level 3 if they have a redemption frequency greater than quarterly, are subject to redemption restrictions, or are nonredeemable.
investments and debt of consolidated vies consist of corporate debt securities held by and debt issued by clos.  we elected the fair value option for all assets and liabilities of our consolidated clos. the fair values of the corporate debt securities and debt are obtained from independent third-party broker or dealer price quotes and are classified as level 2, except for debt that is classified as level 3 because the price quotes are derived from significant unobservable inputs.
goodwill and other intangible assets goodwill represents the excess cost of a business acquisition over the fair value of the net assets acquired. other intangible assets consist primarily of mutual fund management contracts and customer base assets resulting from business acquisitions. we amortize these intangible assets over their estimated useful lives, which range from six to 15 years, using the straight-line method, unless the asset is determined to have an indefinite useful life. indefinite-lived intangible assets primarily represent contracts to manage mutual fund assets for which there is no foreseeable limit on the contract period.
we make significant estimates and assumptions when valuing goodwill and other intangible assets in connection with the initial purchase price allocation of an acquired entity, as well as when evaluating impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets on an ongoing basis.
goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are tested for impairment annually and when an event occurs or circumstances change that more likely than not reduce the fair value of the related reporting unit or indefinite-lived intangible asset below its carrying value. we have one reporting unit, investment management and related services, consistent with our single operating segment, to which all goodwill has been assigned.
we may first assess goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform a quantitative impairment test. the qualitative analysis considers entity-specific and
55
macroeconomic factors and their potential impact on the key assumptions used in the determination of the fair value of the reporting unit or indefinite-lived intangible asset. a quantitative impairment test is performed if the results of the qualitative assessment indicate that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the related reporting unit is less than its carrying value or an indefinite-lived intangible asset is impaired, or if a qualitative assessment is not performed.
the quantitative goodwill impairment test involves a two-step process. the first step compares the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying value. if the carrying value is less than the fair value, no impairment exists and the second step is not performed. if the carrying value is higher than the fair value, there is an indication that impairment may exist and the second step is performed to compute the amount of the impairment. in the second step, impairment is computed by comparing the implied fair value of reporting unit goodwill with the carrying value of the goodwill.
the quantitative indefinite-lived intangible assets impairment test compares the fair value of the asset to its carrying value. if the carrying value is higher than the fair value, impairment is recognized in the amount of the difference in values.
in estimating the fair value of the reporting unit and indefinite-lived intangible assets, we use valuation techniques based on an income approach under which future cash flows are discounted. our future cash flow estimates include assumptions about revenue and aum growth rates, the pre-tax profit margin, the average effective fee rate, the effective tax rate, and the discount rate, which is based on our weighted average cost of capital. the most relevant of these assumptions to the determination of estimated fair value are the aum growth rate and the discount rate.
we performed our annual impairment tests for goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets as of august 1, 2014. we elected to perform a qualitative assessment of the valuation of goodwill and 86% of our indefinite-lived intangible assets and concluded it is more likely than not that the fair values of our reporting unit and the specific intangible assets exceed their carrying values. we performed a quantitative test for the remaining indefinite-lived intangible assets and did not recognize any impairment because our estimates of the fair values of the assets exceeded their carrying values. the fair values for the remaining indefinite-lived intangible assets exceeded their carrying values by more than 100%.
we subsequently monitor the market conditions and their potential impact on the assumptions used in the annual calculations of fair value to determine whether circumstances have changed that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of our reporting unit below its carrying value, or indicate that our indefinite-lived intangible assets might be impaired. we consider, among other things, changes in our aum and weighted-average cost of capital by assessing whether these changes would impact the reasonableness of the assumptions used in our impairment tests as of august 1, 2014. we also monitor fluctuations of our common stock per share price to evaluate our market capitalization relative to the reporting unit as a whole. subsequent to august 1, 2014, there were no impairments to goodwill or indefinite-lived intangible assets as we determined no events occurred or circumstances changed that would indicate that these assets might be impaired.
we test definite-lived intangible assets for impairment quarterly. impairment is indicated when the carrying value of the asset is not recoverable and exceeds its fair value. in evaluating the recoverability of definite-lived intangible assets, we estimate the undiscounted future cash flows to be derived from these assets. our future undiscounted cash flow projections include assumptions about revenue and aum growth rates, effective fee rates, investor redemptions, the pre-tax profit margin, and expected useful lives. the most relevant of these assumptions to determine future cash flows is the change in the amount of aum. the assumptions used in our impairment tests are developed taking into consideration the ongoing market conditions. if the carrying value of an asset is not recoverable through the related undiscounted cash flows, the impairment loss is measured based on the amount by which the carrying value of the asset exceeds its fair value. the fair value of the asset is determined by discounted cash flows or other methods as appropriate for the asset type.
as of september 30, 2014, the undiscounted future cash flow projections for 56% of our definite-lived intangible assets exceeded their carrying values by at least 70%. we estimated the future undiscounted cash flows for these assets using aum growth rates ranging from (5)% to 6%. the assumptions used in the impairment tests for definite-lived intangible assets were developed taking into consideration current market conditions. as of september 30, 2014, a decline in these assets' related aum of 42% could cause us to evaluate whether their fair value is below the carrying
56
value. the undiscounted future cash flow projections for substantially all of the remaining assets exceeded their carrying values by at least 15%. there was no impairment of definite-lived intangible assets during fiscal year 2014.
revenues investment management, distribution and shareholder servicing fees are recognized as earned over the period in which services are rendered, except for performance-based investment management fees, which are recognized when earned. sales commissions related to the sale of shares of sips are recognized on trade date. investment management fees, other than performance-based fees, and distribution fees are determined based on a percentage of aum, primarily on a monthly basis using average daily aum. performance-based investment management fees are based on performance targets established in the related investment management contracts. shareholder servicing fees are generally calculated based on the number and type of accounts serviced.
aum is generally based on the fair value of the underlying securities held by sips and is calculated using fair value methods derived primarily from unadjusted quoted market prices, unadjusted independent third-party broker or dealer price quotes in active markets, or market prices or price quotes adjusted for observable price movements after the close of the primary market. the fair values of the underlying securities for which market prices are not readily available are internally valued using various methodologies which incorporate unobservable inputs as appropriate for each security type.
pricing of the securities held by sips is governed by our global valuation and pricing policy, which defines valuation and pricing conventions for each security type, including practices for responding to unexpected or unusual market events. as of september 30, 2014, our total aum by fair value hierarchy level was 52% level 1, 47% level 2 and 1% level 3.
as substantially all of our aum is valued based on observable market prices or inputs, market risk is the most significant risk underlying the valuation of our aum. while recent economic conditions have resulted in ongoing market price volatility, the fair value of substantially all of the securities held by sips continues to be derived from observable market inputs.
income taxes deferred tax assets and liabilities are recorded for temporary differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and the reported amounts in the consolidated financial statements using the statutory tax rates in effect for the year when the reported amount of the asset or liability is expected to be recovered or settled, respectively. the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income tax expense in the period that includes the enactment date. a valuation allowance is recorded to reduce the carrying values of deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized. for each tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return, we determine whether it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination based on the technical merits of the position, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation. a tax position that meets the more likely than not recognition threshold is measured to determine the amount of benefit to recognize. the tax position is measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized upon settlement. we recognize the accrual of interest on uncertain tax positions in interest expense and penalties in other operating expenses.
as a multinational corporation, we operate in various locations outside the u.s. and generate earnings from our non-u.s. subsidiaries. we indefinitely reinvest the undistributed earnings of our non-u.s. subsidiaries, except for income previously taxed in the u.s., subject to regulatory or legal repatriation restrictions or requirements, and the excess net earnings reduced by cash needs for operational and regulatory capital requirements, capital management plans and capital expenditure plans of our canadian and u.k. subsidiaries. as a result, we have not recognized a provision for u.s. income taxes and a deferred income tax liability on $7.3 billion of cumulative undistributed non-u.s. earnings that are indefinitely reinvested at september 30, 2014. changes to our policy of reinvestment or repatriation of non-u.s. earnings may have a significant effect on our financial condition and results of operations.
57
loss contingencies we are involved in various lawsuits and claims encountered in the normal course of business. when such a matter arises and periodically thereafter, we consult with our legal counsel and evaluate the merits of the claims based on the facts available at that time. in management's opinion, an adequate accrual has been made as of september 30, 2014 to provide for probable losses that may arise from these matters for which we could reasonably estimate an amount. see also note 14 - commitments and contingencies in the notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 of part ii of this form 10-k.

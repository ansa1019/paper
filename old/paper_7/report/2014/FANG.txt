december 31, 2013. on december 31, 2014, our net acreage position in the permian basin was approximately 85,369 net acres.
2014 developments viper energy partners lp viper energy partners lp, or viper, is a publicly traded delaware limited partnership, the common units of which are listed on the nasdaq global market under the symbol "vnom". viper was formed by us on february 27, 2014, to own, acquire and exploit oil and natural gas properties in north america. viper is currently focused on oil and natural gas properties in the permian basin.
prior to the completion on june 23, 2014 of viper's initial public offering, or the viper offering, we owned all of the general and limited partner interests in viper. the viper offering consisted of 5,750,000 common units representing limited partner interests at a price to the public of $26.00 per common unit, which included 750,000 common units issued pursuant to an option to purchase additional common units granted to the underwriters on the same terms. viper received net proceeds of approximately $137.2 million from the sale of these common units, net of offering expenses and underwriting discounts and commissions.
in connection with the viper offering, we contributed all of the membership interests in viper energy partners llc to viper in exchange for 70,450,000 common units. in addition, in connection with the closing of the viper offering, viper agreed to distribute to diamondback all cash and cash equivalents and the royalty income receivable on hand in the aggregate amount of approximately $11.6 million and the net proceeds from the viper offering. as of december 31, 2014, the partnership had distributed $148.8 million to us pursuant to this agreement. the contribution of viper energy partners llc to viper was accounted for as a combination of entities under common control with assets and liabilities transferred at their carrying amounts in a manner similar to a pooling of interests.
acquisitions on february 27 and 28, 2014, we completed acquisitions of oil and natural gas interests from unrelated third party sellers of additional leasehold interests in martin county, texas, in the permian basin, for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $292.2 million, subject to certain adjustments. these transactions included 6,450 gross (4,785 net) acres with a 74% working interest (56% net revenue interest). we funded these acquisitions with the net proceeds from an underwritten public offering of our common stock completed on february 26, 2014 and borrowings under our revolving credit facility. upon completion of these acquisitions, we became the operator of this acquired acreage.
on september 9, 2014, we completed the acquisition of oil and natural gas interests from unrelated third party sellers of additional leasehold interests in midland, glasscock, reagan and upton counties, texas in the permian basin, for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $523.3 million, subject to certain adjustments. this transaction included 17,617 gross (12,967 net) acres with an approximate 74% working interest (approximately 75% net revenue interest). we funded this acquisition with the net proceeds from an underwritten public offering of our common stock completed on july 25, 2014 and borrowings under our revolving credit facility. upon completion of these acquisitions, we became the operator of this acquired acreage.
common stock transactions in february 2014, we completed an underwritten public offering of 3,450,000 shares of common stock, which included 450,000 shares of common stock issued pursuant to an option to purchase additional shares granted to the underwriters. the stock was sold to the public at $62.67 per share and we received net proceeds of approximately $208.4 million from the sale of these shares of common stock, net of offering expenses and underwriting discounts and commissions.
in july 2014, we completed an underwritten public offering of 5,750,000 shares of common stock, which included 750,000 shares of common stock issued pursuant to an option to purchase additional shares granted to the underwriters. the stock was sold to the public at $87.00 per share and we received net proceeds of approximately $485.0 million from the sale of these shares of common stock, net of offering expenses and underwriting discounts and commissions. the net proceeds of this offering were used to partially fund the september 9, 2014 acquisition described above.

in september 2014, viper completed an underwritten public offering of 3,500,000 common units. the common units were sold to the public at $28.50 per unit and viper received net proceeds of approximately $94.8 million from the sale of these common units, net of offering expenses and underwriting discounts and commissions.
2015 capital budget we expect a 2015 total capital spend of $400.0 million to $450.0 million, consisting of $285.0 million to $315.0 million for horizontal drilling and completions, $20.0 million to $30.0 million for infrastructure and $20.0 million to $30.0 million for non-operated activity and other expenditures. capital spend also includes $75.0 million for expenditures related to 2014 activity (net of expenditures from 2015 expected to be carried into 2016).
during february 2015, we intend to release two horizontal rigs and its remaining vertical rig. of the three remaining horizontal rigs, two will operate at spanish trail in midland county where viper owns the underlying minerals.
we expect to drill and complete 50 to 60 gross horizontal wells in 2015. we expect that service costs will recalibrate to the current commodity environment and anticipates costs for a 7,500 foot lateral horizontal well to range from $6.2 million to $6.7 million. if we do not receive meaningful service cost reductions, we could defer completions.
basis of presentation transfers of a business between entities under common control are accounted for as if the transfer occurred at the beginning of the period, and prior years are retrospectively adjusted to furnish comparative information. as discussed in note 1 to our combined consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report, the windsor ut contribution was accounted for as a transaction between entities under common control. accordingly, the financial information and production data contained in this report have been retrospectively adjusted to include the historical results of windsor ut at historical carrying values and its operations prior to october 11, 2012, the effective date of the windsor ut contribution.
operating results overview during the year ended december 31, 2014, our average daily production was approximately 19,474 boe/d, consisting of 14,744 bbls/d of oil, 11,907 mcf/d of natural gas and 2,745 bbls/d of natural gas liquids, an increase of 12,153 boe/d, or 166%, from average daily production of 7,321 boe/d for the year ended december 31, 2013, consisting of 5,542 bbls/d of oil, 4,741 mcf/d of natural gas and 989 bbls/d of natural gas liquids.
during the year ended december 31, 2014, we drilled 82 gross (67 net) horizontal wells and 27 gross (22 net) vertical wells and participated in the drilling of four gross (two net) non-operated wells in the permian basin. additionally, on properties acquired this year there were 10 gross (8 net) wells drilled during the year ended december 31, 2014 by the original operator between the effective date and closing date on the property acquired.
reserves and pricing ryder scott prepared estimates of our proved reserves at december 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012 (which include estimated proved reserves attributable to viper). the prices used to estimate proved reserves for all periods did not give effect to derivative transactions, were held constant throughout the life of the properties and have been adjusted for quality, transportation fees, geographical differentials, marketing bonuses or deductions and other factors affecting the price received at the wellhead.

sources of our revenue our revenues are derived from the sale of oil and natural gas production, as well as the sale of natural gas liquids that are extracted from our natural gas during processing. our oil and natural gas revenues do not include the effects of derivatives. for the year ended december 31, 2014, our revenues were derived 91% from oil sales, 6% from natural gas liquids sales and 3% from natural gas sales. for the year ended december 31, 2013, our revenues were derived 91% from oil sales, 6% from natural gas liquids sales and 3% from natural gas sales. for the year ended december 31, 2012, our revenues were derived 88% from oil sales, 9% from natural gas liquids sales and 3% from natural gas sales. our revenues may vary significantly from period to period as a result of changes in volumes of production sold, production mix or commodity prices.
since our production consists primarily of oil, our revenues are more sensitive to fluctuations in oil prices than they are to fluctuations in natural gas liquids or natural gas prices. oil, natural gas liquids and natural gas prices have historically been volatile. during 2014, west texas intermediate posted prices ranged from $53.45 to $107.95 per bbl and the henry hub spot market price of natural gas ranged from $2.74 to $8.15 per mmbtu. on december 31, 2014, the west texas intermediate posted price for crude oil was $53.45 per bbl and the henry hub spot market price of natural gas was $3.14 per mmbtu.
the industry has recently observed a decline in oil prices from over $105.00 per bbl in june 2014 to below $50.00 per bbl in february 2015, combined with increasing service costs. while we entered 2015 running five horizontal rigs and one vertical rig, we intend to release two horizontal rigs and the one vertical rig in february 2015 and continue with three horizontal rigs, two of which will operate in spanish trail. our decision to reduce our rig count, rather than increase it as previously contemplated, is based on our goal of maximizing return on capital and minimizing debt until we can get a more attractive return on our assets.
principal components of our cost structure lease operating and natural gas transportation and treating expenses. these are daily costs incurred to bring oil and natural gas out of the ground and to the market, together with the daily costs incurred to maintain our producing properties. such costs also include maintenance, repairs and workover expenses related to our oil and natural gas properties.
production and ad valorem taxes. production taxes are paid on produced oil and natural gas based on a percentage of revenues from products sold at fixed rates established by federal, state or local taxing authorities. where available, we benefit from tax credits and exemptions in our various taxing jurisdictions. we are also subject to ad valorem taxes in the counties where our production is located. ad valorem taxes are generally based on the valuation of our oil and gas properties.
general and administrative. these are costs incurred for overhead, including payroll and benefits for our corporate staff, costs of maintaining our headquarters, costs of managing our production and development operations, franchise taxes, audit and other fees for professional services and legal compliance.
depreciation, depletion and amortization. under the full cost accounting method, we capitalize costs within a cost center and then systematically expense those costs on a units of production basis based on proved oil and natural gas reserve quantities. we calculate depletion on the following types of costs: (i) all capitalized costs, other than the cost of investments in unproved properties and major development projects for which proved reserves cannot yet be assigned, less accumulated amortization; (ii) the estimated future expenditures to be incurred in developing proved reserves; and (iii) the estimated dismantlement and abandonment costs, net of estimated salvage values. depreciation of other property and equipment is computed using the straight line method over their estimated useful lives, which range from three to fifteen years.
impairment expense. this is the cost to reduce proved oil and gas properties to the calculated full cost ceiling value.

other income (expense)
interest income. this represents the interest received on our cash and cash equivalents.
interest expense. we have financed a portion of our working capital requirements, capital expenditures and acquisitions with borrowings under our revolving credit facility and our net proceeds from the issuance of the senior notes. we incur interest expense that is affected by both fluctuations in interest rates and our financing decisions. we reflect interest paid to our lender in interest expense. in addition, we include the amortization of deferred financing costs (including origination and amendment fees), commitment fees and annual agency fees in interest expense.
gain/loss on derivative instruments. we utilize commodity derivative financial instruments to reduce our exposure to fluctuations in the price of crude oil. this amount represents (i) the recognition of the change in the fair value of open non-hedge derivative contracts as commodity prices change and commodity derivative contracts expire or new ones are entered into, and (ii) our gains and losses on the settlement of these commodity derivative instruments.
loss from equity investment. this line item represents our proportionate share of the earnings and losses from our investment in the membership interests of muskie, an equity method investment.
income tax expense. prior to our initial public offering in october 2012, the operations of windsor permian and windsor ut, as limited liability companies, were not subject to federal income taxes. at the date of the merger of diamondback energy llc with and into diamondback, a corresponding "first day" tax expense to net income from continuing operations was recorded to establish a net deferred tax liability for differences between the tax and book basis of diamondback's assets and liabilities. this charge was $54,142,000.
we use the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes, under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences of (1) temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax bases of existing assets and liabilities and (2) operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. deferred income tax assets and liabilities are based on enacted tax rates applicable to the future period when those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. the effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in income in the period the rate change is enacted. a valuation allowance is provided for deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not the deferred tax assets will not be realized.

comparison of the years ended december 31, 2014 and 2013
oil, natural gas liquids and natural gas revenues. our oil, natural gas liquids and natural gas revenues increased by approximately $287.7 million, or 138%, to $495.7 million for the year ended december 31, 2014 from $208.0 million for the year ended december 31, 2013. our revenues are a function of oil, natural gas liquids and natural gas production volumes sold and average sales prices received for those volumes. average daily production sold increased by 12,153 boe/d to 19,474 boe/d during the year ended december 31, 2014 from 7,321 boe/d during the year ended december 31, 2013. the total increase in revenue of approximately $287.7 million is largely attributable to higher oil, natural gas liquids and natural gas production volumes for the year ended december 31, 2014 as compared to the year ended december 31, 2013, partially offset by lower average sales prices. the increases in production volumes were due to a combination of increased drilling activity and growth through acquisitions. our production increased by 3,358,827 bbls of oil, 640,912 bbls of natural gas liquids and 2,615,419 mcf of natural gas for the year ended december 31, 2014 as compared to the year ended december 31, 2013. the net dollar effect of the decreases in prices of approximately $58.2 million (calculated as the change in period-to-period average prices multiplied by current period production volumes of oil, natural gas liquids and natural gas) and the net dollar effect of the increase in production of approximately $346.0 million (calculated as the increase in period-to-period volumes for oil, natural gas liquids and natural gas multiplied by the period average prices) are shown below.

(1   )   production volumes are presented in bbls for oil and natural gas liquids and mcf for natural gas lease operating expense. lease operating expense, or loe, was $55.4 million ($7.79 per boe) for the year ended december 31, 2014, an increase of $34.2 million, or 162%, from $21.2 million ($7.92 per boe) for the year ended december 31, 2013. the increase is due to increased drilling activity and acquisitions, which resulted in 389 additional producing wells, for the year ended december 31, 2014 as compared to the year ended december 31, 2013. upon becoming the operator of wells acquired in our acquisitions, we seek to achieve the efficiencies in those wells that we have established with our existing portfolio of wells. on a per boe basis, loe remained stable as new volumes came on line and expenses were held in line or were reduced.
56
production and ad valorem tax expense. production and ad valorem taxes increased to $32.6 million for the year ended december 31, 2014 from $12.9 million for the year ended december 31, 2013. in general, production taxes and ad valorem taxes are directly related to commodity price changes; however, texas ad valorem taxes are based upon prior year commodity prices, whereas production taxes are based upon current year commodity prices. during the year ended december 31, 2014, our production taxes per boe decreased by $0.24 as compared to the year ended december 31, 2013, primarily reflecting the impact of lower oil and natural gas prices on production taxes. our ad valorem taxes have increased primarily as a result of increased valuations on our properties.
depreciation, depletion and amortization. depreciation, depletion and amortization, or dd&a, expense increased $103.4 million, or 155%, from $66.6 million for the year ended december 31, 2013 to $170.0 million for the year ended december 31, 2014.
the following table provides components of our dd&a expense for the periods presented:

the increases in depletion of proved oil and natural gas properties of $102.9 million for the year ended december 31, 2014 as compared to the year ended december 31, 2013 resulted primarily from higher total production levels, increased net book value on new reserves added and an increase in capitalized interest to the full cost pool. on a per boe basis, dd&a decreased primarily due to the increased net book value on new reserves and acquisitions.
general and administrative expense. general and administrative expense increased $10.2 million from $11.0 million for the year ended december 31, 2013 to $21.3 million for the year ended december 31, 2014. the increase was due to increases in stock based compensation, salary, legal, professional service and advisory service expenses. these increases were partially offset by increases in general and administrative costs related to exploration and development activity capitalized to the full cost pool and increases in copas overhead reimbursements due to increased drilling activity.
net interest expense. net interest expense for the year ended december 31, 2014 was $34.5 million as compared to $8.1 million for the year ended december 31, 2013, an increase of $26.5 million. this increase was due primarily to the issuance of $450.0 million in aggregate principal amount of our 7.625% senior notes in september 2013.
derivatives. we are required to recognize all derivative instruments on the balance sheet as either assets or liabilities measured at fair value. we have not designated our derivative instruments as hedges for accounting purposes. as a result, we mark our derivative instruments to fair value and recognize the cash and non-cash changes in fair value on derivative instruments in our combined consolidated statements of operations under the line item captioned "gain (loss) on derivative instruments, net." for the years ended december 31, 2014 and 2013, we had a cash gain on settlement of derivative instruments of $10.4 million and a cash loss on settlement of derivative instruments of $7.2 million, respectively. for the years ended december 31, 2014 and 2013, we had a positive change in the fair value of open derivative instruments of $117.1 million and $5.3 million, respectively.
income tax expense. we recorded income tax expense of $109.0 million for the year ended december 31, 2014 as compared to $31.8 million for the year ended december 31, 2013. our effective tax rate was 35.7% for the year ended december 31, 2014 as compared to 36.8% for the year ended december 31, 2013.

comparison of the years ended december 31, 2013 and 2012
oil, natural gas liquids and natural gas revenues. our oil, natural gas liquids and natural gas revenues increased by approximately $133.0 million, or 177%, to $208.0 million for the year ended december 31, 2013 from $75.0 million for the year ended december 31, 2012. our revenues are a function of oil, natural gas liquids and natural gas production volumes sold and average sales prices received for those volumes. average daily production sold increased by 4,375 boe/d to 7,321 boe/d during the year ended december 31, 2013 from 2,946 boe/d during the year ended december 31, 2012. the total increase in revenue of approximately $133.0 million was largely attributable to higher oil, natural gas liquids and natural gas production volumes for the year ended december 31, 2013 as compared to the year ended december 31, 2012. the increases in production volumes were due to a combination of increased drilling activity and the effect for the full year in 2013 of the contribution of gulfport's permian basin assets on october 11, 2012 in connection with our initial public offering. our production increased by 1,266,463 bbls of oil, 177,965 bbls of natural gas liquids and 896,981 mcf of natural gas for the year ended december 31, 2013 as compared to the year ended december 31, 2012. the net dollar effect of the increases in prices of approximately $13.8 million (calculated as the change in period-to-period average prices multiplied by current period production volumes of oil, natural gas liquids and natural gas) and the net dollar effect of the increase in production of approximately $119.3 million (calculated as the increase in period-to-period volumes for oil, natural gas liquids and natural gas multiplied by the period average prices) are shown below.

(1   )   production volumes are presented in bbls for oil and natural gas liquids and mcf for natural gas lease operating expense. lease operating expense, or loe, was $21.2 million ($7.92 per boe) for the year ended december 31, 2013, an increase of $5.9 million, or 39%, from $15.2 million ($14.14 per boe) for the year ended december 31, 2012. the increase was due to increased drilling activity and acquisitions, which resulted in 126 gross (105 net) additional producing wells at december 31, 2013 as compared to december 31, 2012. on a per boe basis, loe declined successively for each quarter throughout 2013 as new volumes came on line and expenses were held in line or were reduced. by the end of 2013, we were moving approximately 70% of our produced water by pipeline directly into commercial salt water disposal wells, rather than by truck, thereby further reducing one of our largest components of loe.
58
production and ad valorem tax expense. production and ad valorem taxes increased to $12.9 million for the year ended december 31, 2013 from $5.2 million for the year ended december 31, 2013. in general, production taxes and ad valorem taxes are directly related to commodity price changes; however, texas ad valorem taxes are based upon prior year commodity prices, whereas production taxes are based upon current year commodity prices. during 2013, our production taxes per boe increased by 2% as compared to 2012, primarily reflecting the impact of higher oil and natural gas prices on production taxes. our ad valorem taxes have increased primarily as a result of increased valuations on our properties and an increase in the number of wells included in those valuations as a result of our 2013 drilling activity.
depreciation, depletion and amortization. depreciation, depletion and amortization, or dd&a, expense increased $40.3 million, or 153%, from $26.3 million for the year ended december 31, 2012 to $66.6 million for the year ended december 31, 2013.
the following table provides components of our dd&a expense for the periods presented:

the increases in depletion of proved oil and natural gas properties of $40.0 million and $0.73 per boe for the year ended december 31, 2013 as compared to the year ended december 31, 2012 resulted primarily from higher total production levels, increased net book value on new reserves added and an increase in capitalized interest to the full cost pool.
general and administrative expense. general and administrative expense increased $0.7 million from $10.4 million for the year ended december 31, 2012 to $11.0 million for the year ended december 31, 2013. the increase was due to increases in salary, legal and compliance services, professional service and advisory service expenses. these increases were partially offset by a decrease in stock based compensation, increases in general and administrative costs related to exploration and development activity capitalized to the full cost pool and increases in copas overhead reimbursements due to increased drilling activity.
net interest expense. net interest expense for the year ended december 31, 2013 was $8.1 million as compared to $3.6 million for the year ended december 31, 2012, an increase of $4.5 million, or 123%. this increase was due primarily to the interest expense associated with the issuance of $450.0 million in aggregate principal amount of our 7.625% senior notes in september 2013.
derivatives. we are required to recognize all derivative instruments on the balance sheet as either assets or liabilities measured at fair value. we have not designated our derivative instruments as hedges for accounting purposes. as a result, we mark our derivative instruments to fair value and recognize the cash and non-cash changes in fair value on derivative instruments in our combined consolidated statements of operations under the line item captioned "gain (loss) on derivative instruments, net." for the years ended december 31, 2013 and 2012, we had a cash loss on settlement of derivative instruments of $7.2 million and $5.4 million, respectively. for the years ended december 31, 2013 and 2012, we had a positive change in the fair value of open derivative instruments of $5.3 million and $8.1 million, respectively.
income tax expense. prior to our initial public offering in october 2012, the operations of windsor permian and windsor ut, as limited liability companies, were not subject to federal income taxes. as of october 11, 2012, the date of the merger of diamondback energy llc with and into diamondback, a corresponding "first day" tax expense to net income from continuing operations was recorded to establish a net deferred tax liability for differences between the tax and book basis of diamondback's assets and liabilities. this charge was $54.1 million. for the year ended december 31, 2012, we recorded a deferred income tax expense of $54.9 million. income tax
59
expense of $0.8 million was incurred as a result of operations from october 11, 2012 through december 31, 2012. for the year ended december 31, 2013, our provision for income taxes was $31.8 million.
liquidity and capital resources our primary sources of liquidity have been proceeds from our public equity offerings, borrowings under our revolving credit facility, proceeds from the issuance of the senior notes and cash flows from operations. our primary use of capital has been for the acquisition, development and exploration of oil and natural gas properties. as we pursue reserves and production growth, we regularly consider which capital resources, including equity and debt financings, are available to meet our future financial obligations, planned capital expenditure activities and liquidity requirements. our future ability to grow proved reserves and production will be highly dependent on the capital resources available to us.
liquidity and cash flow our cash flows for the years ended december 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012 are presented below:

operating activities net cash provided by operating activities was $356.4 million for the year ended december 31, 2014 as compared to $155.8 million for the year ended december 31, 2013. the increase in operating cash flows is primarily the result of the increase in our oil and natural gas revenues due to a 166.0% increase in our net boe production partially offset by a 10.4% decrease in our net realized sales prices.
net cash provided by operating activities was $155.8 million for the year ended december 31, 2013 as compared to $49.7 million for the year ended december 31, 2012. the increase in operating cash flows is primarily a result of the increases in our oil and natural gas revenues due to a 147.8% increase in our net boe production and a 12.0% increase in our net realized sales prices.
our operating cash flow is sensitive to many variables, the most significant of which is the volatility of prices for the oil and natural gas we produce. prices for these commodities are determined primarily by prevailing market conditions. regional and worldwide economic activity, weather and other substantially variable factors influence market conditions for these products. these factors are beyond our control and are difficult to predict. see "-sources of our revenue" above.
investing activities the purchase and development of oil and natural gas properties accounted for the majority of our cash outlays for investing activities. we used cash for investing activities of $1,482.0 million, $940.1 million and $183.1 million during the years ended december 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012 respectively.
during the year ended december 31, 2014, we spent $499.8 million on capital expenditures in conjunction with our infrastructure projects and drilling program, in which we drilled 82 gross (67 net) horizontal wells and 27 gross (22 net) vertical wells and participated in the drilling of four gross (two net) non-operated wells. we spent an additional $845.8 million on leasehold costs, $44.2 million for the purchase of other property and equipment, approximately $57.7 million on acquisitions of mineral interests underlying approximately 10,364 gross (3,261) net acres in the midland and delaware basins and approximately $33.9 million for a minor equity interest in an entity that owns mineral, overriding royalty, net profits, leasehold and other similar interests.

during the year ended december 31, 2013, we spent $297.7 million on capital expenditures in conjunction with our drilling program in which we drilled 77 gross (70 net) wells and participated in the drilling of an additional four gross (two net) non-operated wells. we spent an additional $444.1 million on the acquisition of mineral interests, $177.3 million on leasehold costs, $2.2 million for the purchase of other property and equipment, $0.3 million, net, on the settlement of non-hedge derivative instruments and $18.6 million for the post-closing adjustment associated with our acquisition of gulfport energy corporation's oil and natural gas assets in the permian basin in connection with our initial public offering in october 2012.
during the year ended december 31, 2012, we spent $100.1 million on capital expenditures in conjunction with our drilling program in which we participated in the drilling of 65 gross (44 net) wells. we spent an additional $11.7 million on the acquisition of leasehold interests, $1.1 million for the purchase of other property and equipment and $6.6 million, net, on the settlement of derivative transactions. on october 11, 2012, we acquired all of the oil and natural gas properties of gulfport located in the permian basin in exchange for (i) 7,914,036 shares of our common stock, (ii) $63.6 million in the form of a non-interest bearing promissory note that was repaid in full upon the closing of our initial public offering and (iii) a post-closing cash adjustment of approximately $18.6 million.

financing activities net cash provided by financing activities for the years ended december 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012 was $1,140.2 million , $773.6 million and $152.8 million, respectively. the 2014 amount provided by financing activities was primarily attributable to the net proceeds of $208.4 million from our february 2014 equity offering, net proceeds of $137.2 million from the viper offering, net proceeds of $485.0 million from our july 2014 equity offering, net proceeds of $94.8 million from the viper september 2014 equity offering and borrowings, net of repayment, of $213.5 million under our credit facility. during the year ended december 31, 2013, the amount provided by financing activities was primarily attributable to (a) the net proceeds of $144.4 million from our may 2013 equity offering, $177.5 million from our august 2013 equity offering, $450.0 million from our september 2013 senior note offering and (b) net borrowings of $10.0 million under our revolving credit facility. in both 2014 and 2013, these proceeds were used primarily to acquire property and fund our drilling costs.
during the year ended december 31, 2012, we borrowed $15.0 million under our revolving credit facility and $30.0 million under our subordinated note with wexford and received capital contributions from our members of $4.0 million.
on october 17, 2012, our initial public offering was completed and we received net proceeds of approximately $234.1 million, after deducting the underwriting discount. during 2012 we borrowed $15.0 million under our revolving credit facility. all borrowings outstanding under our revolving credit facility were repaid with proceeds of the initial public offering. during 2012, we borrowed $30.0 million under our subordinated note with wexford. this note was repaid with proceeds of the initial public offering and was canceled. during 2012, we received capital contributions from our members of $4.0 million. these proceeds were used primarily to fund our drilling costs and purchase property. during the year ended december 31, 2012, we paid $2.9 million for costs associated with our initial public offering.
61
senior notes on september 18, 2013, we completed an offering of $450.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 7.625% senior unsecured notes due 2021, which we refer to as the senior notes. the senior notes bear interest at the rate of 7.625% per annum, payable semi-annually, in arrears on april 1 and october 1 of each year, commencing on april 1, 2014, and will mature on october 1, 2021. on june 23, 2014, in connection with the viper offering, we designated viper, the general partner and viper energy partners llc as unrestricted subsidiaries and, upon such designation, viper energy partners llc, which was a guarantor under the indenture governing of the senior notes, was released as a guarantor under the indenture. as of december 31, 2014, the senior notes were fully and unconditionally guaranteed by diamondback o&g llc, diamondback e&p llc and white fang energy llc and will also be guaranteed by any of our future restricted subsidiaries. the net proceeds from the senior notes were used to fund the acquisition of mineral interests underlying approximately 14,804 gross (12,687 net) acres in midland county, texas in the permian basin.
the senior notes were issued under, and are governed by, an indenture among us, the subsidiary guarantors party thereto and wells fargo bank, n.a., as the trustee, as amended and supplemented, or the indenture. we may issue additional senior notes under the indenture, and all senior notes issued under the indenture will constitute part of a single class of securities for all purposes of the indenture. the indenture contains certain covenants that, subject to certain exceptions and qualifications, among other things, limit our ability and the ability of our restricted subsidiaries to incur or guarantee additional indebtedness, make certain investments, declare or pay dividends or make other distributions on, or redeem or repurchase, capital stock, prepay subordinated indebtedness, sell assets including capital stock of subsidiaries, agree to payment restrictions affecting our restricted subsidiaries, consolidate, merge, sell or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of our assets, enter into transactions with affiliates, incur liens, engage in business other than the oil and gas business and designate certain of our subsidiaries as unrestricted subsidiaries. if we experience certain kinds of changes of control or if we sell certain of our assets, holders of the senior notes may have the right to require us to repurchase their senior notes.
we have the option to redeem the senior notes, in whole or in part, at any time on or after october 1, 2016 at the redemption prices (expressed as percentages of principal amount) of 105.719% for the 12-month period beginning on october 1, 2016, 103.813% for the 12-month period beginning on october 1, 2017, 101.906% for the 12-month period beginning on october 1, 2018 and 100.000% beginning on october 1, 2019 and at any time thereafter with any accrued and unpaid interest to, but not including, the date of redemption. in addition, prior to october 1, 2016, we may redeem all or a part of the senior notes at a price equal to 100% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the redemption date, plus a "make-whole" premium at the redemption date. furthermore, before october 1, 2016, we may, at any time or from time to time, redeem up to 35% of the aggregate principal amount of the senior notes with the net cash proceeds of certain equity offerings at a redemption price of 107.625% of the principal amount of the senior notes being redeemed plus any accrued and unpaid interest to the date of redemption, if at least 65% of the aggregate principal amount of the senior notes originally issued under the indenture remains outstanding immediately after such redemption and the redemption occurs within 120 days of the closing date of such equity offering.
in connection with the issuance of the senior notes, we and the subsidiary guarantors entered into a registration rights agreement with the initial purchasers on september 18, 2013, pursuant to which we and the subsidiary guarantors agreed to offer to exchange the senior notes for a new issue of substantially identical debt securities registered under the securities act. the exchange offer was completed on october 23, 2014.
second amended and restated credit facility our second amended and restated credit agreement, dated november 1, 2013, as amended on june 9, 2014 and november 13, 2014, with a syndication of banks, including wells fargo, as administrative agent, sole book runner and lead arranger, provides for a revolving credit facility in the maximum amount of $2.0 billion, subject to scheduled semi-annual and other elective collateral borrowing base redeterminations based on our oil and natural gas reserves and other factors (the "borrowing base"). the borrowing base is scheduled to be re-determined semi-annually with effective dates of may 1st and november 1st. in addition, we may request up to three additional redeterminations of the borrowing base during any 12-month period. as of december 31, 2014, the borrowing base was set at $750.0 million, although we elected a commitment amount of $500.0 million. as of december 31, 2014, we had outstanding borrowings of $223.5 million, which bore a weighted-average interest rate of 1.67%, and $276.5 million available for future borrowings under this facility.
the june 9, 2014 amendment modified certain provisions of the credit agreement to, among other things, allow us to designate one or more of our subsidiaries as "unrestricted subsidiaries" that are not subject to certain
62
restrictions contained in the credit agreement. in connection with the viper offering, we designated viper, the general partner and viper energy partners llc as unrestricted subsidiaries under the credit agreement. as of december 31, 2014, the loan is guaranteed by us, diamondback e&p llc and white fang energy llc and will also be guaranteed by any future restricted subsidiaries of diamondback. the credit agreement is also secured by substantially all of our assets and the assets of diamondback o&g llc and the guarantors.
the outstanding borrowings under the credit agreement bear interest at a rate elected by us that is equal to an alternative base rate (which is equal to the greatest of the prime rate, the federal funds effective rate plus 0.50% and 3-month libor plus 1.0%) or libor, in each case plus the applicable margin. the applicable margin ranges from 0.50% to 1.50% in the case of the alternative base rate and from 1.50% to 2.50% in the case of libor, in each case depending on the amount of the loan outstanding in relation to the borrowing base. we are obligated to pay a quarterly commitment fee ranging from 0.375% to 0.50% per year on the unused portion of the borrowing base, which fee is also dependent on the amount of the loan outstanding in relation to the borrowing base. loan principal may be optionally repaid from time to time without premium or penalty (other than customary libor breakage), and is required to be repaid (a) to the extent the loan amount exceeds the borrowing base, whether due to a borrowing base redetermination or otherwise (in some cases subject to a cure period), (b) in an amount equal to the net cash proceeds from the sale of property when a borrowing base deficiency or event of default exists under the credit agreement and (c) at the maturity date of november 1, 2018.
the credit agreement contains various affirmative, negative and financial maintenance covenants. these covenants, among other things, limit additional indebtedness, additional liens, sales of assets, mergers and consolidations, dividends and distributions, transactions with affiliates and entering into certain swap agreements and require the maintenance of the financial ratios described below.
financial covenant                                                              required ratio ratio of total debt to ebitdax                                                  not greater than 4.0 to 1.0
ratio of current assets to liabilities, as defined in the credit agreement      not less than 1.0 to 1.0
the covenant prohibiting additional indebtedness allows for the issuance of unsecured debt of up to $750 million in the form of senior or senior subordinated notes and, in connection with any such issuance, the reduction of the borrowing base by 25% of the stated principal amount of each such issuance. a borrowing base reduction in connection with such issuance may require a portion of the outstanding principal of the loan to be repaid. as of december 31, 2014, we had $450 million of senior notes outstanding.
as of december 31, 2014, we were in compliance with all financial covenants under our revolving credit facility. the lenders may accelerate all of the indebtedness under our revolving credit facility upon the occurrence and during the continuance of any event of default. the credit agreement contains customary events of default, including non-payment, breach of covenants, materially incorrect representations, cross-default, bankruptcy and change of control. with certain specified exceptions, the terms and provisions of our revolving credit facility generally may be amended with the consent of the lenders holding a majority of the outstanding loans or commitments to lend.
partnership credit facility-wells fargo bank on july 8, 2014, viper entered into a secured revolving credit agreement with wells fargo bank, national association, or wells fargo, as the administrative agent, sole book runner and lead arranger. the credit agreement, which was amended august 15, 2014 to add additional lenders to the lending group, provides for a revolving credit facility in the maximum amount of $500.0 million, subject to scheduled semi-annual and other elective collateral borrowing base redeterminations based on viper's oil and natural gas reserves and other factors (the "borrowing base"). the borrowing base is scheduled to be re-determined semi-annually with effective dates of april 1st and october 1st. in addition, viper may request up to three additional redeterminations of the borrowing base during any 12-month period. as of december 31, 2014, the borrowing base was set at $110.0 million and viper had no outstanding borrowings.
the outstanding borrowings under viper's credit agreement bear interest at a rate elected by viper that is equal to an alternative base rate (which is equal to the greatest of the prime rate, the federal funds effective rate plus 0.50% and 3-month libor plus 1.0%) or libor, in each case plus the applicable margin. the applicable margin ranges from 0.50% to 1.50% in the case of the alternative base rate and from 1.50% to 2.50% in the case of libor, in each case depending on the amount of the loan outstanding in relation to the borrowing base. viper is obligated to pay a quarterly commitment fee ranging from 0.375% to 0.500% per year on the unused portion of the borrowing
63
base, which fee is also dependent on the amount of the loan outstanding in relation to the borrowing base. loan principal may be optionally repaid from time to time without premium or penalty (other than customary libor breakage), and is required to be paid (a) if the loan amount exceeds the borrowing base, whether due to a borrowing base redetermination or otherwise (in some cases subject to a cure period) and (b) at the maturity date of july 8, 2019. the loan is secured by substantially all of the assets of the partnership and its subsidiaries.
the viper credit agreement contains various affirmative, negative and financial maintenance covenants. these covenants, among other things, limit additional indebtedness, additional liens, sales of assets, mergers and consolidations, dividends and distributions, transactions with affiliates and entering into certain swap agreements and require the maintenance of the financial ratios described below.
financial covenant                                                                                                 required ratio ratio of total debt to ebitdax                                                                                     not greater than 4.0 to 1.0
ratio of current assets to liabilities, as defined in the credit agreement                                         not less than 1.0 to 1.0
ebitdax will be annualized beginning with the quarter ended september 30, 2014 and ending with the quarter ending march 31, 2015
the covenant prohibiting additional indebtedness allows for the issuance of unsecured debt of up to $250 million in the form of senior unsecured notes and, in connection with any such issuance, the reduction of the borrowing base by 25% of the stated principal amount of each such issuance. a borrowing base reduction in connection with such issuance may require a portion of the outstanding principal of the loan to be repaid.
the lenders may accelerate all of the indebtedness under viper's revolving credit facility upon the occurrence and during the continuance of any event of default. the viper credit agreement contains customary events of default, including non-payment, breach of covenants, materially incorrect representations, cross-default, bankruptcy and change of control. there are no cure periods for events of default due to non-payment of principal and breaches of negative and financial covenants, but non-payment of interest and breaches of certain affirmative covenants are subject to customary cure periods.
capital requirements and sources of liquidity our board of directors approved a 2015 capital budget for drilling and infrastructure of $400.0 million to $450.0 million, representing a decrease of 6% over our 2014 capital budget. we estimate that, of these expenditures, approximately:
•   $285.0 million to $315.0 million will be spent on drilling and completing 50 to 60 gross (43 to 52 net) operated horizontal wells focused in midland, andrews, upton, martin and dawson counties;
•   $20.0 million to $30.0 million will be spent on infrastructure;
•   $20.0 million to $30.0 million will be spent on non-operated activity and other expenditures; and
•   an estimated $75.0 million for expenditures related to 2014 activity (net of expenditures from 2015 expected to be carried into 2016).
during the year ended december 31, 2014, our aggregate capital expenditures for drilling and infrastructure were $499.8 million. we do not have a specific acquisition budget since the timing and size of acquisitions cannot be accurately forecasted. during the year ended december 31, 2014, we spent approximately $845.8 million on acquisitions of leasehold interests.
the amount and timing of these capital expenditures is largely discretionary and within our control. we could choose to defer a portion of these planned capital expenditures depending on a variety of factors, including but not limited to the success of our drilling activities, prevailing and anticipated prices for oil and natural gas, the availability of necessary equipment, infrastructure and capital, the receipt and timing of required regulatory permits and approvals, seasonal conditions, drilling and acquisition costs and the level of participation by other interest owners.
based upon current oil and natural gas price and production expectations for 2015, we believe that our cash flow from operations and borrowings under our revolving credit facility will be sufficient to fund our operations through year-end 2015. however, future cash flows are subject to a number of variables, including the level of oil and natural gas production and prices, and significant additional capital expenditures will be required to more fully
64
develop our properties. further, our 2015 capital expenditure budget does not allocate any funds for leasehold interest and property acquisitions.
we monitor and adjust our projected capital expenditures in response to success or lack of success in drilling activities, changes in prices, availability of financing, drilling and acquisition costs, industry conditions, the timing of regulatory approvals, the availability of rigs, contractual obligations, internally generated cash flow and other factors both within and outside our control. if we require additional capital, we may seek such capital through traditional reserve base borrowings, joint venture partnerships, production payment financing, asset sales, offerings of debt and or equity securities or other means. we cannot assure you that the needed capital will be available on acceptable terms or at all. if we are unable to obtain funds when needed or on acceptable terms, we may be required to curtail our drilling programs, which could result in a loss of acreage through lease expirations. in addition, we may not be able to complete acquisitions that may be favorable to us or finance the capital expenditures necessary to replace our reserves.

(2)   interest represents the scheduled cash payments on our senior notes.
(3)   amounts represent our estimates of future asset retirement obligations. because these costs typically extend many years into the future, estimating these future costs requires management to make estimates and judgments that are subject to future revisions based upon numerous factors, including the rate of inflation, changing technology and the political and regulatory environment. see note 6 of the notes to our combined consolidated financial statements set forth in part iv, item 15 of this form 10-k.
(4)   drilling commitments represent future minimum expenditure commitments for drilling rig services under contracts to which the company was a party on december 31, 2014.
critical accounting policies the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our combined consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states. below, we have provided expanded discussion of our more significant accounting policies, estimates and judgments. we believe these accounting policies reflect our more significant estimates and assumptions used in preparation of our financial statements. see note 2 of the notes to the combined consolidated financial statements set forth in part iv, item 15 of this form 10-k.
use of estimates certain amounts included in or affecting our combined consolidated financial statements and related disclosures must be estimated by our management, requiring certain assumptions to be made with respect to values or conditions that cannot be known with certainty at the time the combined consolidated financial statements are prepared. these estimates and assumptions affect the amounts we report for assets and liabilities and our disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the combined consolidated financial statements. actual results could differ from those estimates.

we evaluate these estimates on an ongoing basis, using historical experience, consultation with experts and other methods we consider reasonable in the particular circumstances. nevertheless, actual results may differ significantly from our estimates. any effects on our business, financial position or results of operations resulting from revisions to these estimates are recorded in the period in which the facts that give rise to the revision become known. significant items subject to such estimates and assumptions include estimates of proved oil and gas reserves and related present value estimates of future net cash flows therefrom, the carrying value of oil and natural gas properties, asset retirement obligations, the fair value determination of acquired assets and liabilities, stock-based compensation, fair value estimates of commodity derivatives and estimates of income taxes.
method of accounting for oil and natural gas properties we account for our oil and natural gas producing activities using the full cost method of accounting. accordingly, all costs incurred in the acquisition, exploration and development of proved oil and natural gas properties, including the costs of abandoned properties, dry holes, geophysical costs and annual lease rentals are capitalized. we also capitalize direct operating costs for services performed with internally owned drilling and well servicing equipment. internal costs capitalized to the full cost pool represent management's estimate of costs incurred directly related to exploration and development activities such as geological and other administrative costs associated with overseeing the exploration and development activities. all internal costs unrelated to drilling activities are expensed as incurred. sales or other dispositions of oil and natural gas properties are accounted for as adjustments to capitalized costs, with no gain or loss recorded unless the ratio of cost to proved reserves would significantly change. income from services provided to working interest owners of properties in which we also own an interest, to the extent they exceed related costs incurred, are accounted for as reductions of capitalized costs of oil and natural gas properties. depletion of evaluated oil and natural gas properties is computed on the units of production method, whereby capitalized costs plus estimated future development costs are amortized over total proved reserves.
costs associated with unevaluated properties are excluded from the full cost pool until we have made a determination as to the existence of proved reserves. we assess all items classified as unevaluated property on an annual basis for possible impairment. we assess properties on an individual basis or as a group if properties are individually insignificant. the assessment includes consideration of the following factors, among others: intent to drill; remaining lease term; geological and geophysical evaluations; drilling results and activity; the assignment of proved reserves; and the economic viability of development if proved reserves are assigned. during any period in which these factors indicate an impairment, the cumulative drilling costs incurred to date for such property and all or a portion of the associated leasehold costs are transferred to the full cost pool and are then subject to amortization.
oil and natural gas reserve quantities and standardized measure of future net revenue our independent engineers and technical staff prepare our estimates of oil and natural gas reserves and associated future net revenues. the sec has defined proved reserves as the estimated quantities of oil and gas which geological and engineering data demonstrate with reasonable certainty to be recoverable in future years from known reservoirs under existing economic and operating conditions. the process of estimating oil and gas reserves is complex, requiring significant decisions in the evaluation of available geological, geophysical, engineering and economic data. the data for a given property may also change substantially over time as a result of numerous factors, including additional development activity, evolving production history and a continual reassessment of the viability of production under changing economic conditions. as a result, material revisions to existing reserve estimates occur from time to time. although every reasonable effort is made to ensure that reserve estimates reported represent the most accurate assessments possible, the subjective decisions and variances in available data for various properties increase the likelihood of significant changes in these estimates. if such changes are material, they could significantly affect future amortization of capitalized costs and result in impairment of assets that may be material.
there are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of proved oil and natural gas reserves. oil and natural gas reserve engineering is a subjective process of estimating underground accumulations of oil and natural gas that cannot be precisely measured and the accuracy of any reserve estimate is a function of the quality of available data and of engineering and geological interpretation and judgment. results of drilling, testing and production subsequent to the date of the estimate may justify revision of such estimate. accordingly, reserve estimates are often different from the quantities of oil and natural gas that are ultimately recovered.
revenue recognition oil and natural gas revenues are recorded when title passes to the purchaser, net of royalty interests, discounts and allowances, as applicable. we account for oil and natural gas production imbalances using the sales method, whereby a liability is recorded when our volumes exceed our estimated remaining recoverable reserves. no

receivables are recorded for those wells where we have taken less than our ownership share of production. we did not have any gas imbalances as of december 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012. revenues from oil and natural gas services are recognized as services are provided.
impairment the net capitalized costs of proved oil and natural gas properties are subject to a full cost ceiling limitation in which the costs are not allowed to exceed their related estimated future net revenues discounted at 10%. to the extent capitalized costs of evaluated oil and natural gas properties, net of accumulated depreciation, depletion, amortization, impairment and deferred income taxes exceed the discounted future net revenues of proved oil and natural gas reserves, less any related income tax effects, the excess capitalized costs are charged to expense. in calculating future net revenues, prices are calculated as the average oil and gas prices during the preceding 12-month period prior to the end of the current reporting period, determined as the unweighted arithmetic average first-day-of-the-month prices for the prior 12-month period and costs used are those as of the end of the appropriate quarterly period.
asset retirement obligations we measure the future cost to retire our tangible long-lived assets and recognize such cost as a liability for legal obligations associated with the retirement of long-lived assets that result from the acquisition, construction or normal operation of a long-lived asset. the fair value of a liability for an asset's retirement obligation is recorded in the period in which it is incurred if a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made and the corresponding cost is capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the related long-lived asset. the liability is accreted to its then present value each period, and the capitalized cost is depreciated over the useful life of the related asset. if the liability is settled for an amount other than the recorded amount, the difference is recorded in oil and natural gas properties.
our asset retirement obligations primarily relate to the future plugging and abandonment of wells and related facilities. estimating the future restoration and removal costs is difficult and requires management to make estimates and judgments because most of the removal obligations are many years in the future and asset removal technologies and costs are constantly changing, as are regulatory, political, environmental, safety and public relations considerations. we estimate the future plugging and abandonment costs of wells, the ultimate productive life of the properties, a risk-adjusted discount rate and an inflation factor in order to determine the current present value of this obligation. to the extent future revisions to these assumptions impact the present value of the existing asset retirement obligation liability, a corresponding adjustment is made to the oil and gas property balance.
derivatives from time to time, we have used energy derivatives for the purpose of mitigating the risk resulting from fluctuations in the market price of crude oil. we recognize all of our derivative instruments as either assets or liabilities at fair value. the accounting for changes in the fair value (i.e., gains or losses) of a derivative instrument depends on whether it has been designated and qualifies as part of a hedging relationship and further on the type of hedging relationship. none of our derivatives were designated as hedging instruments during the years ended december 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012. for derivative instruments not designated as hedging instruments, changes in the fair value of these instruments are recognized in earnings during the period of change.
accounting for stock-based compensation we grant various types of stock-based awards including stock options and restricted stock units. these plans and related accounting policies are defined and described more fully in note 10-stock and unit based compensation. stock compensation awards are measured at fair value on the date of grant and are expensed, net of estimated forfeitures, over the required service period.
income taxes we use the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes, under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences of (1) temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax bases of existing assets and liabilities and (2) operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. deferred income tax assets and liabilities are based on enacted tax rates applicable to the future period when those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. the effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in income in the period the rate change is enacted. a valuation allowance is provided for deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not the deferred tax assets will not be realized.

recent accounting pronouncements in may 2014, the financial accounting standards board issued accounting standards update ("asu") 2014-09, "revenue from contracts with customers". asu 2014-09 supersedes most of the existing revenue recognition requirements in accounting principles generally accepted in the united states and requires (i) an entity to recognize revenue when it transfers promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services and (ii) requires expanded disclosures regarding the nature, amount, timing and certainty of revenue and cash flows from contracts with customers. the standard will be effective for annual and interim reporting periods beginning after december 15, 2016, with early application not permitted. the standard allows for either full retrospective adoption, meaning the standard is applied to all periods presented in the financial statements, or modified retrospective adoption, meaning the standard is applied only to the most current period presented. we are currently evaluating the impact this standard will have on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
inflation inflation in the united states has been relatively low in recent years and did not have a material impact on results of operations for the years ended 2014, 2013 and 2012. although the impact of inflation has been insignificant in recent years, it is still a factor in the united states economy and we tend to experience inflationary pressure on the cost of oilfield services and equipment as increasing oil and gas prices increase drilling activity in our areas of operations.
off-balance sheet arrangements we currently have no off-balance sheet arrangements as of december 31, 2014. please read note 15 included in notes to the combined consolidated financial statements set forth in part iv, item 15 of this form 10-k, for a discussion of our commitments and contingencies, some of which are not recognized in the balance sheets under gaap.

total other income (expense)       $(71,961)                            $3,563
foreign exchange loss the increase in foreign exchange loss is due to losses on net foreign currency assets of $14.4 million offset by gains of $5.7 million from foreign exchange derivatives.
interest expense the increase in interest expense is due to interest expense of $16.0 million related to the senior notes, $20.0 million related to the term loan and bridge loan fees of $19.0 million.
forward interest rate swaps the increase in forward swap loss is due to the loss on the forward interest rate swaps not designated in a hedge relationship. we entered into new swaps and offsetting swaps on november 20, 2014, which we designated as cash flow hedges of interest rate exposure associated with variability in future cash flows on the term loan. subsequent to the hedge designation, the effective portion of changes in their fair value is recognized in other comprehensive income (loss) and the ineffective portion is recognized in earnings. the effective portion recognized in other comprehensive income (loss) will be reclassified to earnings in other income (expense) as the interest payments under the term loan affect earnings. the syndicated swaps and the offsetting swaps are not designated in a hedging relationship and the changes in fair values are recognized in earnings in other income (expense). refer to note 13, derivative instruments to the consolidated financial statements included in the form 10-k.
income taxes the effective income tax rate for 2014 was (95.0%) compared to prior years effective income tax rate of 18.1%. the 2014 rate benefit is primarily driven by foreign earnings taxed at a lower rates and domestic pre-tax loss, which is attributable to third-party interest expense and acquisition expenses.

consolidated results of operations  full year net sales for 2013 compared with 2012 increased 4.2% as a result of growth across most product categories with notable increases in supplies, service and software. the growth in supplies, due to the laserband acquisition in july 2012, partially offset weak business conditions from the first half of 2013. printer unit volumes increased 4.9% for 2013 compared to 2012 due to volume increases in desktop, mobile, kiosk and card printers. movement towards lower-priced printers partially offset unit volume increases. movement in foreign currency, net of hedge activity, partially offset sales growth by $2.8 million.

operating expenses for 2013 increased 4.9%. the increase is due to increased expenses across all functional areas offset by the absence of a goodwill impairment charge which represents 2.8% of 2012 operating expenses. the acquisition of both laserband and stepone contributed to the increase in zebras operating expenses. several categories accounted for these increases, including compensation costs, outside professional services, depreciation and information systems expenses. acquisition costs are related to investigated and completed acquisitions during the period. amortization of intangible assets increased from additions of current technology, patent and patent rights and customer relationships during the year, including the acquisition of laserband in july 2012. exit and restructuring costs in 2012 and 2013 primarily relate to the restructuring of the location solutions business management structure.
exit and restructuring costs during the third quarter of 2012, revenue from location solutions fell below plan from slower than anticipated growth in the automotive and process manufacturing industries and weakness in the government sector. as a result, we initiated the locations solutions 2012 restructuring plan.
in the second quarter of 2013, management determined that additional restructuring actions would be required to meet our financial goals for the location solutions business. we anticipate that the results of our restructuring actions will reduce costs of the location solutions business by $4.0 million per year. these savings should be fully realized by the first quarter 2014. the savings from the location solutions restructuring plan will primarily benefit cost of goods sold, engineering and selling and marketing expenses.
33
during 2007, zebra began a plan to outsource printer manufacturing to a third-party contract manufacturer. the transition to the third-party manufacturer was completed during 2010. during the fourth quarter of 2012, we determined that further supply chain cost reductions were possible by moving certain supply chain support operations closer to our contract printer manufacturers facility, which is located in china. we anticipate these actions will generate $2.6 million in annual savings to our cost of goods sold. these actions were completed by the end of 2013.
operating income the operating income decrease for 2013 was the result of operating expense increases as noted above and partially offset by higher gross profit.
other income (expense)
zebras non-operating income and expense items are summarized in the following table (in thousands):
year ended december 31,           december 31,
2013                      2012

total other income (expense)                $3,563           $(177)
the increase in other income is the result of a net $1.6 million favorable litigation settlement associated with an investment loss that was recorded in prior years.
income taxes the effective tax rate for 2013 was 18.1% compared to an effective tax rate of 25.8% for 2012. the 2012 rate reflects a discrete item for nondeductible asset impairment charge, increasing the tax rate by 1.9% for the full year. further, in 2012, in order to streamline the management, financing and capital structure of its foreign affiliates, zebra established a foreign holding company and restructured the ownership structure of its foreign affiliates. this new holding company structure allows zebra to consolidate the ownership of its significant foreign affiliates under a single holding company. in addition, the structure introduced leverage which gives zebra the ability to facilitate cash pooling and improve the capital structure of its non-us operations. the new capital structure and global financing favorably impacts the zebras effective tax rate and facilitates the tax efficient movement of zebras foreign cash to finance the ongoing operating and investment needs of the foreign subsidiaries. the restructuring was completed in the second quarter of 2012 and was in place for the full year in 2013. in addition, the us r&d credit reinstatement for the 2012 income tax year resulted in a tax benefit of $0.9 million. finally, zebra recorded a favorable provision to return adjustment resulting in a reduction to the effective tax rate of 1.1% following the filing of zebras 2012 income tax returns.
34
critical accounting policies and estimates management prepared the consolidated financial statements of zebra under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america. these principles require the use of estimates, judgments and assumptions. we believe that the estimates, judgments and assumptions we used are reasonable, based upon the information available.
our estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts in our financial statements. the following accounting policies comprise those that we believe are the most critical in understanding and evaluating zebras reported financial results.
revenue recognition revenue includes sales of hardware, supplies, software and services (including repair services, extended service contracts, and professional services) and bundled sales of equipment, software and services. we enter into revenue arrangements that may consist of multiple deliverables of our products and services due to the needs of our customers. zebra recognizes revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred and title has passed to the customer, which happens at the point of shipment, provided that no significant obligations remain, the price is fixed and determinable and collectability of the sales price is reasonably assured. for hardware sales, in addition to the criteria discussed above, revenue recognition occurs when no significant obligations remain and allowances for discounts, price protection, returns and customer incentives can be reasonably estimated. in addition to cooperative marketing and other incentive programs, zebra has arrangements with some distributors which allow for price protection and limited rights of return, generally through stock rotation programs. under the price protection programs, zebra gives distributors credits for the difference between the original price paid and zebras then current price. under the stock rotation programs, distributors are able to exchange certain products based on the number of qualified purchases made during the period. we monitor and track these programs and record a provision for future payments or credits granted as reductions of revenue based on historical experience. recorded revenues are reduced by these allowances. zebra enters into post contract maintenance and support agreements; revenues are deferred and then recognized ratably over the service period and the cost of providing these services is expensed as incurred. zebra includes shipping and handling charges billed to customers as revenue when the product ships; any costs incurred related to these services are included in cost of sales.
fair value of financial instruments fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. our financial assets and financial liabilities that require recognition under the accounting guidance generally include available-for-sale investments, employee deferred compensation plan, foreign currency derivatives and interest rate swaps. the guidance establishes a hierarchy for inputs used in measuring fair value that maximizes the use of observable inputs and minimizes the use of unobservable inputs by requiring that the observable inputs be used when available. observable inputs are inputs that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability developed based on market data obtained from sources independent of us. unobservable inputs that reflect our assumptions about the assumptions market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability developed based on the best information available in the circumstances.
zebras investments in marketable debt securities are classified as available-for-sale except for securities held in zebras deferred compensation plan which are considered to be trading securities. in general we use quoted prices in active markets for identical assets to determine fair value. if active markets for identical assets are not available to determine fair value, then we use quoted prices for similar assets or inputs that are observable either directly or indirectly.
zebra has foreign currency forwards to hedge certain foreign currency exposures and interest rate swaps to hedge a portion of the variability in future cash flows on debt. we use broker quotations or market transactions, in either the listed or over-the-counter markets to value our foreign currency exchange contracts and relevant observable market inputs at quoted intervals, such as forward yield curves and zebras own credit risk to value our interest rate swaps.
accounts receivable we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for losses that we estimate will arise from our customers inability to make required payments. we make estimates of the collectability of our accounts receivable by considering factors such as historical bad debt experience, specific customer creditworthiness, the age of the accounts receivable balances and current economic trends that may affect a customers ability to pay. if the data we use to calculate the allowance for doubtful accounts does not reflect the future ability to collect outstanding receivables, additional provisions for doubtful accounts may be needed and our results of operations could be materially affected. accounts receivable reserves as of december 31, 2014, were $1.1 million or 0.2% of the balance due.
35
inventories we value our inventories at the lower of the actual cost to purchase or manufacture using the first-in, first-out (fifo) method, or the current estimated market value. we review inventory quantities on hand and record a provision for excess and obsolete inventory based on forecasts of product demand and production requirements for the subsequent twelve months.
over the last three years, our inventory reserves have ranged from 1.5% to 11.9% of gross inventory. as of december 31, 2014, inventory reserves were $5.8 million, or 1.5% of gross inventory. we believe this reserve level is appropriate considering the quantities and quality of the inventories as of december 31, 2014.
goodwill and other intangible assets we perform an annual review of goodwill or sooner if indicators of potential impairment are identified. we review performance and other indicators and determine at that time if the goodwill test associated with the acquisition should be evaluated on a qualitative or quantitative basis. if quantitative, the process we would expect to use, and have used historically, compares the book value of net assets to the fair value of the reporting units. if the fair value is determined to be less than the book value or qualitative factors indicate that it is more likely than not that goodwill is impaired, a second step is performed to compute the amount of impairment as the difference between the estimated fair value of goodwill and the carrying value at the testing date. we estimate the fair value of the reporting units using discounted cash flow and certain market value data.
of the goodwill recognized at december 31, 2014, approximately $2.336 billion relates to the enterprise acquisition transaction. approximately $153.5 million of goodwill existed prior to the enterprise acquisition and is recorded in the legacy zebra business. net intangible assets excluding goodwill amounted to $1.014 billion as of december 31, 2014.
the annual evaluation of goodwill requires the use of estimates about future operating results, valuation multiples, and discount rates to determine their estimated fair value. changes in these assumptions can materially affect these estimates. if our future performance is below our projections, goodwill impairment charges can result. zebra will monitor future results and will perform a test if indicators trigger an impairment review.
long-lived assets and other intangible assets long-lived assets held and used are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. we estimate the future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition. if the sum of the expected future cash flows (undiscounted and without interest charges) is less than the carrying amount of the asset, an impairment is recognized. determining whether an impairment has occurred typically requires various estimates and assumptions, including determining which undiscounted cash flows are directly related to the potentially impaired asset, the useful life over which cash flows will occur, their amount, and the assets residual value, if any. any related impairment loss is calculated based upon comparison of the fair value to the carrying value of the asset. separate intangible assets that have finite useful lives are amortized over their useful lives. an impaired long-lived or intangible asset would be written down to fair value, based on various available valuation techniques, including the discounted cash flow method.
income taxes income taxes are recognized during the year in which transactions enter into the determination of financial statement income, with deferred taxes being provided for temporary differences between financial and tax reporting. zebra recognizes in the financial statements a provision for tax uncertainties, resulting from application of complex tax regulations in multiple jurisdictions. see note 19 in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in the form 10-k.
contingencies zebra records estimated liabilities related to contingencies based on our estimates of the probable outcomes. quarterly, zebra assesses the potential liability related to pending litigation, tax audits and other contingencies and confirm or revise estimates and reserves as appropriate.
for further information regarding material pending legal proceedings, see note 15 in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in the form 10-k.
36
equity-based compensation as of december 31, 2014, zebra had an active equity-based compensation plan and a stock purchase plan available for future grants. we accounted for these plans in accordance with asc 505 and asc 718. zebra recognizes compensation costs using the straight-line method over the vesting period of up to 5 years. see notes 2 and 18 to the consolidated financial statements included in the form 10-k for further information.
acquisitions we account for acquired businesses using the acquisition method of accounting. this method requires that the purchase price be allocated to the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed at their estimated fair values. the excess of the purchase price over the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed is recorded as goodwill.
the estimates used to determine the fair value of long-lived assets, such as intangible assets, can be complex and require significant judgments. we use information available to us to make fair value determinations and engage independent valuation specialists, when necessary, to assist in the fair value determination of significant acquired long-lived assets. while we use our best estimates and assumptions as a part of the purchase price allocation process, our estimates are inherently uncertain and subject to refinement. critical estimates in valuing certain intangible assets include, but are not limited to, future expected cash flows from customer relationships, customer attrition rates and discount rates. managements estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable, but due to the inherent uncertainty during the measurement period, which may be up to one year from the acquisition date, we record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, with the corresponding offset to goodwill. the purchase price allocation of the enterprise acquisition is based upon a preliminary valuation and the estimates and assumptions are subject to change within the measurement period as additional information is obtained.
recently issued accounting pronouncements in july 2013, the fasb issued accounting standard update (asu) 2013-11 presentation of an unrecognized tax benefit when a net operating loss carryforward, a similar tax loss, or a tax credit carryforward exists. asu 2013 -11 was issued to promote consistency among financial statement issuers and amends asc 740, income taxes, to provide clarification of the financial statement presentation of an unrecognized tax benefit when a net operating loss carryforward, a similar tax loss, or a tax credit carryforward exists. according to asu 2013-11, an unrecognized tax benefit or a portion of an unrecognized tax benefit should be presented in the financial statements as a reduction of a deferred tax asset for a net operating loss carryforward, a similar tax loss, or a tax credit carryforward, with certain exceptions. the revised guidance is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after december 15, 2013 with early adoption permitted. we adopted this guidance for our fiscal year beginning january 1, 2014. the adoption did not have a material impact on our financial statements.
in april 2014, the fasb issued asu 2014-08 reporting discontinued operations and disclosures of disposals of components of an entity. this update amends the criteria for reporting discontinued operations to, among other things, raise the threshold for disposals to qualify as discontinued operations. under the revised standard, a discontinued operation must represent a strategic shift that has or will have a major effect on an entitys operations and financial results. the revised standard will also allow an entity to have certain continuing cash flows or involvement with the component after the disposal. this update is effective for interim and annual reporting periods, beginning after december 15, 2014, with early adoption permitted. we will adopt this guidance for our fiscal year beginning january 1, 2015. we do not expect the adoption to have a material impact on our financial statements.
in may 2014, the fasb issued update 2014-09, asc 606, revenue from contracts with customers. this guidance is a comprehensive new revenue recognition model that requires a company to recognize revenue to depict the transfer of goods or services to a customer at an amount that reflects the consideration it expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services. this standard is effective for annual periods beginning after december 15, 2016 and interim periods within those annual periods. management is still assessing the impact of adoption on its consolidated financial statements.
liquidity and capital resources in connection with the acquisition in october 2014, we incurred indebtedness totaling $3.25 billion. as of december 31, 2014, we had cash and marketable securities balances of $418.3 million and long-term debt totaling $3.2 billion. we did not have any borrowings against our revolving credit facility with $247.1 million available ($250 million less $2.9 million of letters of credit available). see note 14 long term debt in the notes to the consolidated financial statements for further details and under financing activities below. the primary factors that influence our liquidity include, but are not
37
limited to, the amount and timing of our revenues, cash collections from our customers, capital expenditures and acquisitions of third-parties. management believes that existing capital resources and funds generated from operations are sufficient to meet anticipated capital requirements and service our indebtedness. the following table summarizes our cash flow activities for the periods indicated (in thousands):

the change in our cash and cash equivalents balance is reflective of the following:
operating activities during 2014, zebra generated operating cash flows of $248.3 million increasing $53.6 million from 2013. the operating cash flows increase is a result of strong legacy zebra performance in addition to operating cash from the acquisition of enterprise.
receivables increased $69.6 million which was a result of fourth quarter 2014 sales from both legacy zebra and the acquisition of enterprise.
accounts payable increased $62.2 million primarily due to increase in business activity as a result of the acquisition of enterprise.
accrued liabilities increased $164.3 million as of december 31, 2014. this increase in accrued liabilities is related to an increase in compensation accruals and professional service fees which are related to the acquisition of enterprise.
movements in deferred revenue reflect the increased level of service contracts. deferred revenue primarily consists of billings and payments received in advance of revenue recognition from service contracts.
investing activities cash used for investing increased to $3.1 billion due to the $3.4 billion paid to acquire enterprise, refer to note 3 business combinations in the notes to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion regarding the acquisition.
financing activities in 2014, financing activities were a source of cash of $3.2 billion compared to uses of cash of $44.2 million and $49.4 million in 2013 and 2012. financing activities were higher in 2014 primarily to fund the purchase price related to the acquisition of enterprise, see further discussion below. in addition we paid deferred financing costs of $24.0 million related to this debt; these costs are capitalized in zebras financial results. in 2013 and 2012, cash used for financing activities was primarily to repurchase shares of zebras common stock.
the following table shows our level of indebtedness and other information as of december 31, 2014 (in thousands):

private offering on october 15, 2014, zebra completed a private offering of $1.05 billion aggregate principal of 7.25% senior notes due october 15, 2022 (the senior notes). interest on the senior notes is payable in cash on april 15 and october 15 of each year, commencing on april 15, 2015.

the indenture covering the senior notes contains certain covenants limiting among other things, the ability of zebra and its restricted subsidiaries, with certain exceptions as described in the indenture, to; (i) incur indebtedness or issue certain preferred stock; (ii) incur liens; (iii) pay dividends or make distributions in respect of capital stock; (iv) purchase or redeem capital stock; (v) make investments or certain other restricted payments; (vi) sell assets; (vii) issue or sell stock of restricted subsidiaries; (viii) enter into transactions with stockholders or affiliates; or (ix) effect a consolidation or merger. on december 31, 2014, zebra was in compliance with the covenants.
new credit facilities on october 27, 2014, zebra entered into a new credit agreement which provides for a term loan of $2.2 billion (term loan) and a revolving credit facility of $250.0 million (revolving credit facility). borrowings under the term loan bear interest at a variable rate plus an applicable margin, subject to an all-in floor of 4.75%. as of december 31 2014, the term loan interest rate was 4.75%. interest payments are payable quarterly, starting january 27, 2015. the october 2012 revolving credit agreement for $250.0 million with a syndicate of banks was terminated upon execution of this credit agreement. the company has entered into interest rate swaps to manage interest rate risk on its long-term debt. see note 13 derivative instruments in the notes to the consolidated financial statements for further details.
the credit agreement requires zebra to prepay the term loan and revolving credit facility, under certain circumstances or transactions defined in the credit agreement. also, zebra may voluntarily prepay its obligations under the term loan at any time; however, we are required to make scheduled quarterly principal payments of $5.5 million beginning june 30, 2015, with the balance of $2.1 billion due on october 27, 2021.
the revolving credit facility is available for working capital and other general corporate purposes including letters of credit. the amount (including letters of credit) shall not exceed $250.0 million. as of december 31, 2014, zebra had established letters of credit amounting to $2.9 million, which reduced funds available for other borrowings under the agreement to $247.1 million. the revolving credit facility will mature and the commitments thereunder will terminate on october 27, 2019.
borrowings under the revolving credit facility bear interest at a variable rate plus an applicable margin. the applicable margin for borrowings under the revolving credit facility ranges from 2.25% to 2.75% depending on zebras consolidated total secured net leverage ratio which is evaluated on a quarterly basis. interest payments are payable quarterly. as of december 31 2014, zebra did not have any borrowings against the revolving credit facility.
the revolving credit facility contains certain covenants limiting among other things, the ability of zebra and its restricted subsidiaries, with certain exceptions as described in the agreement, to: (i) incur indebtedness, make guarantees or issue certain equity securities; (ii) pay dividends on its capital stock or redeem, repurchase or retire its capital stock; (iii) make certain investments, loans and acquisitions; (iv) sell certain assets or issue capital stock of restricted subsidiaries; (v) create liens or engage in sale-leaseback transactions; (vi) merge, consolidate or transfer or dispose of substantially all of their assets; (vii) engage in certain transactions with affiliates; (viii) alter the business it conducts; (ix) amend, prepay, redeem or purchase subordinated debt and (x) enter into agreements limiting subsidiary dividends and distributions. the revolving credit facility also requires zebra to comply with a financial covenant consisting of a quarterly maximum consolidated total secured net leverage ratio, (as defined in the revolving credit facility). this test is only required to be performed at the end of the fiscal quarter and when 20% of the commitments under the revolving credit facility have been drawn and remain outstanding.
the term loan and obligations under the revolving credit facility are collateralized by a security interest in substantially all of zebras assets as defined in the security agreement and guaranteed by its direct and indirect wholly-owned existing and future domestic restricted subsidiaries, subject to certain exceptions.
certain domestic subsidiaries of zebra (the guarantor subsidiaries) guarantee the notes, the term loan and the revolving credit facility on a senior basis: for the twelve months ended december 31, 2014, after giving pro forma effect to the acquisition of enterprise, the non-guarantor subsidiaries would have (a) accounted for approximately 44% of our total revenue and (b) held approximately 16% of our total assets and approximately 15.6%, or $704.1 million, of our total liabilities including trade payables but excluding intercompany liabilities.
on december 31, 2014, zebra was in compliance with the covenants.

historically, significant portions of our cash inflows were generated by our operations. we currently expect this trend to continue throughout 2015. we believe that our existing cash and investments, borrowings available under our revolving credit facility, together with cash flows expected from operations will be sufficient to meet expected operating, capital expenditure and debt obligation requirements for the next 12 months.
zebra had $268.4 million as of december 31, 2014, and $251.7 million as of december 31, 2013 of foreign cash and investments, which are primarily invested in u.s. dollar-denominated holdings.
management believes that existing capital resources and funds generated from operations are sufficient to finance anticipated capital requirements.

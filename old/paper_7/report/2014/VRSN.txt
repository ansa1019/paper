overview we are a global provider of domain name registry services and internet security, enabling internet navigation for many of the world's most recognized domain names and providing protection for websites and enterprises around the world. our registry services ensure the security, stability and resiliency of key internet infrastructure and services, including the .com and .net domains, two of the internet's root servers, and operation of the root-zone maintainer functions for the core of the internet's dns. our product suite also includes nia services consisting of ddos protection services, verisign idefense services and managed dns services.  as of december 31, 2014, we had approximately 130.6 million domain names registered under the .com and .net registries, our principal registries. the number of domain names registered is largely driven by continued growth in online advertising, e-commerce, and the number of internet users, which is partially driven by greater availability of broadband, as well as advertising and promotional activities carried out by us and third-party registrars. growth in the number of domain names has been hindered by certain factors, including changes to the marketing strategies of certain registrars, overall economic conditions, the introduction of new gtlds, and ongoing changes to search algorithms used by google and other internet search engines that negatively affect the profitability of certain types of websites, and as a result, reduce demand for new domain name registrations and renewals. revenues from nia services are not significant in relation to our consolidated revenues.
2014 business highlights and trends
•   we recorded revenues of $1,010.1 million in 2014, which represents an increase of 5% compared to 2013.
•   during 2014, domain names registered under the .com and .net tlds increased by 3.4 million to end the year at 130.6 million domain names in the domain name base, which was an increase of 3% compared to december 31, 2013.

critical accounting policies and significant management estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with u.s. generally accepted accounting principles. the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. on an ongoing basis, management evaluates those estimates. management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily available from other sources. actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.
an accounting estimate is considered critical if the nature of the estimates or assumptions is material due to the levels of subjectivity and judgment involved, and the impact of changes in the estimates and assumptions would have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements. we believe the following critical accounting estimates and policies have the most significant impact on our consolidated financial statements:
revenue recognition we generate revenues by providing services over a period of time. fees for these services are deferred and recognized as performance occurs. the majority of our revenue transactions contain standard business terms and conditions. however, at times, we enter into non-standard arrangements including multiple-element arrangements. as a result, we must evaluate (1) whether an arrangement exists; (2) how the arrangement consideration should be allocated among the deliverables; (3) when to recognize revenue on the deliverables; and (4) whether all elements of the arrangement have been delivered. our revenue recognition policy also requires an assessment as to whether collection is reasonably assured, which requires us to evaluate the creditworthiness of our customers.
fair value of financial instruments our subordinated convertible debentures have a contingent interest payment provision that is identified as an embedded derivative. the embedded derivative is accounted for separately at fair value, and is marked to market at the end of each reporting period. we utilize a valuation model based on stock price, bond price, risk free interest rates, volatility, and credit spread observations to estimate the value of the derivative. several of these inputs to the model are not observable and require management judgment.
income taxes accounting for income taxes requires significant judgments in the development of estimates used in income tax calculations. such judgments include, but are not limited to, the likelihood we would realize the benefits of net operating loss carryforwards, domestic and/or foreign tax credit carryforwards, the adequacy of valuation allowances, and the rates used to measure transactions with foreign subsidiaries. to the extent recovery of deferred tax assets is not likely, we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized.
our operations involve dealing with uncertainties and judgments in the application of complex tax regulations in multiple jurisdictions. the final taxes payable are dependent upon many factors, including negotiations with taxing authorities in various jurisdictions and resolution of disputes arising from u.s. federal, state, and international tax audits. we only recognize or continue to only recognize tax positions that are more likely than not to be sustained upon examination. we adjust these amounts in light of changing facts and circumstances; however, due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties, the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from our current estimate of the tax liabilities.
during the second quarter of 2014, we completed the repatriation of $740.9 million of cash held by foreign subsidiaries, in a tax efficient manner by using the tax benefits resulting from the 2013 worthless stock deduction to offset the taxable income generated in the u.s. as a result of the repatriation. the repatriation utilized substantially all of the capital reserves of our foreign subsidiaries that were legally distributable under applicable foreign statutes. deferred income taxes are not provided for any funds remaining in the foreign subsidiaries after the repatriation because these earnings are intended to be indefinitely reinvested. we consider the following matters, among others, in evaluating our plans for indefinite reinvestment: the forecasts, budgets and financial requirements of the parent and subsidiaries for both the long and short term; the tax consequences of a
37
decision to reinvest; and any u.s. and foreign government programs designed to influence remittances. if factors change and as a result we are unable to indefinitely reinvest the foreign earnings, the income tax expense and payments may differ significantly from the current period and could materially adversely affect our results of operations.
earnings per share we use the treasury stock method to calculate the impact of our subordinated convertible debentures on diluted earnings per share. under this method, only a positive conversion spread related to the subordinated convertible debentures is included in the diluted earnings per share calculations. this is based on our intent and ability to settle the principal amount of the subordinated convertible debentures in cash. a change in our intent and ability would require us to use the if-converted method, which could have a material impact on our diluted earnings per share.

revenues revenues related to our registry services are primarily derived from registrations for domain names in the .com and .net domain name registries. we also derive revenues from operating domain name registries for several other tlds which are not significant in relation to our consolidated revenues. for domain names registered with the .com and .net registries, we receive a fee from third-party registrars per annual registration that is fixed pursuant to our agreements with icann. individual customers, called registrants, contract directly with third-party registrars or their resellers, and the third-party registrars in turn register the domain names with verisign. changes in revenues are driven largely by changes in the number of new domain name registrations and the renewal rate for existing registrations as well as the impact of new and prior price increases, to the extent permitted, by icann and the doc. new registrations and the renewal rate for existing registrations are impacted by continued growth in online advertising, e-commerce, and the number of internet users, which is partially driven by greater availability of broadband, as well as advertising and promotional activities carried out by us and third-party registrars. we increased the annual fee for a .net domain name registration from $5.11 to $5.62 on july 1, 2013, from $5.62 to $6.18 on february 1, 2014, and from $6.18 to $6.79 on february 1, 2015. we have the contractual right to increase the fees for .net domain name registrations by up to 10% each year during the term of our .net agreement with icann through june 30, 2017. the annual fee for a .com domain name registration is fixed at $7.85 for the duration of the current .com registry agreement through november 30, 2018, except that prices may be raised by up to 7% each year due to the imposition of any new consensus policy or documented extraordinary expense resulting from an attack or threat of attack on the security and stability (each as defined in the .com registry agreement) of the dns, subject to approval of the doc. we offer promotional marketing programs for our registrars based upon market conditions and the business environment in which the registrars operate. all fees paid to us for .com and .net registrations are in u.s. dollars. revenues from nia services are not significant in relation to our total consolidated revenues.

2014 compared to 2013: revenues increased by $45.0 million, primarily due to a 3% increase in the number of domain names ending in .com and .net and increases in the .net domain name registration fees in july 2013 and february 2014.
2013 compared to 2012: revenues increased by $91.5 million, primarily due to an $80.8 million increase in revenues from the operation of the registries for the .com and .net tlds and a $10.7 million increase from other service revenues. the increase in revenues from operation of the registries for the .com and .net tlds is primarily due to a 5% increase in the number of domain names ending in .com and .net and increases in the .com domain name registration fees in january 2012 and .net domain name registration fees in january 2012 and july 2013 as per our agreements with icann.
the growth in the domain name base was primarily driven by continued internet growth and new domain name promotional programs. however, ongoing economic uncertainty, the introduction of new gtlds and changing marketing strategies by certain registrars has limited the rate of growth of the domain name base in 2014 and to a lesser extent in 2013. further, according to published reports, google periodically makes changes to its search algorithms, which may decrease traffic to certain websites, and pay-per-click advertising policies, which may provide less compensation for certain types of websites. this could make such websites less profitable and hinder domain name registration growth. we believe these algorithm changes had a negative effect on the first time renewal rate for registrations in recent years.
we expect to see continued growth in the domain name base during 2015 as a result of further internet growth. in addition we expect to see continued growth internationally in the domain name base, resulting from greater broadband availability, internet adoption, and expanding e-commerce. however, we expect the rate of growth to be limited because of the same factors described above which limited growth in 2014. we expect revenues will continue to increase in fiscal 2015, albeit at a slower rate, as compared to fiscal 2014 as a result of continued growth in the aggregate number of active domain names ending in .com and .net and increases in the .net domain name registration fees in february 2014 and 2015.
we generate revenue in the u.s.; europe, the middle east and africa ("emea"); australia, china, india, and other asia pacific countries ("apac"); and certain other countries, including canada and latin american countries.

revenues for our registry services business are attributed to the country of domicile and the respective regions in which our registrars are located, however, this may differ from the regions where the registrars operate or where registrants are located. revenue growth for each region may be impacted by registrars reincorporating, relocating, or from acquisitions or changes in affiliations of resellers. revenue growth for each region may also be impacted by registrars domiciled in one region, registering domain names in another region. these factors are reflected in the higher revenue growth in emea in 2014 and 2013, lower revenue growth in apac during 2014, and declining revenue in apac during 2013 and in the other region during 2014.

we applied for 14 new gtlds, including 12 idn gtlds, which are transliterations of ".com" or ".net" in various languages.  we executed registry agreements to become the registry operator for 12 of these new gtlds, including 11 idns as well as .comsec. the remaining idn application was for a transliteration of ".com" in traditional chinese script, which was a variant of a string we applied for in another idn application (".com" in simplified chinese), and has been withdrawn at the request of icann, because icann had not yet developed a policy to address such variants. we may continue with this application, or a new one for the same string, once icann develops and implements a policy to address variant strings. the deadline to execute the registry agreement for our .verisign application is july 29, 2015.  there is no certainty that we will enter into the registry agreement for .verisign or ultimately operate any of these new gtlds.
icann has stated that it will need to limit the maximum number of new gtlds that may be delegated in a year to 1,000, which could delay the activation of some approved new gtlds. even though idn gtlds have been given priority, other factors related to the application process could delay or disrupt an application and the timing of revenue generation, if any, from these gtlds. further, there is no guarantee that such new gtlds will be any more successful than the new gtlds obtained by our competitors. for example, some of the new gtlds including our new gtld strings, may face additional universal acceptability and usability challenges in that current desktop and mobile device software does not ubiquitously recognize these new gtlds and may be slow to adopt standards or support these gtlds, even if demand for such products is strong. this is particularly true for idn gtlds, but applies to conventional gtlds as well.
similarly, while we originally entered into agreements to provide back-end registry services to other applicants for approximately 220 new gtlds, and applicants for approximately 170 new gtlds currently continue to contract with us to provide back-end registry services, there is no guarantee that such applicants with which we have entered into agreements will be successful in obtaining one or more of these new gtlds or that such new gtlds will be successful due to some or all of the factors discussed above in connection with our new gtlds. we also cannot guarantee that we will ultimately provide back-end registry services for all of these new gtlds. icann's registry agreement for new gtlds requires the distribution of new gtlds only through registrars who have executed the 2013 raa. if registrars do not execute the 2013 raa, our ability to provide back-end registry services would be reduced, negatively impacting the sale of our back-end registry services for new gtlds. even if we are able to provide such services, the timing of revenue may also be dependent on how diligently our customers proceed to delegation and launch following the completion of the application process and our customers' respective launch plans for the new gtlds. in addition, we may face risks regarding icann requirements for mitigating name collisions in the new gtlds which we operate or for which we provide back-end registry services.
we cannot assess the impact, if any, the introduction of these new gtlds will have on our revenues and results of operations. see item 1a. "risk factors-we may face additional competition, operational and other risks from the introduction of new gtlds by icann, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows," of this form 10-k.
cost of revenues cost of revenues consist primarily of salaries and employee benefits expenses for our personnel who manage the operational systems, depreciation expenses, operational costs associated with the delivery of our services, fees paid to icann, customer support and training, consulting and development services, costs of facilities and computer equipment used in these activities, telecommunications expense and allocations of indirect costs such as corporate overhead.

2014 compared to 2013: cost of revenues increased slightly, primarily due to increases in allocated overhead expenses and depreciation expenses. allocated overhead expenses increased by $1.8 million, primarily due to an increase in allocable indirect costs. depreciation expenses increased by $1.5 million, primarily due to an increase in hardware and equipment purchases to support our network infrastructure in recent years.
2013 compared to 2012: cost of revenues increased primarily due to increases in registry fees, depreciation expenses, and salary and employee benefits expenses, including stock-based compensation expenses. registry fees increased by $9.2 million, due to increased registry fees required to be paid under the renewed .com registry agreement which became effective in the fourth quarter of 2012. depreciation expenses increased by $7.0 million, primarily due to an increase in capital expenditures in 2013, the acceleration of depreciation on an abandoned software project in 2013, and a change in the estimated useful lives of computer

hardware and equipment assets from three years to four years in 2012. salary and employee benefits expenses, including stock-based compensation expenses, increased by $4.2 million primarily due to an increase in bonus expenses as a result of a lower payout of fiscal 2012 bonuses.
we expect cost of revenues as a percentage of revenues to remain consistent in 2015 as compared to 2014.
sales and marketing sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of salaries, sales commissions, sales operations and other personnel-related expenses, travel and related expenses, gtld application costs, trade shows, costs of lead generation, costs of computer and communications equipment and support services, facilities costs, consulting fees, costs of marketing programs, such as online, television, radio, print and direct mail advertising costs, and allocations of indirect costs such as corporate overhead.

2014 compared to 2013: sales and marketing expenses increased primarily due to increases in advertising and marketing expenses and stock-based compensation expenses, partially offset by a decrease in contract and professional services expenses. advertising and marketing expenses increased by $2.7 million primarily due to an increase in advertising expenses for product marketing initiatives promoting registry and nia services and an increase in general corporate marketing expenses. stock-based compensation expenses increased by $1.8 million, primarily due to additional expense recognized for certain performance-based rsus which was recorded based on their period-end fair value as well as an increase in expense related to higher expected attainment levels for performance-based rsus granted in 2013 and 2014, and lower expense recognized during 2013 as a result of lower actual attainment level for performance-based rsus granted in 2012. contract and professional services expenses decreased by $2.0 million, primarily due to a decrease in strategy consulting costs related to new gtlds and other marketing research expenses.
2013 compared to 2012: sales and marketing expenses decreased primarily due to decreases in advertising and consulting services expenses, fees paid to icann for new gtld applications, and allocated overhead expenses. advertising and consulting services expenses decreased by $2.5 million, due to changes in product marketing programs and the timing of marketing initiatives in our registry services business. during 2012, we applied for 14 new gtlds and incurred fees of $2.6 million related to those applications. allocated overhead expenses decreased by $1.6 million primarily due to a decrease in average headcount relative to other functions and a decrease in allocable expenses.
we expect sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of revenues to remain consistent in 2015 as compared to 2014.
research and development research and development expenses consist primarily of costs related to research and development personnel, including salaries and other personnel-related expenses, consulting fees, facilities costs, computer and communications equipment, support services used in our service and technology development, and allocations of indirect costs such as corporate overhead.

2014 compared to 2013: research and development expenses decreased primarily due to a $1.7 million decrease in contract and professional services expenses from lower consulting costs on various development projects as we have shifted more development work to our employees.
2013 compared to 2012: research and development expenses increased primarily due to an increase in salary and employee benefits expenses, including stock-based compensation expenses, and a decrease in capitalized labor, partially offset by a decrease in contract and professional services expenses. salary and employee benefits expenses, including stock-based compensation expenses, increased by $8.5 million, primarily due to an increase in average headcount to support the development of our dns infrastructure and new services and higher bonus expenses as a result of a lower payout of fiscal 2012 bonuses. capitalized labor

decreased by $2.0 million in 2013 due to a decrease in the volume of work performed on internally developed software projects. contract and professional services expenses decreased by $3.4 million due to lower consulting costs on various projects.
we expect research and development expenses as a percentage of revenues to remain consistent in 2015 as compared to 2014.
general and administrative general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and other personnel-related expenses for our executive, administrative, legal, finance, information technology and human resources personnel, costs of facilities, computer and communications equipment, management information systems, support services, professional services fees, certain tax and license fees, and bad debt expense, offset by allocations of indirect costs such as facilities and shared services expenses to other cost types.

2014 compared to 2013: general and administrative expenses increased primarily due to increases in salary and employee benefit expenses, stock-based compensation expenses, contract and professional services expenses, and depreciation expenses, partially offset by an increase in overhead expenses allocated to other cost types and a decrease in legal expenses. salary and employee benefits expenses increased by $3.8 million, primarily due to higher average headcount and increase in severance expenses. stock-based compensation expenses increased by $5.5 million due to additional expense recognized for certain performance-based rsus which were recorded based on their period-end fair value as well as an increase in expense related to higher expected attainment levels for performance-based rsus granted in 2013 and 2014, and lower expense recognized during 2013 as a result of lower actual attainment level for performance-based rsus granted in 2012. contract and professional services expenses increased by $2.0 million, primarily due to increases in strategic consulting costs. depreciation expenses increased by $1.5 million, primarily due to the additional depreciation related to an internal use software product being placed into service in 2014. overhead expenses allocated to other cost types increased by $3.5 million due to an increase in total allocable indirect costs. legal expenses decreased by $2.7 million primarily due to a reduction in legal services related to income tax matters and our patent portfolio.
2013 compared to 2012: general and administrative expenses remained consistent in 2013 compared to 2012 as an increase in salary and employee benefits expenses, including stock-based compensation in 2013, and the 2012 reimbursement of previously incurred legal costs, received upon settlement of indemnification claims with the selling shareholders of a previously acquired business, were offset by decreases in legal expenses, occupancy expenses, and contract and professional services expenses. salary and employee benefits expenses increased by $7.5 million, including a $1.6 million increase in stock-based compensation expenses, primarily due to an increase in average headcount and higher bonus expenses as compared to 2012 as a result of a lower payout of fiscal 2012 bonuses. stock-based compensation expenses increased due to higher expected attainment levels for performance based rsus granted to the company's executives in 2013. in the fourth quarter of 2012, we recognized a credit of $4.5 million related to reimbursement of previously incurred legal costs, received upon settlement of indemnification claims with the selling shareholders of a previously acquired business. legal expenses decreased by $8.3 million due to costs incurred in 2012 to support the doc's review of our renewal of the .com registry agreement with icann, in addition to decreases in patent and trademark related expenses and legal advice related to icann's new gtld program. occupancy expenses decreased by $2.6 million primarily due to the reversal of certain accrued expenses upon the resolution of a dispute related to a vacated office lease and a decrease in leased space. contract and professional services expenses decreased by $1.7 million due to an increase in costs capitalized related to development and implementation of internal use software.
we expect general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues to remain consistent in 2015 as compared to 2014.

our effective tax rate for 2014 was lower than the statutory federal rate of 35% primarily due to benefits from foreign income taxed at lower rates, partially offset by state income taxes and net income tax expense of $9.8 million due to a non-u.s. income tax charge in the fourth quarter of 2014 related to a reorganization of certain international operations and changes in estimates during 2014 for u.s. income taxes related to the 2013 worthless stock deduction and the 2014 repatriation of earnings from foreign subsidiaries.
during the fourth quarter of 2013, we liquidated for tax purposes one of our domestic subsidiaries, which allowed us to claim a worthless stock deduction on our 2013 federal income tax return.   we recorded an income tax benefit during the fourth quarter of 2013 of $375.3 million related to the worthless stock deduction, net of valuation allowances and accrual for uncertain tax positions.  the financial statement carrying value of this subsidiary was not material. the worthless stock deduction may be subject to audit and adjustment by the irs, which could result in reversal of all, part or none of the income tax benefit, or could result in a benefit higher than the net amount recorded.  if the irs rejects or reduces the amount of the income tax benefit related to the worthless stock deduction, we may have to pay additional cash income taxes, which could adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. we cannot guarantee what the ultimate outcome or amount of the benefit we receive, if any, will be. during the fourth quarter of 2013, we recorded an income tax expense of $167.1 million related to taxable income generated in the u.s. as a result of the 2014 repatriation. for funds remaining in the foreign subsidiaries after the repatriation that have not been previously taxed in the u.s., our intent remains to indefinitely reinvest those funds outside of the u.s. and accordingly we have not provided deferred u.s. taxes. see note 12, "income taxes," of our notes to consolidated financial statements in item 15 of this form 10-k.
our effective tax rate for 2013 was lower than the statutory federal rate of 35% primarily due to benefits from the worthless stock deduction, net of valuation allowances and accrual for uncertain tax positions and tax benefits from foreign income taxed at lower rates, partially offset by the expense related to the repatriation of cash held by foreign subsidiaries and state income taxes.
our effective tax rate for 2012 was lower than the statutory federal rate of 35% primarily due to tax benefits from foreign income taxed at lower rates and a decrease in valuation allowances related to deferred tax assets, partially offset by state income taxes and non-deductible stock based compensation.
as of december 31, 2014, we had deferred tax assets arising from deductible temporary differences, tax losses, and tax credits of $304.3 million, net of valuation allowances, but before the offset of certain deferred tax liabilities. with the exception of deferred tax assets related to capital loss carryforwards, we believe it is more likely than not that the tax effects of the deferred tax liabilities, together with future taxable income, will be sufficient to fully recover the remaining deferred tax assets. our deferred tax assets related to net operating loss carryforwards decreased in 2014 as the net operating loss carryforwards were utilized to offset 2014 taxable income, including the repatriation of foreign earnings.
we qualified for two tax holidays in switzerland. the tax holidays provide reduced rates of taxation on certain types of income and also require certain thresholds of foreign source income. one of the tax holidays is effective through december 31, 2016, and upon expiration may be subject to renewal if certain criteria are satisfied. the other tax holiday in switzerland expired on december 31, 2014, and has not been extended. these two tax holidays increased our earnings per share by $0.50, $0.18 and $0.11 in 2014, 2013, and 2012, respectively. we qualify for an additional tax holiday in switzerland which will take effect beginning in 2015. this tax holiday is indefinite, unless the required thresholds are no longer met, or there is a law change which eliminates the holiday. in the fourth quarter of 2014, we incurred a charge of $14.5 million in non-us income taxes as a result of a reorganization of certain international operations. as a result of the tax holiday which becomes effective in 2015, and the reorganization, we do not believe there will be a significant change to our international tax rate after the expiration of the tax holiday in switzerland.

as of december 31, 2014, our principal source of liquidity was $191.6 million of cash and cash equivalents and $1.2 billion of marketable securities. the marketable securities consist of debt securities issued by the u.s. treasury meeting the criteria of our investment policy, which is focused on the preservation of our capital through investment in investment grade securities. the cash equivalents consist mainly of amounts invested in money market funds and u.s. treasury bills purchased with original maturities of less than 90 days. as of december 31, 2014, all of our marketable securities have contractual maturities of less than one year. our cash and cash equivalents are readily accessible. for additional information on our investment portfolio, see note 2, "cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities," of our notes to consolidated financial statements in item 15 of this form 10-k.
during the second quarter of 2014, we completed the repatriation of approximately $740.9 million of cash held by foreign subsidiaries, net of foreign withholding taxes of $28.1 million. as of december 31, 2014, the amount of cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities held by foreign subsidiaries was $939.0 million. our intent remains to indefinitely reinvest these funds outside of the u.s. and accordingly, we have not provided deferred u.s. taxes for these funds. in the event funds from foreign operations are needed to fund operations in the u.s. and if u.s. tax has not already been provided, we would be required to accrue and pay additional u.s. taxes in order to repatriate these funds. we utilized substantially all of the remaining net operating losses generated from the 2013 worthless stock deduction to offset current year taxable income including the taxable income recognized in the u.s. as a result of the repatriation. the repatriation generated foreign source income in the u.s. which allows the company to claim eligible foreign taxes amounting to $187.7 million paid in the current year and prior years as foreign tax credits instead of as deductions. the majority of these foreign tax credits will expire in 2024. see "risk factors - changes in, or interpretations of, tax rules and regulations or our tax positions may adversely affect our effective tax rates." as of december 31, 2014, the amount of undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries for which deferred income taxes have not been provided was $447.0 million.
in 2014, proceeds from sales and maturities of marketable securities, net of purchases were $151.6 million compared with $59.0 million in 2013. in 2012, purchases of marketable securities were $1.4 billion, net of sales and maturities.
in 2014, we repurchased 16.3 million shares of our common stock at an average stock price of $53.15 for an aggregate cost of $867.1 million. in 2013, we repurchased 21.0 million shares of our common stock at an average stock price of $48.65 for an aggregate cost of $1.0 billion. in 2012, we repurchased 7.7 million shares of our common stock at an average stock price of $40.90 for an aggregate cost of $314.6 million. as of december 31, 2014, there was $623.5 million remaining for future share repurchases under the share buyback program. effective january 30, 2015, the board of directors authorized the repurchase of approximately $452.9 million of our common stock, in addition to the $547.1 million of our common stock remaining available for repurchase under the previous share repurchase program, for a total repurchase authorization of up to $1.0 billion of our common stock.
as of december 31, 2014, we had $1.25 billion principal amount outstanding of 3.25% subordinated convertible debentures due 2037 (see note 6 "debt and interest expense" of the accompanying consolidated financial statements).
the price of our common stock exceeded the conversion price threshold trigger during the fourth quarter of 2014. accordingly, the subordinated convertible debentures are convertible at the option of each holder through march 31, 2015. we do not expect a material amount of the subordinated convertible debentures to be converted in the near term as the trading price of the debentures exceeds the value that is likely to be received upon conversion. however, we cannot provide any assurance that the trading price of the debentures will continue to exceed the value that would be derived upon conversion or that the holders will not elect to convert the subordinated convertible debentures.
if a holder elects to convert its subordinated convertible debentures, we are permitted under the indenture to pursue an exchange in lieu of conversion or to settle the conversion value (as defined in the indenture) in cash, stock, or a combination thereof. if we choose not to pursue or cannot complete an exchange in lieu of conversion, we currently have the intent and the ability (based on current facts and circumstances) to settle the principal amount of the subordinated convertible debentures in cash. however, if the principal amount of the subordinated convertible debentures that holders actually elect to convert exceeds our cash on hand and cash from operations, we will need to draw cash from existing financing or pursue additional
44
sources of financing to settle the subordinated convertible debentures in cash. we cannot provide any assurances that we will be able to obtain new sources of financing on terms acceptable to us or at all, nor can we assure that we will be able to obtain such financing in time to settle the subordinated convertible debentures that holders elect to convert.
on august 14, 2014, the upside trigger on the subordinated convertible debentures was met for the six month interest period from august 15, 2014 through february 14, 2015. on february 15, 2015, we will pay contingent interest of $5.2 million in addition to the normal coupon interest to holders of record of the subordinated convertible debentures as of february 1, 2015. the upside trigger is met if the subordinated convertible debentures' average trading price is at least 150% of par during the 10 trading days before each semi-annual interest period. the upside trigger is tested semi-annually for the following six months. the semi-annual upside contingent interest payment, for a given period, can be approximated by applying the annual rate of 0.5% to the aggregate market value of all outstanding subordinated convertible debentures and dividing by two for that semi-annual period payment amount.
on april 16, 2013, we issued $750.0 million aggregate principal amount of 4.625% senior unsecured notes due 2023 in a private offering. the senior notes will mature in may 2023. we used a portion of the net proceeds to repay the $100.0 million of outstanding indebtedness under our unsecured credit facility. the remaining portion of the proceeds were used for general corporate purposes including the repurchase of shares under the share buyback program. the unsecured credit facility remains available with a borrowing capacity of $200.0 million.
we believe existing cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, and funds generated from operations, together with our ability to arrange for additional financing should be sufficient to meet our working capital, capital expenditure requirements, and to service our debt for the next 12 months. we regularly assess our cash management approach and activities in view of our current and potential future needs.
in summary, our cash flows for 2014, 2013, and 2012 were as follows:

net cash provided by operating activities our largest source of operating cash flows is cash collections from our customers. our primary uses of cash from operating activities are for personnel related expenditures, and other general operating expenses, as well as payments related to taxes, interest and facilities.
2014 compared to 2013: cash provided by operating activities increased primarily due to an increase in cash received from customers partially offset by increases in cash paid for interest and cash paid to employees and vendors. cash received from customers increased primarily due to an increase in new and renewed domain name registrations during 2014. cash paid for interest increased due to the issuance of the senior notes in april 2013. payments to employees and vendors increased primarily due to an increase in operating expenses.
2013 compared to 2012: cash provided by operating activities increased primarily due to an increase in cash received from customers, and decreases in cash paid to employees and vendors offset by increases in interest paid and income taxes paid. cash received from customers increased primarily due to an increase in new and renewed domain name registrations during 2013. payments to employees and vendors decreased primarily due to the timing of payments to vendors. interest paid increased in 2013 as a result of the issuance of our senior notes in april 2013. income taxes paid increased primarily due to federal income tax payments made during 2013 based on estimated taxable income before we determined that we would claim a worthless stock deduction that ultimately resulted in a tax loss for the year.
net cash provided by (used in) by investing activities the changes in cash flows from investing activities primarily relate to purchases, maturities and sales of marketable securities, and purchases of property and equipment.
45
2014 compared to 2013: the change in cash provided by (used in) investing activities was primarily due to an increase in proceeds from maturities and sales of marketable securities, net of purchases of marketable securities and a decrease in purchases of property and equipment.
2013 compared to 2012: cash used in investing activities decreased primarily due to $1.4 billion of purchases of marketable securities, net of sales and maturities, during 2012 compared to $58.5 million of sales and maturities of marketable securities, net of purchases, in 2013, partially offset by an increase in purchases of property and equipment as we continue to invest in our infrastructure.
net cash used in financing activities the changes in cash flows from financing activities primarily relate to share repurchases, proceeds from and repayment of borrowings, stock option exercises, our employee stock purchase plan ("espp"), and excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation.
2014 compared to 2013: net cash used in financing activities increased due to the proceeds received in 2013 from the issuance of senior notes and a decrease in proceeds from stock options exercises and espp as well as lower recognized excess tax benefits associated with stock-based compensation, partially offset by a decrease in share repurchases and the repayment of borrowings under our credit facility in 2013.
2013 compared to 2012: net cash used in financing activities increased primarily due to an increase in share repurchases during 2013 and repayment of the outstanding indebtedness under our unsecured credit facility in 2013, partially offset by proceeds received from the issuance of senior notes in 2013.
impact of inflation we do not believe that inflation has had a significant impact on our operations in any of the periods presented.
income taxes we derive significant tax savings from the subordinated convertible debentures.  during 2014 and 2013, the interest deduction, for income tax purposes, related to our subordinated convertible debentures was $154.9 million and $145.8 million, respectively, compared to coupon interest expense of $40.6 million for each of the same periods. for income tax purposes, we deduct interest expense on the subordinated convertible debentures calculated at 8.5% of the adjusted issue price, subject to adjustment for actual versus projected contingent interest. the adjusted issue price, and consequently the interest deduction for income tax purposes, grows over the term due to the difference between the interest deduction taken using a comparable yield of 8.5% on the adjusted issue price, and the coupon rate of 3.25% on the principal amount, compounded annually. the interest deduction taken is subject to recapture upon settlement to the extent that the amount paid (in cash or stock) to settle the subordinated convertible debentures is less than the adjusted issue price. interest recognized in accordance with gaap, which is calculated at 8.39% of the liability component of the subordinated convertible debentures, will also grow over the term, but at a slower rate. this difference will result in a continuing increase in the deferred tax liability on our consolidated balance sheet.
if the amount paid (in cash or stock) to settle the subordinated convertible debentures (i.e., the settlement amount) is less than the adjusted issue price, under the internal revenue code and the regulations thereunder, the difference is included in taxable income as recapture of previous interest deductions. the settlement amount will vary based on the stock price at settlement date. depending on the settlement amount for the subordinated convertible debentures at the settlement date, the amount included in taxable income as a result of this recapture could be substantial, which could adversely impact our cash flow.
we do not expect to pay u.s. federal income taxes during 2015 as a result of the interest deduction on our subordinated convertible debentures, and the use of foreign tax credits and research tax credits. we expect the amount of cash paid for non-u.s. income taxes in 2015 to be consistent with 2014.
property and equipment expenditures our planned property and equipment expenditures for 2015 are anticipated to be between $40.0 million and $50.0 million and will primarily be focused on infrastructure upgrades and enhancements to our product portfolio.

contractual obligations see note 13, "commitments and contingencies, "purchase obligations and contractual agreements, of our notes to consolidated financial statements in item 15 of this form 10-k.
we enter into indemnification agreements with many of our customers in the ordinary course of business. we also entered into indemnification agreements with symantec in connection with the sale of the authentication services business. see note 13, "commitments and contingencies," indemnifications, of our notes to consolidated financial statements in item 15 of this form 10-k.
off-balance sheet arrangements it is not our business practice to enter into off-balance sheet arrangements. as of december 31, 2014, we did not have any significant off-balance sheet arrangements. see note 13, "commitments and contingencies," off-balance sheet arrangements, of our notes to consolidated financial statements in item 15 of this form 10-k for further information regarding off-balance sheet arrangements.
dilution from subordinated convertible debentures, rsus and stock options the conversion of our subordinated convertible debentures may dilute the holdings of existing shareholders due to the potential number of shares that could be required to settle the subordinated convertible debentures. we have the intent and ability to settle the principal amount of the subordinated convertible debentures in cash, but the excess of the conversion value over the principal amount ("the conversion spread") may be settled in shares of common stock. as of december 31, 2014, there are 36.4 million shares of common stock reserved for issuance upon conversion or repurchase of the subordinated convertible debentures. based on the if-converted value of the subordinated convertible debentures as of december 31, 2014, the conversion spread could have required us to issue up to 14.4 million shares of common stock. see item 1a. "risk factors-we may not have the ability to repurchase the subordinated convertible debentures in cash upon the occurrence of a fundamental change, or to pay cash upon the conversion of subordinated convertible debentures; occurrence of certain events related to our subordinated convertible debentures might have significant adverse accounting, disclosure, tax, and liquidity implications," of this form 10-k.
grants of stock-based awards are key components of the compensation packages we provide to attract and retain certain of our talented employees and align their interests with the interests of existing stockholders. we recognize that these stock-based awards dilute existing stockholders and have sought to control the number granted while providing competitive compensation packages. as of december 31, 2014, there are a total of 2.2 million unvested rsus which represent potential dilution of 1.8%. this maximum potential dilution will only result if all outstanding rsus vest and are settled. there were no stock options granted in the last three years. in recent years, our stock repurchase program has more than offset the dilutive effect of our stock option and rsu programs; however, we may reduce the level of our stock repurchases in the future as we may use our available cash for other purposes.

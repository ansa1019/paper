new executive leadership team and divisional structure in 2014, we announced a new executive leadership team led by tom hill, president and chief executive officer. joining mr. hill on the leadership team were john mcpherson (executive vice president, chief financial and strategy officer), stan bass (senior vice president, west region) and michael mills (senior vice president and general counsel). we also introduced a new divisional organization structure effective january 1, 2015. this new structure enables us to pursue growth and profitability while further leveraging the erp and shared services platforms implemented in 2012. 2014 strategic acquisitions/divestitures
§   fourth quarter acquisition

§   two portable asphalt plants and an aggregates facility in southern california

§   third quarter acquisitions

§   five aggregates facilities and associated downstream assets in arizona and new mexico

§   two aggregates facilities in delaware, serving northern virginia and washington, d.c.

§   four aggregates facilities in the san francisco bay area

§   a rail-connected aggregates operation and two distribution yards that serve the greater dallas/fort worth market

§   second quarter acquisition

§   a permitted aggregates quarry in alabama

in the first quarter of 2014 we sold our cement and concrete businesses in the florida area to cementos argos (argos) for net pretax cash proceeds of $721.4 million resulting in a pretax gain of $211.4 million (net of $16.5 million of disposition related charges). we retained all of our florida aggregates operations, our former cement segment's calcium operation in brooksville, florida and real estate associated with certain former ready-mixed concrete facilities. under a separate supply agreement, we will continue to provide aggregates to the divested concrete facilities, at market prices, for a period of 20 years.
given our aggregates focused strategy, argos is a better owner of those assets than we were. our divested cement and concrete operations were among the most volatile and capital-intensive businesses in our portfolio. we continually challenge ourselves as to whether we are the best owner of our individual assets and operations - this logic supports the argos divestiture and also underpins the smaller transaction we closed in late january 2015 to exchange our california ready-mixed concrete operations for 13 asphalt mix plants, primarily in arizona. we expect to earn a higher return on the exchanged assets due to our operational and strategic focus in the arizona asphalt market.
for a detailed discussion of our acquisitions and divestitures, see note 19 "acquisitions and divestitures" in item 8 "financial statements and supplementary data."
market developments aggregates demand is in the early stages of recovery and remains well below normalized levels. the pattern of recovery is increasingly broad-based and, for the first time since 2005, demand in each of the four major end markets increased versus the prior year. we currently anticipate a gradual recovery lasting several more years before we return to aggregates consumption levels consistent with long-term trends.
construction activity in our markets grew faster than u.s. markets as a whole in 2014, led by growth in private construction. residential construction activity, measured in housing starts, continues to recover from depressed levels of demand to more normalized levels needed to support demographics. private nonresidential construction activity continues to benefit from growth in office and commercial as well as large industrial projects along the coasts of texas and louisiana, where we are well positioned to provide aggregates to an area deprived of naturally occurring sources suitable for construction. we see demand from private end-uses up 14% to 18% during 2015. private growth continues to be driven by the recovery in employment and the continued strength in family and multi-family housing. our employment and housing assumptions are consistent with consensus forecasts and reflect that our markets are growing faster than the rest of the united states.
part ii   29
public construction continues to realize steady growth due mostly to strong awards for new projects in 2013 and early in 2014 as well as large transportation-related projects funded through the federal government's tifia program. we currently expect these trends in demand in each of the major end markets to continue in 2015. we believe demand from public end-uses will increase 3% to 5% during 2015. construction award momentum remains positive and stable in our markets. the south and west continue to see more growth than other areas of the united states. state and local tax revenue growth has mirrored the economic recovery. as tax revenues approach all time high levels, they will supply the support for new public funding.
reconciliation of non-gaap financial measures gross profit margin excluding freight and delivery revenues is not a generally accepted accounting principle (gaap) measure. we present this metric as it is consistent with the basis by which we review our operating results. likewise, we believe that this presentation is consistent with the basis by which investors analyze our operating results considering that freight and delivery services represent pass-through activities. reconciliation of this metric to its nearest gaap measure is presented below: gross profit margin in accordance with gaap in millions                     2014   2013             2012

aggregates segment gross profit as a percentage of freight-adjusted revenues is not a gaap measure. we present this metric as it is consistent with the basis by which we review our operating results. we believe that this presentation is more meaningful to our investors as it excludes freight, delivery and transportation revenues which are pass-through activities. it also excludes immaterial other revenues related to services, such as landfill tipping fees, that are derived from our aggregates business. incremental gross profit as a percentage of freight-adjusted revenues represents the year-over-year change in gross profit divided by the year-over-year change in freight-adjusted revenues. reconciliation of these metrics to their nearest gaap measure is presented below:

gaap does not define "free cash flow," "cash gross profit" and "earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization" (ebitda). thus, free cash flow should not be considered as an alternative to net cash provided by operating activities or any other liquidity measure defined by gaap. likewise, cash gross profit and ebitda should not be considered as alternatives to earnings measures defined by gaap. we present these metrics for the convenience of investment professionals who use such metrics in their analyses and for shareholders who need to understand the metrics we use to assess performance and to monitor our cash and liquidity positions. the investment community often uses these metrics as indicators of a company's ability to incur and service debt and to assess the operating performance of a company's businesses. we use free cash flow, cash gross profit, ebitda and other such measures to assess liquidity and the operating performance of our various business units and the consolidated company. additionally, we adjust ebitda for certain items to provide a more consistent comparison of performance from period to period. we do not use these metrics as a measure to allocate resources. reconciliations of these metrics to their nearest gaap measures are presented below:
free cash flow free cash flow is calculated by deducting purchases of property, plant & equipment from net cash provided by operating activities.

operating results by segment we present our results of operations by segment at the gross profit level. we have four operating (and reportable) segments organized around our principal product lines: 1) aggregates, 2) asphalt mix, 3) concrete and 4) calcium (formerly cement). management reviews earnings for the product line segments principally at the gross profit level. 1. aggregates our year-over-year aggregates shipments:
§   increased 11% in 2014

§   increased 4% in 2013

§   declined 1% in 2012

sales volume momentum improved across most of our 20-state geographic footprint. this growing momentum is driven by strengthening construction activity across all end-use markets and an increasing number of large projects. on a same-store basis, aggregates shipments increased 15.0 million tons or 10%. florida, georgia, illinois, texas and virginia saw shipment increases in excess of 10% over the prior year on a same-store basis. this strong broad-based growth is driven by improving private construction activity and our ability to serve growing demand from large-project work in both private and public end-markets.
residential construction activity continues to be solid across our footprint, led by growth in multi-family housing. while the growth rate nationally for housing starts has slowed, key markets in california, florida, georgia and texas continue to post above-average growth rates. private nonresidential demand in our markets continues to grow faster than in the u.s. as a whole. this is driven by office, commercial and manufacturing projects - and by growth in construction activity along the gulf coast where we are uniquely positioned. in the public sector, shipments for highways has remained solid due to strong contract awards in 2013, increases in state highway funding, a growing number of tifia-funded projects in key states, and the extension of map-21 (the federal highway bill).
our year-over-year freight-adjusted selling price1 for aggregates:
§   increased 2% in 2014

§   increased 3% in 2013

§   increased 2% in 2012

1   we routinely arrange the delivery of our aggregates to the customer. additionally, we incur transportation costs to move aggregates from the production site to remote distribution sites. these costs are passed on to our customers in the aggregates price. we remove these pass-through freight and transportation revenues (and any other aggregates-derived revenues, such as landfill tipping fees) from the freight-adjusted selling price for aggregates. see the reconciliation of non-gaap financial measures within this item 7 for a reconciliation of freight-adjusted revenues.
part ii   36
our pricing environment continues to improve with the gradual improvement in demand. during 2014, we realized modest price improvements in all but one of our management reporting units across our 20-state geographic footprint. pricing decisions are made locally and outcomes will vary significantly by geography.

aggregates segment cash gross profit per ton increased 9% to $4.75 in 2014. this measure continues to improve, reflecting our effective management of the three major profit drivers (price for service; sales and production mix; operating efficiency and leverage). these efforts resulted in a record level of unit profitability that exceeds the level achieved in 2005 ($3.28 per ton - our peak year for volume) and in 2008 ($4.69 per ton - our previous high). this trend further highlights the earnings potential of our aggregates business as volumes recover.

2. asphalt mix our year-over-year asphalt mix shipments:
§   increased 8% in 2014

§   increased 3% in 2013

§   declined 7% in 2012

asphalt mix segment gross profit of $38.1 million was up $5.4 million from the prior year due to higher margins in california and the earnings contribution from recently completed acquisitions in arizona and new mexico. on a same-store basis, asphalt volumes increased 4% from the prior year and unit profitability increased 6%.

§   increased 14% in 2013

§   increased 9% in 2012

concrete segment gross profit was $2.2 million in 2014 compared to a loss of $24.8 million in 2013. adjusted for the sale of our concrete business in the florida area, concrete segment gross profit was $5.9 million compared to a loss of $0.3 million in 2013. ready-mixed concrete shipments declined in 2014 as a result of the sale of our florida concrete business in the first quarter of 2014. adjusted for the sale of our concrete business in the florida area, ready-mixed concrete shipments increased 10% in 2014.

selling, administrative and general expenses in millions sag expenses were up $12.9 million, or 5%, due primarily to increased performance based incentives and business development expenses. as a percentage of total revenues, sag expenses declined from 9.4% in 2013 to 9.1% in 2014. we remain focused on leveraging sag to revenues as volumes recover.
our comparative total company employment levels at year end:
§   declined 3% in 2014

the $116.2 million increase in our 2014 provision for income taxes and the $42.0 million decrease in our 2013 benefit from income taxes are primarily related to the year-over-year improvement in our earnings from continuing operations. a reconciliation of the federal statutory rate of 35% to our effective tax rates for 2014, 2013 and 2012 is presented in note 9 "income taxes" in item 8 "financial statements and supplementary data."

discontinued operations pretax earnings (loss) from discontinued operations were:
§   $3.7 million loss in 2014

§   $6.0 million earnings in 2013

§   $2.2 million earnings in 2012

the $3.7 million loss from discontinued operations resulted primarily from general and product liability costs, including legal defense costs, and environmental remediation costs associated with our former chemicals business. the 2013 and 2012 pretax earnings include gains related to the 5cp earn-out (final payment in 2013) of $11.7 and $10.2 million, respectively. these gains were partially offset by general and product liability costs, including legal defense costs, and environmental remediation costs. for additional information regarding discontinued operations and the 5cp earn-out, see note 2 "discontinued operations" in item 8 "financial statements and supplementary data."
liquidity and financial resources our primary sources of liquidity are cash provided by our operating activities, a bank line of credit and access to the capital markets. additional sources of liquidity include the sale of reclaimed and surplus real estate, and dispositions of non-strategic operating assets. we believe these liquidity and financial resources are sufficient to fund our business requirements for 2015, including:
§   cash contractual obligations

§   capital expenditures

§   debt service obligations

§   potential future acquisitions

§   dividend payments

we actively manage our capital structure and resources in order to minimize the cost of capital while properly managing financial risk. we seek to meet these objectives by adhering to the following principles:
§   maintain substantial bank line of credit borrowing capacity

§   proactively manage our long-term debt maturity schedule such that repayment/refinancing risk in any single year is low

§   minimize financial and other covenants that limit our operating and financial flexibility

§   opportunistically access the capital markets when conditions and terms are favorable

2014 versus 2013 - net cash provided by operating activities of $260.3 million decreased $96.2 million from 2013. the decrease is attributable to a transaction in 2013 in which we sold a percentage of future production from aggregates reserves resulting in net cash proceeds of $153.1 million (see note 1 "summary of significant accounting policies" in item 8 "financial statements and supplementary data"). net earnings before noncash deductions for dda&a increased $152.9 million to $484.4 million during 2014. included in net earnings for 2014 is a pretax gain of $227.9 million (see note 19 "acquisitions and divestitures" in item 8 "financial statements and supplementary data") from the sale of our cement and concrete businesses in the florida area. cash received associated with the sale of property, plant & equipment and businesses is presented as a component of investing activities. additionally, we purchased $506.4 million principal amount of outstanding debt through a tender offer and incurred a loss of $72.9 million (see note 6 "debt" in item 8 "financial statements and supplementary data"). cash paid for the debt purchase is presented as a component of financing activities.
2013 versus 2012 - net cash provided by operating activities of $356.5 million increased $118.0 million from 2012 due primarily to a $79.5 million increase in proceeds from the sale of future production. in september 2013, we entered into a second transaction to sell a percentage of future production from aggregates reserves resulting in net cash proceeds of $153.1 million (see note 19 "acquisitions and divestitures" in item 8 "financial statements and supplementary data"). additionally, as noted in the table above, net earnings before noncash deductions for depreciation, depletion, accretion and amortization increased $52.1 million in 2013 compared with 2012.

2014 versus 2013 - net cash provided by investing activities increased $534.5 million during 2014. this increase resulted from a $678.2 million increase in proceeds from the sale of property, plant & equipment and businesses partially offset by a $143.8 million increase in purchases of property, plant & equipment and businesses. during 2014, we sold a previously mined and subsequently reclaimed tract of land for $10.7 million, land previously containing a sales yard for $5.8 million, and our cement and concrete businesses in the florida area for $721.4 million. in the same period, we completed several acquisitions for total consideration of $331.8 million, of which $284.2 million was paid in cash (see note 19 "acquisitions and divestitures" in item 8 "financial statements and supplementary data").
2013 versus 2012 - net cash used for investing activities increased $306.6 million in 2013. this increase resulted from a $272.0 million increase in the purchase of property, plant & equipment and businesses and a $32.8 million decrease in proceeds from the sale of property, plant & equipment and businesses. during 2013, we acquired three aggregates production facilities and four ready-mixed concrete facilities for approximately $90.0 million and land containing 136 million tons of reserves for $117.0 million. we also sold five aggregates production facilities, one replacement reserve site and reclaimed land associated with a former site of a ready-mixed concrete facility for approximately $51.1 million.
cash from financing activities in millions
2014 versus 2013 - net cash used for financing activities of $551.1 million increased $409.1 million in 2014 compared to 2013. this increase is primarily attributable to a $429.2 million increase in debt payments (net of draws on our line of credit). as previously mentioned, in 2014 we purchased $506.4 million principal amount of outstanding debt through a tender offer as follows: $375.0 million of 6.50% notes due in 2016 and $131.4 million of 6.40% notes due in 2017. total tender costs were $579.7 million including $71.8 million premium and $1.5 million in transaction costs. this increase in cash used for financing activities is partially offset by a $26.8 million increase in proceeds from the issuance of common stock.  in 2014, we issued 0.5 million shares of common stock to the trustee of our 401(k) savings and retirement plans for cash proceeds of $30.6 million.
2013 versus 2012 - net cash used for financing activities of $142.0 million increased $12.8 million in 2013 compared to 2012. this increase in cash used for financing activities is attributable to a $15.8 million increase in debt payments. during 2013, we made scheduled debt payments of $10.0 million in january to retire the 8.70% medium-term note and $140.4 million in june to retire the 6.30% notes.

our long-term debt is unsecured and essentially all such debt agreements contain customary investment-grade type covenants that primarily limit the amount of secured debt we may incur without ratably securing the outstanding debt. our debt may be redeemed prior to maturity at the greater of par value and the make-whole value plus accrued and unpaid interest.
there were no material scheduled debt payments during 2014. however, we purchased $506.4 million principal amount of outstanding debt through a tender offer in march 2014 as described in note 6 "debt" in item 8 "financial statements and supplementary data." this debt purchase was funded by the aforementioned sale of our cement and concrete businesses in the florida area.
as of december 31, 2014, current maturities for the next four quarters and maturities for the next five years are due as follows:

2019          0.0
we expect to retire debt maturities using existing cash, cash generated from operations, by drawing on our bank line of credit or accessing the capital markets.
in march 2014, we amended our $500.0 million line of credit to, among other items, extend the term from march 2018 to march 2019. the line of credit is secured by accounts receivable and inventory, but will become unsecured upon the achievement of certain credit metrics and/or credit ratings. the line of credit also contains negative and financial covenants customary for a secured facility.
part ii   45
the negative covenants primarily limit our ability to: (1) incur secured debt, (2) make certain investments, (3) execute acquisitions and divestitures, and (4) make restricted payments, including dividends. such limitations currently do not impact our ability to execute our strategic, operating and financial plans, and become less restrictive when the line of credit becomes unsecured as described above.
the line of credit contains two financial covenants: (1) a maximum ratio of debt to ebitda that declines over time to 3.5:1 and (2) a minimum ratio of ebitda to net cash interest expense that increases over time to 3.0:1.
as of december 31, 2014, we were in compliance with all of our long-term debt and line of credit covenants.
as of december 31, 2014, our available borrowing capacity under the line of credit was $446.5 million. utilization of the borrowing capacity was as follows:
§   none was drawn

§   $53.6 million was used to provide support for outstanding standby letters of credit

borrowings under the line of credit bear interest at a rate determined at the time of borrowing equal to the london interbank offered rate (libor) plus a margin ranging from 1.50% to 2.25%, or an alternative rate derived from the lender's prime rate, based on our ratio of debt to ebitda. standby letters of credit issued under the line of credit reduce availability and are charged a fee equal to the margin for libor based borrowings plus 0.175%. as of december 31, 2014, the applicable margin was 1.50%. we also pay a commitment fee on the daily average unused amount of the line of credit. this commitment fee ranges from 0.25% to 0.40% based on our ratio of debt to ebitda. at december 31, 2014, the commitment fee was 0.25%. once the line of credit becomes unsecured, both the libor margin range for borrowings and the commitment fee range will decline.

we occasionally sell shares of common stock to the trustee of our 401(k) retirement plans to satisfy the plan participants' elections to invest in our common stock. under this arrangement, the stock issuances and resulting cash proceeds for the years ended december 31 were:
§   2014 - issued 485.3 thousand shares for cash proceeds of $30.6 million

§   2013 - issued 71.2 thousand shares for cash proceeds of $3.8 million

§   2012 - no shares issued

there were no shares held in treasury as of december 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012. there were 3,411,416 shares remaining under the current purchase authorization of the board of directors as of december 31, 2014.

cash contractual obligations we expect cash requirements for income taxes to be $80.3 million during 2015. we expect capital spending of $250 million during 2015. additionally, we have a number of contracts containing commitments or contingent obligations that are not material to our earnings. these contracts are discrete and it is unlikely that the various contingencies contained within the contracts would be triggered by a common event. excluding future cash requirements for income taxes and capital expenditures, and these immaterial contracts, our obligations to make future contractual payments as of december 31, 2014 are summarized in the table below:

6   the above table excludes liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits in the amount of $7.1 million at december 31, 2014, as we cannot make a reasonably reliable estimate of the amount and period of related future payment of these uncertain tax positions (for more details, see note 9 "income taxes" in item 8 "financial statements and supplementary data").
critical accounting policies we follow certain significant accounting policies when we prepare our consolidated financial statements. a summary of these policies is included in note 1 "summary of significant accounting policies" in item 8 "financial statements and supplementary data."
we prepare these financial statements to conform with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america. these principles require us to make estimates and judgments that affect reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and the related disclosures of contingent assets and contingent liabilities at the date of the financial statements. we base our estimates on historical experience, current conditions and various other assumptions we believe reasonable under existing circumstances and evaluate these estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis. the results of these estimates form the basis for our judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities as well as identifying and assessing the accounting treatment with respect to commitments and contingencies. our actual results may materially differ from these estimates.
part ii   48
we believe the following seven critical accounting policies require the most significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements:
1.    goodwill and goodwill impairment

2.    impairment of long-lived assets excluding goodwill

3.    reclamation costs

4.    pension and other postretirement benefits

5.    environmental compliance

6.    claims and litigation including self-insurance

7.    income taxes

1. goodwill and goodwill impairment goodwill represents the excess of the cost of net assets acquired in business combinations over the fair value of the identifiable tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination. goodwill impairment exists when the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. goodwill is tested for impairment on an annual basis or more frequently whenever events or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount. the impairment evaluation is a critical accounting policy because goodwill is material to our total assets (as of december 31, 2014, goodwill represents 38% of total assets) and the evaluation involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions and considerable management judgment. how we test goodwill for impairment goodwill is tested for impairment one level below our operating segments (reporting unit). we have identified 19 reporting units, of which 9 carry goodwill. we have the option of either assessing qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the carrying value of our reporting units exceeds their respective fair value or proceeding directly to a two-step quantitative test. we elected to perform the quantitative impairment test for all years presented. step 1
we compare the fair value of a reporting unit to its carrying value, including goodwill:
§   if the fair value exceeds its carrying value, the goodwill of the reporting unit is not considered impaired

§   if the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, we go to step two to measure the amount of impairment loss, if any

step 2
we compare the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill. the implied fair value of goodwill is determined by hypothetically allocating the fair value of the reporting unit to its identifiable assets and liabilities in a manner consistent with a business combination, with any excess fair value representing implied goodwill:
§   if the carrying value of the reporting unit goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess

how we determine carrying value and fair value first, we determine the carrying value of each reporting unit by assigning assets and liabilities, including goodwill, to those units as of the measurement date. then, we estimate the fair values of the reporting units using both an income approach (which involves discounting estimated future cash flows) and a market approach (which involves the application of revenue and ebitda multiples of comparable companies). we consider market factors when determining the assumptions and estimates used in our valuation models. finally, to access the reasonableness of the fair values derived from these valuations, we compare the implied fair values to our market capitalization.
part ii   49
our assumptions we base our fair value estimates on market participant assumptions we believe to be reasonable at the time, but such assumptions are subject to inherent uncertainty. actual results may differ from those estimates. changes in key assumptions or management judgment with respect to a reporting unit or its prospects may result from a change in market conditions, market trends, interest rates or other factors outside of our control, or significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results. these conditions could result in a significantly different estimate of the fair value of our reporting units, which could result in an impairment charge in the future.
the significant assumptions in our discounted cash flow models include our estimate of future profitability, capital requirements and the discount rate. the profitability estimates used in the models were derived from internal operating budgets and forecasts for long-term demand and pricing in our industry. estimated capital requirements reflect replacement capital estimated on a per ton basis and acquisition capital necessary to support growth estimated in the models. the discount rate was derived using a capital asset pricing model.
results of our impairment tests the results of our annual impairment tests for:
§   november 1, 2014 indicated that the fair values of all reporting units with goodwill substantially exceeded (by a range of 21% to 630%) their carrying values

§   november 1, 2013 indicated that the fair values of all reporting units with goodwill substantially exceeded (by a range of 32% to 620%) their carrying values

§   november 1, 2012 indicated that the fair values of all reporting units with goodwill substantially exceeded (by a range of 34% to 851%) their carrying values

for additional information regarding goodwill, see note 18 "goodwill and intangible assets" in item 8 "financial statements and supplementary data."
2. impairment of long-lived assets excluding goodwill we evaluate the carrying value of long-lived assets, including intangible assets subject to amortization, when events and circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. the impairment evaluation is a critical accounting policy because long-lived assets are material to our total assets (as of december 31, 2014, net property, plant & equipment represents 38% of total assets, while net other intangible assets represents 9% of total assets) and the evaluation involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions and considerable management judgment. the carrying value of long-lived assets is considered impaired when the estimated undiscounted cash flows from such assets are less than their carrying value. in that event, we recognize a loss equal to the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the long-lived assets.
fair value is estimated primarily by using a discounted cash flow methodology that requires considerable management judgment and long-term assumptions. our estimate of net future cash flows is based on historical experience and assumptions of future trends, which may be different from actual results. we periodically review the appropriateness of the estimated useful lives of our long-lived assets.
we test long-lived assets for impairment at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets. as a result, our long-lived asset impairment test is at a significantly lower level than the level at which we test goodwill for impairment. in markets where we do not produce downstream products (e.g. asphalt mix and ready-mixed concrete), the lowest level of largely independent identifiable cash flows is at the individual aggregates operation or a group of aggregates operations collectively serving a local market. conversely, in vertically integrated markets, the cash flows of our downstream and upstream businesses are not largely independently identifiable as the selling price of the upstream products (aggregates) determines the profitability of the downstream business.
part ii   50
during 2014, we recorded a $3.1 million loss on impairment of long-lived assets related primarily to assets retained in the divestiture of our cement and concrete businesses in the florida area, see note 19 "acquisitions and divestitures" in item 8 "financial statements and supplementary data." we recorded no asset impairments during 2013. during 2012, we recorded a $2.0 million loss on impairment of long-lived assets. this impairment loss related primarily to assets classified as held for sale.
we maintain certain long-lived assets that are not currently being utilized in our operations. these assets totaled $376.4 million at december 31, 2014, representing an approximate 8% increase from december 31, 2013. of the total $376.4 million, approximately 40% relates to real estate held for future development and expansion of our operations. in addition, approximately 25% is comprised of real estate (principally former mining sites) pending development as commercial or residential real estate, reservoirs or landfills. the remaining 35% is composed of aggregates, asphalt mix and ready-mixed concrete operating assets idled temporarily as a result of a decline in demand for our products. we anticipate moving idled assets back into operation as demand recovers. we evaluate the useful lives and the recoverability of these assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that carrying amounts may not be recoverable.
for additional information regarding long-lived assets and intangible assets, see note 4 "property, plant & equipment" and note 18 "goodwill and intangible assets" in item 8 "financial statements and supplementary data."
3. reclamation costs reclamation costs resulting from normal use of long-lived assets are recognized over the period the asset is in use only if there is a legal obligation to incur these costs upon retirement of the assets. additionally, reclamation costs resulting from normal use under a mineral lease are recognized over the lease term only if there is a legal obligation to incur these costs upon expiration of the lease. the obligation, which cannot be reduced by estimated offsetting cash flows, is recorded at fair value as a liability at the obligating event date and is accreted through charges to operating expenses. this fair value is also capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the underlying asset and depreciated over the estimated useful life of the asset. if the obligation is settled for other than the carrying amount of the liability, a gain or loss is recognized on settlement.
reclamation costs are considered a critical accounting policy because of the significant estimates, assumptions and considerable management judgment used to determine the fair value of the obligation and the significant carrying amount of these obligations ($226.6 million as of december 31, 2014 and $228.2 million as of december 31, 2013).
how we determine fair value of the obligation to determine the fair value of the obligation, we estimate the cost for a third party to perform the legally required reclamation tasks including a reasonable profit margin. this cost is then increased for both future estimated inflation and an estimated market risk premium related to the estimated years to settlement. once calculated, this cost is discounted to fair value using present value techniques with a credit-adjusted, risk-free rate commensurate with the estimated years to settlement.
we evaluate current facts and conditions to determine the most likely settlement date. if this evaluation identifies alternative estimated settlement dates, we use a weighted-average settlement date considering the probabilities of each alternative.
we review reclamation obligations at least annually for a revision to the cost or a change in the estimated settlement date. additionally, reclamation obligations are reviewed in the period that a triggering event occurs that would result in either a revision to the cost or a change in the estimated settlement date. examples of events that would trigger a change in the cost include a new reclamation law or amendment of an existing mineral lease. examples of events that would trigger a change in the estimated settlement date include the acquisition of additional reserves or the closure of a facility.

4. pension and other postretirement benefits accounting for pension and postretirement benefits requires that we make significant assumptions regarding the valuation of benefit obligations and the performance of plan assets. each year we review our assumptions about the discount rate, the expected return on plan assets, the rate of compensation increase (for salary-related plans) and the rate of increase in the per capita cost of covered healthcare benefits.
§   discount rate - the discount rate is used in calculating the present value of benefits, which is based on projections of benefit payments to be made in the future

§   expected return on plan assets - we project the future return on plan assets based principally on prior performance and our expectations for future returns for the types of investments held by the plan as well as the expected long-term asset allocation of the plan. these projected returns reduce the recorded net benefit costs

§   rate of compensation increase - for salary-related plans only, we project employees' annual pay increases through 2015, which are used to project employees' pension benefits at retirement

§   rate of increase in the per capita cost of covered healthcare benefits - we project the expected increases in the cost of covered healthcare benefits

how we set our assumptions in selecting the discount rate, we consider fixed-income security yields, specifically high-quality bonds. we also analyze the duration of plan liabilities and the yields for corresponding high-quality bonds. at december 31, 2014, the discount rates for our various plans ranged from 3.50% to 4.30% (december 31, 2013 ranged from 3.80% to 5.15%).
in estimating the expected return on plan assets, we consider past performance and long-term future expectations for the types of investments held by the plan as well as the expected long-term allocation of plan assets to these investments. at december 31, 2014, the expected return on plan assets remained at 7.50%.
in projecting the rate of compensation increase, we consider past experience and future expectations. at december 31, 2014, our projected weighted-average rate of compensation increase was 3.70%, up from 3.50% at december 31, 2013.
in selecting the rate of increase in the per capita cost of covered healthcare benefits, we consider past performance and forecasts of future healthcare cost trends. at december 31, 2014, our assumed rate of increase in the per capita cost of covered healthcare benefits remained at 7.50% for 2014, decreasing each year until reaching 5.0% in 2025 and remaining level thereafter. increases in the per capita cost after 2015 are not expected to increase our obligations related to postretirement medical benefits as a result of a 2012 plan amendment to cap medical coverage cost at the 2015 level.
changes to the assumptions listed above would have an impact on the projected benefit obligations, the accrued other postretirement benefit liabilities, and the annual net periodic pension and other postretirement benefit cost. the following table reflects the favorable and unfavorable outcomes associated with a change in certain assumptions:

as of the december 31, 2014 measurement date, the fair value of our pension plan assets increased from $756.6 million to $817.0 million due to favorable investment returns. no contributions were made to the qualified pension plans in 2014.
during 2015, we expect to recognize net periodic pension expense of approximately $16.5 million and net periodic postretirement expense of approximately $1.0 million compared to $9.2 million and $(2.5) million, respectively, in 2014. the increase in pension expense is primarily due to the nearly 0.8 percentage point (80 basis points) drop in discount rates and the adoption of the new mortality tables issued by the society of actuaries on october 27, 2014. we do not anticipate contributions will be required to the funded pension plans during 2015 and we do not anticipate making a discretionary contribution. we currently do not anticipate that the funded status of any of our plans will fall below statutory thresholds requiring accelerated funding or constraints on benefit levels or plan administration.
for additional information regarding pension and other postretirement benefits, see note 10 "benefit plans" in item 8 "financial statements and supplementary data."
5. environmental compliance our environmental compliance costs include the cost of ongoing monitoring programs, the cost of remediation efforts and other similar costs. our accounting policy for environmental compliance costs is a critical accounting policy because it involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions and requires considerable management judgment. how we account for environmental costs to account for environmental costs, we:
§   expense or capitalize environmental costs consistent with our capitalization policy

§   expense costs for an existing condition caused by past operations that do not contribute to future revenues

§   accrue costs for environmental assessment and remediation efforts when we determine that a liability is probable and we can reasonably estimate the cost

at the early stages of a remediation effort, environmental remediation liabilities are not easily quantified due to the uncertainties of various factors. the range of an estimated remediation liability is defined and redefined as events in the remediation effort occur, but generally liabilities are recognized no later than completion of the remedial feasibility study. when we can estimate a range of probable loss, we accrue the most likely amount. in the event that no amount in the range of probable loss is considered most likely, the minimum loss in the range is accrued. as of december 31, 2014, the difference between the amount accrued and the maximum loss in the range for all sites for which a range can be reasonably estimated was $3.0 million. our environmental remediation obligations are recorded on an undiscounted basis.
accrual amounts may be based on technical cost estimations or the professional judgment of experienced environmental managers. our safety, health and environmental affairs management committee routinely reviews cost estimates and key assumptions in response to new information, such as the kinds and quantities of hazardous substances, available technologies and changes to the parties participating in the remediation efforts. however, a number of factors, including adverse agency rulings and unanticipated conditions as remediation efforts progress, may cause actual results to differ materially from accrued costs.
for additional information regarding environmental compliance costs, see note 8 "accrued environmental remediation costs" in item 8 "financial statements and supplementary data."

6. claims and litigation including self-insurance we are involved with claims and litigation, including items covered under our self-insurance program. we are self-insured for losses related to workers' compensation up to $2.0 million per occurrence and automotive and general/product liability up to $3.0 million per occurrence. we have excess coverage on a per occurrence basis beyond these retention levels.
under our self-insurance program, we aggregate certain claims and litigation costs that are reasonably predictable based on our historical loss experience and accrue losses, including future legal defense costs, based on actuarial studies. certain claims and litigation costs, due to their unique nature, are not included in our actuarial studies. for matters not included in our actuarial studies, legal defense costs are accrued when incurred.
our accounting policy for claims and litigation including self-insurance is a critical accounting policy because it involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions and requires considerable management judgment.
how we assess the probability of loss we use both internal and outside legal counsel to assess the probability of loss, and establish an accrual when the claims and litigation represent a probable loss and the cost can be reasonably estimated. significant judgment is used in determining the timing and amount of the accruals for probable losses, and the actual liability could differ materially from the accrued amounts.
for additional information regarding claims and litigation including self-insurance, see note 1 "summary of significant accounting policies" in item 8 "financial statements and supplementary data" under the caption claims and litigation including self-insurance.
7. income taxes how we determine our current and deferred tax assets and liabilities we file various federal, state and foreign income tax returns, including some returns that are consolidated with subsidiaries. we account for the current and deferred tax effects of such returns using the asset and liability method. significant judgments and estimates are required in determining our current and deferred tax assets and liabilities, which reflect our best assessment of the estimated future taxes we will pay. these estimates are updated throughout the year to consider income tax return filings, our geographic mix of earnings, legislative changes and other relevant items.
we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the differences between the financial statement's carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and the amounts used for income tax purposes. deferred tax assets represent items to be used as a tax deduction or credit in future tax returns. realization of the deferred tax assets ultimately depends on the existence of sufficient taxable income of the appropriate character in either the carryback or carryforward period.
each quarter we analyze the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be realized. a valuation allowance is recorded if, based on the weight of all available positive and negative evidence, it is more likely than not (a likelihood of more than 50%) that some portion, or all, of a deferred tax asset will not be realized. a summary of our deferred tax assets is included in note 9 "income taxes" in item 8 "financial statements and supplementary data."
while we believe that the majority of our deferred tax assets will be realized, our state net operating loss deferred tax asset carryforwards require additional consideration based on the following reasons:
§   the required filing groups in many states are different from the federal filing group

§   certain states have brief expiration periods or other limitations on the utilization of net operating loss carryforwards

§   we no longer file in certain states for which we have net operating loss carryforwards

based on this analysis, we have provided a valuation allowance of $56.9 million, an increase of $10.6 million from the prior year valuation allowance, against our state net operating loss deferred tax asset carryforwards. of the $56.9 million valuation allowance, $55.5 million relates to our alabama net operating loss carryforward. the remaining valuation allowance of $1.4 million relates to other state net operating loss carryforwards.
if we later determine that realization is more likely than not for deferred tax assets with a valuation allowance, the related valuation allowance will be reduced. conversely, if we determine that it is more likely than not that we will not be able to realize a portion of our deferred tax assets, we will increase the valuation allowance.
part ii   54
foreign earnings u.s. income taxes are not provided on foreign earnings when such earnings are indefinitely reinvested offshore. at least annually, we evaluate our investment strategies for each foreign tax jurisdiction in which we operate to determine whether foreign earnings will be indefinitely reinvested offshore. liability for unrecognized tax benefits we recognize a tax benefit associated with a tax position when, in our judgment, it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained based upon the technical merits of the position. for a tax position that meets the more likely than not recognition threshold, we measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that we judge to have a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized. a liability is established for the unrecognized portion of any tax position. our liability for unrecognized tax benefits is adjusted periodically due to changing circumstances, such as the progress of tax audits, case law developments and new or emerging legislation.
the years open to tax examinations vary by jurisdiction. while it is often difficult to predict the final outcome or the timing of resolution of any particular tax matter, we believe our liability for unrecognized tax benefits is appropriate.
we consider a tax position to be resolved at the earlier of the issue being "effectively settled," settlement of an examination, or the expiration of the statute of limitations. upon resolution of a tax position, any liability for unrecognized tax benefits will be released.
our liability for unrecognized tax benefits is generally presented as noncurrent. however, if we anticipate paying cash within one year to settle an uncertain tax position, the liability is presented as current. we classify interest and penalties associated with our liability for unrecognized tax benefits as income tax expense.
statutory depletion our largest permanent item in computing both our taxable income and effective tax rate is the deduction allowed for statutory depletion. the impact of statutory depletion on the effective tax rate is presented in note 9 "income taxes" in item 8 "financial statements and supplementary data." the deduction for statutory depletion does not necessarily change proportionately to changes in pretax earnings. new accounting standards for a discussion of accounting standards recently adopted and pending adoption and the affect such accounting changes will have on our results of operations, financial position or liquidity, see note 1 "summary of significant accounting policies" in item 8 "financial statements and supplementary data" under the caption new accounting standards. forward-looking statements the foregoing discussion and analysis, as well as certain information contained elsewhere in this annual report, contain "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of section 27a of the securities act of 1933, as amended, and section 21e of the securities exchange act of 1934, as amended, and are intended to be covered by the safe harbor created thereby. see the discussion in safe harbor statement under the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 in part i, above.

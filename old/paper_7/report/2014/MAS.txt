item 7.    management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations.
the financial and business analysis below provides information which we believe is relevant to an assessment and understanding of our consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows. this financial and business analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes.
the following discussion and certain other sections of this report contain statements reflecting our views about our future performance and constitute "forward-looking statements" under the private securities litigation reform act of 1995. forward-looking statements can be identified by words such as "believe," "anticipate," "appear," "may," "will," "should," "intend," "plan," "estimate," "expect," "assume," "seek," "forecast" and similar references to future periods. these views involve risks and uncertainties that are difficult to predict and, accordingly, our actual results may differ materially from the results discussed in such forward-looking statements. we caution you against relying on any of these forward-looking statements. in addition to the various factors included in the "executive level overview," "critical accounting policies and estimates" and "outlook for the company" sections, our future performance may be affected by our reliance on new home construction and home improvement, our reliance on key customers, the cost and availability of raw materials, uncertainty in the international economy, shifts in consumer preferences and purchasing practices, our ability to improve our underperforming businesses, our ability to maintain our competitive position in our industries, risks associated with the proposed spin-off of our installation and other services businesses, our ability to realize the expected benefits of the spin-off, the timing and the terms of our share repurchase program, and our ability to reduce corporate expense and simplify our organizational structure. these and other factors are discussed in detail in item 1a "risk factors" of this report. any forward-looking statement made by us speaks only as of the date on which it was made. factors or events that could cause our actual results to differ may emerge from time to time, and it is not possible for us to predict all of them. unless required by law, we undertake no obligation to update publicly any forward-looking statements as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.
executive level overview we manufacture, distribute and install home improvement and building products. these products are sold for home improvement and new home construction through mass merchandisers, hardware stores, home centers, homebuilders, distributors and other outlets for consumers and contractors and direct to the consumer.
2014 results net sales were positively affected by increased new home construction and repair and remodel activity in the u.s. and europe. such increases were partially offset by decreased sales volume in our north american cabinetry business. our results of operations were positively affected by increased sales volume, as well as a more favorable relationship between selling prices and commodity costs, except in paints and stains. our results of operations were negatively affected by increased business rationalization costs and costs associated with our proposed spin-off transaction. most of our business segments also benefited from the business rationalizations and cost savings initiatives we have undertaken over the last several years.
our cabinets and related products segment was negatively affected by lower sales volume of our north american operations, which completely offset a more favorable relationship between selling prices and commodity costs and any increased sales volume by our u.k. cabinet business. our plumbing products segment benefited from increased sales volume of north american and international operations, as well as a more favorable relationship between selling prices and commodity costs. the installation and other services segment benefited from increased new home construction and
19
commercial activity and a more favorable relationship between selling prices and commodity costs. the decorative architectural products segment benefited from increased sales volume of paints and stains and builders' hardware, which was offset by a less favorable relationship between selling prices and commodity costs in paints and stains. our other specialty products segment benefited from a more favorable relationship between selling prices and commodity costs and a more favorable product mix of u.s. and u.k. windows, as well as increased sales volume.
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america ("gaap"). the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of any contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. we regularly review our estimates and assumptions, which are based upon historical experience, as well as current economic conditions and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of certain assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. actual results may differ from these estimates and assumptions.
note a to our consolidated financial statements includes our accounting policies, estimates and methods used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.
we believe that the following critical accounting policies are affected by significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.
revenue recognition and receivables we recognize revenue as title to products and risk of loss is transferred to customers or when services are rendered. we record revenue for unbilled services performed based upon estimates of material and labor incurred in the installation and other services segment; such amounts are recorded in receivables. receivables include unbilled revenue related to the installation and other services segment of $24 million at both december 31, 2014 and 2013. we record estimated reductions to revenue for customer programs and incentive offerings, including special pricing and co-operative advertising arrangements, promotions and other volume-based incentives. we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts receivable for estimated losses resulting from the inability of customers to make required payments. in addition, we monitor our customer receivable balances and the credit worthiness of our customers on an on-going basis.
goodwill and other intangible assets we record the excess of purchase cost over the fair value of net tangible assets of acquired companies as goodwill or other identifiable intangible assets. in the fourth quarter of each year, or as events occur or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount, we complete the impairment testing of goodwill utilizing a discounted cash flow method. we selected the discounted cash flow methodology because we believe that it is comparable to what would be used by other market participants. we have defined our reporting units and completed the impairment testing of goodwill at the operating segment level, as defined by accounting guidance.
determining market values using a discounted cash flow method requires us to make significant estimates and assumptions, including long-term projections of cash flows, market conditions and
20
appropriate discount rates. our judgments are based upon historical experience, current market trends, consultations with external valuation specialists and other information. while we believe that the estimates and assumptions underlying the valuation methodology are reasonable, different estimates and assumptions could result in different outcomes. in estimating future cash flows, we rely on internally generated five-year forecasts for sales and operating profits, including capital expenditures, and generally a one to three percent long-term assumed annual growth rate of cash flows for periods after the five-year forecast. we generally develop these forecasts based upon, among other things, recent sales data for existing products, planned timing of new product launches, estimated housing starts and estimated repair and remodel activity.
in 2014, we utilized estimated housing starts, from independent industry sources, growing from current levels to 1.45 million units in 2019 (terminal growth year) and operating profit margins improving to approximate historical levels for those business units by 2019 (terminal growth year). we utilize our weighted average cost of capital of approximately 9 percent as the basis to determine the discount rate to apply to the estimated future cash flows. our weighted average cost of capital decreased in 2014 primarily due to lower bond rates. in 2014, based upon our assessment of the risks impacting each of our businesses, we applied a risk premium to increase the discount rate to a range of 11.0 percent to 14.0 percent for our reporting units.
if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, we measure the possible goodwill impairment based upon an allocation of the estimate of fair value of the reporting unit to all of the underlying assets and liabilities of the reporting unit, including any previously unrecognized intangible assets (step two analysis). the excess of the fair value of a reporting unit over the amounts assigned to its assets and liabilities is the implied fair value of goodwill. an impairment loss is recognized to the extent that a reporting unit's recorded goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of goodwill.
in the fourth quarter of 2014, we estimated that future discounted cash flows projected for all of our reporting units were greater than the carrying values. accordingly, we did not recognize any impairment charges for goodwill.
a 10 percent decrease in the estimated fair value of our reporting units at december 31, 2014 would not have resulted in any additional analysis of goodwill impairment for any additional reporting unit.
we review our other indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment annually, in the fourth quarter, or as events occur or circumstances change that indicate the assets may be impaired without regard to the business unit. we consider the implications of both external (e.g., market growth, competition and local economic conditions) and internal (e.g., product sales and expected product growth) factors and their potential impact on cash flows related to the intangible asset in both the near- and long-term. in 2014, we recognized an insignificant impairment charge for other indefinite-lived intangible assets.
employee retirement plans effective january 1, 2010, we froze all future benefit accruals under substantially all of our domestic qualified and non-qualified defined-benefit pension plans.
accounting for defined-benefit pension plans involves estimating the cost of benefits to be provided in the future, based upon vested years of service, and attributing those costs over the time period each employee works. we develop our pension costs and obligations from actuarial valuations. inherent in these valuations are key assumptions regarding inflation, expected return on plan assets, mortality rates and discount rates for obligations and expenses. we consider current market conditions, including changes in interest rates, in selecting these assumptions. changes in assumptions used could result in changes to reported pension costs and obligations within our consolidated financial statements.
in december 2014, our discount rate decreased for obligations to an average of 3.80 percent from 4.40 percent. the discount rate for obligations is based upon the expected duration of each defined-
21
benefit pension plan's liabilities matched to the december 31, 2014 towers watson rate link curve. the discount rates we use for our defined-benefit pension plans ranged from 2.00 percent to 4.00 percent, with the most significant portion of the liabilities having a discount rate for obligations of 3.70 percent or higher. the assumed asset return was primarily 7.25 percent, reflecting the expected long-term return on plan assets.
our net underfunded amount for our qualified defined-benefit pension plans, which is the difference between the projected benefit obligation and plan assets, increased to $454 million at december 31, 2014 from $324 million at december 31, 2013. our projected benefit obligation for our unfunded non-qualified defined-benefit pension plans was $190 million at december 31, 2014 compared with $163 million at december 31, 2013.
the increase in the projected benefit obligations was primarily due to lower bond rates and a change to the rp 2014 mortality tables issued by the u.s. society of actuaries, which increased our long-term pension liabilities. our qualified domestic pension plan assets in 2014 had a net gain of 3.6 percent compared to average gains of 9.5 percent for the investorforce defined benefit plan universe.
at december 31, 2014, we reported a net liability of $644 million, of which $190 million was related to our non-qualified, supplemental retirement plans, which are not subject to the funding requirements of the pension protection act of 2006. in accordance with the pension protection act, the adjusted funding target attainment percentage for the various defined-benefit pension plans ranges from 79 percent to 90 percent.
we expect pension expense for our qualified defined-benefit pension plans to be $23 million in 2015 compared with $16 million in 2014. if we assumed that the future return on plan assets was one-half percent lower than the assumed asset return and the discount rate decreased by 50 basis points, the 2015 pension expense would increase by $5 million. we expect pension expense for our non-qualified defined-benefit pension plans to be $10 million in 2015 compared with $9 million in 2014.
we anticipate that we will be required to contribute approximately $55 million to $65 million in 2015 to our qualified and non-qualified defined-benefit plans.
income taxes the accounting guidance for income taxes requires that the future realization of deferred tax assets depends on the existence of sufficient taxable income in future periods. possible sources of taxable income include taxable income in carryback periods, the future reversal of existing taxable temporary differences recorded as a deferred tax liability, tax-planning strategies that generate future income or gains in excess of anticipated losses in the carryforward period and projected future taxable income.
if, based upon all available evidence, both positive and negative, it is more likely than not (more than 50 percent likely) such deferred tax assets will not be realized, a valuation allowance is recorded. significant weight is given to positive and negative evidence that is objectively verifiable. a company's three-year cumulative loss position is significant negative evidence in considering whether deferred tax assets are realizable and the accounting guidance restricts the amount of reliance we can place on projected taxable income to support the recovery of the deferred tax assets.
in 2010, we recorded a $372 million valuation allowance against our u.s. federal deferred tax assets as a non-cash charge to income tax expense. in reaching this conclusion, we considered the weaker retail sales of certain of our building products and the slower than anticipated recovery in the u.s. housing market which led to u.s. operating losses and significant u.s. goodwill impairment charges, that primarily occurred in the fourth quarter of 2010, causing us to be in a three-year cumulative u.s. loss position.
during 2012 and 2011, objective and verifiable negative evidence, such as u.s. operating losses and significant impairment charges for u.s. goodwill in 2011 and other intangible assets, continued to
22
outweigh positive evidence necessary to reduce the valuation allowance. as a result, we recorded increases of $65 million and $87 million in the valuation allowance related to our u.s. federal deferred tax assets as a non-cash charge to income tax expense in 2012 and 2011, respectively.
in the third quarter of 2014, we recorded a $517 million tax benefit from the release of the valuation allowance against our u.s. federal and certain state deferred tax assets due primarily to a return to sustainable profitability in our u.s. operations. in reaching this conclusion, we considered the continued improvement in both the new home construction market and repair and remodel activity in the u.s. and our progress on strategic initiatives to reduce costs and expand our product leadership positions which contributed to the continued improvement in our u.s. operations over the past few years.
in the fourth quarter of 2014, we recorded an additional $12 million tax benefit from the release of the valuation allowances against certain u.k. and mexican deferred tax assets primarily resulting from a return to sustainable profitability in these jurisdictions.
we continue to maintain a valuation allowance on certain state and foreign deferred tax assets as of december 31, 2014. should we determine that we would not be able to realize our remaining deferred tax assets in these jurisdictions in the future, an adjustment to the valuation allowance would be recorded in the period such determination is made. the need to maintain a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets may cause greater volatility in our effective tax rate.
it is reasonably possible that the continued improvements in certain of our businesses located in the u.s. could result in the objective positive evidence necessary to warrant the additional reversal of all or a portion of the valuation allowance, up to approximately $27 million, by the end of 2015.
the current accounting guidance allows the recognition of only those income tax positions that have a greater than 50 percent likelihood of being sustained upon examination by the taxing authorities. we believe that there is an increased potential for volatility in our effective tax rate because this threshold allows changes in the income tax environment and the inherent complexities of income tax law in a substantial number of jurisdictions to affect the computation of our liability for uncertain tax positions to a greater extent.
while we believe we have adequately provided for our uncertain tax positions, amounts asserted by taxing authorities could vary from our liability for uncertain tax positions. accordingly, additional provisions for tax-related matters, including interest and penalties, could be recorded in income tax expense in the period revised estimates are made or the underlying matters are settled or otherwise resolved.
warranty at the time of sale, we accrue a warranty liability for the estimated cost to provide products, parts or services to repair or replace products in satisfaction of warranty obligations. our estimate of costs to service our warranty obligations is based upon the information available and includes a number of factors such as the warranty coverage, the warranty period, historical experience specific to the nature, frequency and average cost to service the claim, along with product manufacturing metrics and industry and demographic trends.
certain factors and related assumptions in determining our warranty liability involve judgments and estimates and are sensitive to changes in the aforementioned factors. we believe that the warranty accrual is appropriate; however, actual claims incurred could differ from the original estimates thereby requiring adjustments to previously established accruals.
23
a majority of our business is at the consumer retail level through home centers and major retailers. a consumer may return a product to a retail outlet that is a warranty return. however, certain retail outlets do not distinguish between warranty and other types of returns when they claim a return deduction from us. our revenue recognition policy takes into account this type of return when recognizing revenue, and deductions are recorded at the time of sale.
litigation we are subject to lawsuits and pending or asserted claims in the ordinary course of our business. liabilities and costs associated with these matters require estimates and judgments based upon our professional knowledge and experience and that of our legal counsel. when estimates of our exposure for lawsuits and pending or asserted claims meet the criteria for recognition under accounting guidance, amounts are recorded as charges to earnings. the ultimate resolution of these exposures may differ due to subsequent developments.
corporate development strategy our business strategy includes expanding our product leadership and implementing lean principles and product process improvements across our business units. going forward, we expect to maintain a balanced growth strategy with emphasis on cash flow, organic growth with smaller acquisitions and growth through new product development.
as part of our strategic planning, we continue to review all of our businesses to determine which businesses may not be core to our long-term growth strategy.
on september 30, 2014, we announced a plan to spin off 100 percent of our installation and other services businesses into an independent, publicly-traded company through a tax-free stock distribution to our shareholders. the transaction is expected to be completed in mid-2015.
liquidity and capital resources historically, we have largely funded our growth through cash provided by our operations, long-term bank debt and the issuance of notes in the financial markets, and by the issuance of our common stock, including issuances for certain mergers and acquisitions. maintaining high levels of liquidity and focusing on cash generation are among our financial strategies.
our total debt as a percent of total capitalization was 75 percent and 81 percent at december 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively.
on march 28, 2013, we entered into a credit agreement (the "credit agreement") with a bank group, with an aggregate commitment of $1.25 billion and a maturity date of march 28, 2018.
the credit agreement contains financial covenants requiring us to maintain (a) a maximum debt to total capitalization ratio, as adjusted for certain items, of 65 percent, and (b) a minimum interest coverage ratio, as adjusted for certain items, equal to or greater than 2.5 to 1.0. the debt to total capitalization ratio allows the add-back, if incurred, of up to the first $250 million of certain non-cash charges, including goodwill and other intangible asset impairment charges, occurring from and after january 1, 2012 that would negatively impact shareholders' equity.
at december 31, 2014, we had additional borrowing capacity, subject to availability, of up to $1.2 billion. alternatively, at december 31, 2014, we could absorb a reduction to shareholders' equity of approximately $747 million and remain in compliance with the debt to total capitalization covenant. we were in compliance with all credit agreement covenants and we had no borrowings under the credit agreement at december 31, 2014.
24
we had cash, cash investments and short-term bank deposits of approximately $1.7 billion at december 31, 2014. our cash and cash investments consist of overnight interest bearing money market demand and time deposit accounts, money market mutual funds containing government securities and treasury obligations. while we attempt to diversify these investments in a prudent manner to minimize risk, it is possible that future changes in the financial markets could affect the security or availability of these investments.
of the $1.7 billion and the $1.5 billion of cash, cash investments and short-term bank deposits we held at december 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively, $672 million and $622 million, respectively, is held in our foreign subsidiaries. if these funds were needed for our operations in the u.s., their repatriation into the u.s. may result in additional u.s. income taxes or foreign withholding taxes. the amount of such taxes is dependent on the income tax laws and circumstances at the time of distribution.
we utilize derivative and hedging instruments to manage our exposure to currency fluctuations, primarily related to the european euro and the u.s. dollar; commodity cost fluctuations, primarily zinc and copper; and interest rate fluctuations, primarily related to debt issuances. we review our hedging program, derivative positions and overall risk management on a regular basis.
in the second quarter of 2014, we increased our quarterly dividend to $.09 per common share from $.075 per common share.
our current ratio was 1.7 to 1 and 2.1 to 1 at december 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. the decrease in the current ratio was due to the short-term classification of $500 million of 4.8% notes due june 2015 at december 31, 2014.
cash flows significant sources and (uses) of cash in the past three years are summarized as follows, in millions:

our working capital days were as follows:

receivable days                                                                                      47            46

accounts payable days                                                                                71            67
working capital (receivables plus inventories, less accounts payable) as a % of net sales          10.7   %      10.6   %
net cash provided by operations of $602 million consisted primarily of net income adjusted for non-cash and certain other items, including depreciation and amortization expense of $167 million, a $406 million net decrease in deferred taxes and other non-cash items, including stock-based compensation expense and amortization expense related to in-store displays. our cash provided by operations was positively affected by increased sales and more effective accounts payable management.
net cash used for financing activities was $297 million, primarily due to $158 million for the repurchase and retirement of company common stock in open market transactions (as part of our strategic initiative to drive shareholder value, and includes 1.7 million shares repurchased to offset the dilutive impact of long-term stock awards granted in 2014), $117 million for cash dividends paid and $34 million for dividends paid to noncontrolling interest.
in september 2014, our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to 50 million shares for retirement of our common stock in open-market transactions or otherwise, replacing the previous board of directors authorization established in 2007. during the fourth quarter of 2014, we repurchased and retired 5 million common shares for cash of $119 million. at december 31, 2014, we had remaining authorization from our board of directors to repurchase up to an additional 45 million shares of our common stock. we expect to repurchase between $400 million and $500 million of our common stock in 2015.
we believe that our present cash balance and cash flows from operations are sufficient to fund our near-term working capital and other investment needs. we believe that our longer-term working capital and other general corporate requirements will be satisfied through cash flows from operations and, to the extent necessary, from bank borrowings and future financial market activities. consistent with past practice, we anticipate repurchasing shares in 2015 as part of our strategic initiative and to offset any dilution from long-term stock awards granted as part of our compensation programs.
net cash used for investing activities was $100 million, and included $128 million for capital expenditures. cash provided by investing activities included primarily $63 million from the net sale of financial investments and $16 million of net proceeds from the disposition of property and equipment. investing activities also include net cash used for the purchase of short-term bank deposits of $20 million.
we continue to invest in our manufacturing operations to increase our productivity, improve customer service and support new product innovation, as well as to invest in our distribution facilities. capital expenditures for 2014 were $128 million, compared with $126 million for 2013 and $119 million for 2012. for 2015, capital expenditures, excluding any potential 2015 acquisitions, are expected to be approximately $190 million. depreciation and amortization expense for 2014 totaled $167 million, compared with $186 million for 2013 and $214 million for 2012, including accelerated depreciation of $1 million, $13 million and $28 million in 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. for 2015, depreciation and amortization expense, excluding any potential 2015 acquisitions, is expected to be approximately $154 million. amortization expense totaled $10 million, $11 million and $12 million in 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively.
26
costs of environmental responsibilities and compliance with existing environmental laws and regulations have not had, nor do we expect them to have, a material effect on our capital expenditures, financial position or results of operations.
consolidated results of operations we report our financial results in accordance with gaap in the united states. however, we believe that certain non-gaap performance measures and ratios, used in managing the business, may provide users of this financial information with additional meaningful comparisons between current results and results in prior periods. non-gaap performance measures and ratios should be viewed in addition to, and not as an alternative for, our reported results.
sales and operations net sales for 2014 were $8.5 billion, which increased four percent compared with 2013. the effect of currency translation and acquisitions was insignificant compared with 2013. the following table reconciles reported net sales to net sales excluding acquisitions and the effect of currency translation, in millions:

business rationalizations and other initiatives over the last several years, we have taken several actions focused on the strategic rationalization of our businesses including business consolidations, plant closures, headcount reductions and other cost savings initiatives. for the years ended december 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, we incurred net pre-tax costs and charges related to these initiatives of $72 million (including $6 million of spin-off transaction costs), $48 million and $75 million, respectively.
we continue to realize the benefits of our business rationalizations and continuous improvement initiatives across our enterprise and expect to identify additional opportunities to improve our business operations. we do not anticipate that any costs and charges related to our ongoing commitment to continuous improvement will be as significant as they have been.
during 2014, our north american cabinet business continued to incur costs and charges of $31 million primarily related to actions taken to sell two previously idled manufacturing facilities. our corporate office incurred $27 million in costs primarily related to severance actions. finally, we incurred $8 million of costs and charges across our business units related to other cost savings initiatives.
on september 30, 2014, we announced a plan to spin off 100 percent of our installation and other services businesses into an independent, publicly-traded company through a tax-free stock distribution to our shareholders. the transaction is expected to be completed in mid-2015. through december 31, 2014, we have incurred $6 million of costs and charges related to this transaction. under generally accepted accounting principles, the installation and other services businesses are included in continuing operations until the transaction is completed.

based on current plans, we anticipate costs and charges related to our business rationalizations and other initiatives to approximate $30 million in 2015. our business rationalization expenses in 2015 include approximately $25 million of costs and charges related to the spin-off transaction. we continue to evaluate our businesses and may implement additional rationalization programs based on changes in our markets which could result in further costs and charges.

other matters commitments and contingencies litigation information regarding our legal proceedings is set forth in note u to the consolidated financial statements, which is incorporated herein by reference.
other commitments with respect to our investments in private equity funds, we had, at december 31, 2014, commitments to contribute up to $9 million of additional capital to such funds, representing our aggregate capital commitment to such funds less capital contributions made to date. we are contractually obligated to make additional capital contributions to these private equity funds upon receipt of a capital call from the private equity fund. we have no control over when or if the capital calls will occur. capital calls are funded in cash and generally result in an increase in the carrying value of our investment in the private equity fund when paid.
we enter into contracts, which include reasonable and customary indemnifications that are standard for the industries in which we operate. such indemnifications include claims made against builders by homeowners for issues relating to our products and workmanship. in conjunction with divestitures and other transactions, we occasionally provide reasonable and customary indemnifications relating to various items, including: the enforceability of trademarks; legal and environmental issues; and provisions for sales returns. we have never had to pay a material amount related to these indemnifications, and we evaluate the probability that amounts may be incurred and we appropriately record an estimated liability when probable.
recently issued accounting pronouncements in may 2014, the financial accounting standards board (fasb) issued a new standard for revenue recognition, accounting standards codification 606 (asc 606). the purpose of asc 606 is to provide a single, comprehensive revenue recognition model for all contracts with customers to improve comparability across industries. asc 606 is effective for us for annual periods beginning january 1, 2017.
36
we are currently evaluating the impact the adoption of this new standard will have on our results of operations.
in april 2014, the fasb issued accounting standards update 2014-8 (asu 2014-8), "reporting of discontinued operations and disclosure of disposals of components of an entity," which changes the criteria for determining which disposals can be presented as discontinued operations and modifies the related disclosure requirements. asu 2014-8 is effective for us beginning january 1, 2015. we do not expect that the adoption will have a significant impact on our financial position or our results of operations.

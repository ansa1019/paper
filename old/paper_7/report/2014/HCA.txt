2014 operations summary net income attributable to hca holdings, inc. totaled $1.875 billion, or $4.16 per diluted share, for 2014, compared to $1.556 billion, or $3.37 per diluted share, for 2013. the 2014 results include net gains on sales of facilities of $29 million, or $0.04 per diluted share, losses on retirement of debt of $335 million, or $0.47 per diluted share, and legal claim costs of $78 million, or $0.11 per diluted share. the 2013 results include net losses on sales of facilities of $10 million, or $0.02 per diluted share, and losses on retirement of debt of $17 million, or $0.02 per diluted share. all per diluted share disclosures are based upon amounts net of the applicable income taxes. shares used for diluted earnings per share were 450.352 million shares and 461.913 million shares for the years ended december 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. during 2014, we repurchased 28.583 million shares of our common stock.
revenues increased to $36.918 billion for 2014 from $34.182 billion for 2013. revenues increased 8.0% and 6.9%, respectively, on a consolidated basis and on a same facility basis for 2014, compared to 2013. the consolidated revenues increase can be primarily attributed to the combined impact of a 3.8% increase in revenue per equivalent admission and a 4.0% increase in equivalent admissions. the same facility revenues increase resulted primarily from a 3.9% increase in same facility revenue per equivalent admission and a 2.9% increase in same facility equivalent admissions.
during 2014, consolidated admissions increased 2.9% and same facility admissions increased 2.1%, compared to 2013. inpatient surgical volumes increased 2.0% on a consolidated basis and increased 1.3% on a same facility basis during 2014, compared to 2013. outpatient surgical volumes increased 1.1% on a consolidated basis and declined 0.1% on a same facility basis during 2014, compared to 2013. emergency room visits increased 6.9% on a consolidated basis and increased 5.8% on a same facility basis during 2014, compared to 2013.
for 2014, the provision for doubtful accounts declined $689 million, compared to 2013. the self-pay revenue deductions for charity care and uninsured discounts increased $278 million and $789 million, respectively, for 2014, compared to 2013. the sum of the provision for doubtful accounts, uninsured discounts and charity care, as a percentage of the sum of revenues, the provision for doubtful accounts, uninsured discounts and charity care, was 30.2% for 2014, compared to 31.3% for 2013. same facility uninsured admissions declined 9.4% and same facility uninsured emergency room visits declined 6.6% for 2014, compared to 2013. we believe these declines were primarily due to previously uninsured patients obtaining medical coverage through the health insurance exchanges and medicaid expansion programs.
interest expense totaled $1.743 billion for 2014, compared to $1.848 billion for 2013. the $105 million decline in interest expense for 2014 was due primarily to a decline in the average interest rate.
cash flows from operating activities increased $768 million, from $3.680 billion for 2013 to $4.448 billion for 2014. the increase in cash flows from operating activities was primarily related to the net impact of an

2014 operations summary (continued)
increase in net income of $377 million, net positive changes in working capital items of $150 million, a net benefit of $357 million related to gains (losses) on sales of facilities, losses on retirement of debt and legal claim costs, and a negative impact of $226 million related to income taxes.
business strategy we are committed to providing the communities we serve with high quality, cost-effective health care while growing our business, increasing our profitability and creating long-term value for our stockholders. to achieve these objectives, we align our efforts around the following growth agenda:
grow our presence in existing markets. we believe we are well positioned in a number of large and growing markets that will allow us the opportunity to generate long-term, attractive growth through the expansion of our presence in these markets. we plan to continue recruiting and strategically collaborating with the physician community and adding attractive service lines such as cardiology, emergency services, oncology and womens services. additional components of our growth strategy include expanding our footprint through developing various outpatient access points, including surgery centers, rural outreach, freestanding emergency departments and walk-in clinics.
achieve industry-leading performance in clinical and satisfaction measures. achieving high levels of patient safety, patient satisfaction and clinical quality are central goals of our business model. to achieve these goals, we have implemented a number of initiatives including infection reduction initiatives, hospitalist programs, advanced health information technology and evidence-based medicine programs. we routinely analyze operational practices from our best-performing hospitals to identify ways to implement organization-wide performance improvements and reduce clinical variation. we believe these initiatives will continue to improve patient care, help us achieve cost efficiencies, grow our revenues and favorably position us in an environment where our constituents are increasingly focused on quality, efficacy and efficiency.
recruit and employ physicians to meet need for high quality health services. we depend on the quality and dedication of the health care providers and other team members who serve at our facilities. we believe a critical component of our growth strategy is our ability to successfully recruit and strategically collaborate with physicians and other professionals to provide high quality care. we attract and retain physicians by providing high quality, convenient facilities with advanced technology, by expanding our specialty services and by building our outpatient operations. we believe our continued investment in the employment, recruitment and retention of physicians will improve the quality of care at our facilities.
continue to leverage our scale and market positions to enhance profitability. we believe there is significant opportunity to continue to grow the profitability of our company by fully leveraging the scale and scope of our franchise. we are currently pursuing next generation performance improvement initiatives such as contracting for services on a multistate basis and expanding our support infrastructure for additional clinical and support functions, such as physician credentialing, medical transcription and electronic medical recordkeeping. we believe our centrally managed business processes and ability to leverage cost-saving practices across our extensive network will enable us to continue to manage costs effectively. we continue to invest in our parallon subsidiary group to leverage key components of our support infrastructure, including revenue cycle management, health care group purchasing, supply chain management and staffing functions and are offering these services to other hospital companies.

hca holdings, inc.
managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (continued)
business strategy (continued)
selectively pursue a disciplined development strategy. we continue to believe there are significant growth opportunities in our markets. we will continue to provide financial and operational resources to analyze and develop our in-market opportunities. to complement our in-market growth agenda, we intend to focus on selectively developing and acquiring new hospitals, outpatient facilities and other health care service providers. we believe the challenges faced by the hospital industry may spur consolidation and we believe our size, scale, national presence and access to capital will position us well to participate in any such consolidation. we have a strong record of successfully acquiring and integrating hospitals and entering into joint ventures and intend to continue leveraging this experience.
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent liabilities and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses. our estimates are based on historical experience and various other assumptions we believe are reasonable under the circumstances. we evaluate our estimates on an ongoing basis and make changes to the estimates and related disclosures as experience develops or new information becomes known. actual results may differ from these estimates.
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.
revenues revenues are recorded during the period the health care services are provided, based upon the estimated amounts due from payers. estimates of contractual allowances under managed care health plans are based upon the payment terms specified in the related contractual agreements. laws and regulations governing the medicare and medicaid programs are complex and subject to interpretation. the estimated reimbursement amounts are made on a payer-specific basis and are recorded based on the best information available regarding managements interpretation of the applicable laws, regulations and contract terms. management continually reviews the contractual estimation process to consider and incorporate updates to laws and regulations and the frequent changes in managed care contractual terms resulting from contract renegotiations and renewals. we have invested significant resources to refine and improve our billing systems and the information system data used to make contractual allowance estimates. we have developed standardized calculation processes and related training programs to improve the utility of our patient accounting systems.
the emergency medical treatment and labor act (emtala) requires any hospital participating in the medicare program to conduct an appropriate medical screening examination of every person who presents to the hospitals emergency room for treatment and, if the individual is suffering from an emergency medical condition, to either stabilize the condition or make an appropriate transfer of the individual to a facility able to handle the condition. the obligation to screen and stabilize emergency medical conditions exists regardless of an individuals ability to pay for treatment. federal and state laws and regulations, including but not limited to emtala, require, and our commitment to providing quality patient care encourages, the provision of services to patients who are financially unable to pay for the health care services they receive. the health reform law requires health plans to reimburse hospitals for emergency services provided to enrollees without prior authorization and without regard to whether a participating provider contract is in place. further, the health reform law contains provisions that seek to decrease the number of uninsured individuals, including
62
hca holdings, inc.

critical accounting policies and estimates (continued)
revenues (continued)
requirements or incentives, most of which became effective on january 1, 2014, for individuals to obtain, and large employers to provide, insurance coverage. these mandates are reducing the financial impact of screening for and stabilizing emergency medical conditions. however, many factors are continuing to develop regarding the impact of the health reform law, including how many previously uninsured individuals will obtain and maintain coverage as a result of the law, the change, if any, in the volume of inpatient and outpatient hospital services that are sought by and provided to previously uninsured individuals and overall changes in the payer mix.
we do not pursue collection of amounts related to patients who meet our guidelines to qualify as charity care; therefore, they are not reported in revenues. patients treated at our hospitals for nonelective care, who have income at or below 200% of the federal poverty level, are eligible for charity care. the federal poverty level is established by the federal government and is based on income and family size. we provide discounts from our gross charges to uninsured patients who do not qualify for medicaid or charity care. after the discounts are applied, we are still unable to collect a significant portion of uninsured patients accounts, and we record significant provisions for doubtful accounts (based upon our historical collection experience) related to uninsured patients in the period the services are provided.
due to the complexities involved in the classification and documentation of health care services authorized and provided, the estimation of revenues earned and the related reimbursement are often subject to interpretations that could result in payments that are different from our estimates. adjustments to estimated medicare and medicaid reimbursement amounts and disproportionate-share funds, which resulted in net increases to revenues, related primarily to cost reports filed during the respective year were $50 million, $41 million and $50 million in 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. the adjustments to estimated reimbursement amounts, which resulted in net increases to revenues, related primarily to cost reports filed during previous years were $53 million, $68 million and $242 million in 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. the 2012 amount related to cost reports filed during previous years includes two adjustments to medicare revenues that affected multiple annual cost report periods for the majority of our hospitals (the rural floor provision settlement increased revenues by approximately $271 million and the implementation of revised supplemental security income ratios reduced revenues by approximately $75 million). excluding the effect of these medicare adjustments, the 2012 amount related to previous years would have been $46 million. we expect adjustments during the next 12 months related to medicare and medicaid cost report filings and settlements will result in increases to revenues generally similar to the amounts recorded during 2014 and 2013.
provision for doubtful accounts and the allowance for doubtful accounts the collection of outstanding receivables from medicare, medicaid, managed care payers, other third-party payers and patients is our primary source of cash and is critical to our operating performance. the primary collection risks relate to uninsured patient accounts, including patient accounts for which the primary insurance carrier has paid the amounts covered by the applicable agreement, but patient responsibility amounts (deductibles and copayments) remain outstanding. the provision for doubtful accounts and the allowance for doubtful accounts relate primarily to amounts due directly from patients. an estimated allowance for doubtful accounts is recorded for all uninsured accounts, regardless of the aging of those accounts. accounts are written off when all reasonable internal and external collection efforts have been performed. our collection policies include a review of all accounts against certain standard collection criteria, upon completion of our primary internal collection efforts. accounts determined to possess positive collectibility attributes are forwarded to a secondary internal or external collection agency and the other accounts are written off. the accounts that are not collected by the

provision for doubtful accounts and the allowance for doubtful accounts (continued)
secondary collection agency are written off when secondary collection efforts are completed (usually within 12 months). writeoffs are based upon specific identification and the writeoff process requires a writeoff adjustment entry to the patient accounting system. we do not pursue collection of amounts related to patients that meet our guidelines to qualify as charity care.
the amount of the provision for doubtful accounts is based upon managements assessment of historical writeoffs and expected net collections, business and economic conditions, trends in federal, state, and private employer health care coverage and other collection indicators. management relies on the results of detailed reviews of historical writeoffs and recoveries at facilities that represent a majority of our revenues and accounts receivable (the hindsight analysis) as a primary source of information in estimating the collectibility of our accounts receivable. we perform the hindsight analysis quarterly, utilizing rolling twelve-months accounts receivable collection and writeoff data. we believe our quarterly updates to the estimated allowance for doubtful accounts at each of our hospital facilities provide reasonable valuations of our accounts receivable. these routine, quarterly changes in estimates have not resulted in material adjustments to our allowance for doubtful accounts, provision for doubtful accounts or period-to-period comparisons of our results of operations. at december 31, 2014 and 2013, the allowance for doubtful accounts represented approximately 91.4%, of the $5.482 billion and 92.6% of the $5.927 billion, respectively, patient due accounts receivable balance. the patient due accounts receivable balance represents the estimated uninsured portion of our accounts receivable. the estimated uninsured portion of medicaid pending and uninsured discount pending accounts is included in our patient due accounts receivable balance.
to quantify the total impact of and trends related to uninsured accounts, we believe it is beneficial to view the revenue deductions related to uninsured accounts (charity care and uninsured discounts) and provision for doubtful accounts in combination, rather than each separately. a summary of these amounts for the years ended december 31, follows (dollars in millions):
2014              2013              2012
charity care                               $3,775            $3,497            $3,093
uninsured discounts                         8,999             8,210             6,978
provision for doubtful accounts             3,169             3,858             3,770
totals                                    $15,943           $15,565           $13,841
the sum of the provision for doubtful accounts, uninsured discounts and charity care, as a percentage of the sum of revenues, the provision for doubtful accounts, uninsured discounts and charity care was 30.2% for 2014, 31.3% for 2013 and 29.5% for 2012. we believe the decline from 2013 to 2014 was primarily due to previously uninsured patients obtaining medical coverage through the health insurance exchanges and medicaid expansion programs.
days revenues in accounts receivable were 54 days, 54 days and 51 days at december 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. management expects a continuation of the challenges related to the collection of the patient due accounts. adverse changes in the percentage of our patients having adequate health care coverage, increases in patient responsibility amounts under certain health care coverages, general economic conditions, patient accounting service center operations, payer mix, or trends in federal, state, and private employer health care coverage could affect the collection of accounts receivable, cash flows and results of operations.

professional liability claims we, along with virtually all health care providers, operate in an environment with professional liability risks. our facilities are insured by our 100% owned insurance subsidiary for losses up to $50 million per occurrence, subject to a $5 million per occurrence self-insured retention (effective january 1, 2015, the self-insure retention increased to $15 million per occurrence). the insurance subsidiary has obtained reinsurance for professional liability risks generally above a retention level of $15 million per occurrence. we purchase excess insurance on a claims-made basis for losses in excess of $50 million per occurrence. provisions for losses related to professional liability risks were $395 million, $314 million and $331 million for the years ended december 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively.
reserves for professional liability risks represent the estimated ultimate cost of all reported and unreported losses incurred through the respective consolidated balance sheet dates. the estimated ultimate cost includes estimates of direct expenses and fees paid to outside counsel and experts, but does not include the general overhead costs of our insurance subsidiary or corporate office. individual case reserves are established based upon the particular circumstances of each reported claim and represent our estimates of the future costs that will be paid on reported claims. case reserves are reduced as claim payments are made and are adjusted upward or downward as our estimates regarding the amounts of future losses are revised. once the case reserves for known claims are determined, information is stratified by loss layers and retentions, accident years, reported years, and geographic location of our hospitals. several actuarial methods are employed to utilize this data to produce estimates of ultimate losses and reserves for incurred but not reported claims, including: paid and incurred extrapolation methods utilizing paid and incurred loss development to estimate ultimate losses; frequency and severity methods utilizing paid and incurred claims development to estimate ultimate average frequency (number of claims) and ultimate average severity (cost per claim); and bornhuetter-ferguson methods which add expected development to actual paid or incurred experience to estimate ultimate losses. these methods use our company-specific historical claims data and other information. company-specific claim reporting and payment data collected over an approximate 20-year period is used in our reserve estimation process. this company-specific
65

critical accounting policies and estimates (continued)
professional liability claims (continued)
data includes information regarding our business, including historical paid losses and loss adjustment expenses, historical and current case loss reserves, actual and projected hospital statistical data, professional liability retentions for each policy year, geographic information and other data.
reserves and provisions for professional liability risks are based upon actuarially determined estimates. the estimated reserve ranges, net of amounts receivable under reinsurance contracts, were $1.229 billion to $1.469 billion at december 31, 2014 and $1.137 billion to $1.359 billion at december 31, 2013. our estimated reserves for professional liability claims may change significantly if future claims differ from expected trends. we perform sensitivity analyses which model the volatility of key actuarial assumptions and monitor our reserves for adequacy relative to all our assumptions in the aggregate. based on our analysis, we believe the estimated professional liability reserve ranges represent the reasonably likely outcomes for ultimate losses. we consider the number and severity of claims to be the most significant assumptions in estimating reserves for professional liabilities. a 2% change in the expected frequency trend could be reasonably likely and would increase the reserve estimate by $21 million or reduce the reserve estimate by $20 million. a 2% change in the expected claim severity trend could be reasonably likely and would increase the reserve estimate by $78 million or reduce the reserve estimate by $72 million. we believe adequate reserves have been recorded for our professional liability claims; however, due to the complexity of the claims, the extended period of time to resolve the claims and the wide range of potential outcomes, our ultimate liability for professional liability claims could change by more than the estimated sensitivity amounts and could change materially from our current estimates.
the reserves for professional liability risks cover approximately 2,700 individual claims and 2,600 individual claims at december 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively, and estimates for unreported potential claims. the time period required to resolve these claims can vary depending upon the jurisdiction and whether the claim is settled or litigated. the average time period between the occurrence and final resolution for our professional liability claims is approximately five years, although the facts and circumstances of each individual claim can result in an occurrence-to-resolution timeframe that varies from this average. the estimation of the timing of payments beyond a year can vary significantly.
reserves for professional liability risks were $1.407 billion and $1.279 billion at december 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. the current portion of these reserves, $329 million and $330 million at december 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively, is included in other accrued expenses. obligations covered by reinsurance and excess insurance contracts are included in the reserves for professional liability risks, as we remain liable to the extent reinsurers and excess insurance carriers do not meet their obligations. reserves for professional liability risks (net of $25 million and $24 million receivable under reinsurance and excess insurance contracts at december 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively) were $1.382 billion and $1.255 billion at december 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. the estimated total net reserves for professional liability risks at december 31, 2014 and 2013 are comprised of $746 million and $710 million, respectively, of case reserves for known claims and $636 million and $545 million, respectively, of reserves for incurred but not reported claims.

income taxes we calculate our provision for income taxes using the asset and liability method, under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized by identifying the temporary differences that arise from the recognition of items in different periods for tax and accounting purposes. deferred tax assets generally represent the tax effects of amounts expensed in our income statement for which tax deductions will be claimed in future periods.
although we believe we have properly reported taxable income and paid taxes in accordance with applicable laws, federal, state or international taxing authorities may challenge our tax positions upon audit. significant judgment is required in determining and assessing the impact of uncertain tax positions. we report a liability for unrecognized tax benefits from uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in our income tax return. during each reporting period, we assess the facts and circumstances related to uncertain tax positions. if the realization of unrecognized tax benefits is deemed probable based upon new facts and circumstances, the estimated liability and the provision for income taxes are reduced in the current period. final audit results may vary from our estimates.
results of operations revenue/volume trends our revenues depend upon inpatient occupancy levels, the ancillary services and therapy programs ordered by physicians and provided to patients, the volume of outpatient procedures and the charge and negotiated payment rates for such services. gross charges typically do not reflect what our facilities are actually paid. our facilities have entered into agreements with third-party payers, including government programs and managed care health plans, under which the facilities are paid based upon the cost of providing services, predetermined rates per diagnosis, fixed per diem rates or discounts from gross charges. we do not pursue collection of amounts related to patients who meet our guidelines to qualify for charity care; therefore, they are not reported in revenues. we provide discounts to uninsured patients who do not qualify for medicaid or charity care.

revenues increased 8.0% to $36.918 billion for 2014 from $34.182 billion for 2013 and increased 3.5% for 2013 from $33.013 billion for 2012. the increase in revenues in 2014 can be primarily attributed to the combined impact of a 3.8% increase in revenue per equivalent admission and a 4.0% increase in equivalent admissions compared to the prior year. the increase in revenues in 2013 can be primarily attributed to the combined impact of a 3.1% increase in revenue per equivalent admission and a 0.4% increase in equivalent admissions compared to 2012. we recorded $142 million of medicaid revenues during the second quarter of 2014 related to the receipt of reimbursements in excess of our estimates for the indigent care component of the texas medicaid waiver program for the program year ended september 30, 2013. we recorded $94 million of medicare revenues during the third quarter of 2014 as the estimated settlement amount for certain claims denied by recovery audit contractor (rac) entities conducting reviews on behalf of cms and pending in the appeals process. cms offered an administrative agreement to providers willing to withdraw their pending appeals in exchange for a timely partial payment (generally, 68% of the claim amount, subject to certain adjustments), which we accepted during 2014. all revenue amounts and revenue-related statistics for the year ended december 31, 2014 include the impact of these two items that resulted in increases to revenues.
same facility revenues increased 6.9% for the year ended december 31, 2014 compared to the year ended december 31, 2013 and increased 3.1% for the year ended december 31, 2013 compared to the year ended december 31, 2012. the 6.9% increase for 2014 can be primarily attributed to the combined impact of a 3.9% increase in same facility revenue per equivalent admission and a 2.9% increase in same facility equivalent admissions. the 3.1% increase for 2013 can be primarily attributed to the combined impact of a 3.0% increase in same facility revenue per equivalent admission and a 0.1% increase in same facility equivalent admissions.
consolidated admissions increased 2.9% in 2014 compared to 2013 and increased 0.2% in 2013 compared to 2012. consolidated inpatient surgeries increased 2.0% and consolidated outpatient surgeries increased 1.1% during 2014 compared to 2013. consolidated inpatient surgeries increased 0.5% and consolidated outpatient surgeries increased 0.9% during 2013 compared to 2012. consolidated emergency room visits increased 6.9% during 2014 compared to 2013 and increased 0.8% during 2013 compared to 2012.
same facility admissions increased 2.1% in 2014 compared to 2013 and increased 0.1% in 2013 compared to 2012. same facility inpatient surgeries increased 1.3% and same facility outpatient surgeries declined 0.1% during 2014 compared to 2013. same facility inpatient surgeries increased 0.3% and same facility outpatient surgeries declined 0.5% during 2013 compared to 2012. same facility emergency room visits increased 5.8% during 2014 compared to 2013 and increased 0.7% during 2013 compared to 2012.
same facility uninsured emergency room visits declined 6.6% and same facility uninsured admissions declined 9.4% during 2014 compared to 2013. we believe these declines were primarily due to previously uninsured patients obtaining medical coverage through the health insurance exchanges and medicaid expansion programs. same facility uninsured emergency room visits increased 2.2% and same facility uninsured admissions increased 7.6% during 2013 compared to 2012.

we believe the decline in inpatient revenues related to the uninsured is primarily due to the combination of increases in discounts provided to the uninsured and previously uninsured patients obtaining medical coverage through the health insurance exchanges and medicaid expansion programs.
at december 31, 2014, we owned and operated 42 hospitals and 31 surgery centers in the state of florida. our florida facilities revenues totaled $8.336 billion, $7.545 billion and $7.336 billion for the years ended december 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. at december 31, 2014, we owned and operated 36 hospitals and 25 surgery centers in the state of texas. our texas facilities revenues totaled $8.706 billion, $8.192 billion and $8.012 billion for the years ended december 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. during 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively, 56%, 55% and 55% of our admissions and 46%, 46% and 47% of our revenues were generated by our florida and texas facilities. uninsured admissions in florida and texas represented 66%, 62% and 61% of our uninsured admissions during 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively.
we receive a significant portion of our revenues from government health programs, principally medicare and medicaid, which are highly regulated and subject to frequent and substantial changes. in 2011, the centers

for medicare and medicaid services (cms) approved a medicaid waiver that allows texas to continue receiving supplemental medicaid reimbursement while expanding its medicaid managed care program. thus, texas is operating pursuant to a waiver program. the texas waiver program includes two primary components: the continuation of an indigent care component and the establishment of a delivery system reform incentive payment (dsrip) component. initiatives under the dsrip program are designed to provide incentive payments to hospitals and other providers for their investments in delivery system reforms that increase access to health care, improve the quality of care and enhance the health of patients and families they serve. we provide indigent care services in several communities in the state of texas, in affiliation with other hospitals. the state of texas has been involved in efforts to increase the indigent care provided by private hospitals. as a result of additional indigent care being provided by private hospitals, public hospital districts or counties in texas have available funds that were previously devoted to indigent care. the public hospital districts or counties are under no contractual or legal obligation to provide such indigent care. the public hospital districts or counties have elected to transfer some portion of these available funds to the states medicaid program. such action is at the sole discretion of the public hospital districts or counties. it is anticipated that these contributions to the state will be matched with federal medicaid funds. the state then may make supplemental payments to hospitals in the state for medicaid services rendered. hospitals receiving medicaid supplemental payments may include those that are providing additional indigent care services. our texas medicaid revenues included $472 million ($81 million dsrip related and $391 million indigent care related), $393 million ($76 million dsrip related and $317 million indigent care related) and $387 million (all indigent care related) during 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively, of medicaid supplemental payments.
in the second quarter of 2014, we recorded $142 million of medicaid revenues related to the receipt of reimbursements in excess of our estimates for the indigent care component of the texas medicaid waiver program for the program year ended september 30, 2013. on october 1, 2014, the texas health and human services commission (thhsc) issued a notice to hospitals participating in the texas medicaid waiver program indicating that a review conducted by cms identified certain local government/hospital affiliations it believes may be inconsistent with the waiver. in addition, cms notified thhsc that it would defer the federal portion of the medicaid payments associated with the affiliations while it completes the review. during the third quarter of 2014, we recorded a reduction of $68 million to medicaid revenues related to the cms review and deferral of the federal portion of the medicaid payments, and we ceased recognizing the estimated medicaid revenues related to certain components of the texas medicaid waiver program. cms announced on january 7, 2015 that the payment deferral has been released, but the review is continuing. during the fourth quarter of 2014, due to the updated information and the receipt of a program payment during december, we reversed the $68 million reduction to medicaid revenues recorded in the third quarter. we continue the nonrecognition of medicaid revenues related to certain components of the texas medicaid waiver program.
in addition, we receive supplemental payments in several other states. we are aware these supplemental payment programs are currently being reviewed by certain state agencies and some states have made waiver requests to the cms to replace their existing supplemental payment programs. it is possible these reviews and waiver requests will result in the restructuring of such supplemental payment programs and could result in the payment programs being reduced or eliminated. because deliberations about these programs are ongoing, we are unable to estimate the financial impact the program structure modifications, if any, may have on our results of operations.

electronic health record incentive payments the american recovery and reinvestment act of 2009 provides for medicare and medicaid incentive payments, beginning in 2011, for eligible hospitals and professionals that adopt and meaningfully use certified electronic health record (ehr) technology. we recognize income related to medicare and medicaid incentive payments using a gain contingency model that is based upon when our eligible hospitals have demonstrated meaningful use of certified ehr technology for the applicable period and the cost report information for the full cost report year that will determine the final calculation of the incentive payment is available.
during 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively, we recognized $125 million, $216 million and $336 million of electronic health record incentive income related to medicare ($118 million, $183 million and $252 million) and medicaid ($7 million, $33 million and $84 million) incentive programs. at december 31, 2014, we have $39 million of deferred ehr incentive income, which represents initial incentive payments received for which ehr incentive income has not been recognized.
we have incurred and will continue to incur both capital costs and operating expenses in order to implement our certified ehr technology and meet meaningful use requirements. these expenses are ongoing and are projected to continue over all stages of implementation of meaningful use. the timing of recognizing the expenses may not correlate with the receipt of the incentive payments and the recognition of incentive income. during 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively, we incurred $112 million, $113 million and $80 million of operating expenses to implement our certified ehr technology and meet meaningful use.
for 2015, we estimate ehr incentive income will be recognized in the range of $40 million to $50 million and that related ehr operating expenses will be in the range of $30 million to $40 million. actual incentive payments and ehr operating expenses could vary from these estimates due to certain factors such as availability of federal funding for both medicare and medicaid incentive payments and our ability to continue to demonstrate meaningful use of certified ehr technology. the failure of our ability to continue to demonstrate meaningful use of ehr technology could have a material, adverse effect on our results of operations.

net income attributable to noncontrolling interests increased from $401 million for 2012 to $440 million for 2013. the increase in net income attributable to noncontrolling interests related primarily to growth in operating results of a hospital joint venture in one of our texas markets.
liquidity and capital resources our primary cash requirements are paying our operating expenses, servicing our debt, capital expenditures on our existing properties, acquisitions of hospitals and other health care entities, repurchases of our common stock, distributions to stockholders and distributions to noncontrolling interests. our primary cash sources are cash flows from operating activities, issuances of debt and equity securities and dispositions of hospitals and other health care entities.
cash provided by operating activities totaled $4.448 billion in 2014 compared to $3.680 billion in 2013 and $4.175 billion in 2012. working capital totaled $3.450 billion at december 31, 2014 and $2.342 billion at december 31, 2013. the $768 million increase in cash provided by operating activities for 2014, compared to 2013, was primarily related to the net impact of an increase in net income of $377 million, net positive changes in working capital items of $150 million, a net benefit of $357 million related to gains (losses) on sales of facilities, losses on retirement of debt and legal claim costs, and a negative impact of $226 million related to income taxes. the $495 million decline in cash provided by operating activities for 2013, compared to 2012, was primarily related to net negative changes in working capital items of $521 million. cash payments for interest and income taxes increased $289 million for 2014 compared to 2013 and increased $185 million for 2013 compared to 2012.
cash used in investing activities was $2.918 billion, $2.346 billion and $2.063 billion in 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. excluding acquisitions, capital expenditures were $2.176 billion in 2014, $1.943 billion in 2013 and $1.862 billion in 2012. we expended $766 million, $481 million and $258 million for acquisitions of hospitals and health care entities during 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. planned capital expenditures are expected to approximate $2.4 billion in 2015. at december 31, 2014, there were projects under construction which had an estimated additional cost to complete and equip over the next five years of approximately $1.9 billion. we expect to finance capital expenditures with internally generated and borrowed funds.
during 2014, we received cash of $51 million from sales of real estate and other investments. we also expended cash of $37 million related to net changes in our investments. during 2013, we received cash of $33 million from sales of a hospital, real estate and other investments. we also received net cash proceeds of $36 million related to net changes in our investments. during 2012, we received cash of $30 million from sales of real estate and other investments. we also received net cash proceeds of $16 million related to net changes in our investments.

income tax benefits of $134 million, $113 million and $174 million, respectively, for certain items (primarily the cash distributions to holders of our stock options and exercises of stock options) that were deductible expenses for tax purposes, but were recognized as adjustments to stockholders deficit for financial reporting purposes. we, or our affiliates, may in the future repurchase portions of our debt or equity securities, subject to certain limitations, from time to time in either the open market or through privately negotiated transactions, in accordance with applicable sec and other legal requirements. the timing, prices, and sizes of purchases depend upon prevailing trading prices, general economic and market conditions, and other factors, including applicable securities laws. funds for the repurchase of debt or equity securities have, and are expected to, come primarily from cash generated from operations and borrowed funds.
in addition to cash flows from operations, available sources of capital include amounts available under our senior secured credit facilities ($2.112 billion as of december 31, 2014 and $2.488 billion as of january 31, 2015) and anticipated access to public and private debt and equity markets. these amounts reflect the october 2014 amendment to our senior secured asset-based revolving credit facility, which increased the revolving credit commitments by $750 million.
during 2012, our board of directors declared three distributions to our stockholders and holders of certain vested share-based awards. the distributions totaled $6.50 per share and vested share-based award, or $3.142 billion in the aggregate. there were no distributions declared during 2014 or 2013.
investments of our professional liability insurance subsidiaries, to maintain statutory equity and pay claims, totaled $558 million and $510 million at december 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. the insurance subsidiary maintained net reserves for professional liability risks of $347 million and $315 million at december 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. our facilities are insured by our 100% owned insurance subsidiary for losses up to $50 million per occurrence; however, this coverage is subject to a $5 million per occurrence self-insured retention (effective january 1, 2015, this coverage is subject to a $15 million per occurrence self-insured retention). net reserves for the self-insured professional liability risks retained were $1.035 billion and $940 million at december 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. claims payments, net of reinsurance recoveries, during the next 12 months are expected to approximate $317 million. we estimate that approximately $253 million of the expected net claim payments during the next 12 months will relate to claims subject to the self-insured retention.

during january 2015, we issued $1.000 billion aggregate principal amount of notes 5.375% senior notes due 2025. we used a portion of the net proceeds to repay at maturity our $750 million aggregate principal amount of 6.375% senior notes due 2015.
management believes that cash flows from operations, amounts available under our senior secured credit facilities and our anticipated access to public and private debt markets will be sufficient to meet expected liquidity needs during the next twelve months.

(a)                                                  we have not included obligations to pay net estimated professional liability claims ($1.382 billion at december 31, 2014, including net reserves of
$347 million relating to the 100% owned insurance subsidiary) in this table. the estimated professional liability claims, which occurred prior to 2007, are expected to be funded by the designated investment securities that are restricted for this purpose ($558 million at december 31, 2014). we also have not included obligations related to unrecognized tax benefits of $548 million at december 31, 2014, as we cannot reasonably estimate the timing or amounts of cash payments, if any, at this time.

(b)   estimates of interest payments assume that interest rates and borrowing spreads at december 31, 2014, remain constant during the period presented.

(c)   amounts relate to future operating lease obligations, purchase obligations and other obligations and are not recorded in our consolidated balance sheet. amounts also include physician commitments that are recorded in our consolidated balance sheet.

(d)                                               amounts relate primarily to instances in which we have agreed to indemnify various commercial insurers who have provided surety bonds to cover self-insured workers compensation claims, utility and construction deposits and damages for malpractice cases which were awarded to plaintiffs by the courts. these cases are currently under appeal and the bonds will not be released by the courts until the cases are closed.

(e)   amounts relate primarily to various insurance programs and employee benefit plan obligations for which we have letters of credit outstanding.

(f)                                           in consideration for physicians relocating to the communities in which our hospitals are located and agreeing to engage in private practice for the benefit of the respective communities, we make advances to physicians, normally over a period of one year, to assist in establishing the physicians practices. the actual amount of these commitments to be advanced often depends upon the financial results of the physicians private practice during the recruitment agreement payment period. the physician commitments reflected were based on our maximum exposure on effective agreements at december 31, 2014.

market risk we are exposed to market risk related to changes in market values of securities. the investments in debt and equity securities of our 100% owned insurance subsidiaries were $555 million and $3 million, respectively, at december 31, 2014. these investments are carried at fair value, with changes in unrealized gains and losses being recorded as adjustments to other comprehensive income. at december 31, 2014, we had a net unrealized gain of $19 million on the insurance subsidiaries investment securities.
we are exposed to market risk related to market illiquidity. investments in debt and equity securities of our 100% owned insurance subsidiaries could be impaired by the inability to access the capital markets. should the 100% owned insurance subsidiaries require significant amounts of cash in excess of normal cash requirements to pay claims and other expenses on short notice, we may have difficulty selling these investments in a timely manner or be forced to sell them at a price less than what we might otherwise have been able to in a normal market environment. we may be required to recognize other-than-temporary impairments on our investment securities in future periods should issuers default on interest payments or should the fair market valuations of the securities deteriorate due to ratings downgrades or other issue-specific factors.
we are also exposed to market risk related to changes in interest rates, and we periodically enter into interest rate swap agreements to manage our exposure to these fluctuations. our interest rate swap agreements involve the exchange of fixed and variable rate interest payments between two parties, based on common notional principal amounts and maturity dates. the notional amounts of the swap agreements represent balances used to calculate the exchange of cash flows and are not our assets or liabilities. our credit risk related to these agreements is considered low because the swap agreements are with creditworthy financial institutions. the interest payments under these agreements are settled on a net basis. these derivatives have been recognized in the financial statements at their respective fair values. changes in the fair value of these derivatives, which are designated as cash flow hedges, are included in other comprehensive income.
with respect to our interest-bearing liabilities, approximately $4.399 billion of long-term debt at december 31, 2014 was subject to variable rates of interest, while the remaining balance in long-term debt of $25.246 billion at december 31, 2014 was subject to fixed rates of interest. both the general level of interest rates and, for the senior secured credit facilities, our leverage affect our variable interest rates. our variable debt is comprised primarily of amounts outstanding under the senior secured credit facilities. borrowings under the senior secured credit facilities bear interest at a rate equal to an applicable margin plus, at our option, either (a) a base rate determined by reference to the higher of (1) the federal funds rate plus 0.50% and (2) the prime rate of bank of america or (b) a libor rate for the currency of such borrowing for the relevant interest period. the applicable margin for borrowings under the senior secured credit facilities may fluctuate according to a leverage ratio. the average effective interest rate for our long-term debt declined from 6.5% for 2013 to 6.1% for 2014.
the estimated fair value of our total long-term debt was $30.861 billion at december 31, 2014. the estimates of fair value are based upon the quoted market prices for the same or similar issues of long-term debt with the same maturities. based on a hypothetical 1% increase in interest rates, the potential annualized reduction to future pretax earnings would be approximately $44 million. to mitigate the impact of fluctuations in interest rates, we generally target a portion of our debt portfolio to be maintained at fixed rates.
our international operations and the related market risks associated with foreign currencies are currently insignificant to our results of operations and financial position.

financial instruments derivative financial instruments are employed to manage risks, including interest rate exposures, and are not used for trading or speculative purposes. we recognize derivative instruments, such as interest rate swap agreements, in the consolidated balance sheets at fair value. changes in the fair value of derivatives are recognized periodically either in earnings or in stockholders equity, as a component of other comprehensive income, depending on whether the derivative financial instrument qualifies for hedge accounting, and if so, whether it qualifies as a fair value hedge or a cash flow hedge. gains and losses on derivatives designated as cash flow hedges, to the extent they are effective, are recorded in other comprehensive income, and subsequently reclassified to earnings to offset the impact of the hedged items when they occur.
the net interest paid or received on interest rate swaps is recognized as interest expense. gains and losses resulting from the early termination of interest rate swap agreements are deferred and amortized as adjustments to expense over the remaining period of the debt originally covered by the terminated swap.
effects of inflation and changing prices various federal, state and local laws have been enacted that, in certain cases, limit our ability to increase prices. revenues for general, acute care hospital services rendered to medicare patients are established under the federal governments prospective payment system. total fee-for-service medicare revenues were 22.6%, 23.3% and 25.1% of our revenues for 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively.
management believes hospital industry operating margins have been, and may continue to be, under significant pressure because of changes in payer and service mix and growth in operating expenses in excess of the increase in prospective payments under the medicare program. in addition, as a result of increasing regulatory and competitive pressures, our ability to maintain operating margins through price increases to non-medicare patients is limited.
tax examinations the irs examination division began an audit of hca holdings, inc.s 2011 and 2012 federal income tax returns during 2014. we are also subject to examination by state and foreign taxing authorities.
management believes hca holdings, inc., its predecessors and affiliates properly reported taxable income and paid taxes in accordance with applicable laws and agreements established with the irs, state and foreign taxing authorities and final resolution of any disputes will not have a material, adverse effect on our results of operations or financial position. however, if payments due upon final resolution of any issues exceed our recorded estimates, such resolutions could have a material, adverse effect on our results of operations or financial position.

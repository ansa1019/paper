item 7.   management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we provide replacement parts, components and systems used in the repair and maintenance of vehicles, as well as specialty vehicle products and accessories.
buyers of vehicle replacement products have the option to purchase from primarily five sources: new products produced by original equipment manufacturers ("oems"), which are commonly known as oem products; new products produced by companies other than the oems, which are sometimes referred to as aftermarket products; recycled products obtained from salvage vehicles; used products that have been refurbished; and used products that have been remanufactured. we distribute a variety of products to collision and mechanical repair shops, including aftermarket collision and mechanical products, recycled collision and mechanical products, refurbished collision products such as wheels, bumper covers and lights, and remanufactured engines. collectively, we refer to these products as alternative parts because they are not new oem products.
we are the nation's largest provider of alternative vehicle collision replacement products and a leading provider of alternative vehicle mechanical replacement products, with our sales, processing, and distribution facilities reaching most major markets in the united states and canada. we are also a leading provider of alternative vehicle replacement and maintenance products in the united kingdom and the benelux region of continental europe. in addition to our wholesale operations, we operate heavy truck facilities and self service retail facilities across the u.s. that sell recycled automotive products from end-of-life-vehicles. in 2014, we expanded our product offering to include specialty vehicle aftermarket equipment and accessories through the acquisition of keystone specialty.
we are organized into four operating segments: wholesale - north america; wholesale - europe; self service; and specialty. we aggregate our north american operating segments (wholesale - north america and self service) into one reportable segment, resulting in three reportable segments: north america, europe and specialty.
our revenue, cost of goods sold, and operating results have fluctuated on a quarterly and annual basis in the past and can be expected to continue to fluctuate in the future as a result of a number of factors, some of which are beyond our control. factors that may affect our operating results include, but are not limited to, those listed in the special note on forward-looking statements in part i, item 1 of this annual report on form 10-k. accordingly, our historical results of operations may not be indicative of future performance.
acquisitions and investments since our inception in 1998, we have pursued a growth strategy through both organic growth and acquisitions. we have pursued acquisitions that we believe will help drive profitability, cash flow and stockholder value. our principal focus for acquisitions is companies that are market leaders, will expand our geographic presence and enhance our ability to provide a wide array of automotive products to our customers through our distribution network.
on january 3, 2014, we completed our acquisition of keystone specialty. keystone specialty is a leading distributor and marketer of specialty vehicle aftermarket equipment and accessories in north america serving the following six product segments: truck and off-road; speed and performance; recreational vehicle; towing; wheels, tires and performance handling; and miscellaneous accessories. our acquisition of keystone specialty allows us to enter into new product lines and increase the size of our addressable market. in addition, we believe that the acquisition creates logistics and administrative cost synergies and potential cross-selling opportunities.
in addition to our acquisition of keystone specialty, we made 22 acquisitions during 2014, including 9 wholesale businesses in north america, 9 wholesale businesses in europe, 2 self service retail operations, and 2 specialty vehicle aftermarket businesses. our european acquisitions included seven aftermarket parts distribution businesses in the netherlands, five of which were customers of and distributors for our netherlands subsidiary, sator. in the netherlands, we are currently converting our existing distribution model to better align with that of our u.k. operations. this realignment will allow us to sell directly to the end repair shop customer versus through a local wholesale distributor, which we expect to improve margins, customer service, and fulfillment rates, and position us well to introduce additional product categories, such as collision and specialty vehicle, in the long term. our other acquisitions completed during the year ended december 31, 2014 enabled us to expand into new product lines and enter new markets.
during the year ended december 31, 2013, we completed 20 acquisitions, including our may 2013 acquisition of sator, a vehicle mechanical aftermarket parts distribution company based in the netherlands, with operations in the netherlands, belgium and northern france. with the acquisition of sator, we expanded our geographic presence in the european vehicle mechanical aftermarket products market into continental europe to complement our existing u.k. operations.
36
in addition to our acquisition of sator, we acquired 10 wholesale businesses in north america, 7 wholesale businesses in europe and 2 self service operations. our european acquisitions included five automotive paint distribution businesses in the u.k., which enabled us to expand our collision product offerings. the other acquisitions completed during 2013 enabled us to expand into new product lines and enter new markets.
in august 2013, we entered into an agreement with suncorp group, a leading general insurance group in australia and new zealand, to develop an alternative vehicle replacement parts business in those countries. we are contributing our experience to help establish automotive parts recycling operations and to facilitate the procurement of aftermarket parts, while suncorp is supplying salvage vehicles to the venture as well as assisting in establishing relationships with repair shops as customers. our investment expanded our geographic presence into australia and new zealand and provides the opportunity to establish a leadership position in the supply of alternative parts in those countries.
during the year ended december 31, 2012, we made 30 acquisitions in north america, including 22 wholesale businesses and 8 self service retail operations. these acquisitions enabled us to expand our geographic presence and to enter new markets. additionally, two of our acquisitions were completed with a goal of improving the recovery from scrap and other metals harvested from the vehicles we purchase: a precious metals refining and reclamation business and a scrap metal shredder.
sources of revenue we report our revenue in two categories: (i) parts and services and (ii) other. our parts and services revenue is generated from the sale of vehicle products and related services including (i) aftermarket, other new and refurbished products and (ii) recycled, remanufactured and related products and services. for the year ended december 31, 2014, parts and services revenue represented approximately 90% of our consolidated revenue.
the majority of our parts and services revenue is generated from the sale of vehicle replacement products to collision and mechanical repair shops. our vehicle replacement products include sheet metal crash parts such as doors, hoods, and fenders; bumper covers; engines; head and tail lamps; and wheels. the demand for these products is influenced by several factors, including the number of vehicles in operation, the number of miles being driven, the frequency and severity of vehicle accidents, the age profile of vehicles in accidents, the availability and pricing of new oem parts, seasonal weather patterns and local weather conditions. additionally, automobile insurers exert significant influence over collision repair shops as to how an insured vehicle is repaired and the cost level of the products used in the repair process. accordingly, we consider automobile insurers to be key demand drivers of our vehicle replacement products. while they are not our direct customers, we do provide insurance carriers services in an effort to promote the increased usage of alternative replacement products in the repair process. such services include the review of vehicle repair order estimates, direct quotation services to insurance company adjusters and an aftermarket parts quality and service assurance program. we neither charge a fee to the insurance carriers for these services nor adjust our pricing of products for our customers when we perform these services for insurance carriers. there is no standard price for many of our vehicle replacement products, but rather a pricing structure that varies from day to day based upon such factors as product availability, quality, demand, new oem product prices, the age and mileage of the vehicle from which the part was obtained, competitor pricing and our product cost.
with our january 3, 2014 acquisition of keystone specialty, our revenue from aftermarket, other new and refurbished products also includes revenue generated from the sale of specialty aftermarket vehicle equipment and accessories. these products are primarily sold to a large customer base of specialty vehicle retailers and equipment installers, including mostly independent, single-site operators. specialty vehicle aftermarket products are typically installed on vehicles within the first year of ownership to enhance functionality, performance or aesthetics. as a result, the demand for these products is influenced by new and used vehicle sales and the overall economic health of vehicle owners, which may be affected by general business conditions, interest rates, inflation, consumer debt levels and other matters that influence consumer confidence and spending. the prices for our specialty vehicle products are based on manufacturers' suggested retail prices, with discounts applied based on prevailing market conditions, customer volumes and promotions that we may offer from time to time.
for the year ended december 31, 2014, revenue from other sources represented approximately 10% of our consolidated sales. these other sources include scrap sales and sales of aluminum ingots and sows. we derive scrap metal from several sources, including vehicles that have been used in both our wholesale and self service recycling operations and from oems and other entities that contract with us for secure disposal of "crush only" vehicles. other revenue will vary from period to period based on fluctuations in commodity prices and the volume of materials sold.
37
cost of goods sold our cost of goods sold for aftermarket products includes the price we pay for the parts, freight, and overhead costs related to the purchasing, warehousing and distribution of our inventory, including labor, facility and equipment costs and depreciation. our aftermarket products are acquired from a number of vendors. our cost of goods sold for refurbished products includes the price we pay for cores, freight, and costs to refurbish the parts, including direct and indirect labor, facility and equipment costs, depreciation and other overhead related to our refurbishing operations.
our cost of goods sold for recycled products includes the price we pay for the salvage vehicle and, where applicable, auction, towing and storage fees. prices for salvage vehicles may be impacted by a variety of factors, including the number of buyers competing to purchase the vehicles, the demand and pricing trends for used vehicles, the number of vehicles designated as "total losses" by insurance companies, the production level of new vehicles (which provides the source from which salvage vehicles ultimately come), the age of vehicles at auction and the status of laws regulating bidders or exporters of salvage vehicles. from time to time, we may also adjust our buying strategy to target vehicles with different attributes (for example, age, level of damage, revenue potential). due to changes relating to these factors, we have seen the prices we pay for salvage vehicles fluctuate over time. our cost of goods sold also includes labor and other costs we incur to acquire and dismantle such vehicles. our labor and labor-related costs related to acquisition and dismantling generally account for between 8% and 10% of our cost of goods sold for vehicles we dismantle. the acquisition and dismantling of salvage vehicles is a manual process and, as a result, energy costs are not material. our cost of goods sold for remanufactured products includes the price we pay for cores; freight; and costs to remanufacture the products, including direct and indirect labor, facility and equipment costs, depreciation and other overhead related to our remanufacturing operations.
some of our salvage mechanical products are sold with a standard six-month warranty against defects. additionally, some of our remanufactured engines are sold with a standard three-year warranty against defects. we also provide a limited lifetime warranty for certain of our aftermarket products that is supported by certain of the suppliers of those products. we record the estimated warranty costs at the time of sale using historical warranty claims information to project future warranty claims activity and related expenses.
other revenue is primarily generated from the hulks and unusable parts of the vehicles we acquire for our wholesale and self service recycled product operations, and therefore, the costs of these sales include the proportionate share of the price we pay for the salvage vehicles as well as the applicable auction, storage and towing fees and internal costs to purchase and dismantle the vehicles. our cost of goods sold for other revenue will fluctuate based on the prices paid for salvage vehicles, which may be impacted by a variety of factors as discussed above.
expenses our facility and warehouse expenses primarily include our costs to operate our aftermarket selling warehouses, salvage yards and self service retail facilities. these costs include personnel expenses such as wages, incentive compensation and employee benefits for plant management and facility and warehouse personnel, as well as rent for our facilities and related utilities, property taxes, repairs and maintenance. the costs included in facility and warehouse expenses do not relate to inventory processing or conversion activities and, as such, are classified below the gross margin line on our consolidated statements of income.
our distribution expenses primarily include our costs to prepare and deliver our products to our customers. included in our distribution expense category are personnel costs such as wages, employee benefits and incentive compensation for drivers; third party freight costs; fuel; and expenses related to our delivery and transfer trucks, including vehicle leases, repairs and maintenance and insurance.
our selling and marketing expenses primarily include salary, commission and other incentive compensation expenses for sales personnel; advertising, promotion and marketing costs; credit card fees; telephone and other communication expenses; and bad debt expense. personnel costs generally account for between 75% and 80% of our selling and marketing expenses. most of our sales personnel are paid on a commission basis. the number and quality of our sales force is critical to our ability to respond to our customers' needs and increase our sales volume. our objective is to continually evaluate our sales force, develop and implement training programs, and utilize appropriate measurements to assess our selling effectiveness.
our general and administrative expenses primarily include the costs of our corporate offices and field support center, which provide management, treasury, accounting, legal, payroll, business development, human resources and information systems functions. general and administrative expenses include wages, benefits, stock-based compensation and other incentive compensation for corporate, regional and administrative personnel; information systems support and maintenance expenses; and accounting, legal and other professional fees.
38
seasonality our operating results are subject to quarterly variations based on a variety of factors, influenced primarily by seasonal changes in weather patterns. during the winter months, we tend to have higher demand for our vehicle replacement products because there are more weather related accidents, which generate repairs. we expect our specialty vehicle operations to generate greater revenue and earnings in the first half of the year, when vehicle owners tend to install specialty products.
critical accounting policies and estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states. the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates, assumptions, and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. on an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates, assumptions, and judgments, including those related to revenue recognition, inventory valuation, business combinations, and goodwill impairment. we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances. the results of these estimates form the basis for our judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities and our recognition of revenue. actual results may differ from these estimates.
revenue recognition we recognize and report revenue from the sale of vehicle products when they are shipped to or picked up by the customers and title has transferred, subject to an allowance for estimated returns, discounts and allowances that management estimates based upon historical information. a product would ordinarily be returned within a few days of shipment. our customers may earn discounts based upon sales volumes or sales volumes coupled with prompt payment. allowances are normally given within a few days following product shipment. we analyze historical returns and allowances activity by comparing the items to the original invoice amounts and dates. we use this information to project future returns and allowances on products sold. if actual returns and allowances are higher than our historical experience, there would be an adverse impact on our operating results in the period of occurrence.
we recognize revenue from the sale of scrap metal, other metals, and cores when title has transferred, which typically occurs upon delivery to the customer.
inventory accounting aftermarket and refurbished product inventory. our aftermarket inventory cost is established based on the average price we pay for parts, and includes expenses incurred for freight and overhead costs. for items purchased from foreign companies, import fees and duties and transportation insurance are also included. refurbished inventory cost is based on the average price we pay for cores, and also includes expenses incurred for freight, labor and other overhead related to our refurbishing operations.
salvage and remanufactured inventory. our salvage inventory cost is established based upon the price we pay for a vehicle, including auction, towing and storage fees, as well as expenditures for buying and dismantling vehicles. inventory carrying value is determined using the average cost to sales percentage at each of our facilities and applying that percentage to the facility's inventory at expected selling prices, the assessment of which incorporates the sales probability based on a part's days in stock and historical demand. the average cost to sales percentage is derived from each facility's historical profitability for salvage vehicles. remanufactured inventory cost is based upon the price paid for cores, and also includes expenses incurred for freight, direct manufacturing costs and overhead related to our remanufacturing operations.
all inventory is recorded at the lower of cost or market. the carrying value of our inventory includes a provision for excess and obsolete inventory, which we calculate based on a detailed review of current inventory on hand, historical sales experience, and anticipated demand. the carrying value is adjusted downward when anticipated demand is less than inventory on hand, inventories have become obsolete or inventory costs are in excess of net realizable value.
business combinations we record our acquisitions under the acquisition method of accounting, under which the acquisition purchase price is allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based upon their respective fair values. we utilize management estimates and, in some instances, independent third-party valuation firms to assist in determining the fair values of assets acquired, liabilities assumed and contingent consideration granted. such estimates and valuations require us to make significant assumptions, including projections of future events and operating performance. the purchase price allocation is subject to change during the measurement period, which is limited to one year subsequent to the acquisition date.
39
goodwill impairment we are required to test our goodwill for impairment at least annually. when testing goodwill for impairment, we are required to evaluate events and circumstances that may affect the performance of the reporting unit and the extent to which the events and circumstances may impact the future cash flows of the reporting unit to determine whether the fair value of the assets exceed the carrying value. if these assumptions or estimates change in the future, we may be required to record impairment charges for these assets. in response to changes in industry and market conditions, we may be required to strategically realign our resources and consider restructuring, disposing of, or otherwise exiting businesses, which could result in an impairment of goodwill.
we are organized into four operating segments: wholesale-north america; wholesale-europe; self service; and specialty. we have also concluded that these four operating segments are reporting units for purposes of goodwill impairment testing in 2014. we perform goodwill impairment tests annually in the fourth quarter and between annual tests whenever events indicate that an impairment may exist. during 2014, we did not identify any events or changes in circumstances that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of our reporting units below their carrying amounts. therefore, we did not perform any impairment tests other than our annual test in the fourth quarter of 2014.
our goodwill would be considered impaired if the net book value of a reporting unit exceeded its estimated fair value. the fair value estimates are established using weightings of the results of a discounted cash flow methodology and a comparative market multiples approach. we believe that using two methods to determine fair value limits the chances of an unrepresentative valuation. as of december 31, 2014, we had a total of $2.3 billion in goodwill subject to future impairment tests. if we were required to recognize goodwill impairments, we would report those impairment losses as part of our operating results. we determined that no adjustments were necessary when we performed our annual impairment testing in the fourth quarter of 2014. a 10% decrease in the fair value estimates of the reporting units in the annual impairment test would not have changed this determination.

refer to the discussion of our segment results of operations for factors contributing to revenue growth during 2014 compared to the prior year.
cost of goods sold. our cost of goods sold increased to 60.7% of revenue in 2014 from 59.0% of revenue in 2013. the increase in cost of goods sold was primarily the result of lower margins generated by certain of our acquired businesses, which increased cost of goods sold by 2.0% of revenue. our keystone specialty business operates a three step distribution model, which generates lower gross margins compared to our revenue from sales directly to repairers, and therefore was responsible for 1.2% of the increase in cost of goods sold as a percentage of revenue. our other acquisitions completed since the beginning of the prior year were responsible for the remainder of the acquisition impact on cost of goods sold, none of which had a material impact on our gross margins individually. partially offsetting the impact of our acquisitions, improvement in our north american gross margins decreased cost of goods sold by 0.4% of revenue. refer to the discussion of our segment results of operations for factors contributing to the changes in cost of goods sold by segment for the year ended december 31, 2014 compared to the year ended december 31, 2013.
facility and warehouse expenses. as a percentage of revenue, facility and warehouse expenses for the year ended december 31, 2014 decreased to 7.8% from 8.4% in the prior year, which was primarily due to the effect of our keystone specialty acquisition. compared to our other north american operations, keystone specialty stores a greater portion of inventory at its regional distribution centers, the costs of which are capitalized into inventory and expensed through cost of goods sold. in our north american wholesale operations, most of the inventory sold by our locations is stored on site rather than in distribution centers, and the related facility and warehouse expenses are recorded in this line item.
distribution expenses. as a percentage of revenue, distribution expenses increased to 8.6% in 2014 from 8.5% in 2013, primarily due to greater costs in our european segment. in our u.k. operations, we incurred greater personnel expenditures as a result of 59 new branch openings since the beginning of the prior year, which increased distribution expenses by 0.1% of revenue.
selling, general and administrative expenses. our selling, general and administrative expenses for the year ended december 31, 2014 decreased to 11.3% of revenue from 11.8% of revenue in the prior year. our acquisitions contributed 0.4% of the reduction in expense, including primarily the effect of keystone specialty, which has lower selling, general and administrative costs compared to our other operations. greater leverage of our sales force and general and administrative personnel in our north american operations contributed an additional 0.3% improvement in costs as a percentage of revenue. these reductions in expense as a percentage of revenue were partially offset by greater expenses in our european operations, including greater expenditures for our sales force, primarily related to new branch openings, and higher advertising costs compared to the prior year period, which increased selling, general and administrative expenses by 0.2% of revenue.
restructuring and acquisition related expenses. the following table summarizes restructuring and acquisition related expenses for the periods indicated (in thousands):

total restructuring and acquisition related expenses     $14,806                 $10,173                  $4,633
(1)   includes $5.8 million of expense related to the integration of our keystone specialty acquisition, as well as $1.9 million, $1.0 million, and $0.8 million of expense related to the integration of acquired businesses in our european, north american and specialty segments, respectively. additionally, we incurred $1.6 million of severance costs to terminated employees as part of the ongoing rationalization of our european operations.
41
(2)   includes $2.1 million of restructuring expenses related to the integration of certain of our 2013 european acquisitions and $1.4 million of restructuring expenses related to the integration of certain of our 2012 north american acquisitions.
(3)   includes external costs primarily related to our acquisitions of seven distribution companies in the netherlands.
(4)   includes external costs primarily related to our acquisitions of sator, five automotive paint distribution businesses in the u.k. and our january 2014 acquisition of keystone specialty.
see note 9, "restructuring and acquisition related expenses" to the consolidated financial statements in part ii, item 8 of this annual report on form 10-k for further information on our restructuring and integration plans.
depreciation and amortization. the following table provides additional information about the increase in depreciation and amortization compared to the prior year (in thousands):

total depreciation and amortization      $120,719               $80,969               $39,750
(1)   increase in depreciation is a result of increased levels of property and equipment to support our organic and acquisition related growth.
(2)   increase in amortization is a result of amortization of intangible assets related to our acquisitions completed since the beginning of the prior year. we recognized $78.1 million of intangibles related to our january 2014 acquisition of keystone specialty and $45.3 million of intangibles related to our may 2013 acquisition of sator.

other expense, net for the year ended december 31, 2014             $61,980
(1)   increased $17.8 million as a result of higher average outstanding debt levels, primarily to finance our keystone specialty and 2014 european acquisitions, partially offset by a decrease of $4.4 million as a result of lower interest rates relative to the prior year, primarily due to a lower applicable margin on our credit agreement borrowings as a result of our march 2014 amendment.
(2)   in 2014, we incurred a loss on debt extinguishment of $0.3 million related to the march 2014 amendment to our senior secured credit agreement, compared to a loss on debt extinguishment of $2.8 million during the prior year related to our may 2013 amendment to our senior secured credit credit agreement.
(3)   during 2014, we recorded gains of $1.9 million as a result of fair value adjustments to our contingent consideration liabilities, compared to losses of $2.5 million in the prior year. see note 6, "fair value measurements" to the consolidated financial statements in part ii, item 8 of this annual report on form 10-k for further information on our contingent payment arrangements.
(4)   primarily due to $0.9 million of greater losses as a result of foreign currency exchange for the year ended december 31, 2014 compared to the year ended december 31, 2013.

provision for income taxes. our effective income tax rate was 34.7% for the year ended december 31, 2014, compared to 34.5% for the year ended december 31, 2013. the lower effective income tax rate in 2013 primarily reflects the discrete benefit related to the revaluation of our net u.k. deferred tax liabilities as a result of reductions in the u.k. corporate income tax rate.

refer to the discussion of our segment results of operations for factors contributing to revenue growth during 2013 compared to the prior year.
cost of goods sold. our cost of goods sold increased to 59.0% of revenue in 2013 from 58.2% of revenue in 2012. in 2013, our cost of goods sold reflected a 0.7% increase as a percentage of revenue as a result of the lower gross margins generated by certain of our acquisitions, including our 2013 acquisitions of sator and five u.k.-based paint distribution businesses, as well as our june 2012 acquisition of a precious metals refining and reclamation business. in 2012, we recognized a gain on lawsuit settlements totaling $17.9 million that did not reoccur in 2013, thus accounting for 0.4% of the increase in the 2013 cost of goods sold as a percentage of revenue. see note 7, "commitments and contingencies" to the consolidated financial statements in part ii, item 8 of this annual report on form 10-k for further information on the lawsuit settlements. these increases in cost of goods sold as a percentage of revenue were partially offset by 0.4% improvement in gross margin in our salvage operations within our wholesale - north america segment, which reflects the impact of various individually insignificant factors, the largest of which were lower vehicle costs and pricing improvements.
facility and warehouse expenses. as a percentage of revenue, facility and warehouse expenses for the year ended december 31, 2013 remained flat at 8.4% of revenue. our north american operations increased facility and warehouse expense by 0.2% of revenue, which reflects increased weighting of our self service business. during 2012, we completed the acquisition of eight self service retail operations, which generally incur greater facility costs as a percentage of revenue compared to our wholesale operations, as our self service business tends to require a larger facility footprint to generate its sales. higher costs in north america were offset by a greater proportion of revenue generated by our european operations, which incur lower facility and warehouse costs as a percentage of revenue, combined with improved leveraging of facility and warehouse personnel in our u.k. operations related to 56 new branch openings completed since the beginning of 2012.
distribution expenses. as a percentage of revenue, distribution expenses decreased to 8.5% of revenue in 2013 from 9.1% of revenue in 2012. in our north american operations, improved leveraging of our distribution workforce contributed 0.2% of the reduction in distribution expenses as a percentage of revenue. fuel expense also decreased by 0.1% of revenue due to a reduction in the average price we pay for fuel. our european operations contributed the remainder of the decrease, including a 0.2% benefit from our 2013 european acquisitions, as well as a 0.1% benefit from our existing u.k. operations, primarily as a result of improved leverage related to 56 new branch openings since the beginning of 2012.
selling, general and administrative expenses. our selling, general and administrative expenses for the year ended december 31, 2013 decreased to 11.8% of revenue from 12.0% during the prior year. the reduction of these expenses as a percentage of revenue reflects an approximately equal impact from improved leveraging of general and administrative overhead costs and the relatively lower general and administrative expenses incurred by our sator business compared to our other operations.

total depreciation and amortization     $80,969               $64,093               $16,876
(1)   increase in depreciation is a result of increased levels of property and equipment to support our organic and acquisition related growth.
(2)   increase in amortization is a result of higher levels of intangible assets as a result of business acquisitions, including $45.3 million related to our may 2013 acquisition of sator.
other expense, net. the following table summarizes the components of the year-over-year increase in other expense, net (in thousands):
other expense, net for the year ended december 31, 2012             $28,786
increase due to:
interest expense                                                     19,755   (1)
loss on debt extinguishment                                           2,795   (2)
changes in fair value of contingent consideration liabilities           861   (3)
interest and other income, net                                        2,156   (4)
total increase                                                       25,567
other expense, net for the year ended december 31, 2013             $54,353
(1)   the increase in interest expense includes an approximately equal impact of higher outstanding debt balances and higher interest rates, primarily as a result of the senior notes issued in may 2013. see note 4, "long-term obligations" to the consolidated financial statements in part ii, item 8 of this annual report on form 10-k for further information related to our 2013 senior notes offering.
(2)   in may 2013, we executed an amended and restated senior secured credit agreement, and as a result, we expensed a portion of capitalized debt issuance costs related to the prior agreement, as well as a portion of the fees incurred with the amendment.
(3)   in 2013, we recognized expense of $2.5 million as a result of fair value adjustments to our contingent payment liabilities, compared to $1.6 million in 2012. see note 6, "fair value measurements" to the consolidated financial statements in part ii, item 8 of this annual report on form 10-k for further information on our contingent payment arrangements.
44
(4)   the increase in interest and other income, net was primarily due to the impact of foreign currency fluctuations in the canadian dollar, the british pound, and other currencies, which was a loss of $2.4 million during 2013 compared to a gain of $0.2 million during 2012.
provision for income taxes. our effective income tax rate was 34.5% and 36.2% for the years ended december 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively. we continued to expand our international operations throughout 2012 and 2013 with both acquisition related and organic revenue growth in our european segment as well as through acquisitions in canada. the lower effective income tax rate in 2013 reflects a 1.4% benefit relative to the prior year as a result of this growth in our international operations, where a larger proportion of our pretax income was generated in lower rate jurisdictions. the effect of lower state income taxes, other discrete items and permanent differences contributed the remaining 0.3% reduction in the effective tax rate compared to the prior year.
results of operations-segment reporting we have four operating segments: wholesale - north america; wholesale - europe; self service; and specialty. our specialty operating segment was formed with our january 3, 2014 acquisition of keystone specialty, as discussed in note 8, "business combinations" to the consolidated financial statements in part ii, item 8 of this annual report on form 10-k. our wholesale - north america and self service operating segments are aggregated into one reportable segment, north america, because they possess similar economic characteristics and have common products and services, customers, and methods of distribution. therefore, we present three reportable segments: north america, europe and specialty.
the following table presents our financial performance, including third party revenue, total revenue and segment ebitda, by reportable segment for the periods indicated (in thousands):

the key measure of segment profit or loss reviewed by our chief operating decision maker, who is our chief executive officer, is segment ebitda. segment ebitda includes revenue and expenses that are controllable by the segment. corporate and administrative expenses are allocated to the segments based on usage, with shared expenses apportioned based on the segment's percentage of consolidated revenue. segment ebitda is calculated as ebitda excluding restructuring and acquisition related expenses, change in fair value of contingent consideration liabilities and equity in earnings of unconsolidated subsidiaries. ebitda, which is the basis for segment ebitda, is calculated as net income excluding depreciation, amortization, interest (including loss on debt extinguishment) and taxes. loss on debt extinguishment is considered a component of interest in calculating ebitda, as the write-off of debt issuance costs is similar to the treatment of debt issuance cost amortization. see note 13, "segment and geographic information" to the consolidated financial statements in part ii, item 8 of this annual report on form 10-k for a reconciliation of total segment ebitda to net income.

because our specialty segment was formed on january 3, 2014 with our keystone specialty acquisition, the discussion of our consolidated results of operations covers the factors driving the year-over-year performance of our existing business and also discusses the effect of the specialty operations on our consolidated results. results for the specialty segment will not have a comparative period until the first quarter of 2015. however, compared to keystone specialty's unaudited results for the year ended december 31, 2013, revenue in our specialty segment increased 15.8%. during the fourth quarter of 2014, we completed two additional acquisitions in our specialty segment, which contributed approximately one quarter of the revenue growth. the remaining revenue growth was primarily due to greater sales volumes as a result of favorable economic conditions. additionally, during the year ended december 31, 2014, we generated a greater proportion of revenue from our higher-end specialty vehicle products, such as truck and recreational vehicle accessories, which resulted in a favorable mix of revenue compared to the prior year unaudited results.

north america third party revenue. the following table summarizes the changes in third party revenue by category in our north american segment (in thousands):
year ended december 31,                                                                 percentage change in revenue north america                                 2014   2013                              acquisition (1)           organic            foreign exchange           total change parts &amp; services revenue      $3,437,821                  $3,171,733                 2.8         %         6.1     %   (2)       (0.5   )%                 8.4        %
other revenue                        650,880                     631,196                 9.3         %        (6.0    )%   (3)       (0.1   )%                 3.1        %
total revenue                     $4,088,701                  $3,802,929                 3.8         %         4.1     %             (0.5   )%                 7.5        %
(1)   reflects the impact of 9 wholesale businesses and 2 self service retail operations acquired during 2014.
(2)   our organic growth in parts and services revenue was primarily due to higher sales volumes, as severe winter weather conditions during the second half of the fourth quarter of 2013 and through the first quarter of 2014 contributed to increased vehicle accidents, resulting in higher insurance claims activity. in addition, we believe the increased new car production since 2009 and greater miles driven has increased the demand for automotive parts used in repairs, including alternative parts. industry reports also indicate that the number of parts used in each insured repair is increasing compared to historical levels.
(3)   approximately half of the reduction in other revenue was due to reduced volume of scrap and other metals, with the remaining decline a result of lower prices for scrap and other metals. compared to the prior year, our furnace operations processed lower volumes of aluminum. additionally, we purchased fewer self service and "crush only" cars in the first quarter of 2014 as the prices demanded for vehicles in certain markets exceeded our acceptable cost given the prices of scrap and other metals. while we increased our purchasing levels during the remainder of the year to offset the shortfall, we crushed fewer vehicles compared to the prior year period due to the lag time to process these cars.
segment ebitda. as a percentage of total revenue, segment ebitda in north america increased to 13.3% during the year ended december 31, 2014 from 12.8% in the prior year. the improvement in segment ebitda reflects an increase in gross margin by 0.2% of revenue combined with a 0.3% reduction in operating expenses as a percentage of revenue. our wholesale operations increased gross margin by 0.6% of revenue, including a 0.5% improvement from lower inventory purchase costs and a favorable mix effect of 0.2% as a result of generating less revenue from our lower margin sales of scrap and precious metals. the improvement in gross margin as a percentage of revenue was partially offset by the impact of our acquisition of an automotive core business in january 2014, which increased our revenue in product lines that are complementary to our existing vehicle replacement parts offerings but generate lower gross margins, thereby decreasing gross margins by 0.5% of revenue. selling, general and administrative expenses declined by 0.5% of revenue, primarily due to improved leverage of our sales force and general and administrative personnel, but this was partially offset by an increase of facility and warehouse expenses by 0.2% of revenue due to higher personnel expenditures.

other revenue                          2,425                       1,752                 12.8         %         19.7       %               5.8            %          38.4        %
total revenue                     $1,846,155                  $1,259,599                 26.9         %         16.1       %               3.6            %          46.6        %
(1)   includes $131.3 million from our may 2013 acquisition of sator, $85.6 million from our august 2013 acquisitions of five paint distributors in the u.k. and $100.3 million from our 2014 acquisitions of seven distribution companies in the netherlands.
(2)   in our u.k. operations, revenue grew organically by 20.6%, while our continental european operations were flat with the prior year post-acquisition period, resulting in net organic revenue growth of 16.1% over the prior year. our organic revenue growth in the u.k., which resulted from higher sales volumes, was composed of a 13.3% increase from stores open more than 12 months and a 7.3% increase from revenue generated by 59 branch openings since the beginning of the prior year through the one year anniversary of their respective opening dates. in our continental european operations, a new warehouse location in france resulted in greater sales volumes compared to the prior year period, but this growth was offset by a decline in sales into eastern europe as a result of the devaluation of local currencies and political instability.
(3)   compared to the prior year, exchange rates contributed 3.6% of the revenue growth, primarily due to the strengthening of the british pound against the u.s. dollar in the first nine months of 2014. while exchanges rates positively affected revenue on a year-to-date basis, the british pound weakened against the u.s. dollar in the fourth quarter to partially offset the benefit realized during the first nine months of the year. based on exchange rates through early february 2015 and projections for the remainder of the year, we expect there will be a negative effect on revenue from foreign currency exchange in 2015.
segment ebitda. as a percentage of total revenue, segment ebitda in our european operations decreased to 9.1% for the year ended december 31, 2014 from 11.3% during the year ended december 31, 2013. our acquisitions completed since the beginning of the prior year were responsible for 1.1% of the decline in segment ebitda as a percentage of revenue, including primarily the effect of the netherlands distributors we acquired in may 2014. the effect of the netherlands distributors includes a negative gross margin impact of 0.3% that we believe will not affect future periods once the higher cost acquired inventory has turned and we are able to internalize the incremental distributor margin. additionally, as we transition our continental european operations to a two step distribution model, including the effect of these acquisitions, we expect our operating expenses to increase as we internalize the cost of the distribution network; during the year ended december 31, 2014, these greater operating costs resulted in a decline in segment ebitda as a percentage of revenue, thereby accounting for the remaining negative impact on segment ebitda margins. our existing operations were responsible for the remaining decline in segment ebitda, including a 0.7% effect from 59 new branch openings in the u.k. since the beginning of the prior year in our u.k. operations. additionally, we incurred 0.2% in higher advertising expenses compared to the prior year.

north america third party revenue. the following table summarizes the changes in third party revenue by category in our north american segment (in thousands):
year ended december 31,                                                                  percentage change in revenue north america                                 2013   2012                               acquisition (1)           organic            foreign exchange           total change parts &amp; services revenue      $3,171,733                  $2,868,980                  4.8         %         6.0     %   (2)       (0.2   )%                10.6        %
other revenue                        631,196                     557,878                 14.8         %        (1.6    )%   (3)       (0.1   )%                13.1        %
total revenue                     $3,802,929                  $3,426,858                  6.4         %         4.8     %             (0.2   )%                11.0        %
(1)   reflects the impact of 10 wholesale businesses and 2 self service retail operations acquired during 2013.
(2)   organic growth in parts and services revenue is primarily due to higher sales volumes. in the first half of 2012, we experienced milder winter weather conditions, which contributed to fewer and less severe vehicle accidents, resulting in lower insurance claims. additionally, 2013 sales volumes benefited from higher inventory purchases compared to 2012, which contributed to a greater volume of parts available for sale.
47
(3)   the decrease in other revenue was primarily a result of a reduction in sales volume from our furnace operations, partially offset by an increased volume of scrap and core revenue from our salvage operations.
segment ebitda. as a percentage of total revenue, segment ebitda decreased to 12.8% in 2013 from 12.9% in 2012. in 2012, we recognized a gain on lawsuit settlements totaling $17.9 million, which decreased 2013 segment ebitda as a percentage of revenue by 0.5% relative to 2012 as the gain did not reoccur in 2013. our precious metals refining and reclamation business, which generates lower margins as a percentage of revenue, contributed 0.2% of the decline in segment ebitda, primarily due to including a full year of results in 2013 compared to only seven months in 2012. in our self service operations, a narrowing spread between the prices received for scrap and other metals and the cost of the scrap component of the cars that we crushed resulted in a decrease in segment ebitda of 0.2% of revenue.  these decreases were partly offset by a 0.5% improvement in segment ebitda margin from our wholesale salvage operations, which reflects the impact of various individually insignificant factors, the largest of which were lower vehicle costs and pricing improvements. lower operating expenses increased segment ebitda by 0.2% of revenue as a result of improved leverage of our distribution workforce and lower fuel costs, partially offset by higher facility costs in our self service operations.
europe third party revenue. the following table summarizes the changes in third party revenue by category in our european segment (in thousands):
year ended december 31,                                                                        percentage change in revenue europe                                        2013   2012                             acquisition (1)          organic (2)           foreign exchange (3)           total change parts &amp; services revenue      $1,257,847                  $694,896                 50.5   %               31.8       %              (1.3   )%                  81.0        %

(1)   acquisition related revenue growth was primarily a result of our sator acquisition completed in may 2013.
(2)   our organic revenue growth was a result of higher sales volumes, including a 20.8% increase from stores open more than 12 months and an 11% increase from revenue generated by 56 branch openings since the beginning of 2012 through the one year anniversary of their respective opening dates.
(3)   the weakening, on average, of the british pound against the u.s. dollar decreased revenue by 1.3% compared to the prior year.
segment ebitda. as a percentage of total revenue, segment ebitda in our european segment increased to 11.3% for the year ended december 31, 2013 from 10.6% during 2012. in our u.k. operations, improved leverage of our facilities and distribution network to support new branch openings and existing store sales growth resulted in a 1.1% improvement in segment ebitda as a percentage of revenue compared to the prior year. the improvement in segment ebitda margin in our u.k. operations was partially offset by the impact of our sator acquisition, which decreased segment ebitda by 0.4% as a percentage of revenue.
2015 outlook we estimate that net income and diluted earnings per share for the year ending december 31, 2015, excluding the impact of any restructuring and acquisition related expenses and any gains or losses related to acquisitions or divestitures (including changes in the fair value of contingent consideration liabilities), will be in the range of $420 million to $450 million and $1.36 to $1.46, respectively.

total liquidity (cash and equivalents plus availability on credit facilities)       1,242,415               1,301,091
(1) includes our revolving credit facilities and our receivables securitization facility.
we assess our liquidity in terms of our ability to fund our operations and provide for expansion through both internal development and acquisitions. our primary sources of liquidity are cash flows from operations and our credit facilities. we utilize our cash flows from operations to fund working capital and capital expenditures, with the excess amounts going towards funding acquisitions or paying down outstanding debt. as we have pursued acquisitions as part of our growth strategy, our cash flows from operations have not always been sufficient to cover our investing activities. to fund our acquisitions, we have accessed various forms of debt financing, including our march 2014 amendment to our senior secured credit facilities and the issuance of $600 million of senior notes in may 2013.
as of december 31, 2014, we had debt outstanding and additional available sources of financing, as follows:
•   senior secured credit facilities maturing in may 2019, composed of $450 million in term loans ($433 million outstanding at december 31, 2014) and $1.85 billion in revolving credit ($664 million outstanding at december 31, 2014), bearing interest at variable rates (although a portion of this debt is hedged through interest rate swap contracts)
•   senior notes totaling $600 million, maturing in may 2023 and bearing interest at a 4.75% fixed rate
•   receivables securitization facility with availability up to $97 million ($94.9 million outstanding as of december 31, 2014), maturing in october 2017 and bearing interest at variable commercial paper rates since the first quarter of 2013, we have undertaken several financing transactions to increase our available liquidity, including two amendments to our senior secured credit facilities (most recently amended as of march 27, 2014), our $600 million senior notes offering completed in may 2013 and an amendment to our receivables facility in september 2014. the amendments to our credit facilities increased the size of our revolver, reset the term loan, extended the maturity of the credit agreement, and adjusted certain of our bank covenants. by issuing the notes, we diversified our financing structure by adding a long-term fixed rate instrument and reducing our reliance on the bank market. we also believe the interest rate on the notes was favorable. although higher than today's short-term floating rate debt, the 10-year fixed rate of 4.75% reduces our risk of future interest rate increases, which we have seen in the market subsequent to our offering. the amendment to our receivables facility increased our maximum borrowing capacity by $17 million and extended the maturity by two years. the new structure provides financial flexibility to execute our long-term growth strategy. if we see an attractive acquisition opportunity, we have the ability to use our revolver to move quickly and have certainty of funding up to the amount of our then-available liquidity.
as of december 31, 2014, we had approximately $1.1 billion available under our credit facilities. combined with approximately $115 million of cash and equivalents at december 31, 2014, we had approximately $1.2 billion in available liquidity, a decrease of $59 million over our available liquidity as of december 31, 2013. the amendment to our senior secured credit facilities in the first quarter of 2014 provided an additional $500 million of availability on our revolver, which more than offset the increase in borrowings to finance our january 2014 keystone specialty acquisition. we believe that our current liquidity and cash expected to be generated by operating activities in future periods will be sufficient to meet our current operating and capital requirements, although such sources may not be sufficient for future acquisitions depending on their size. while we believe that we currently have adequate capacity, from time to time we may need to raise additional funds through public or private financing, strategic relationships or other arrangements. there can be no assurance that additional funding, or refinancing of our credit facilities, if needed, will be available on terms attractive to us, or at all. furthermore, any additional equity financing may be dilutive to stockholders, and debt financing, if available, may involve restrictive covenants or higher interest costs. our failure to raise capital if and when needed could have a material adverse impact on our business, operating results, and financial condition.
borrowings under the credit agreement accrue interest at variable rates, which depend on the currency and the duration of the borrowing, plus an applicable margin rate which is subject to change quarterly based on our reported leverage ratio. we
49
hold interest rate swaps to hedge the variable rates on our credit agreement borrowings (as described in note 5, "derivative instruments and hedging activities" to the consolidated financial statements in part ii, item 8 of this annual report on form 10-k), with the effect of fixing the interest rates on the respective notional amounts. after giving effect to these interest rate swap contracts, the weighted average interest rate on borrowings outstanding under our credit agreement at december 31, 2014 was 2.10%, although the rate will increase in march 2015 as a result of the quarterly reset of our applicable margin rate. including the borrowings on our senior notes and receivables securitization program, our overall weighted average interest rate on borrowings was 2.92% at december 31, 2014. cash interest payments were $59.7 million for the year ended december 31, 2014, including interest payments totaling $28.5 million related to the senior notes. the semi-annual interest payments on our senior notes are made in may and november each year, and began in november 2013. we had outstanding credit agreement borrowings of $1.1 billion and $672.6 million at december 31, 2014 and december 31, 2013, respectively. of these amounts, $22.5 million were classified as current maturities at december 31, 2014 and december 31, 2013. we have scheduled repayments of $5.6 million each quarter on the term loan through its maturity in may 2019, but no other significant principal payments on our credit facilities prior to the maturity of the receivables securitization program in october 2017. in addition to the repayments under our credit facilities, we will make payments on notes payable and other debt totaling $41 million in the next 12 months, the majority of which is for payments on notes payable issued in connection with acquisitions.
our credit agreement contains customary covenants that provide limitations and conditions on our ability to enter into certain transactions.  the credit agreement also contains financial and affirmative covenants, including limitations on our net leverage ratio and a minimum interest coverage ratio.  we were in compliance with all restrictive covenants under our credit agreement as of december 31, 2014.
as of december 31, 2014, cash held by our foreign subsidiaries totaled $77 million and undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries amounted to approximately $266 million. these earnings are considered to be indefinitely reinvested, and accordingly no provision for u.s. income taxes has been provided thereon. should these earnings be repatriated in the future, in the form of dividends or otherwise, we would be subject to both u.s. income taxes (subject to adjustment for foreign tax credits) and potential withholding taxes payable to the various foreign countries. we believe that we have sufficient cash flow and liquidity to meet our financial obligations in the u.s. without resort to repatriation of foreign earnings.
the procurement of inventory is the largest operating use of our funds. we normally pay for aftermarket product purchases at the time of shipment or on standard payment terms, depending on the manufacturer and the negotiated payment terms. we normally pay for salvage vehicles acquired at salvage auctions and under direct procurement arrangements at the time that we take possession of the vehicles.
the following table sets forth a summary of our inventory procurement for 2014, 2013, and 2012:
year ended december 31,
2014                                                          2013                  2012
aftermarket inventory purchases (billions)        $2.7                  $1.7                  $1.3
wholesale salvage cars and trucks              290,000               281,000               262,200
self service and "crush only" cars             514,000               513,000               416,000
aftermarket inventory purchases in 2014 included $613 million within our specialty segment that was formed in 2014, as well as $88.2 million of incremental purchases for our sator business (acquired in may 2013) from the beginning of 2014 through the anniversary date of the acquisition.
net cash provided by operating activities totaled $370.9 million for the year ended december 31, 2014, compared to $428.1 million in 2013. compared to the prior year, our 2014 ebitda increased by $159.6 million, due to both acquisition related growth and organic growth. cash outflows for our primary working capital accounts (receivables, inventory and payables) increased to $189.8 million during 2014, from $64.3 million during 2013, as a result of greater inventory growth, particularly in our aftermarket products, as well as increased receivables balances, including the effect of increased sales levels in our u.k. operations. cash flows related to our primary working capital accounts can be volatile as the purchases, payments and collections can be timed differently from period to period and can be influenced by factors outside of our control. however, we expect that the net change in these working capital items will generally be a cash outflow as we grow our business each year. cash paid for income taxes increased to $177.0 million from $110.9 million due to the overpayment of taxes in 2012 that we offset against the estimated tax payments in 2013, as well as greater earnings that required higher estimated tax payments in 2014 compared to the prior year. during 2014, we made two semi-annual interest payments totaling $28.5 million on our senior notes, whereas in 2013 we made one semi-annual interest payment of $14.2 million. cash payments for bonuses were $7.8 million higher during 2014 than they were in 2013.
net cash used in investing activities totaled $921.0 million for the year ended december 31, 2014, compared to $505.6 million for the same period of 2013. we invested $775.9 million of cash, net of cash acquired, in business acquisitions during
50
2014, including $427.1 million for our keystone specialty acquisition. we invested $408.4 million for business acquisitions in the comparable prior year, including our acquisition of sator for $272.8 million. property and equipment purchases were $141.0 million in the year ended december 31, 2014 compared to $90.2 million in the prior year. the increase in capital expenditures relative to the prior year period reflects an increase of $17.4 million in our u.k. operations, including greater expenditures for leasehold improvements and vehicles for 44 new branch locations opened during the year ended december 31, 2014. capital expenditures in our north american segment increased by $19.9 million, primarily due to costs incurred to build a facility that we subsequently sold and leased back from the buyer. the proceeds of the sale-leaseback transaction are reflected as financing cash inflows in the year ended december 31, 2014. in 2013, we entered into an agreement with suncorp group to develop an alternative vehicle products business in australia and new zealand, for which our initial investment totaled $9.1 million; during 2014, we paid $2.2 million for investments in unconsolidated subsidiaries.
net cash provided by financing activities totaled $519.0 million for the year ended december 31, 2014, compared to $165.9 million in 2013. during 2014, net borrowings under our credit facilities were $578.4 million compared to net borrowings of $227.1 million in 2013. in both periods, we used the proceeds from the net borrowings primarily to fund acquisitions, including $370 million of revolver borrowings and $80 million of borrowings under our receivables facility to finance the keystone specialty acquisition. our march 2014 amendment of our credit facilities generated $11.3 million in additional term loan borrowings, which were used to pay $3.7 million in debt issuance costs related to the amendment, as well as to repay outstanding revolver borrowings. during 2013 we completed a $600 million senior notes offering, as well as an amendment to our credit agreement that resulted in $35 million in term loan proceeds, which were used to pay $16.9 million in debt issuance costs as well as to repay outstanding amounts on our revolving credit facilities. in 2014, we made a payment of $44.8 million ($39.5 million included in financing cash flows and $5.3 million included in operating cash flows) for the final earnout period under the contingent payment agreement related to our 2011 ecp acquisition. in the comparable prior year period, we made a similar payment of $33.9 million ($31.5 million included in financing cash flows and $2.4 million included in operating cash flows) for the 2012 earnout period. cash generated from exercises of stock options provided $9.3 million and $15.4 million in the years ended december 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. the excess tax benefit from share-based payment arrangements reduced income taxes payable by $17.8 million and $18.3 million in the years ended december 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. during the year ended december 31, 2014, we paid $12.6 million related to the settlement of foreign currency forward contracts.

we intend to continue to evaluate markets for potential growth through the internal development of distribution centers, processing and sales facilities, and warehouses, through further integration of our facilities, and through selected business acquisitions. our future liquidity and capital requirements will depend upon numerous factors, including the costs and timing of our internal development efforts and the success of those efforts, the costs and timing of expansion of our sales and marketing activities, and the costs and timing of future business acquisitions.

2015 outlook we estimate that our capital expenditures for 2015, excluding business acquisitions, will be between $150 million and $180 million. we expect to use these funds for several major facility expansions, improvement of current facilities, real estate acquisitions and systems development projects. we anticipate that net cash provided by operating activities for 2015 will be approximately $425 million.

(1)   our long-term debt under contractual obligations above includes interest on the balances outstanding as of december 31, 2014. interest on our senior notes, notes payable, and other long-term debt is calculated based on the respective stated rates. interest on our variable rate credit facilities is calculated based on the weighted average rates, including the impact of interest rate swaps through their respective expiration dates, in effect for each tranche of borrowings as of december 31, 2014. future estimated interest expense for the next year, one to three years, and three to five years is $52.6 million, $103.0 million and $94.4 million, respectively. estimated interest expense beyond five years is $99.9 million.
(2)   interest on capital lease obligations is included based on incremental borrowing or implied rates.
(3)   the operating lease payments above do not include certain tax, insurance and maintenance costs, which are also required contractual obligations under our operating leases but are generally not fixed and can fluctuate from year to year. historically, these expenses have averaged approximately 25% of the corresponding lease payments.
(4)   our purchase obligations include open purchase orders for aftermarket inventory.
(5)   our contingent consideration liabilities reflect the undiscounted estimated payments of additional consideration related to business combinations. the actual payments will be determined at the end of the applicable performance periods based on the acquired entities' achievement of the targets specified in the purchase agreements.
(6)   self-insurance reserves include undiscounted estimated payments, net of estimated insurance recoveries, for our employee medical benefits, automobile liability, general liability, directors and officers liability, workers' compensation and property insurance.
52
(7)   deferred compensation payments are dependent on elected payment dates. while we expect that these payments will be made more than five years from the latest balance sheet date, payments may be made earlier depending on such elections. our deferred compensation plans are funded through investments in life insurance policies. other retirement obligations consists of our expected required contributions to sator's pension plan. we have not included future funding requirements beyond 2015 in the table above, as these funding projections are not practicable to estimate.

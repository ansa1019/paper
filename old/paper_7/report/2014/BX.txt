item 7.   managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations

the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the blackstone group l.p.s consolidated financial statements and the related notes included within this annual report on form 10-k.
our business blackstone is one of the largest independent managers of private capital in the world. we also provide a wide range of financial advisory services, including financial advisory, restructuring and reorganization advisory and fund placement services.
our business is organized into five business segments:
                                                          private equity. we are a world leader in private equity investing, having managed six general private equity funds, as well as two sector focused funds, since we established this business in 1987. we refer to these managed corporate private equity funds collectively as our blackstone capital partners (bcp) funds. our private equity segment also includes blackstone tactical opportunities accounts (tactical opportunities), which are multi-asset class investment accounts, strategic partners fund solutions (strategic partners), a secondary private fund of funds business and blackstone total alternatives solution (btas), a new investment program for eligible high net worth investors offering exposure to blackstones key illiquid investment strategies through a single commitment. through our private equity funds we pursue transactions throughout the world, including leveraged buyout acquisitions of seasoned companies, transactions involving growth equity or start-up businesses in established industries, minority investments, corporate partnerships, distressed debt, structured securities and industry consolidations, in all cases in strictly friendly transactions.

                                                        real estate. we are a world leader in real estate investing, having built the largest private real estate investment business in the world since our start in 1991. we have managed or continue to manage a number of global, european and asian focused opportunistic real estate funds, several real estate debt investment funds, a publicly traded real estate investment trust (bxmt) and core+ real estate investments, including the 2014 launch of our first commingled u.s.-focused open ended core+ fund. our real estate opportunity funds are diversified geographically and have made significant investments in lodging, office buildings, shopping centers, residential and a variety of real estate operating companies. our debt investment funds target high yield real estate debt related investment opportunities in the public and private markets, primarily in the united states and europe. our core+ funds target stabilized office, multifamily, industrial, and retail assets globally. we refer to our real estate opportunistic funds as our blackstone real estate partners (brep) funds, our real estate debt investment funds as our blackstone real estate debt strategies (breds) funds and our core+ investment funds as our blackstone property partners (bpp) funds.

                                                    hedge fund solutions. blackstones hedge fund solutions segment is comprised principally of blackstone alternative asset management
(baam). baam was organized in 1990 and has developed into a leading institutional solutions provider utilizing hedge funds across a wide variety of strategies. baam is the worlds largest discretionary allocator to hedge funds.

                                                           credit. our credit segment is comprised principally of gso capital partners lp (gso), a global leader in managing credit-focused products within private debt and public market strategies. gsos products include senior credit-focused funds, distressed debt funds, mezzanine funds, general credit-focused funds, registered investment companies, separately managed accounts and collateralized loan obligation (clo) vehicles.

   financial advisory. our financial advisory segment serves a diverse and global group of clients with financial and strategic advisory services, restructuring and reorganization advisory services, capital markets services and fund placement services for alternative investment funds.

75
we generate revenue from fees earned pursuant to contractual arrangements with funds, fund investors and fund portfolio companies (including management, transaction and monitoring fees), and from financial and strategic advisory, restructuring and reorganization advisory, capital markets services and fund placement services for alternative investment funds. we invest in the funds we manage and, in most cases, receive a preferred allocation of income (i.e., a carried interest) or an incentive fee from an investment fund in the event that specified cumulative investment returns are achieved (generally collectively referred to as performance fees). the composition of our revenues will vary based on market conditions and the cyclicality of the different businesses in which we operate. net investment gains and investment income generated by the blackstone funds, principally private equity and real estate funds, are driven by value created by our operating and strategic initiatives as well as overall market conditions. fair values are affected by changes in the fundamentals of the portfolio company, the portfolio companys industry, the overall economy and other market conditions.
business environment blackstones businesses are materially affected by conditions in the financial markets and economic conditions in the u.s., europe, asia and, to a lesser extent, elsewhere in the world.
global equity and debt markets generally had another positive year in 2014, although returns were significantly lower than 2013 levels, with a sharp increase in volatility late in the year. the cboe volatility index rose 40% during 2014, and high yield spreads widened sharply in the fourth quarter, largely driven by weakness in the energy sector, as investors considered the implications of a steep decline in oil prices.
the outlook for global economic growth deteriorated throughout the year, resulting in sustained or increased accommodative monetary policies from several central banks. however, economic activity in the u.s. continued to strengthen and the unemployment rate declined further to a stated rate of 5.6% at year end. the s&p 500 rose 11.4% for the year, making it one of the best-performing developed equity markets. the u.s. dollar strengthened sharply against most major currencies, and that has continued into 2015.
the u.s. federal reserve ended its quantitative easing program in october, but reiterated its plans to maintain the federal funds rate at historically low levels for the intermediate term. contrary to market expectations in early 2014, benchmark rates fell further during the year, with the 10-year treasury yield declining 86 basis points to 2.17%.
the global real estate investment environment is generally characterized by limited new supply and moderate levels of debt capital. in the u.s., real estate fundamentals appear healthy. although distress is limited, new construction remains well below historic levels, and when combined with a strengthening economy, supports improving fundamentals across nearly every real estate asset class. real estate debt markets in the u.s. have also recovered, with $94 billion in 2014 commercial mortgage backed securities issuance significantly up from post-crisis lows, but remain less than half of the pre-crisis high of $229 billion. there continues to be distress in european real estate markets. the european lending environment also remains dislocated, while bank deleveraging due to enhanced regulatory pressures drove asset sales north of 80 billion in 2014. in asia, economic growth in china and india have moderated yet continue to support robust demand dynamics. ongoing capital market dislocation across emerging markets in asia has provided minimal liquidity for real estate owners and reduced financing for new construction.
significant transaction on october 10, 2014, blackstone announced that its board of directors had approved a plan to spin off its financial and strategic advisory services, restructuring and reorganization advisory services, and its park hill fund placement businesses and combine these businesses with pjt partners, an independent financial advisory firm founded by paul j. taubman. blackstones capital markets business will not be part of the transaction, and will be retained by blackstone. the parties expect the transaction to close in 2015. the new entity will be an independent, publicly traded company, which will be led by mr. taubman as chairman and chief executive officer. the transaction is intended to be tax-free to blackstone and blackstones unitholders.

organizational structure the simplified diagram below depicts our current organizational structure. the diagram does not depict all of our subsidiaries, including intermediate holding companies through which certain of the subsidiaries depicted are held.
key financial measures and indicators we manage our business using traditional financial measures and key operating metrics since we believe these metrics measure the productivity of our investment activities. our key financial measures and indicators are discussed below.
revenues revenues primarily consist of management and advisory fees, performance fees, investment income, interest and dividend revenue and other. please refer to part i. item 1. business  incentive arrangements / fee structure and  critical accounting policies, revenue recognition for additional information regarding the manner in which base management fees and performance fees are generated.
management and advisory fees, net  management and advisory fees, net are comprised of management fees, including base management fees, transaction and other fees, advisory fees and management fee reductions and offsets.
the partnership earns base management fees from limited partners of funds in each of its managed funds, at a fixed percentage of assets under management, net asset value, total assets, committed capital or invested capital, or in some cases, a fixed fee. base management fees are recognized based on contractual terms specified in the underlying investment advisory agreements.
77
transaction and other fees (including monitoring fees) are fees charged directly to managed funds and portfolio companies. the investment advisory agreements generally require that the investment adviser reduce the amount of management fees payable by the limited partners to the partnership (management fee reductions) by an amount equal to a portion of the transaction and other fees directly paid to the partnership by the portfolio companies. the amount of the reduction varies by fund, the type of fee paid by the portfolio company and the previously incurred expenses of the fund.
management fee offsets are reductions to management fees payable by the limited partners of the blackstone funds, which are granted based on the amount such limited partners reimburse the blackstone funds for placement fees.
advisory fees consist of advisory retainer and transaction-based fee arrangements related to financial and strategic advisory services, restructuring and reorganization advisory services, capital markets services and fund placement services for alternative investment funds. advisory retainer fees are recognized when services for the transactions are complete, in accordance with terms set forth in individual agreements. transaction-based fees are recognized when (a) there is evidence of an arrangement with a client, (b) agreed upon services have been provided, (c) fees are fixed or determinable, and (d) collection is reasonably assured. fund placement fees are recognized as earned upon the acceptance by a fund of capital or capital commitments.
accrued but unpaid management and advisory fees, net of management fee reductions and management fee offsets, as of the reporting date are included in accounts receivable or due from affiliates in the consolidated statements of financial condition. management fees paid by limited partners to the blackstone funds and passed on to blackstone are not considered affiliate revenues.
performance fees  performance fees earned on the performance of blackstones hedge fund structures (incentive fees) are recognized based on fund performance during the period, subject to the achievement of minimum return levels, or high water marks, in accordance with the respective terms set out in each hedge funds governing agreements. accrued but unpaid incentive fees charged directly to investors in blackstones offshore hedge funds as of the reporting date are recorded within due from affiliates in the consolidated statements of financial condition. accrued but unpaid incentive fees on onshore funds as of the reporting date are reflected in investments in the consolidated statements of financial condition. incentive fees are realized at the end of a measurement period, typically annually. once realized, such fees are not subject to clawback or reversal.
in certain fund structures, specifically in private equity, real estate and certain hedge fund solutions and credit-focused funds (carry funds), performance fees (carried interest) are allocated to the general partner based on cumulative fund performance to date, subject to a preferred return to limited partners. at the end of each reporting period, the partnership calculates the carried interest that would be due to the partnership for each fund, pursuant to the fund agreements, as if the fair value of the underlying investments were realized as of such date, irrespective of whether such amounts have been realized. as the fair value of underlying investments varies between reporting periods, it is necessary to make adjustments to amounts recorded as carried interest to reflect either (a) positive performance resulting in an increase in the carried interest allocated to the general partner or (b) negative performance that would cause the amount due to the partnership to be less than the amount previously recognized as revenue, resulting in a negative adjustment to carried interest allocated to the general partner. in each scenario, it is necessary to calculate the carried interest on cumulative results compared to the carried interest recorded to date and make the required positive or negative adjustments. the partnership ceases to record negative carried interest allocations once previously recognized carried interest allocations for such fund have been fully reversed. the partnership is not obligated to pay guaranteed returns or hurdles, and therefore, cannot have negative carried interest over the life of a fund. accrued but unpaid carried interest as of the reporting date is reflected in investments in the consolidated statements of financial condition.
carried interest is realized when an underlying investment is profitably disposed of and the funds cumulative returns are in excess of the preferred return or, in limited instances, after certain thresholds for return of capital are met. carried interest is subject to clawback to the extent that the carried interest received to date exceeds the
78
amount due to blackstone based on cumulative results. as such, the accrual for potential repayment of previously received carried interest, which is a component of due to affiliates, represents all amounts previously distributed to blackstone holdings and non-controlling interest holders that would need to be repaid to the blackstone funds if the blackstone carry funds were to be liquidated based on the current fair value of the underlying funds investments as of the reporting date. the actual clawback liability, however, generally does not become realized until the end of a funds life except for certain blackstone real estate funds, multi-asset class investment funds and credit-focused funds, which may have an interim clawback liability.
investment income (loss)  investment income (loss) represents the unrealized and realized gains and losses on the partnerships principal investments, including its investments in blackstone funds that are not consolidated, its equity method investments, and other principal investments. investment income (loss) is realized when the partnership redeems all or a portion of its investment or when the partnership receives cash income, such as dividends or distributions. unrealized investment income (loss) results from changes in the fair value of the underlying investment as well as the reversal of unrealized gain (loss) at the time an investment is realized.
interest and dividend revenue  interest and dividend revenue comprises primarily interest and dividend income earned on principal investments held by blackstone.
other revenue  other revenue consists of miscellaneous income and foreign exchange gains and losses arising on transactions denominated in currencies other than u.s. dollars.
expenses compensation and benefits  compensation  compensation and benefits consists of (a) employee compensation, comprising salary and bonus, and benefits paid and payable to employees and senior managing directors and (b) equity-based compensation associated with the grants of equity-based awards to employees and senior managing directors. compensation cost relating to the issuance of equity-based awards to senior managing directors and employees is measured at fair value at the grant date, taking into consideration expected forfeitures, and expensed over the vesting period on a straight-line basis. equity-based awards that do not require future service are expensed immediately. cash settled equity-based awards are classified as liabilities and are remeasured at the end of each reporting period.
compensation and benefits  performance fee  performance fee compensation consists of carried interest (which may be distributed in cash or in-kind) and incentive fee allocations, and may in future periods also include allocations of investment income from blackstones firm investments, to employees and senior managing directors participating in certain profit sharing initiatives. such compensation expense is subject to both positive and negative adjustments. unlike carried interest and incentive fees, compensation expense is based on the performance of individual investments held by a fund rather than on a fund by fund basis. compensation received from advisory clients in the form of securities of such clients may also be allocated to employees and senior managing directors.
other operating expenses  other operating expenses represents general and administrative expenses including interest expense, occupancy and equipment expenses and other expenses, which consist principally of professional fees, public company costs, travel and related expenses, communications and information services and depreciation and amortization.
fund expenses  the expenses of our consolidated blackstone funds consist primarily of interest expense, professional fees and other third party expenses.
non-controlling interests in consolidated entities non-controlling interests in consolidated entities represent the component of partners capital in consolidated blackstone funds held by third party investors and employees. the percentage interests held by third parties and
79
employees is adjusted for general partner allocations and by subscriptions and redemptions in funds of hedge funds and certain credit-focused funds which occur during the reporting period. in addition, all non-controlling interests in consolidated blackstone funds are attributed a share of income (loss) arising from the respective funds and a share of other comprehensive income, if applicable. income (loss) is allocated to non-controlling interests in consolidated entities based on the relative ownership interests of third party investors and employees after considering any contractual arrangements that govern the allocation of income (loss) such as fees allocable to the blackstone group l.p.
redeemable non-controlling interests in consolidated entities non-controlling interests related to funds of hedge funds and certain other credit-focused funds are subject to annual, semi-annual or quarterly redemption by investors in these funds following the expiration of a specified period of time (typically between one and three years), or may be withdrawn subject to a redemption fee in the funds of hedge funds and certain credit-focused funds during the period when capital may not be withdrawn. as limited partners in these types of funds have been granted redemption rights, amounts relating to third party interests in such consolidated funds are presented as redeemable non-controlling interests in consolidated entities within the consolidated statements of financial condition. when redeemable amounts become legally payable to investors, they are classified as a liability and included in accounts payable, accrued expenses and other liabilities in the consolidated statements of financial condition. for all consolidated funds in which redemption rights have not been granted, non-controlling interests are presented within partners capital in the consolidated statements of financial condition as non-controlling interests in consolidated entities.
non-controlling interests in blackstone holdings non-controlling interests in blackstone holdings represent the component of partners capital in the consolidated blackstone holdings partnerships held by blackstone personnel and others who are limited partners of the blackstone holdings partnerships.
certain costs and expenses are borne directly by the holdings partnerships. income (loss), excluding those costs directly borne by and attributable to the holdings partnerships, is attributable to non-controlling interests in blackstone holdings. this residual attribution is based on the year to date average percentage of blackstone holdings partnership units held by blackstone personnel and others who are limited partners of the blackstone holdings partnerships.
income taxes the blackstone holdings partnerships and certain of their subsidiaries operate in the u.s. as partnerships for u.s. federal income tax purposes and generally as corporate entities in non-u.s. jurisdictions. accordingly, these entities in some cases are subject to new york city unincorporated business taxes or non-u.s. income taxes. in addition, certain of the wholly owned subsidiaries of the partnership and the blackstone holdings partnerships will be subject to federal, state and local corporate income taxes at the entity level and the related tax provision attributable to the partnerships share of this income tax is reflected in the consolidated financial statements.
income taxes are accounted for using the asset and liability method of accounting. under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis, using tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. the effect on deferred assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period when the change is enacted. deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. current and deferred tax liabilities are recorded within accounts payable, accrued expenses and other liabilities in the consolidated statements of financial position.
80
blackstone uses the flow-through method to account for investment tax credits. under this method, the investment tax credits are recognized as a reduction to income tax expense.
blackstone analyzes its tax filing positions in all of the u.s. federal, state, local and foreign tax jurisdictions where it is required to file income tax returns, as well as for all open tax years in these jurisdictions. blackstone records uncertain tax positions on the basis of a two-step process: (a) determination is made whether it is more likely than not that the tax positions will be sustained based on the technical merits of the position and (b) those tax positions that meet the more-likely-than-not threshold are recognized as the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement with the related tax authority. blackstone recognizes accrued interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions in general, administrative, and other expenses within the consolidated statements of operations.
there remains some uncertainty regarding blackstones future taxation levels. over the past several years, a number of legislative and administrative proposals to change the taxation of carried interest have been introduced and, in certain cases, have been passed by the u.s. house of representatives that would have, in general, treated income and gains, including gain on sale, attributable to an investment services partnership interest, or ispi, as income subject to a new blended tax rate that is higher than the capital gains rate applicable to such income under current law, except to the extent such ispi would have been considered under the legislation to be a qualified capital interest. our common units and the interests that we hold in entities that are entitled to receive carried interest would likely have been classified as ispis for purposes of this legislation. it is unclear whether or when the u.s. congress will pass such legislation or what provisions will be included in any final legislation if enacted.
the most recent legislative proposals provided that, for taxable years beginning ten years after the date of enactment, income derived with respect to an ispi that is not a qualified capital interest and that is subject to the foregoing rules would not meet the qualifying income requirements under the publicly traded partnership rules. therefore, if similar legislation were to be enacted, following such ten-year period, we would be precluded from qualifying as a partnership for u.s. federal income tax purposes or be required to hold all such ispis through corporations.
the obama administration proposed policies similar to congress that would tax income and gain, including gain on sale, attributable to an ispi at ordinary rates, with an exception for certain qualified capital interests. the proposal would also characterize certain income and gain in respect of ispis as non-qualifying income under the tax rules applicable to publicly traded partnerships after a ten-year transition period from the effective date, with an exception for certain qualified capital interests. the obama administration proposed similar changes in its published revenue proposals for 2013 and prior years.
on february 26, 2014, representative camp, chairman of the house ways and means committee, released a discussion draft of proposed legislation that would introduce major changes to the u.s. federal income tax system (the 2014 camp proposal). it would, among other things (a) generally treat publicly traded partnerships (other than those deriving 90 percent of their income from activities relating to mining and natural resources) as taxable corporations for tax years beginning after 2016 and (b) recharacterize a portion of capital gain from certain partnership interests held in connection with the performance of services as ordinary income for tax years beginning after 2014.
states and other jurisdictions have also considered legislation to increase taxes with respect to carried interest. for example, in 2010, the new york state assembly passed a bill, which could have caused a non-resident of new york who holds our common units to be subject to new york state income tax on carried interest earned by entities in which we hold an indirect interest, thereby requiring the non-resident to file a new york state income tax return reporting such carried interest income. this legislation would have been retroactive to january 1, 2010. it is unclear whether or when similar legislation will be enacted. finally, several state and local jurisdictions are evaluating ways to subject partnerships to entity level taxation through the imposition of state or local income, franchise or other forms of taxation or to increase the amount of such taxation.
81
if we were taxed as a corporation or were forced to hold interests in entities earning income from carried interest through taxable subsidiary corporations, our effective tax rate could increase significantly. the federal statutory rate for corporations is currently 35%, and the state and local tax rates, net of the federal benefit, aggregate approximately 5%. if a variation of the above described legislation or any other change in the tax laws, rules, regulations or interpretations preclude us from qualifying for treatment as a partnership for u.s. federal income tax purposes under the publicly traded partnership rules or force us to hold interests in entities earning income from carried interest through taxable subsidiary corporations, this could materially increase our tax liability, and could well result in a reduction in the market price of our common units.
it is not possible at this time to meaningfully quantify the potential impact on blackstone of this potential future legislation or any similar legislation. multiple versions of legislation in this area have been proposed over the last few years that have included significantly different provisions regarding effective dates and the treatment of invested capital, tiered entities and cross-border operations, among other matters. depending upon what version of the legislation, if any, were enacted, the potential impact on a public company such as blackstone in a given year could differ dramatically and could be material. in addition, these legislative proposals would not themselves impose a tax on a publicly traded partnership such as blackstone. rather, they could force blackstone and other publicly traded partnerships to restructure their operations so as to prevent disqualifying income from reaching the publicly traded partnership in amounts that would disqualify the partnership from treatment as a partnership for u.s. federal income tax purposes. such a restructuring could result in more income being earned in corporate subsidiaries, thereby increasing corporate income tax liability indirectly borne by the publicly traded partnership. in addition, we, and our common unitholders, could be taxed on any such restructuring. the nature of any such restructuring would depend on the precise provisions of the legislation that was ultimately enacted, as well as the particular facts and circumstances of blackstones operations at the time any such legislation were to take effect, making the task of predicting the amount of additional tax highly speculative.
the obama administration has announced other proposals for potential reform to the u.s. federal income tax rules for businesses, including reducing the deductibility of interest for corporations, reducing the top marginal rate on corporations and subjecting entities currently treated as partnerships for tax purposes to an entity level income tax similar to the corporate income tax. several proposals for reform if enacted could adversely affect us. it is unclear what any actual legislation would provide, when it would be proposed or what its prospects for enactment would be.
the 2014 camp proposal, in addition to the proposed changes discussed above relating to publicly traded partnerships and carried interest, includes proposed provisions for the migration of the united states from a worldwide system of taxation, pursuant to which u.s. corporations are taxed on their worldwide income, to a territorial system where u.s. corporations are taxed only on their u.s. source income (subject to certain exceptions for income derived in low-tax jurisdictions from the exploitation of tangible assets) at a top corporate tax rate that would be 25%. the 2014 camp proposal includes numerous revenue raisers to offset the reduction in the tax rate and base which may or may not be detrimental to us, including changes to the rules for depreciating or amortizing assets, including goodwill, and changes to rules affecting real estate investment trusts, partnerships and tax-exempt entities. senator baucus recently proposed a similar territorial u.s. tax system, but with more expansive u.s. taxation of the foreign profits of non-u.s. subsidiaries of u.s. corporations. the baucus proposal would also eliminate the withholding tax exemption on portfolio interest debt obligations for investors residing in non-treaty jurisdictions. whether these proposals will be enacted by the government and in what form is unknown, as are the ultimate consequences of the proposed legislation.
economic income blackstone uses economic income (ei) as a key measure of value creation, a benchmark of its performance and in making resource deployment and compensation decisions across its five segments. ei represents segment net income before taxes excluding transaction-related charges. transaction-related charges arise from blackstones initial public offering (ipo) and long-term retention programs outside of annual deferred compensation and other
82
corporate actions, including acquisitions. transaction-related charges include equity-based compensation charges, the amortization of intangible assets and contingent consideration associated with acquisitions. ei presents revenues and expenses on a basis that deconsolidates the investment funds we manage. economic net income (eni) represents ei adjusted to include current period taxes. taxes represent the current tax provision (benefit) calculated on income (loss) before provision for taxes. ei, our principal segment measure, is derived from and reconciled to, but not equivalent to, its most directly comparable gaap measure of income (loss) before provision for taxes. (see note 21. segment reporting in the notes to consolidated financial statements in  item 8. financial statements and supplementary data.)
fee related earnings blackstone uses fee related earnings (fre), which is derived from ei, as a measure to highlight earnings from operations excluding: (a) the income related to performance fees and related performance fee compensation costs, (b) income earned from blackstones investments in the blackstone funds, and (c) realized and unrealized gains (losses) from other investments except for such gains (losses) from blackstones treasury cash management strategies. management uses fre as a measure to assess whether recurring revenue from our businesses is sufficient to adequately cover all of our operating expenses and generate profits. fre equals contractual fee revenues, investment income from blackstones treasury cash management strategies and interest income, less (a) compensation expenses (which includes amortization of non-ipo and non-acquisition-related equity-based awards, but excludes amortization of ipo and acquisition-related equity-based awards, carried interest and incentive fee compensation) and (b) other operating expenses. see  liquidity and capital resources  sources of liquidity below for our discussion of fee related earnings.
distributable earnings distributable earnings, which is derived from our segment reported results, is a supplemental measure to assess performance and amounts available for distributions to blackstone unitholders, including blackstone personnel and others who are limited partners of the blackstone holdings partnerships. distributable earnings, which is a measure not prepared under gaap (a non-gaap measure), is intended to show the amount of net realized earnings without the effects of the consolidation of the blackstone funds. distributable earnings is derived from and reconciled to, but not equivalent to, its most directly comparable gaap measure of income (loss) before provision for taxes. see  liquidity and capital resources  sources of liquidity below for our discussion of distributable earnings.
distributable earnings, which is a component of economic net income, is the sum across all segments of: (a) total management and advisory fees, (b) interest and dividend revenue, (c) other revenue, (d) realized performance fees, and (e) realized investment income (loss); less (a) compensation, excluding the expense of equity-based awards, (b) realized performance fee compensation, (c) other operating expenses, and (d) taxes and payables under the tax receivable agreement.
adjusted earnings before interest, taxes and depreciation and amortization adjusted earnings before interest, taxes and depreciation and amortization (adjusted ebitda), is a supplemental non-gaap measure derived from our segment reported results and may be used to assess our ability to service our borrowings. adjusted ebitda represents distributable earnings plus the addition of (a) interest expense, (b) taxes and related payables including payable under tax receivable agreement, and (c) depreciation and amortization. see  liquidity and capital resources  sources of liquidity below for our calculation of adjusted ebitda.
summary walkdown of gaap to non-gaap financial metrics the relationship of our gaap to non-gaap financial measures is presented in the summary walkdown below. the summary walkdown shows how each non-gaap financial measure is related to the other non-gaap financial measures. this presentation is not meant to be a detailed calculation of each measure, but to show the relationship
83
between the measures. for the calculation of each of these non-gaap financial measures and a full reconciliation of income before provision for taxes to distributable earnings, please see  liquidity and capital resources  sources of liquidity.
operating metrics the alternative asset management business is a complex business that is primarily based on managing third party capital and does not require substantial capital investment to support rapid growth. however, there also can be volatility associated with its earnings and cash flows. since our inception, we have developed and used various key operating metrics to assess and monitor the operating performance of our various alternative asset management businesses in order to monitor the effectiveness of our value creating strategies.
assets under management. assets under management refers to the assets we manage. our assets under management equals the sum of:
(a)                  the fair value of the investments held by our carry funds and our side-by-side and co-investment entities managed by us, plus the capital that we are entitled to call from investors in those funds and entities pursuant to the terms of their respective capital commitments, including capital commitments to funds that have yet to commence their investment periods,

84
(b)   the net asset value of our funds of hedge funds, hedge funds and certain registered investment companies,

(c)   the invested capital or fair value of assets we manage pursuant to separately managed accounts,

(d)   the amount of debt and equity outstanding for our clos and cdos during the reinvestment period,

(e)   the aggregate par amount of collateral assets, including principal cash, for our clos and cdos after the reinvestment period,

(f)   the gross amount of assets (including leverage) for certain of our credit-focused registered investment companies, and

(g)   the fair value of common stock, preferred stock, convertible debt, or similar instruments issued by our public reit.

our carry funds are commitment-based drawdown structured funds that do not permit investors to redeem their interests at their election. our funds of hedge funds and hedge funds generally have structures that afford an investor the right to withdraw or redeem their interests on a periodic basis (for example, annually or quarterly), in most cases upon advance written notice, with the majority of our funds requiring from 60 days up to 95 days notice, depending on the fund and the liquidity profile of the underlying assets. investment advisory agreements related to separately managed accounts may generally be terminated by an investor on 30 to 90 days notice.
fee-earning assets under management. fee-earning assets under management refers to the assets we manage on which we derive management and/or performance fees. our fee-earning assets under management equals the sum of:
(a)   for our private equity segment funds and real estate segment carry funds including certain real estate debt investment funds and certain of our hedge fund solutions funds, the amount of capital commitments, remaining invested capital, fair value or par value of assets held, depending on the fee terms of the fund,

(b)   for our credit-focused carry funds, the amount of remaining invested capital (which may include leverage) or net asset value, depending on the fee terms of the fund,

(c)   the remaining invested capital of co-investments managed by us on which we receive fees,

(d)   the net asset value of our funds of hedge funds, hedge funds and certain registered investment companies,

(e)   the invested capital or fair value of assets we manage pursuant to separately managed accounts,

(f)   the net proceeds received from equity offerings and accumulated core earnings of our reits, subject to certain adjustments,

(g)   the aggregate par amount of collateral assets, including principal cash, of our clos and cdos, and

(h)   the gross amount of assets (including leverage) for certain of our credit-focused registered investment companies.

our calculations of assets under management and fee-earning assets under management may differ from the calculations of other asset managers, and as a result this measure may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other asset managers. in addition, our calculation of assets under management includes commitments to, and the fair value of, invested capital in our funds from blackstone and our personnel, regardless of whether such commitments or invested capital are subject to fees. our definitions of assets under management or fee-earning assets under management are not based on any definition of assets under management or fee-earning assets under management that is set forth in the agreements governing the investment funds that we manage.
for our carry funds, total assets under management includes the fair value of the investments held, whereas fee-earning assets under management includes the amount of capital commitments, the remaining amount of
85
invested capital at cost depending on whether the investment period has or has not expired or the fee terms of the fund. as such, fee-earning assets under management may be greater than total assets under management when the aggregate fair value of the remaining investments is less than the cost of those investments.
limited partner capital invested. limited partner capital invested represents the amount of limited partner capital commitments which were invested by our carry and drawdown funds during each period presented, plus the capital invested through co-investments arranged by us that were made by limited partners in investments of our carry funds on which we receive fees or a carried interest allocation or incentive fee.
the amount of committed undrawn capital available for investment, including general partner and employee commitments, is known as dry powder and is an indicator of the capital we have available for future investments.

revenues total revenues were $7.5 billion for the year ended december 31, 2014, an increase of $871.6 million, or 13%, compared to $6.6 billion for the year ended december 31, 2013. the increase was primarily attributable to increases in performance fees and management and advisory fees, net of $830.2 million and $303.3 million, respectively. these increases were partially offset by a decrease in investment income of $266.3 million.
the increase in performance fees was primarily driven by increases in our private equity segment of $1.2 billion, principally due to performance in our bcp v and bcp vi funds, which generated net returns of 24% and 18%, respectively, with bcp v crossing its preferred return threshold during the period. performance fees in our real estate segment decreased by $137.8 million to $2.0 billion due to a year over year decrease in the net appreciation of investments in our brep carry funds from 31.3% to 20.9%. for the year ended december 31, 2014, the increase in carrying value of assets for blackstones contributed real estate funds, including fee-paying co-investments, was driven by sustained strong operating fundamentals in the private portfolio (23.2%, $8.8 billion) and public portfolio appreciation (17.0%, $3.7 billion). performance fees decreased by $75.8 million in our hedge fund solutions segment due to lower returns. performance fees decreased by $199.9 million in our credit segment due to challenging market conditions for lower rated credits in our hedge fund strategies business and a lower rate of appreciation in our rescue lending business.
the increase in management and advisory fees, net was due to increases in our hedge fund solutions segment of $72.0 million, our private equity segment of $71.9 million, our real estate segment of $63.6 million, and our credit segment of $63.8 million. the increase in our hedge fund solutions segment was primarily due to an increase in fee-earning assets under management. the increase in our private equity segment was primarily due to the increase in the funds raised for our tactical opportunities investment vehicles and strategic partners secondary private fund of funds business as well as the inclusion of the strategic partners management fees for the full year. the increase in our real estate segment was principally due to fees generated from fundraising within brep europe iv, brep asia, bpp and invested capital within breds, partially offset by the expiration of brep v and realizations across the portfolio. the increase in our credit segment was driven by the incremental capital raised for our hedge fund strategies business and business development companies.
the decrease in investment income was primarily due to decreases in our real estate and private equity segments of $152.4 million and $71.0 million, respectively. the decrease in our real estate segment was due to a year over year decrease in the net appreciation of investments in our brep vi fund. blackstone has a larger investment in brep vi than in other brep funds. the decrease in our private equity segment was driven by our bcp v and bep funds which generated strong net returns of 24% and 12%, respectively, for the year but were slightly lower than the returns generated in the full year 2013.
total revenues were $6.6 billion for the year ended december 31, 2013, an increase of $2.6 billion, or 65%, compared to $4.0 billion for the year ended december 31, 2012. performance fees and investment income increased between these periods by $2.0 billion and $450.1 million, respectively, and management and advisory fees, net increased by $163.3 million.
performance fees in our real estate segment increased by $1.3 billion due to the strong performance of our brep carry funds and were primarily driven by valuation gains on investments within our brep vi and brep vii funds. the valuation gains were driven by the successful initial public offerings of hilton, extended stay and brixmor as well as gains resulting from improving fundamentals of equity office and invitation homes. performance fees in our private equity segment increased by $470.0 million principally due to performance in our bcp iv, bep and bcp vi funds, which had net returns of 23%, 36% and 12%, respectively. performance fees increased by $123.0 million in our hedge fund solutions segment due to the increase in fee-earning assets under management above their respective high water marks and/or hurdle, and therefore eligible for performance fees. performance fees increased by $88.4 million in our credit segment due to higher returns in our hedge fund strategies funds and continued strong underlying company performance in the portfolios of our carry funds.
90
the increase in investment income was primarily due to increases in our real estate and private equity segments of $266.4 million and $138.6 million, respectively. the increase in our real estate segment was driven by valuation gains on investments across our global real estate funds including the successful initial public offerings of hilton, extended stay and brixmor. the increase in our private equity segment was driven by returns across all of our significant funds. the portfolio benefited from strong performance of our public holdings through the year, including the successful initial public offerings of pinnacle foods, seaworld parks & entertainment, merlin entertainments and hilton, while our private portfolio benefited from investments in the healthcare, industrial and retail/consumer sectors.
the increase in management and advisory fees, net was due to increases in our hedge fund solutions segment of $61.6 million, our financial advisory segment of $53.9 million, our private equity segment of $16.7 million and our real estate segment of $13.6 million. the increase in our hedge fund solutions segment was primarily due to an increase in fee-earning assets under management. the increase in our financial advisory segment was due to the number and size of transactions completed during the year ended december 31, 2013 compared to the prior year. the increase in our private equity segment was primarily due to the increase in the funds raised for our tactical opportunities investment vehicles as well as the addition of the strategic partners secondary private fund of funds business. the increase in our real estate segment was primarily driven by the increase in funds raised for our brep asia, brep europe iv, bxmt and breds ii funds offset by the expiration of the brep iv fund and decrease in management fees earned by the acquired asian real estate platform.
expenses expenses were $3.9 billion for the year ended december 31, 2014, a decrease of $10.9 million compared to $3.9 billion for the year ended december 31, 2013. the decrease was primarily attributable to a decrease in performance fee compensation of $127.7 million, partially offset by increases of $75.0 million, $24.4 million and $13.6 million, respectively, in general, administrative and other, compensation and interest expense. the decrease in performance fee compensation was due to lower compensation ratios on performance fee revenue and pre-ipo deals. a significant amount of the performance fees granted to employees on deals closed prior to the ipo were exchanged for units of blackstone at the time of the ipo. therefore, for these pre-ipo deals, blackstone retains significantly more of the performance fees that it earns than it does for deals closed after the ipo. this results in lower performance fee compensation for pre-ipo deals. a significant amount of the performance fees granted to employees on deals closed prior to the ipo were exchanged for units of blackstone at the time of the ipo. therefore, for these pre-ipo deals, blackstone retains significantly more of the performance fees that it earns than it does for deals closed after the ipo. this results in lower performance fee compensation for pre-ipo deals. the $75.0 million increase in general, administrative and other was primarily due to spinoff transaction related charges, professional fees, occupancy increases and business development costs. the $24.4 million increase in compensation was due to an overall increase in revenue, on which compensation is based, offset by lower equity-based amortization charges on our transaction-related awards and a reduction of compensation expense due to a change in the terms of deferred compensation plan awards which require future service and are therefore no longer expensed immediately. this resulted in $102.6 million less compensation recorded in the fourth quarter of 2014 than would have been recorded under the prior plan. the $13.6 million increase in interest expense was primarily related to blackstones issuance of senior notes during the second quarter of 2014.
expenses were $3.9 billion for the year ended december 31, 2013, an increase of $606.1 million, or 19%, compared to $3.3 billion for the year ended december 31, 2012. the increase was primarily attributable to increases in total compensation and benefits of $652.4 million and interest expense of $35.1 million, partially offset by a $74.3 million decrease in general, administrative and other. the increase in total compensation and benefits was comprised of a $899.6 million increase in performance fee compensation due to the increase in performance fees revenue and partially offset by a $247.2 million decrease in compensation due mainly to a decrease in the equity-based amortization charges on our transaction-related awards. the $35.1 million increase in interest expense was primarily related to blackstones issuance of senior notes during the third quarter of 2012. these increases were partially offset by a $74.3 million decrease in general, administrative and other, which was primarily due to decreases in depreciation and amortization and professional expenses.

other income other income was $357.9 million for the year ended december 31, 2014, a decrease of $44.3 million compared to $402.1 million for the year ended december 31, 2013. the decrease was comprised of decreases in net gains from fund investment activities of $23.8 million and reversal of tax receivable agreement of $20.5 million.
other income  net gains from fund investment activities is attributable to the consolidated blackstone funds which are largely held by third party investors. as such, most of this other income was eliminated from the results attributable to the blackstone group l.p. through the redeemable non-controlling interests and non-controlling interests items in the consolidated statements of operations.
other income  net gains from fund investment activities was $357.9 million for the year ended december 31, 2014, a decrease of $23.8 million compared to $381.7 million for the year ended december 31, 2013. this decrease was primarily comprised of decreases in our hedge fund solutions and private equity segments of $99.4 million and $25.0 million, respectively, partially offset by increases of $40.7 million and $39.4 million in our real estate and credit segments, respectively. the decrease in our hedge fund solutions segment was primarily the result of a decrease in investment performance from certain of our consolidated funds. the real estate increase was driven by valuation gains on investments across our global real estate funds. the increase in our credit segment was primarily due to lower valuations on the liabilities of certain consolidated clo vehicles, which led to increases in unrealized gains.
for the year ended december 31, 2014, there was no reversal of tax receivable agreement resulting in a decrease of $20.5 million.
other income was $402.1 million for the year ended december 31, 2013, an increase of $146.0 million compared to $256.1 million for the year ended december 31, 2012. the increase was comprised of an increase in net gains from fund investment activities of $125.5 million and income attributable to the reversal of the tax receivable agreement liability of $20.5 million.
other income  net gains from fund investment activities is attributable to the consolidated blackstone funds which are largely held by third party investors. as such, most of this other income was eliminated from the results attributable to the blackstone group l.p. through the redeemable non-controlling interests and non-controlling interests items in the consolidated statements of operations.
other income  net gains from fund investment activities was $381.7 million for the year ended december 31, 2013, an increase of $125.5 million compared to $256.1 million for the year ended december 31, 2012. this increase was primarily comprised of increases in our hedge fund solutions, real estate and private equity segments of $111.3 million, $67.7 million and $54.3 million, respectively, partially offset by a decrease of $107.8 million in our credit segment. the increase in our hedge fund solutions segment was primarily the result of an increase in investment performance from certain of our consolidated funds. the real estate increase in 2013 was driven by valuation gains on investments across our global real estate funds. the private equity increase in 2013 was driven by returns across all of our significant funds. the decrease in our credit segment was primarily due to higher valuations on the liabilities of the consolidated clo vehicles, which led to increases in unrealized losses.
also included in other income in 2013 was $20.5 million of income attributable to the reversal of the tax receivable agreement liability.
provision for taxes blackstones provision for taxes for the years ended december 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012 was $291.2 million, $255.6 million and $185.0 million, respectively. this resulted in an effective tax rate of 7.3%, 8.1% and 18.2%, respectively, based on our income before provision for taxes of $4.0 billion, $3.1 billion and $1.0 billion, respectively.
92
one factor contributed to the 0.8% decrease in the effective tax rate for the year ended december 31, 2014 compared to the year ended december 31, 2013. in 2014 and 2013, book equity-based compensation expense exceeded the tax deductible equity-based compensation expense due to the issuance of units that are not tax deductible since they represent a value for value exchange for tax purposes. although the amount of the excess book expense over the tax expense does not change significantly in 2014 compared to 2013, the impact of the effective tax rate increase was 1.1% and 1.6% in 2014 and 2013, respectively, resulting from the significant increase in pre-tax book income in 2014 compared to 2013.
two factors contributed to the 10.1% decrease in the effective tax rate for the year ended december 31, 2013 compared to the year ended december 31, 2012. first, pre-tax book income includes pre-tax income of $2.6 billion for 2013 and pre-tax income of $683.2 million for 2012 that is passed through to common unit holders and non-controlling interest holders and is not subject to tax by the partnership and its subsidiaries. the year over year change resulted in a decrease to the effective tax rate of 5.1% when comparing 2013 to 2012.
second, in both 2013 and 2012, book equity-based compensation expense exceeded the tax deductible equity-based compensation expense due to the issuance of units that are not tax deductible since they represent a value for value exchange for tax purposes. although the amount of the excess book expense over the tax expense does not change significantly in 2013 compared to 2012, the impact of the effective tax rate increase was 1.6% and 9.3% in 2013 and 2012, respectively, resulting from the significant increase in pre-tax book income in 2013 compared to 2012.
all factors except for the reversal of the deferred tax asset are expected to impact the effective tax rate for future years.
additional information regarding our income taxes can be found in note 14. income taxes in the notes to consolidated financial statements in  item 8. financial statements and supplementary data of this filing.
non-controlling interests in consolidated entities the net income (loss) attributable to redeemable non-controlling interests in consolidated entities and net income attributable to non-controlling interests in consolidated entities is attributable to the consolidated blackstone funds. the amounts of these items vary directly with the performance of the consolidated blackstone funds and largely eliminate the amount of other income  net gains from fund investment activities from the net income (loss) attributable to the blackstone group l.p.
net income (loss) attributable to non-controlling interests in blackstone holdings is derived from the income before provision for taxes, excluding the net gains from fund investment activities and the reversal of tax receivable agreement liability, and the percentage allocation of the income between blackstone holdings and the blackstone group l.p. after considering any contractual arrangements that govern the allocation of income (loss) such as fees allocable to the blackstone group l.p.
for the years ended december 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, the net income before taxes allocated to blackstone holdings was 47.9%, 49.3% and 53.1%, respectively. the decreases of 1.4% and 3.8% were primarily due to conversions of blackstone holdings partnership units to blackstone common units and the vesting of common units.
the other income  reversal of tax receivable agreement liability was entirely allocated to the blackstone group l.p.

limited partner capital invested was $24.4 billion for the year ended december 31, 2014, an increase of $10.2 billion, or 72%, from $14.2 billion for the year ended december 31, 2013. the amount of limited partner capital invested is a function of finding opportunistic investments that fit our investment philosophy and strategy in each of our segments as well as the relative size and timing of investment closings within those segments. our private equity segment deployed significantly greater capital in 2014 than in 2013 as we found strong opportunities that fit within our core investment philosophy for our corporate private equity funds as well as increased capital deployment opportunities within our tactical opportunities and strategic partners businesses. our real estate segment deployed $11.2 billion of capital in 2014, a 15% increase from 2013 as investments outside of the u.s. comprised 62% of total investments up from 44% in 2013. our hedge fund solutions segment is investing capital based on the relative investment opportunities from the hedge fund manager seeding platform and general partner interests vehicle. in our credit segment, capital deployed for the year ended december 31, 2014 was higher compared to the year ended december 31, 2013 primarily due to a greater number of investment opportunities in our carry funds that fit within our investment philosophy.

(a)   available capital represents total investable capital commitments, including side-by-side, adjusted for certain expenses and expired or recallable capital, less invested capital. this amount is not reduced by outstanding commitments to investments.

(b)   multiple of invested capital (moic) represents carrying value, before management fees, expenses and carried interest, divided by invested capital.

(c)   net internal rate of return (irr) represents the annualized inception to december 31, 2014 irr on total invested capital based on realized proceeds and unrealized value, as applicable, after management fees, expenses and carried interest.

(d)   returns for other funds and co-invest are not meaningful as these funds have no or little realizations.

(e)   brep co-investment represents co-investment capital raised for various brep investments. the net irr reflected is calculated by aggregating each co-investments realized proceeds and unrealized value, as applicable, after management fees, expenses and carried interest.

(f)   excludes capital trust drawdown funds.

(g)   the total investments moic for mezzanine i, mezzanine ii, rescue lending i and rescue lending ii funds, excluding recycled capital during the investment period, was
2.0x, 1.7x, 1.6x and 1.4x, respectively. funds presented represent flagship credit drawdown funds only.

segment analysis discussed below is our ei for each of our segments. this information is reflected in the manner utilized by our senior management to make operating decisions, assess performance and allocate resources. references to our sectors or investments may also refer to portfolio companies and investments of the underlying funds that we manage.
for segment reporting purposes, revenues and expenses are presented on a basis that deconsolidates the investment funds we manage. as a result, segment revenues are greater than those presented on a consolidated gaap basis because fund management fees recognized in certain segments are received from the blackstone funds and eliminated in consolidation when presented on a consolidated gaap basis. furthermore, segment expenses are lower than related amounts presented on a consolidated gaap basis due to the exclusion of fund expenses that are paid by limited partners and the elimination of non-controlling interests.

(a)   changes in previous period returns are due to the repayment of fund level financing with capital drawn down from the respective funds general and limited partners.

(b)   net returns are based on the change in carrying value (realized and unrealized) after management fees, expenses and carried interest allocations.

(c)   2012 returns for tactical opportunities are not meaningful as a material portion of the funds capital had not been invested.

the corporate private equity funds within the private equity segment have three contributed funds with closed investment periods: bcp iv, bcp v and bcom. as of december 31, 2014, bcp iv was above its carried interest threshold (i.e., the preferred return payable to its limited partners before the general partner is eligible to receive carried interest) and would still be above its carried interest threshold even if all remaining investments were valued at zero. bcp v is comprised of two fund classes based on the timings of fund closings, the bcp v main fund and bcp v-ac fund. within these fund classes, the general partner (gp) is subject to equalization such that (a) the gp accrues carried interest when the total carried interest for the combined fund classes is positive and (b) the gp realizes carried interest so long as clawback obligations, if any, for the combined fund classes are fully satisfied. bcom is currently above its carried interest threshold and has generated inception to date positive returns. we are entitled to retain previously realized carried interest up to 20% of bcoms net gains. as a result, performance fees are recognized from bcom on current period gains and losses.

revenues revenues were $3.0 billion for the year ended december 31, 2014, a decrease of $218.4 million compared to $3.2 billion for the year ended december 31, 2013. the decrease in revenues was primarily attributable to decreases in investment income and performance fees of $152.4 million and $137.8 million, respectively, partially offset by an increase in total management fees, net of $63.6 million.
investment income was $250.2 million for the year ended december 31, 2014, a decrease of $152.4 million compared to $402.6 million for the year ended december 31, 2013. the decrease in investment income was due to a year over year decrease in the net appreciation of investments in our brep vi fund. blackstone has a larger investment in brep vi than in other brep funds.
performance fees, which are determined on a fund by fund basis, were $2.0 billion for the year ended december 31, 2014, a decrease of $137.8 million compared to $2.2 billion for the year ended december 31, 2013. performance fees decreased by $137.8 million due to a year over year decrease in the net appreciation of investments in our brep carry funds from 31.3% to 20.9%. for the year ended december 31, 2014, the increase in carrying value of assets for blackstones contributed real estate funds, including fee-paying co-investments was driven by sustained strong operating fundamentals in the private portfolio (23.2%, $8.8 billion) and public portfolio appreciation (17.0%, $3.7 billion). our breds drawdown and real estate hedge funds appreciated 7.2% and 5.3%, respectively.
total management fees, net were $685.7 million for the year ended december 31, 2014, an increase of $63.6 million compared to $622.0 million for the year ended december 31, 2013, primarily attributable to increases in base management fees. base management fees were $628.5 million for the year ended december 31, 2014, an increase of $63.3 million compared to $565.2 million for the year ended december 31, 2013. the increase was principally due to fees generated from fundraising within brep europe iv, brep asia, bpp and invested capital within breds, partially offset by the expiration of brep v and realizations across the portfolio.
revenues were $3.2 billion for the year ended december 31, 2013, an increase of $1.6 billion compared to $1.6 billion for the year ended december 31, 2012. the increase in revenues was primarily attributable to an increase of $1.3 billion in performance fees and a $266.4 million increase in investment income.
performance fees, which are determined on a fund by fund basis, were $2.2 billion for the year ended december 31, 2013, an increase of $1.3 billion compared to $874.4 million for the year ended december 31, 2012. performance fees increased due to the strong performance of our brep carry funds and were primarily driven by valuation gains on investments within our brep vi and brep vii funds. the valuation gains were driven by the successful initial public offerings of hilton, extended stay and brixmor as well as gains resulting from improving fundamentals of equity office and invitation homes. for the year ended december 31, 2013, the carrying value of assets for blackstones contributed real estate funds, including fee-paying co-investments, increased 31.3%. our breds drawdown and real estate hedge funds appreciated 10.4% and 15.6%, respectively.
investment income was $402.6 million for the year ended december 31, 2013, an increase of $266.4 million compared to $136.2 million for the year ended december 31, 2012. the increase in investment income was primarily driven by the year over year net increase in the appreciation of investments across our global real estate funds.
expenses expenses were $1.1 billion for the year ended december 31, 2014, a decrease of $29.4 million, compared to $1.1 billion for the year ended december 31, 2013. the decrease was primarily attributable to a decrease of performance fee compensation of $91.1 million, partially offset by increases in compensation and other operating expenses of $32.1 million and $29.7 million, respectively. the decrease in performance fee compensation is the
111
result of a decrease in performance fees revenue. the increase in compensation is due to an overall increase in management fees, on which a portion of compensation is based, as well as an increase in headcount to support the growth of the business. the increase in other operating expenses was primarily due to an increase in interest expense allocated to the segment as well as increases in business development and professional fees.
expenses were $1.1 billion for the year ended december 31, 2013, an increase of $499.9 million, compared to $635.2 million for the year ended december 31, 2012. the increase was primarily attributable to an increase in performance fee compensation of $484.2 million as a result of an increase in performance fees revenue and an increase in compensation of $23.1 million primarily due to the acquisition of bxmt and the growth of our real estate business.

(a)                                         the general partner of each fund is allocated carried interest when the annualized returns, net of management fees and expenses, exceed the preferred return as dictated by the fund agreements. the preferred return is calculated for each limited partner individually. the gain to cross carried interest threshold represents the increase in equity at the fund level (excluding our side-by-side investments) that is required for the general partner to begin accruing carried interest, assuming the gain is earned pro rata across the funds investments and is achieved at the reporting date.

(b)   total enterprise value is the respective funds pro rata ownership of the privately held portfolio companies enterprise value.

the real estate segment has six funds in their investment period, which were above their respective carried interest thresholds as of december 31, 2014: brep vii, brep asia, brep europe iv and three funds within breds ii.

revenues revenues were $657.8 million for the year ended december 31, 2014, an increase of $9.2 million compared to $648.6 million for the year ended december 31, 2013. the increase in revenues was primarily attributable to increases in total management fees, net and investment income of $72.0 million and $8.4 million, respectively, partially offset by a decrease in performance fees of $75.8 million.

total management fees, net were $478.5 million for the year ended december 31, 2014, an increase of $72.0 million compared to $406.6 million for the year ended december 31, 2013, primarily due to an increase in base management fees. base management fees were $483.0 million for the year ended december 31, 2014, an increase of $73.7 million compared to $409.3 million for the year ended december 31, 2013. this was driven by an increase in fee-earning assets under management of 16% from the prior year, which was from net inflows and market appreciation.
investment income was $26.7 million for the year ended december 31, 2014, an increase of $8.4 million compared to $18.3 million for the year ended december 31, 2013. the increase in investment income was primarily driven by the year over year net appreciation of investments of which blackstone owns a share.
performance fees were $139.7 million for the year ended december 31, 2014, a decrease of $75.8 million compared to $215.5 million for the year ended december 31, 2013. this was primarily due to lower returns. the net returns of the underlying assets within baams principal solutions composite funds were 5.9% during the year ended december 31, 2014.
revenues were $648.6 million for the year ended december 31, 2013, an increase of $189.4 million compared to $459.2 million for the year ended december 31, 2012. the increase in revenues was primarily attributable to an increase of $123.0 million in performance fees and an increase of $61.6 million in total management fees.
performance fees were $215.5 million for the year ended december 31, 2013, an increase of $123.0 million compared to $92.5 million for the year ended december 31, 2012. this was primarily due to an increase in fee-earning assets under management above their respective high water marks and/or hurdle, and therefore eligible for performance fees. the net returns of the underlying assets within baams principal solutions composite funds were 11.4% during the year ended december 31, 2013.
total management fees were $406.6 million for the year ended december 31, 2013, an increase of $61.6 million compared to $345.0 million for the year ended december 31, 2012, primarily due to an increase in base management fees. base management fees were $409.3 million for the year ended december 31, 2013, an increase of $63.1 million compared to $346.2 million for the year ended december 31, 2012. this was driven by an increase in fee-earning assets under management of 22% from the prior year, which was from net inflows and market appreciation.
expenses expenses were $260.0 million for the year ended december 31, 2014, a decrease of $12.1 million compared to the year ended december 31, 2013. the decrease was primarily attributable to a $26.5 million decrease in performance fee compensation and a $4.8 million decrease in compensation, partially offset by a $19.2 million increase in other operating expenses. performance fee compensation was $42.2 million for the year ended december 31, 2014, a decrease of $26.5 million compared to $68.6 million for the year ended december 31, 2013 due to the decrease in performance fees revenue. compensation was $131.7 million for the year ended december 31, 2014, a decrease of $4.8 million compared to $136.5 million for the prior year, due to a change in the terms of deferred compensation plan awards which more than offset the increase in management fees. other operating expenses were $86.1 million for the year ended december 31, 2014, an increase of $19.2 million compared to $67.0 million for the year ended december 31, 2013, primarily resulting from an increase in interest expense allocated to the segment as well as an increase in professional fees.
expenses were $272.1 million for the year ended december 31, 2013, an increase of $70.1 million compared to the year ended december 31, 2012. the increase was attributable to a $44.3 million increase in performance fee compensation, a $16.7 million increase in compensation and a $9.2 million increase in other operating expenses. performance fee compensation was $68.6 million for the year ended december 31, 2013, an increase of $44.3 million compared to $24.4 million for the year ended december 31, 2012 due to the increase in performance fees revenue. compensation was $136.5 million for the year ended december 31, 2013, an increase of
115
$16.7 million compared to $119.7 million for the prior year, as a portion of it was related to the segments results, exclusive of performance fees and investment income. other operating expenses were $67.0 million for the year ended december 31, 2013, an increase of $9.2 million compared to $57.8 million for the year ended december 31, 2012, primarily resulting from an increase in interest expense allocated to the segment.

(a)                                              estimated % above high water mark and/or hurdle represents the percentage of fee-earning assets under management eligible for incentive fees that as of the dates presented would earn incentive fees when the applicable baam managed fund has positive investment performance (relative to a hurdle, where applicable). incremental positive performance in the applicable blackstone funds may cause additional assets to reach their respective high water mark and/or hurdle, thereby resulting in an increase in estimated % above high water mark and/or hurdle.

(b)                                for the baam managed funds, at december 31, 2014 the incremental appreciation needed for the 6% of fee-earning assets under management below their respective high water marks and/or hurdle to reach their respective high water marks and/or hurdle was $57.7 million, an increase of $3.5 million, or 6.5%, compared to $54.2 million at december 31, 2013. of the fee-earning assets under management below their respective high water marks and/or hurdle as of december 31, 2014, 94% were within 5% of reaching their respective high water mark and/or hurdle.

revenues revenues were $742.5 million for the year ended december 31, 2014, which were $137.7 million lower compared to $880.3 million for the year ended december 31, 2013. the decrease in revenues was primarily attributable to lower performance fees of $199.9 million, partially offset by an increase of $63.8 million in total management fees, net.
performance fees were $257.2 million for the year ended december 31, 2014, which were $199.9 million lower compared to the prior year. this decrease was primarily due to lower rates of appreciation in our hedge fund strategies business and our rescue lending business. the net returns of blackstones credit segment flagship funds were -1.5% for the hedge funds, 19.0% for the mezzanine funds and 11.9% for the rescue lending funds for the year ended december 31, 2014.
total management fees, net were $450.2 million for the year ended december 31, 2014, an increase of $63.8 million compared to $386.4 million for the year ended december 31, 2013. this increase was primarily attributable to the growth in fee-earning assets under management for our hedge fund strategies business and our business development companies.
revenues were $880.3 million for the year ended december 31, 2013, an increase of $101.9 million compared to $778.4 million for the year ended december 31, 2012. this change was primarily attributable to increases of $88.4 million in performance fees and $5.3 million in total management fees.
performance fees were $457.1 million for the year ended december 31, 2013, an increase of $88.4 million compared to the prior year. this change was primarily attributable to higher returns in our hedge fund strategies funds and continued strong underlying company performance in the portfolios of our carry funds. the net returns of blackstones credit segment funds were 18.2% for the hedge funds, 17.9% for the mezzanine funds and 24.3% for the rescue lending funds for the year ended december 31, 2013.
total management fees were $386.4 million for the year ended december 31, 2013, an increase of $5.3 million compared to $381.1 million for the year ended december 31, 2012. this change was primarily attributable to an increase of $52.9 million in base management fees due to the growth in fee-earning assets under management and partially offset by an increase of $35.3 million in management fee offsets (primarily due to a $29.6 million adjustment in connection with placement fees reimbursed to investors in certain drawdown funds from the second quarter of 2011 through the third quarter of 2013) and a decrease of $12.3 million in transaction and other fees.
expenses expenses were $411.8 million for the year ended december 31, 2014, a decrease of $110.0 million compared to $521.8 million for the year ended december 31, 2013. the decrease in expenses was primarily attributable to a decrease of $105.2 million in performance fee compensation. the decrease in performance fee compensation was due to lower performance fees revenue.
expenses were $521.8 million for the year ended december 31, 2013, an increase of $68.7 million compared to $453.1 million for the year ended december 31, 2012. the increase in expenses was primarily attributable to increases of $51.8 million in performance fee compensation due to the increase in performance fees revenue and $12.5 million in other operating expenses primarily due to an increase in interest expense allocated to the segment, partially offset by a reduction in fund start-up costs.

revenues revenues were $434.3 million for the year ended december 31, 2014, an increase of $14.1 million, or 3%, compared to $420.2 million for the year ended december 31, 2013. the increase in revenues was driven primarily by increases in blackstone advisory partners (bap) financial and strategic advisory business and the fund placement business, partially offset by a decrease in restructuring and reorganization business. the increase in bap was primarily due to improving global mergers and acquisitions activity as well as a greater number of closed transactions. revenue for the fund placement business increased slightly year-over-year and resulted in a record year. restructuring and reorganization experienced a decrease in revenues, while 2014 was still one of the groups best years in its history. revenue for the capital markets business was essentially flat but experienced a positive 2014 acting as underwriter or arranger for over 25 deals.
revenues were $420.2 million for the year ended december 31, 2013, an increase of $53.4 million, or 15%, compared to $366.8 million for the year ended december 31, 2012. the increase in revenues was driven primarily by increases in restructuring and reorganization, capital markets and the fund placement business, partially offset by a decrease in baps financial and strategic advisory business. the increase in restructuring and reorganization was primarily driven by an increase in the number and size of transactions compared to the prior year. the capital markets business was formed in late 2012 and during the year ended december 31, 2013 acted as underwriter or arranger for 26 deals. the increase in fees earned by the fund placement business was due primarily to an increase in the number of transactions that closed during the period. bap experienced a decrease in revenues related to the overall decline in the mergers and acquisitions market, lower fees on closed transactions and timing of some deals.

expenses expenses were $319.0 million for the year ended december 31, 2014, a decrease of $25.5 million, or 7%, compared to $344.5 million for the year ended december 31, 2013. compensation decreased $31.4 million compared to $262.3 million for the year ended december 31, 2013, principally due to relatively flat revenue, on which a portion of compensation is based, and due to a change in the terms of deferred compensation plan awards. this decrease was partially offset by an increase in other operating expenses primarily due to interest expense allocated to the segment as well as an increase in bad debt expense.
expenses were $344.5 million for the year ended december 31, 2013, an increase of $24.8 million, or 8%, compared to $319.7 million for the year ended december 31, 2012. compensation increased $27.2 million compared to $235.1 million for the year ended december 31, 2012, principally due to an overall increase in total fee revenue across the segment. compensation expense for these businesses is related to their financial performance. other operating expenses decreased $2.4 million from the year ended december 31, 2012.
liquidity and capital resources general blackstones business model derives revenue primarily from third party assets under management and from advisory businesses. blackstone is not a capital or balance sheet intensive business and targets operating expense levels such that total management and advisory fees exceed total operating expenses each period. as a result, we require limited capital resources to support the working capital or operating needs of our businesses. we draw primarily on the long-term committed capital of our limited partner investors to fund the investment requirements of the blackstone funds and use our own realizations and cash flows to invest in growth initiatives, make commitments to our own funds, where our minimum general partner commitments are generally less than 5% of the limited partner commitments of a fund, or pay distributions to unitholders.
fluctuations in our statement of financial condition result primarily from activities of the blackstone funds which are consolidated as well as business transactions, such as the issuance of senior notes described below. the majority economic ownership interests of the blackstone funds are reflected as redeemable non-controlling interests in consolidated entities, non-controlling interests in consolidated entities and appropriated partners capital in the consolidated financial statements. the consolidation of these blackstone funds has no net effect on the partnerships net income or partners capital. additionally, fluctuations in our statement of financial condition also include appreciation or depreciation in blackstone investments in the blackstone funds, additional investments and redemptions of such interests in the blackstone funds and the collection of receivables related to management and advisory fees.
total assets were $31.5 billion as of december 31, 2014, up from december 31, 2013. total liabilities were $14.2 billion as of december 31, 2014, a decrease of $1.1 billion from december 31, 2013. the decrease in total liabilities was primarily due to a decrease in loans payable of $1.5 billion resulting from the deconsolidation of certain clo vehicles and loan repayments.
for the year ended december 31, 2014, we had total fee related revenues of $2.7 billion and related expenses of $1.7 billion, generating fee related earnings of $1.0 billion and distributable earnings of $3.1 billion.
sources of liquidity we have multiple sources of liquidity to meet our capital needs, including annual cash flows, accumulated earnings in the businesses, investments in our own treasury and liquid funds and access to our debt capacity, including our $1.1 billion committed revolving credit facility and the proceeds from our 2009, 2010, 2012 and 2014 issuances of senior notes. as of december 31, 2014, blackstone had $1.4 billion in cash, $1.8 billion invested in blackstones treasury cash management strategies, $175.8 million invested in liquid blackstone funds,
122
$2.3 billion invested in illiquid blackstone funds and $132.0 million invested in other investments, against $2.1 billion in borrowings from our bond issuances, and no borrowings outstanding under our revolving credit facility.
in addition to the cash we received in connection with our ipo, debt offerings and our borrowing facilities, we expect to receive (a) cash generated from operating activities, (b) carried interest and incentive income realizations, and (c) realizations on the carry and hedge fund investments that we make. the amounts received from these three sources in particular may vary substantially from year to year and quarter to quarter depending on the frequency and size of realization events or net returns experienced by our investment funds. our available capital could be adversely affected if there are prolonged periods of few substantial realizations from our investment funds accompanied by substantial capital calls for new investments from those investment funds. therefore, blackstones commitments to our funds are taken into consideration when managing our overall liquidity and cash position.
we use distributable earnings, which is derived from our segment reported results, as a supplemental non-gaap measure to assess performance and amounts available for distributions to blackstone unitholders, including blackstone personnel and others who are limited partners of the blackstone holdings partnerships. distributable earnings is intended to show the amount of net realized earnings without the effects of the consolidation of the blackstone funds. distributable earnings is derived from and reconciled to, but not equivalent to, its most directly comparable gaap measure of income (loss) before provision for taxes. distributable earnings, which is a component of economic net income, is the sum across all segments of: (a) total management and advisory fees, (b) interest and dividend revenue, (c) other revenue, (d) realized performance fees, and (e) realized investment income (loss); less (a) compensation, excluding the expense of equity-based awards, (b) realized performance fee compensation, (c) other operating expenses, and (d) taxes and related payables including the payable under tax receivable agreement.

(b)   this adjustment adds back to income before provision for taxes amounts for the amortization of intangibles which are associated with blackstones initial public offering and other corporate actions.

(c)   this adjustment adds back to income before provision for taxes the amount of (income) associated with non-controlling interests of consolidated entities and includes the amount of management fee revenues associated with consolidated clo entities.

(d)   taxes represent the current tax provision calculated on income before provision for taxes.

liquidity needs we expect that our primary liquidity needs will be cash to (a) provide capital to facilitate the growth of our existing businesses which principally includes funding our general partner and co-investment commitments to our funds, (b) provide capital to facilitate our expansion into new businesses that are complementary, (c) pay operating expenses, including cash compensation to our employees and other obligations as they arise, (d) fund modest capital expenditures, (e) repay borrowings and related interest costs, (f) pay income taxes, and (g) make distributions to our unitholders and the holders of blackstone holdings partnership units. our own capital commitments to our funds, the funds we invest in and our investment strategies as of december 31, 2014 consisted of the following:

in the table above. in addition, certain senior managing directors and other professionals are required to fund a de minimis amount of the commitment in the other private equity, real estate and credit-focused carry funds. we expect our commitments to be drawn down over time and to be funded by available cash and cash generated from operations and realizations. taking into account prevailing market conditions and both the liquidity and cash or liquid investment balances, we believe that the sources of liquidity described below will be more than sufficient to fund our working capital requirements.

(b)   represents capital commitments to a number of other funds in each respective segment.

blackstone, through indirect subsidiaries, has a $1.1 billion unsecured revolving credit facility (the credit facility) with citibank, n.a., as administrative agent with a maturity date of may 29, 2019. borrowings may also be made in u.k. sterling, euros, swiss francs or japanese yen, in each case subject to certain sub-limits. the credit facility contains customary representations, covenants and events of default. financial covenants consist of a maximum net leverage ratio and a requirement to keep a minimum amount of fee-earning assets under management, each tested quarterly.
in august 2009, blackstone holdings finance co. l.l.c. issued $600 million in aggregate principal amount of 6.625% senior notes which will mature on august 15, 2019, unless earlier redeemed or repurchased. in september 2010, blackstone holdings finance co. l.l.c. issued $400 million in aggregate principal amount of 5.875% senior notes which will mature on march 15, 2021, unless earlier redeemed or repurchased. in august 2012, blackstone holdings finance co. l.l.c. issued $400 million in aggregate principal amount of 4.75% senior notes which will mature on february 15, 2023 and $250 million in aggregate principal amount of 6.25% senior notes which will mature on august 15, 2042. in april 2014, blackstone holdings finance co. l.l.c. issued $500 million in aggregate principal amount of 5.000% senior notes which will mature on june 15, 2044, unless earlier redeemed or repurchased. (these issuances of senior notes are collectively referred to as the notes.) the notes are unsecured and unsubordinated obligations of blackstone holdings finance co. l.l.c. and are fully and unconditionally guaranteed, jointly and severally, by the blackstone group l.p. and each of the blackstone holdings partnerships. the notes contain customary covenants and financial restrictions that, among other things, limit blackstone holdings finance co. l.l.c. and the guarantors ability, subject to certain exceptions, to incur indebtedness secured by liens on voting stock or profit participating equity interests of their subsidiaries or merge, consolidate or sell, transfer or lease assets. the notes also contain customary events of default. all or a portion of the notes may be redeemed at our option, in whole or in part, at any time and from time to time, prior to their stated maturity, at the make-whole redemption price set forth in the notes. if a change of control repurchase event occurs, the notes are subject to repurchase at the repurchase price as set forth in the notes.
in january 2008, the board of directors of our general partner, blackstone group management l.l.c., authorized the repurchase of up to $500 million of our common units and blackstone holdings partnership units. under this unit repurchase program, units may be repurchased from time to time in open market transactions, in privately negotiated transactions or otherwise. the timing and the actual number of blackstone common units and blackstone holdings partnership units repurchased will depend on a variety of factors, including legal requirements, price and economic and market conditions. this unit repurchase program may be suspended or discontinued at any time and does not have a specified expiration date. during the year ended december 31, 2014, no units were repurchased. as of december 31, 2014, the amount remaining under this program available for repurchases was $335.8 million.
distributions distributable earnings, which is derived from blackstones segment reported results, is a supplemental measure to assess performance and amounts available for distributions to blackstone unitholders, including blackstone personnel and others who are limited partners of the blackstone holdings partnerships. distributable earnings is intended to show the amount of net realized earnings without the effects of the consolidation of the blackstone funds. distributable earnings, which is a component of economic net income, is the sum across all segments of: (a) total management and advisory fees, (b) interest and dividend revenue, (c) other revenue,
129
(d) realized performance fees, and (e) realized investment income (loss); less (a) compensation, excluding the expense of equity-based awards, (b) realized performance fee compensation, (c) other operating expenses, and (d) taxes and related payables including the payable under tax receivable agreement.
our intention is to distribute quarterly to common unitholders approximately 85% of the blackstone group l.p.s share of distributable earnings, subject to adjustment by amounts determined by blackstones general partner to be necessary or appropriate to provide for the conduct of its business, to make appropriate investments in its business and funds, to comply with applicable law, any of its debt instruments or other agreements, or to provide for future cash requirements such as tax-related payments, clawback obligations and distributions to unitholders for any ensuing quarter. the amount to be distributed could also be adjusted upward in any one quarter.
all of the foregoing is subject to the qualification that the declaration and payment of any distributions are at the sole discretion of our general partner, and our general partner may change our distribution policy at any time, including, without limitation, to reduce the quarterly distribution payable to our common unitholders or even to eliminate such distributions entirely.
because the subsidiaries of the blackstone group l.p. must pay taxes and make payments under the tax receivable agreements, the amounts ultimately distributed by the blackstone group l.p. to its common unitholders in respect of each fiscal year are expected to be less, on a per unit basis, than the amounts distributed by the blackstone holdings partnerships to the blackstone personnel and others who are limited partners of the blackstone holdings partnerships in respect of their blackstone holdings partnership units.
the following chart shows fiscal quarterly and annual per common unitholder distributions for 2012, 2013 and 2014. distributions are declared and paid in the quarter subsequent to the quarter in which they are earned.
130
with respect to fiscal year 2014, we have paid to common unitholders distributions of $0.35, $0.55, $0.44 and $0.78 per common unit in respect of the first, second, third and fourth quarters, respectively, aggregating $2.12 per common unit. with respect to fiscal years 2013 and 2012, we paid aggregate common unitholder distributions of $1.34 per common unit and $0.72 per common unit, respectively.
with respect to fiscal year 2014, we have paid to the blackstone personnel and others who are limited partners of the blackstone holdings partnerships distributions of $0.38, $0.60, $0.56 and $0.92 per blackstone holdings partnership unit in respect of the first, second, third and fourth quarters, respectively, aggregating $2.46 per blackstone holdings partnership unit. with respect to fiscal years 2013 and 2012, we paid aggregate distributions of $1.52 per blackstone holdings partnership unit and $0.88 per blackstone holdings partnership unit, respectively.
leverage we may under certain circumstances use leverage opportunistically and over time to create the most efficient capital structure for blackstone and our public common unitholders. in addition to the borrowings from our bond issuances and our revolving credit facility, our treasury cash management strategies may use reverse repurchase agreements, repurchase agreements and securities sold, not yet purchased. all of these positions are held in a separately managed portfolio. reverse repurchase agreements are entered into primarily to take advantage of opportunistic yields otherwise absent in the overnight markets and also to use the collateral received to cover securities sold, not yet purchased. repurchase agreements are entered into primarily to opportunistically yield higher spreads on purchased securities. the balances held in these financial instruments fluctuate based on blackstones liquidity needs, market conditions and investment risk profiles.
generally our private equity funds, real estate funds, funds of hedge funds and credit-focused funds have not utilized substantial leverage at the fund level other than for (a) short-term borrowings between the date of an investment and the receipt of capital from the investing funds investors, and (b) long-term borrowings for certain investments in aggregate amounts which are generally 2% to 20% of the capital commitments of the respective fund. our carry funds make direct or indirect investments in companies that utilize leverage in their capital structure. the degree of leverage employed varies among portfolio companies.
certain of our real estate debt hedge funds, hedge fund solutions and credit funds use leverage in order to obtain additional market exposure, enhance returns on invested capital and/or to bridge short-term cash needs. the forms of leverage primarily employed by these funds include purchasing securities on margin, utilizing collateralized financing and using derivative instruments.

critical accounting policies we prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with gaap. in applying many of these accounting principles, we need to make assumptions, estimates and/or judgments that affect the reported amounts of
131
assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses in our consolidated financial statements. we base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances. these assumptions, estimates and/or judgments, however, are often subjective. actual results may be affected negatively based on changing circumstances. if actual amounts are ultimately different from our estimates, the revisions are included in our results of operations for the period in which the actual amounts become known. we believe the following critical accounting policies could potentially produce materially different results if we were to change underlying assumptions, estimates and/or judgments. (see note 2. summary of significant accounting policies in the notes to consolidated financial statements in  item 8. financial statements and supplementary data of this filing.)
principles of consolidation the partnership consolidates all entities that it controls through a majority voting interest or otherwise, including those blackstone funds in which the general partner is presumed to have control. although the partnership has a non-controlling interest in the blackstone holdings partnerships, the limited partners do not have the right to dissolve the partnerships or have substantive kick out rights or participating rights that would overcome the presumption of control by the partnership. accordingly, the partnership consolidates blackstone holdings and records non-controlling interests to reflect the economic interests of the limited partners of blackstone holdings.
in addition, the partnership consolidates all variable interest entities (vie) in which it is the primary beneficiary. an enterprise is determined to be the primary beneficiary if it holds a controlling financial interest. a controlling financial interest is defined as (a) the power to direct the activities of a vie that most significantly impact the entitys economic performance, and (b) the obligation to absorb losses of the entity or the right to receive benefits from the entity that could potentially be significant to the vie. the consolidation guidance requires an analysis to determine (a) whether an entity in which the partnership holds a variable interest is a vie, and (b) whether the partnerships involvement, through holding interests directly or indirectly in the entity or contractually through other variable interests (for example, management and performance related fees), would give it a controlling financial interest. performance of that analysis requires the exercise of judgment. vies qualify for the deferral of the consolidation guidance if all of the following conditions have been met:
   the entity has all of the attributes of an investment company,

   the reporting entity does not have explicit or implicit obligations to fund any losses of the entity that could potentially be significant to the entity, and

   the entity is not a securitization or asset-backed financing entity or an entity that was formerly considered a qualifying special purpose entity.

where the vies have qualified for the deferral of the current consolidation guidance as discussed in note 2. summary of significant accounting policies in the notes to consolidated financial statements in  item 8. financial statements and supplementary data, the analysis is based on previous consolidation guidance. this guidance requires an analysis to determine (a) whether an entity in which the partnership holds a variable interest is a variable interest entity and (b) whether the partnerships involvement, through holding interests directly or indirectly in the entity or contractually through other variable interests (for example, management and performance related fees), would be expected to absorb a majority of the variability of the entity. under both guidelines, the partnership determines whether it is the primary beneficiary of a vie at the time it becomes involved with a variable interest entity and reconsiders that conclusion continually. in evaluating whether the partnership is the primary beneficiary, blackstone evaluates its economic interests in the entity held either directly by the partnership and its affiliates or indirectly through employees. the consolidation analysis can generally be performed qualitatively; however, if it is not readily apparent that the partnership is not the primary beneficiary, a quantitative analysis may also be performed. investments and redemptions (either by the partnership, affiliates of the partnership or third parties) or amendments to the governing documents of the respective blackstone funds could affect an entitys status as a vie or the determination of the primary beneficiary. at each reporting date, the partnership assesses whether it is the primary beneficiary and will consolidate or deconsolidate accordingly.
132
assets of consolidated vies that can only be used to settle obligations of the consolidated vie and liabilities of a consolidated vie for which creditors (or beneficial interest holders) do not have recourse to the general credit of blackstone are presented in a separate section in the consolidated statements of financial condition.
revenue recognition revenues primarily consist of management and advisory fees, performance fees, investment income, interest and dividend revenue and other. please refer to part i. item 1. business  incentive arrangements / fee structure for additional information regarding the manner in which base management fees and performance fees are generated.
management and advisory fees, net  management and advisory fees, net are comprised of management fees, including base management fees, transaction and other fees, advisory fees and management fee reductions and offsets.
the partnership earns base management fees from limited partners of funds in each of its managed funds, at a fixed percentage of assets under management, net asset value, total assets, committed capital or invested capital, or in some cases, a fixed fee. base management fees are recognized based on contractual terms specified in the underlying investment advisory agreements. the range of management fee rates and the calculation base from which they are earned, generally, are as follows:
on private equity, real estate, and certain credit-focused funds:
   0.30% to 1.50% of committed capital or invested capital during the investment period,

   0.25% to 1.75% of invested capital or investment fair value subsequent to the investment period for private equity and real estate funds, and

   1.00% to 1.50% of invested capital or net asset value for certain credit-focused funds.

on real estate and credit-focused funds structured like hedge funds:
   1.50% to 2.00% of net asset value.

on credit-focused separately managed accounts:
   0.30% to 1.35% of net asset value.

on real estate separately managed accounts:
   0.50% to 2.00% of invested capital or net operating income.

on funds of hedge funds and separately managed accounts invested in hedge funds:
   0.50% to 1.25% of net asset value.

on clo vehicles:
   0.40% to 1.25% of total assets.

on credit-focused registered and non-registered investment companies:
   0.50% to 1.50% of fund assets or net asset value.

the investment adviser of bxmt receives annual management fees based upon 1.50% of bxmts net proceeds received from equity offerings and accumulated core earnings (which is generally equal to its gaap net income excluding certain non-cash and other items), subject to certain adjustments.
133
transaction and other fees (including monitoring fees) are fees charged directly to managed funds and portfolio companies. the investment advisory agreements generally require that the investment adviser reduce the amount of management fees payable by the limited partners to the partnership (management fee reductions) by an amount equal to a portion of the transaction and other fees directly paid to the partnership by the portfolio companies. the amount of the reduction varies by fund, the type of fee paid by the portfolio company and the previously incurred expenses of the fund.
management fee offsets are reductions to management fees payable by the limited partners of the blackstone funds, which are granted based on the amount such limited partners reimburse the blackstone funds for placement fees.
advisory fees consist of advisory retainer and transaction-based fee arrangements related to financial and strategic advisory services, restructuring and reorganization advisory services, capital markets services and fund placement services for alternative investment funds. advisory retainer fees are recognized when services for the transactions are complete, in accordance with terms set forth in individual agreements. transaction-based fees are recognized when (a) there is evidence of an arrangement with a client, (b) agreed upon services have been provided, (c) fees are fixed or determinable, and (d) collection is reasonably assured. fund placement fees are recognized as earned upon the acceptance by a fund of capital or capital commitments.
accrued but unpaid management and advisory fees, net of management fee reductions and management fee offsets, as of the reporting date are included in accounts receivable or due from affiliates in the consolidated statements of financial condition. management fees paid by limited partners to the blackstone funds and passed on to blackstone are not considered affiliate revenues.
performance fees  performance fees earned on the performance of blackstones hedge fund structures (incentive fees) are recognized based on fund performance during the period, subject to the achievement of minimum return levels, or high water marks, in accordance with the respective terms set out in each hedge funds governing agreements. accrued but unpaid incentive fees charged directly to investors in blackstones offshore hedge funds as of the reporting date are recorded within due from affiliates in the consolidated statements of financial condition. accrued but unpaid incentive fees on onshore funds as of the reporting date are reflected in investments in the consolidated statements of financial condition. incentive fees are realized at the end of a measurement period, typically annually. once realized, such fees are not subject to clawback or reversal.
in certain fund structures, specifically in private equity, real estate and certain hedge fund solutions and credit-focused funds (carry funds), performance fees (carried interest) are allocated to the general partner based on cumulative fund performance to date, subject to a preferred return to limited partners. at the end of each reporting period, the partnership calculates the carried interest that would be due to the partnership for each fund, pursuant to the fund agreements, as if the fair value of the underlying investments were realized as of such date, irrespective of whether such amounts have been realized. as the fair value of underlying investments varies between reporting periods, it is necessary to make adjustments to amounts recorded as carried interest to reflect either (a) positive performance resulting in an increase in the carried interest allocated to the general partner or (b) negative performance that would cause the amount due to the partnership to be less than the amount previously recognized as revenue, resulting in a negative adjustment to carried interest allocated to the general partner. in each scenario, it is necessary to calculate the carried interest on cumulative results compared to the carried interest recorded to date and make the required positive or negative adjustments. the partnership ceases to record negative carried interest allocations once previously recognized carried interest allocations for such fund have been fully reversed. the partnership is not obligated to pay guaranteed returns or hurdles, and therefore, cannot have negative carried interest over the life of a fund. accrued but unpaid carried interest as of the reporting date is reflected in investments in the consolidated statements of financial condition.
carried interest is realized when an underlying investment is profitably disposed of and the funds cumulative returns are in excess of the preferred return or, in limited instances, after certain thresholds for return of capital are
134
met. carried interest is subject to clawback to the extent that the carried interest received to date exceeds the amount due to blackstone based on cumulative results. as such, the accrual for potential repayment of previously received carried interest, which is a component of due to affiliates, represents all amounts previously distributed to blackstone holdings and non-controlling interest holders that would need to be repaid to the blackstone funds if the blackstone carry funds were to be liquidated based on the current fair value of the underlying funds investments as of the reporting date. the actual clawback liability, however, generally does not become realized until the end of a funds life except for certain blackstone real estate funds, multi-asset class investment funds and credit-focused funds, which may have an interim clawback liability.
investment income (loss)  investment income (loss) represents the unrealized and realized gains and losses on the partnerships principal investments, including its investments in blackstone funds that are not consolidated, its equity method investments, and other principal investments. investment income (loss) is realized when the partnership redeems all or a portion of its investment or when the partnership receives cash income, such as dividends or distributions. unrealized investment income (loss) results from changes in the fair value of the underlying investment as well as the reversal of unrealized gain (loss) at the time an investment is realized.
interest and dividend revenue  interest and dividend revenue comprises primarily interest and dividend income earned on principal investments held by blackstone.
other revenue  other revenue consists of miscellaneous income and foreign exchange gains and losses arising on transactions denominated in currencies other than u.s. dollars.
expenses our expenses include compensation and benefits expense and general and administrative expenses. our accounting policies related thereto are as follows:
compensation and benefits  compensation  compensation and benefits consists of (a) employee compensation, comprising salary and bonus, and benefits paid and payable to employees and senior managing directors and (b) equity-based compensation associated with the grants of equity-based awards to employees and senior managing directors. compensation cost relating to the issuance of equity-based awards to senior managing directors and employees is measured at fair value at the grant date, taking into consideration expected forfeitures, and expensed over the vesting period on a straight-line basis. equity-based awards that do not require future service are expensed immediately. cash settled equity-based awards are classified as liabilities and are remeasured at the end of each reporting period.
compensation and benefits  performance fee  performance fee compensation consists of carried interest (which may be distributed in cash or in-kind) and incentive fee allocations, and may in future periods also include allocations of investment income from blackstones firm investments, to employees and senior managing directors participating in certain profit sharing initiatives. such compensation expense is subject to both positive and negative adjustments. unlike carried interest and incentive fees, compensation expense is based on the performance of individual investments held by a fund rather than on a fund by fund basis. compensation received from advisory clients in the form of securities of such clients may also be allocated to employees and senior managing directors.
fair value of financial instruments gaap establishes a hierarchical disclosure framework which prioritizes and ranks the level of market price observability used in measuring financial instruments at fair value. market price observability is affected by a number of factors, including the type of financial instrument, the characteristics specific to the financial instrument and the state of the marketplace, including the existence and transparency of transactions between market participants. financial instruments with readily available quoted prices in active markets generally will have a higher degree of market price observability and a lesser degree of judgment used in measuring fair value.
135
financial instruments measured and reported at fair value are classified and disclosed based on the observability of inputs used in the determination of fair values, as follows:
                                                        level i  quoted prices are available in active markets for identical financial instruments as of the reporting date. the type of financial instruments in level i include listed equities, listed derivatives and mutual funds with quoted prices. the partnership does not adjust the quoted price for these investments, even in situations where blackstone holds a large position and a sale could reasonably impact the quoted price.

                                                       level ii  pricing inputs are other than quoted prices in active markets, which are either directly or indirectly observable as of the reporting date, and fair value is determined through the use of models or other valuation methodologies. financial instruments which are generally included in this category include corporate bonds and loans, government and agency securities, less liquid and restricted equity securities, certain over-the-counter derivatives where the fair value is based on observable inputs, and certain funds of hedge funds and proprietary investments in which blackstone has the ability to redeem its investment at net asset value at, or within three months of, the reporting date.

                                                        level iii  pricing inputs are unobservable for the financial instruments and includes situations where there is little, if any, market activity for the financial instrument. the inputs into the determination of fair value require significant management judgment or estimation. financial instruments that are included in this category generally include general and limited partnership interests in private equity and real estate funds, credit-focused funds, distressed debt and non-investment grade residual interests in securitizations, certain corporate bonds and loans held within clo vehicles, certain over-the-counter derivatives where the fair value is based on unobservable inputs and certain funds of hedge funds that use net asset value per share to determine fair value in which blackstone may not have the ability to redeem its investment at net asset value at, or within three months of, the reporting date. blackstone may not have the ability to redeem its investment at net asset value at, or within three months of, the reporting date if an investee fund manager has the ability to limit the amount of redemptions, and/or the ability to side pocket investments, irrespective of whether such ability has been exercised. senior and subordinate notes issued by clo vehicles are classified within level iii of the fair value hierarchy.

in certain cases, the inputs used to measure fair value may fall into different levels of the fair value hierarchy. in such cases, the determination of which category within the fair value hierarchy is appropriate for any given financial instrument is based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. the partnerships assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment and considers factors specific to the financial instrument.
transfers between levels of the fair value hierarchy are recognized at the beginning of the reporting period.
level ii valuation techniques financial instruments classified within level ii of the fair value hierarchy comprise debt instruments, including corporate loans and bonds held by blackstones consolidated clo vehicles, those held within blackstones treasury cash management strategies and debt securities sold, not yet purchased and interests in investment funds. certain equity securities and derivative instruments valued using observable inputs are also classified as level ii.
the valuation techniques used to value financial instruments classified within level ii of the fair value hierarchy are as follows:
                                                   debt instruments and equity securities are valued on the basis of prices from an orderly transaction between market participants provided by reputable dealers or pricing services. in determining the value of a particular investment, pricing services may use certain information with respect to transactions in such investments, quotations from dealers, pricing matrices and market transactions in comparable investments and various relationships between investments. the valuation of certain equity securities is based on an observable price for an identical security adjusted for the effect of a restriction.

136
                                 investment funds held by the consolidated blackstone funds are valued using net asset value per share as described in level iii valuation techniques
 funds of hedge funds. certain investments in investment funds are classified within level ii of the fair value hierarchy as the investment can be redeemed at, or within three months of, the reporting date.

   freestanding derivatives and derivative instruments used in fair value hedging strategies are valued using contractual cash flows and observable inputs comprising yield curves, foreign currency rates and credit spreads.

level iii valuation techniques in the absence of observable market prices, blackstone values its investments using valuation methodologies applied on a consistent basis. for some investments little market activity may exist; managements determination of fair value is then based on the best information available in the circumstances, and may incorporate managements own assumptions and involves a significant degree of judgment, taking into consideration a combination of internal and external factors, including the appropriate risk adjustments for non-performance and liquidity risks. investments for which market prices are not observable include private investments in the equity of operating companies, real estate properties, certain funds of hedge funds and credit-focused investments.
private equity investments  the fair values of private equity investments are determined by reference to projected net earnings, earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (ebitda), the discounted cash flow method, public market or private transactions, valuations for comparable companies and other measures which, in many cases, are unaudited at the time received. valuations may be derived by reference to observable valuation measures for comparable companies or transactions (for example, multiplying a key performance metric of the investee company such as ebitda by a relevant valuation multiple observed in the range of comparable companies or transactions), adjusted by management for differences between the investment and the referenced comparables, and in some instances by reference to option pricing models or other similar methods. where a discounted cash flow method is used, a terminal value is derived by reference to ebitda or price/earnings exit multiples.
real estate investments  the fair values of real estate investments are determined by considering projected operating cash flows, sales of comparable assets, if any, and replacement costs among other measures. the methods used to estimate the fair value of real estate investments include the discounted cash flow method and/or capitalization rates (cap rates) analysis. valuations may be derived by reference to observable valuation measures for comparable companies or assets (for example, multiplying a key performance metric of the investee company or asset, such as ebitda, by a relevant valuation multiple observed in the range of comparable companies or transactions), adjusted by management for differences between the investment and the referenced comparables, and in some instances by reference to option pricing models or other similar methods. where a discounted cash flow method is used, a terminal value is derived by reference to an exit ebitda multiple or capitalization rate. additionally, where applicable, projected distributable cash flow through debt maturity will be considered in support of the investments fair value.
funds of hedge funds  the investments of consolidated blackstone funds in funds of hedge funds (investee funds) are valued at net asset value (nav) per share of the investee fund. in limited circumstances, the partnership may determine, based on its own due diligence and investment procedures, that nav per share does not represent fair value. in such circumstances, the partnership will estimate the fair value in good faith and in a manner that it reasonably chooses, in accordance with the requirements of gaap.
certain investments of blackstone and of the consolidated blackstone funds of hedge funds and credit-focused funds measure their investments in underlying funds at fair value using nav per share without adjustment. the terms of the investees investment generally provide for minimum holding periods or lock-ups, the institution of gates on redemptions or the suspension of redemptions or an ability to side pocket investments, at the discretion of
137
the investees fund manager, and as a result, investments may not be redeemable at, or within three months of, the reporting date. a side pocket is used by hedge funds and funds of hedge funds to separate investments that may lack a readily ascertainable value, are illiquid or are subject to liquidity restriction. redemptions are generally not permitted until the investments within a side pocket are liquidated or it is deemed that the conditions existing at the time that required the investment to be included in the side pocket no longer exist. as the timing of either of these events is uncertain, the timing at which the partnership may redeem an investment held in a side pocket cannot be estimated. investments for which fair value is measured using nav per share are reflected within the fair value hierarchy based on the existence of redemption restrictions, if any, as described above. further disclosure on instruments for which fair value is measured using nav per share is presented in note 5. net asset value as fair value in the notes to consolidated financial statements in  item 8. financial statements and supplementary data of this filing.
credit-focused investments  the fair values of credit-focused investments are generally determined on the basis of prices between market participants provided by reputable dealers or pricing services. in some instances, blackstone may utilize other valuation techniques, including the discounted cash flow method or a market approach.
credit-focused liabilities  credit-focused liabilities comprise senior and subordinate loans issued by blackstones consolidated clo vehicles. such liabilities are valued using a discounted cash flow method.
level iii valuation process investments classified within level iii of the fair value hierarchy are valued on a quarterly basis, taking into consideration any changes in blackstones weighted-average cost of capital assumptions, discounted cash flow projections and exit multiple assumptions, as well as any changes in economic and other relevant conditions, and valuation models are updated accordingly. the valuation process also includes a review by an independent valuation party, at least annually for all investments, and quarterly for certain investments, to corroborate the values determined by management. the valuations of blackstones investments are reviewed quarterly by a valuation committee which is chaired by blackstones vice chairman and includes senior heads of each of blackstones businesses, as well as representatives of legal and finance. each quarter, the valuations of blackstones investments are also reviewed by the audit committee in a meeting attended by the chairman of the valuation committee. the valuations are further tested by comparison to actual sales prices obtained on disposition of the investments.
investments, at fair value the blackstone funds are accounted for as investment companies under the american institute of certified public accountants accounting and auditing guide, investment companies, and reflect their investments, including majority-owned and controlled investments (the portfolio companies), at fair value. blackstone has retained the specialized accounting for the consolidated blackstone funds. thus, such consolidated funds investments are reflected in investments on the consolidated statements of financial condition at fair value, with unrealized gains and losses resulting from changes in fair value reflected as a component of net gains (losses) from fund investment activities in the consolidated statements of operations. fair value is the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability, in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date (i.e., the exit price).
blackstones principal investments are presented at fair value with unrealized appreciation or depreciation and realized gains and losses recognized in the consolidated statements of operations within investment income (loss).
for certain instruments, the partnership has elected the fair value option. such election is irrevocable and is applied on an investment by investment basis at initial recognition. the partnership has applied the fair value option for certain loans and receivables and certain investments in private debt securities that otherwise would not have been carried at fair value with gains and losses recorded in net income. accounting for these financial instruments at fair value is consistent with how the partnership accounts for its other principal investments. loans extended to
138
third parties are recorded within accounts receivable within the consolidated statements of financial condition. debt securities for which the fair value option has been elected are recorded within investments. the methodology for measuring the fair value of such investments is consistent with the methodology applied to private equity, real estate, credit-focused and funds of hedge funds investments. changes in the fair value of such instruments are recognized in investment income (loss) in the consolidated statements of operations. interest income on interest bearing loans and receivables and debt securities on which the fair value option has been elected is based on stated coupon rates adjusted for the accretion of purchase discounts and the amortization of purchase premiums. this interest income is recorded within interest and dividend revenue.
in addition, the partnership has elected the fair value option for the assets and liabilities of clo vehicles that are consolidated as of january 1, 2010, as a result of the initial adoption of variable interest entity consolidation guidance. the partnership has also elected the fair value option for clo vehicles consolidated as a result of the acquisitions of clo management contracts or the acquisition of the share capital of clo managers. the adjustment resulting from the difference between the fair value of assets and liabilities for each of these events is presented as a transition and acquisition adjustment to appropriated partners capital. the recognition of the initial difference between the fair value of assets and liabilities of clo vehicles consolidated as a result of the acquisition of management contracts or clo managers subsequent to the initial adoption of revised accounting guidance effective january 1, 2010, as an adjustment to appropriated partners capital. assets of the consolidated clos are presented within investments within the consolidated statements of financial condition and liabilities within loans payable for the amounts due to unaffiliated third parties and due to affiliates for the amounts held by non-consolidated affiliates. the methodology for measuring the fair value of such assets and liabilities is consistent with the methodology applied to private equity, real estate and credit-focused investments. changes in the fair value of consolidated clo assets and liabilities and related interest, dividend and other income subsequent to adoption and acquisition are presented within net gains (losses) from fund investment activities. expenses of consolidated clo vehicles are presented in fund expenses. amounts attributable to non-controlling interests in consolidated entities have a corresponding adjustment to appropriated partners capital.
the partnership has elected the fair value option for certain proprietary investments that would otherwise have been accounted for using the equity method of accounting. the fair value of such investments is based on quoted prices in an active market or using the discounted cash flow method. changes in fair value are recognized in investment income (loss) in the consolidated statements of operations.
further disclosure on instruments for which the fair value option has been elected is presented in note 7. fair value option in the notes to consolidated financial statements in  item 8. financial statements and supplementary data of this filing.
intangibles and goodwill blackstones intangible assets consist of contractual rights to earn future fee income, including management and advisory fees, incentive fees and carried interest. identifiable finite-lived intangible assets are amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives, ranging from 3 to 20 years, reflecting the contractual lives of such assets. amortization expense is included within general, administrative and other in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations. the partnership does not hold any indefinite-lived intangible assets. intangible assets are reviewed for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.
goodwill comprises goodwill arising from the contribution and reorganization of the partnerships predecessor entities in 2007 immediately prior to its ipo, the acquisition of gso in 2008 and the acquisition of strategic partners in 2013.
goodwill is reviewed for impairment at least annually, and more frequently if circumstances indicate impairment may have occurred. we test goodwill for impairment at the operating segment level (the same as our
139
segments). management has organized the firm into five operating segments. all of the components in each segment have similar economic characteristics and management makes key operating decisions based on the performance of each segment. therefore, we believe that operating segment is the appropriate reporting level for testing the impairment of goodwill.
the carrying value of goodwill was $1.8 billion as of december 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. at december 31, 2014 and 2013, we determined there was no evidence of goodwill impairment.
off-balance sheet arrangements in the normal course of business, we enter into various off-balance sheet arrangements including sponsoring and owning limited or general partner interests in consolidated and non-consolidated funds, entering into derivative transactions, entering into operating leases, and entering into guarantee arrangements. we also have ongoing capital commitment arrangements with certain of our consolidated and non-consolidated drawdown funds. we do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that would require us to fund losses or guarantee target returns to investors in our funds.
further disclosure on our off-balance sheet arrangements is presented in the notes to consolidated financial statements in  item 8. financial statements and supplementary data of this filing as follows:
   note 6. derivative financial instruments,

   note 9. variable interest entities, and

(a)                                             we lease our primary office space under agreements that expire through 2032. in connection with certain lease agreements, we are responsible for escalation payments.
the contractual obligation table above includes only guaranteed minimum lease payments for such leases and does not project potential escalation or other lease-related payments. these leases are classified as operating leases for financial statement purposes and as such are not recorded as liabilities on the consolidated statements of financial condition. the amounts are presented net of contractual sublease commitments.

(b)   represents the principal amount due on the senior notes we issued. as of december 31, 2014, we had no outstanding borrowings under our revolver.

(c)   represents interest to be paid over the maturity of our senior notes and borrowings under our revolving credit facility which has been calculated assuming no pre-payments are made and debt is held until its final maturity date. these amounts exclude commitment fees for unutilized borrowings under our revolver.

(d)   these obligations are those of the blackstone funds including the consolidated clo vehicles.

(e)                           represents interest to be paid over the maturity of the related consolidated blackstone funds and clo vehicles debt obligations which has been calculated assuming no pre-payments will be made and debt will be held until its final maturity date. the future interest payments are calculated using variable rates in effect as of

141
december 31, 2014, at spreads to market rates pursuant to the financing agreements, and range from 0.30% to 10.78%. the majority of the borrowings are due on demand and for purposes of this schedule are assumed to mature within one year. interest on the majority of these borrowings rolls over into the principal balance at each reset date.

(f)   these obligations represent commitments of the consolidated blackstone funds to make capital contributions to investee funds and portfolio companies. these amounts are generally due on demand and are therefore presented in the less than one year category.

(g)                                           represents obligations by the partnerships corporate subsidiary to make payments under the tax receivable agreements to certain non-controlling interest holders for the tax savings realized from the taxable purchases of their interests in connection with the reorganization at the time of blackstones initial public offering in 2007 and subsequent purchases. the obligation represents the amount of the payments currently expected to be made, which are dependent on the tax savings actually realized as determined annually without discounting for the timing of the payments. as required by gaap, the amount of the obligation included in the consolidated financial statements and shown in note 17. related party transactions (see  item 8. financial statements and supplementary data) differs to reflect the net present value of the payments due to certain non-controlling interest holders.

(h)                                         the total represents gross unrecognized tax benefits of $3.2 million and interest and penalties of $2.2 million. in addition, blackstone is not able to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing of payments in individual years in connection with gross unrecognized benefits of $16.6 million and interest of $5.6 million; therefore, such amounts are not included in the above contractual obligations table.

(i)                                             these obligations represent commitments by us to provide general partner capital funding to the blackstone funds, limited partner capital funding to other funds and blackstone principal investment commitments. these amounts are generally due on demand and are therefore presented in the less than one year category; however, a substantial amount of the capital commitments are expected to be called over the next three years. we expect to continue to make these general partner capital commitments as we raise additional amounts for our investment funds over time.

guarantees blackstone and certain of its consolidated funds provide financial guarantees. the amounts and nature of these guarantees are described in note 18. commitments and contingencies  contingencies  guarantees in the notes to consolidated financial statements in  item 8. financial statements and supplementary data of this filing.
indemnifications in many of its service contracts, blackstone agrees to indemnify the third party service provider under certain circumstances. the terms of the indemnities vary from contract to contract and the amount of indemnification liability, if any, cannot be determined and has not been included in the table above or recorded in our consolidated financial statements as of december 31, 2014.
clawback obligations carried interest is subject to clawback to the extent that the carried interest received to date with respect to a fund exceeds the amount due to blackstone based on cumulative results of that fund. the actual clawback liability, however, generally does not become realized until the end of a funds life except for certain blackstone real estate funds, multi-asset class investment funds and credit-focused funds, which may have an interim clawback liability. the lives of the carry funds with a potential clawback obligation, including available contemplated extensions, are currently anticipated to expire at various points through 2016. further extensions of such terms may be implemented under given circumstances.
for financial reporting purposes, the general partners have recorded a liability for potential clawback obligations to the limited partners of some of the carry funds due to changes in the unrealized value of a funds
142
remaining investments and where the funds general partner has previously received carried interest distributions with respect to such funds realized investments.
as of december 31, 2014, the total clawback obligations were $3.9 million, of which $2.5 million related to current and former blackstone personnel, and $1.4 million related to blackstone holdings. (see note 17. related party transactions and note 18. commitments and contingencies in the notes to consolidated financial statements in  item 8. financial statements and supplementary data of this filing.)

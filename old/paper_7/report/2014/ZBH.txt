forward-looking financial information provided in this managements discussion and analysis does not include estimated results of operations, cash flows or financial position related to the pending biomet merger, except for certain costs and expenses we expect to incur that are necessary to consummate the merger and that we will incur for integration planning prior to the merger closing. the biomet merger is expected to be a transformational event for us and have significant effects on all aspects of our business. this managements discussion and analysis of our historical financial condition and results of operations on a standalone basis is not indicative of the financial condition and results of operations for future periods on a combined company basis following the merger.
executive level overview
2014 results our 2014 sales results reflected increased growth as compared with 2013. sales from recent product introductions, such as persona the personalized knee system, as well as a stable joint replacement market, drove sales volume and product mix growth. this was partially offset by continued pricing pressure, negative effects from changes in foreign currency exchange rates, and a year-over-year decline in sales of our transposal fluid waste management system.
despite the increase in net sales, net earnings decreased, driven by increased spending on our operational excellence initiatives, integration planning expenses related to the pending biomet merger, a $70.0 million contingent legal liability recognized in 2014, and increased debt issuance costs and unused commitment fees recognized on new debt facilities that we entered into in may 2014 in order to fund the pending biomet merger.
2015 outlook the pending biomet merger, which we expect to close in the first quarter of 2015, will have a significant impact on our 2015 operating results. this report does not include guidance for 2015 on a combined company basis.
however, for zimmer on a standalone basis, we project that our net sales will face significant headwinds from the u.s. dollar strengthening against the euro, japanese yen and various other currencies around the world based upon recent foreign currency exchange rates. additionally for net sales, we expect to experience volume and mix growth from a stable joint replacement market and continued pricing pressure.
in regards to expenses on a zimmer standalone basis, due to our hedging program, we project that the expected decrease in net sales caused by changes in foreign currency exchange rates will be partially offset by hedge gains to be recognized in 2015. we expect research and development (r&d) spending will remain similar compared to prior years as a percentage of net sales. for our selling, general and administrative (sg&a) expenses, we expect to continue to realize efficiencies from our operational excellence initiatives. however, since many of our fixed sg&a expenses are denominated in u.s. dollars, such as corporate and business unit headquarter expenses and intangible asset amortization, our sg&a expenses may not decrease in similar proportion to net sales decreases expected from changes in foreign currency exchange rates.

demand (volume and mix) trends increased volume and changes in the mix of product sales contributed 4 percentage points of year-over-year sales growth in 2014, which was a lower growth rate than experienced in 2013 compared to 2012. in 2013, accelerated growth was fueled by the introduction of new products, such as persona the personalized knee system and the transposal fluid waste management system. in 2014, while new products continued to drive sales growth, their impact on a year-over-year basis was not as significant.
we believe long-term indicators point toward sustained growth driven by an aging global population, growth in emerging markets, obesity, proven clinical benefits, new material technologies, advances in surgical techniques and more active lifestyles, among other factors. in addition, demand for clinically proven premium products and patient specific devices are expected to continue to positively affect sales growth in markets that recognize the value of these advanced technologies.
pricing trends global selling prices had a negative effect of 2 percent on year-over-year sales during 2014. the negative 2 percent was consistent with prior years as we continued to experience pricing pressure from governmental healthcare cost containment efforts and from local hospitals and health systems. for 2015, we expect continued pricing pressure similar to prior years.
foreign currency exchange rates for 2014, foreign currency exchange rates resulted in a 1 percent decrease in sales, driven by the strengthening of the u.s. dollar versus the japanese yen as well as a few other currencies in other regions in which we operate. if foreign currency exchange rates remain consistent with december 31, 2014 rates, we estimate that a stronger dollar versus foreign currency exchange rates will have a greater negative effect on sales in 2015 than in 2014. we address currency risk through regular operating and financing activities and through the use of foreign currency forward contracts and foreign currency options solely to manage foreign currency volatility and risk. changes to foreign currency exchange rates affect sales growth, but due to gains/losses on hedge contracts and options, which are recorded in cost of products sold, the effect on net earnings in the near term is expected to be partially offset.

zimmer holdings, inc.   2014 form 10-k annual report sales by product category knees knee sales increased 3 percent in 2014 compared to a 4 percent increase in 2013. our knee product category has benefited from recent product introductions, such as persona the personalized knee system and joint preservation solutions. however, the volume/mix growth from new product introductions has been tempered by pricing pressure in all our reporting segments.
in 2014, we continued a broader launch of persona the personalized knee system. we intend to continue to deploy implant and instrument sets for this knee system to all geographic regions in 2015 and beyond. our nexgen complete knee solution product line is still our leading global knee system in terms of sales. products driving growth in this category, in addition to persona the personalized knee system, included the zimmer unicompartmental high flex knee and our joint preservation solutions.
in europe, changes in foreign currency exchange rates affected knee sales in 2014 and 2013 by negative 1 percent and positive 2 percent, respectively. in asia pacific, changes in foreign currency exchange rates had negative effects on knee sales of 5 percent and 9 percent in 2014 and 2013, respectively.
hips hip sales were flat in 2014 after a decline of 1 percent in 2013. positive volume and mix trends continue to be offset by pricing pressure.
leading hip stem sales were the zimmer m/l taper hip prosthesis, the zimmer m/l taper hip prosthesis with kinectiv technology, the cls spotorno stem from the cls hip system, the alloclassic zweymüller hip stem and the fitmore hip stem. products experiencing growth in this category included the avenir müller stem, the wagner sl revision hip stem, the continuum acetabular system, the trilogy it acetabular system, the allofit it alloclassic acetabular system, vivacit-e highly crosslinked polyethylene liners and biolox delta heads.
in europe, changes in foreign currency exchange rates affected hip sales in 2014 and 2013 by negative 1 percent and positive 2 percent, respectively. in asia pacific, changes in foreign currency exchange rates had negative effects on hip sales of 6 percent and 11 percent in 2014 and 2013, respectively.
extremities extremities sales increased 5 percent in 2014 compared to an 11 percent increase in 2013. the sales increase in both years reflected growth from our shoulder systems, such as the zimmer trabecular metal reverse shoulder system and the sidus stem-free shoulder, and a broader product portfolio to compete in the foot and ankle and hand and wrist areas of the extremities category. the broader portfolio includes the zimmer trabecular metal total ankle and products from the acquisition of normed medizin-technik gmbh in june 2013.
dental dental sales increased 1 percent in 2014, which was the same as the prior year sales growth. increased sales of dental reconstructive implants and digital solutions have been partially offset by decreases in restorative products. sales were led by the tapered screw-vent implant system. in our dental product category, in certain markets, especially in our asia pacific region, our customers are distributors. the timing of distributor purchases can have a significant influence on sales in those markets in any particular year.
trauma trauma sales were flat in 2014 and increased by 2 percent in 2013. new product launches, especially in our europe and asia pacific reporting segments, positively affected sales in both years. the zimmer natural nail system and zimmer periarticular locking plates system led trauma sales.
spine spine sales increased 2 percent in 2014 after a decline of 3 percent in 2013. in 2014, we continued to focus on and had success in commercializing offerings across our core fusion portfolio and market adjacencies, including minimally invasive surgeries. solid sales of the pathfinder nxt minimally invasive pedicle screw system and trabecular metal technology products were partially offset by a decline in sales of other spine products.
surgical and other surgical and other sales declined by 5 percent in 2014 after an 18 percent sales increase in 2013. the primary cause of the sales fluctuations in this product category was the transposal fluid waste management system. this system is comprised of a capital equipment component that is used with a one-time use disposable manifold component. in 2013, our system benefitted from commercial disruption experienced by a competitive product, increasing demand for the capital equipment component. with that competitive product back on the market in 2014 and since many customers bought our capital equipment component in 2013, sales of the capital equipment component decreased significantly in 2014. however, this decrease was partially offset by an increase in sales of the related disposable manifold component. other products leading sales in this category were palacos bone cement, tourniquets and wound debridement devices.

the increase in gross margin percentage in 2014 compared to 2013 was primarily due to significant excess and obsolete inventory charges recorded in 2013 related to products we intend to discontinue. we also recognized higher hedge gains in 2014 from our foreign currency hedging program compared to 2013. under the hedging program, for derivatives which qualify as hedges of future cash flows, the effective portion of changes in fair value is temporarily recorded in other comprehensive income and then recognized in cost of products sold when the hedged items affect earnings. further, we experienced improved product category mix, resulting in lower average costs per unit sold. these favorable items were partially offset by lower average selling prices and the u.s. medical device excise tax. while we began paying the medical device excise tax in 2013, based upon the levels of inventory we were carrying before the excise tax was effective on january 1, 2013, we did not recognize any significant expenses from the excise tax until the fourth quarter of 2013. we are in discussions with the internal revenue service (irs) as to what an appropriate constructive sales price used to compute our excise tax obligations should be under irs excise tax regulations and our specific business model. our ultimate medical device excise tax and liability may differ from the amount we have estimated. accordingly, the amount we have recognized as expense is an estimate and subject to change.
the decrease in gross margin in 2013 was primarily due to higher average costs per unit sold as a result of changes in product and geographic mix and increased excess and obsolescence charges related to products we intend to discontinue. additionally, lower average selling prices and certain inventory and manufacturing related charges connected to quality enhancement and remediation efforts reduced gross margin. these negative effects were partially offset by hedge gains recorded in 2013 from our foreign currency hedging program versus hedge losses recorded in 2012.
operating expenses r&d expenses and r&d as a percentage of sales have declined in the last three years. the lower spending reflected a natural decline from certain large projects that achieved commercialization, including persona the personalized knee system, and a dedication of resources to our quality and operational excellence initiatives. we expect r&d spending in 2015 to increase and be between 4 and 4.5 percent of sales as we transition our resources towards new projects as our quality and operational excellence initiatives continue to progress.
sg&a expenses have remained relatively consistent while sg&a as a percentage of sales has decreased over the last three years. improvement in sg&a expenditures as a percentage of sales reflects the effects of our operational excellence initiatives. although variable expenses naturally increase with higher sales, our sg&a expenses as a percentage of sales has decreased due to our operational excellence initiatives which produced lower variable and fixed costs in sg&a as net sales increased. additionally, selling and distribution expenses are lower in our europe and asia pacific reporting segments compared to our americas reporting segment. the mix of revenues with high sales growth in europe and asia pacific compared to the americas helped to lower sg&a as a percentage of sales in 2014 when compared to 2013.

certain claims expense is for estimated liabilities to durom cup patients undergoing revision surgeries. we recorded additional expense of $21.5 million in 2014, bringing the total recorded expense to $420.3 million for these claims, excluding a subset of durom cup claims that were recorded in sg&a. the additional expense recorded in 2014 was the result of new developments related to international claims activity. for more information regarding these claims, see note 19 to the consolidated financial statements.
in connection with our annual goodwill impairment test performed in the fourth quarter of 2012, we noted that the carrying values of the net assets of our u.s. spine reporting unit were in excess of the reporting units estimated fair value. as a result, we recorded a goodwill impairment charge of $96.0 million in 2012. we did not record a goodwill impairment charge in 2014 or 2013, as our annual goodwill impairment tests revealed that the carrying values of the net assets of our u.s. spine reporting unit were less than their estimated fair value. for more information regarding goodwill impairment and the factors that led to the 2012 impairment, see note 8 to the consolidated financial statements.
special items have increased significantly in the past three years. the increase in 2014 was a result of higher professional fees related to the pending biomet merger, increased other professional fees, contract labor and dedicated project personnel related to our quality and operational excellence initiatives, increased intangible asset impairments and a $70.0 million accrual for a certain litigation matter. we continue to implement our quality and operational excellence initiatives, which are intended to improve our future operating results by centralizing or outsourcing certain functions and improving quality, distribution, sourcing, manufacturing and our information technology systems. special items expenses include consulting and professional fees, dedicated personnel costs, severance benefits as well as other costs for those programs. in addition to expenses for our quality and operational excellence programs, we recognize expenses related to integration of acquired businesses, impairment of assets, certain r&d agreements, certain litigation settlements, contract termination expenses and other items as special items. see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for more information regarding special items charges.
other expense, interest income, interest expense, and income taxes other expense represents debt issuance costs and unused commitment fees recognized for our senior credit facility and bridge credit agreement that we entered into in may 2014 in order to fund the pending biomet merger.
interest income and expense, net, was lower in 2014 compared to 2013 and 2012. in the second half of 2013, we entered into additional fixed-to-variable rate interest swaps designated as fair value hedges. in the 2014 periods, the variable rates we paid on the swaps were lower than the fixed rate on the hedged debt and, therefore, interest expense decreased.
our effective tax rate (etr) on earnings before income taxes for the years ended december 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012 was 23.8 percent, 22.6 percent and 24.0 percent, respectively. the variation of our etr has largely been affected by special items, certain claims, goodwill impairment charges and a $34.3 million benefit in 2012 from the recognition of deferred tax assets related to a legal entity restructuring. higher special items and certain claims expense favorably affect our etr because most of these expenses have been incurred within jurisdictions with higher tax rates, resulting in lower taxable income in these higher tax jurisdictions. goodwill impairment negatively affects our etr because no tax benefit is recorded on the charge. in 2014, a portion of our special items were for non-deductible expenses incurred related to the pending biomet merger, which increased our etr relative to 2013. in 2013, in addition to the effect of special items and certain claims, our etr benefited from the retroactive reinstatement of the r&d tax credit and other tax benefits applicable to us that applied to 2012 and 2013. due to the timing of the extension and the applicable rules of accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america (gaap), we recognized the 2012 benefit in 2013. despite the $34.3 million benefit in 2012 from the recognition of deferred tax assets related to a legal entity restructuring, the 2012 etr was higher than 2014 and 2013 due to the goodwill impairment charge and lower certain claims and special items expenses. the items discussed accounted for the majority of the variation in our etrs in the past three years.
segment operating profit for our reporting segments, operating profit increased in europe and asia pacific in 2014 compared to 2013, while in the americas it decreased. the decrease in the americas was primarily from lower gross profit due to lower sales and the effect of the u.s. medical device excise tax. in europe, the increase in operating profit was driven by increased sales coupled with controlled operating expenses. operating expenses increased at a lower percentage compared to sales increases due to our operational excellence initiatives and the nature of fixed versus variable expenses resulting in operating margin expansion in europe. the increase in operating profit in asia pacific was driven by increases in sales from volume and product mix. while changes in foreign currency exchange rates tempered sales growth in asia pacific, this decline was largely offset by increased hedge gains recorded in 2014 versus 2013.
non-gaap operating performance measures we use financial measures that differ from financial measures determined in accordance with gaap to evaluate our operating performance. these non-gaap financial measures exclude the impact of inventory step-up, certain inventory and manufacturing related charges connected to quality enhancement and remediation efforts, certain claims, goodwill impairment, special items, other expenses related to financing obtained for the pending biomet merger and any related effects on our income tax provision associated with

liquidity and capital resources cash flows provided by operating activities were $1,052.8 million in 2014, compared to $963.1 million in 2013. the principal source of cash from operating activities was net earnings. non-cash items included in net earnings accounted for another $346.4 million of operating cash in 2014. all other items of operating cash flows reflect a use of $12.6 million of cash in 2014, compared to a use of $84.9 million in 2013.
the increased cash flows provided by operating activities in 2014 were primarily due to improved cash flows generated from receivables collections, especially in europe, lower funding necessary for our u.s. pension plans, and receipt of insurance proceeds related to durom cup product liability claims. these favorable items were partially offset by higher tax payments for certain unresolved matters in order to limit the potential impact of irs interest charges and inventory investments.
at december 31, 2014, we had 64 days of sales outstanding in trade accounts receivable, which was 1 day less than at december 31, 2013. our days of sales outstanding reflect the reimbursement patterns of the healthcare industry in the markets where we compete. collection of trade accounts receivable is influenced by insurance reimbursements and government budgets, among other things. days of sales outstanding are lowest in our americas reporting segment, as the u.s. healthcare system has a higher percentage of private-pay insurers who generally pay more quickly than government-based healthcare systems. in our europe and asia pacific reporting segments, days of sales outstanding are higher, as healthcare is typically sponsored by governments which tend to pay more slowly. additionally, there are some seasonal trends in our days of sales outstanding as it usually trends higher in our third quarter due to lower sales volumes and is lower in our fourth quarter when sales volumes are at their highest. our days of sales outstanding in the past three years have ranged between 64 and 73 days. we were at the low end of this range as of december 31, 2014 due to improved collections in europe.
at december 31, 2014, we had 337 days of inventory on hand, an increase of 52 days compared to december 31, 2013. in order to maintain high service levels to our hospital customers in numerous geographic regions, we consign inventory to them, including all the various sizes of a particular product, so that our products are available when needed for a surgical procedure. as a result, we have a significant amount of inventory on hand. there are some seasonal trends in our days of inventory on hand, as it usually trends higher in our third quarter due to lower sales volumes and is lower in our fourth quarter when sales volumes are at their highest. other factors that can affect our days of inventory on hand include when we build inventory for new product launches, or the level of excess and obsolete inventory charges and gains/losses related to foreign currency that is reported in cost of products sold in any particular period. our days of inventory on hand in the past three years have ranged between 285 and 356 days. as of december 31, 2014, our days of inventory on hand were near the high end of this range. the higher inventory balance and days of inventory on hand were driven by the ongoing global commercialization of new product offerings, the effects of placing more inventory into distributor and hospital consignment and additional inventory in certain eastern european markets where we now have a direct sales presence instead of selling to a distributor.

zimmer holdings, inc.   2014 form 10-k annual report cash flows used in investing activities were $469.4 million in 2014, compared to $282.5 million in 2013. additions to instruments were relatively consistent between 2014 and 2013 as we continued to invest in instruments for significant product launches, such as persona the personalized knee system. spending on other property, plant and equipment increased in 2014 compared to 2013, reflecting cash outlays necessary to complete new product-related investments and to replace older machinery and equipment. we invest some of our cash and cash equivalents in highly-rated debt securities. the purchases and any sales or maturities of these investments are reflected as cash flows from investing activities. the timing of these investments can vary from period to period depending on the maturity of the debt securities and other cash and cash equivalent needs. in the past three years, we have made a number of business acquisitions including etex holdings, inc., knee creations, llc, normed medizin-technik gmbh, dornoch medical systems, inc., and synvasive technology, inc.
cash flows used in financing activities were $562.4 million in 2014, compared to $467.3 million in 2013. in 2014, we returned cash to our stockholders in the form of cash dividends of $145.5 million and share repurchases of $400.5 million. in association with the debt facilities we entered into for the pending biomet merger, we incurred $64.1 million of debt issuance costs. in 2014, $250.0 million of our outstanding senior notes matured and were paid. additionally, financing cash flows continued to benefit from our increased stock price, with many employees exercising stock options.
in 2014, our board of directors declared cash dividends of $0.22 per share in each quarter. we expect to continue paying cash dividends on a quarterly basis; however, future dividends are subject to approval of the board of directors and may be adjusted as business needs or market conditions change. the 2014 dividend declarations equated to an annualized rate of $0.88 per share, which represented a 10 percent increase over the 2013 annualized rate.
as of december 31, 2014, $599.5 million remained authorized under our $1.0 billion share repurchase program, which has no expiration date. due to the pending merger with biomet, we suspended repurchases after the first quarter of 2014. upon completion of the merger, in the near to medium term we intend to use our cash flows for debt repayment and dividends.
as discussed more completely in note 15 to our consolidated financial statements, the irs has issued proposed adjustments for years 2006 through 2009 reallocating profits between certain of our u.s. and foreign subsidiaries. we have disputed these proposed adjustments and continue to pursue resolution with the irs. although the ultimate timing for resolution of the disputed tax issues is uncertain, future payments may be significant to our operating cash flows.
also as discussed in note 19 to our consolidated financial statements, we have recorded a short-term liability of $50.0 million and long-term liability of $307.2 million related to durom cup product liability claims. we expect to continue paying these claims over the next few years. we expect to be reimbursed a portion of these payments for product liability claims from insurance carriers. we have received an initial amount of the insurance proceeds we estimate to recover. we have a long-term receivable of $170.3 million remaining for future expected reimbursements from our insurance carriers.
we expect to fund the $10.35 billion cash portion of the pending biomet merger with existing cash on hand, as well as proceeds to be obtained from a $3.0 billion 5-year unsecured term loan (term loan) and senior notes that we expect to issue. we have also entered into a $7.66 billion bridge credit agreement (bridge credit agreement) that may be used to fund the pending merger if we are unable to issue senior notes. the lenders commitments under the bridge credit agreement will be reduced dollar-for-dollar by the amount of net cash proceeds we receive from the issuance of the senior notes.
currently, we have three tranches of senior notes outstanding: $500 million aggregate principal amount of 4.625 percent notes due november 30, 2019, $300 million aggregate principal amount of 3.375 percent notes due november 30, 2021 and $500 million aggregate principal amount of 5.75 percent notes due november 30, 2039. interest on each series is payable on may 30 and november 30 of each year until maturity.
we may redeem the senior notes at our election in whole or in part at any time prior to maturity at a redemption price equal to the greater of (i) 100 percent of the principal amount of the notes being redeemed; or (ii) the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest (not including any portion of such payments of interest accrued as of the date of redemption), discounted to the date of redemption on a semi-annual basis at the treasury rate (as defined in the debt agreement), plus 20 basis points in the case of the 2019 and 2021 notes, and 25 basis points in the case of the 2039 notes. we will also pay the accrued and unpaid interest on the senior notes to the redemption date.
we have a senior credit facility (senior credit facility) that contains: (i) the 5-year unsecured term loan in the principal amount of $3.0 billion, and (ii) a 5-year unsecured multicurrency revolving facility (multicurrency revolving facility) in the principal amount of $1.35 billion. the senior credit facility replaces a previous credit agreement that provided for a $1.35 billion revolving credit facility that would have matured in may 2017. the multicurrency revolving facility will mature in may 2019, with two one-year extensions available at our option. borrowings under the multicurrency revolving facility may be used for general corporate purposes. there were no borrowings outstanding under the multicurrency revolving facility as of december 31, 2014. the availability of the term loan is conditioned on, among other things, the consummation of the biomet merger. the term loan will mature five years after the initial borrowing. borrowings under the term loan may only be used by us to fund, in part, the biomet merger, including the payment of any indebtedness of lvb and its subsidiaries, and to pay all or a portion of the costs incurred by us in connection with the biomet merger. we must reduce unused commitments under the term loan and prepay the borrowings under the term loan with any net cash proceeds received from specified asset sales, issuances or sales of equity and incurrences of borrowed

zimmer holdings, inc.   2014 form 10-k annual report money indebtedness, subject to certain exceptions. the commitments under the term loan automatically terminate on the earliest to occur of (i) the funding and disbursement of term loan funds to us, (ii) april 24, 2015, as such date may be extended pursuant to the merger agreement or (iii) termination of the merger agreement.
we and certain of our wholly owned foreign subsidiaries are the borrowers under the senior credit facility. borrowings under the senior credit facility bear interest at floating rates based upon indices determined by the currency of the borrowings plus an applicable margin determined by reference to our senior unsecured long-term credit rating, or at an alternate base rate, or, in the case of borrowings under the multicurrency revolving facility only, at a fixed-rate determined through a competitive bid process. the senior credit facility contains customary affirmative and negative covenants and events of default for an unsecured financing arrangement, including, among other things, limitations on consolidations, mergers and sales of assets. financial covenants include a consolidated indebtedness to consolidated ebitda ratio of no greater than 3.0 to 1.0 in periods prior to any term loan funding and no greater than 5.0 to 1.0 in periods after the term loan is funded. if our credit rating falls below investment grade, additional restrictions would result, including restrictions on investments and payment of dividends. we were in compliance with all covenants under the senior credit facility as of december 31, 2014.
commitments under the senior credit facility are subject to certain fees. on the multicurrency revolving facility, we pay a facility fee at a rate determined by reference to our senior unsecured long-term credit rating. on the term loan, we pay a fee on the daily actual unused commitment for the period from and including july 23, 2014 through the day the commitments under the term loan terminate.
the bridge credit agreement is a 364-day unsecured committed bridge facility in the principal amount of $7.66 billion. funding of loans under the bridge credit agreement is conditioned on, among other things, the consummation of the biomet merger. any loans under the bridge credit agreement will mature 364 days after the funding date of the loans. the bridge credit agreement requires us to reduce unused commitments and prepay the loans with any net cash proceeds received from specified asset sales, issuances or sales of equity and incurrences of borrowed money indebtedness, such as new senior notes we intend to issue, subject to certain exceptions. commitments under the bridge credit agreement automatically terminate on the earliest to occur of: (i) the funding and disbursement of the loans, (ii) april 24, 2015, as such date may be extended pursuant to the merger agreement, or (iii) termination of the merger agreement. proceeds of loans under the bridge credit agreement may only be used to fund, in part, the biomet merger, including the payment of any indebtedness of lvb and its subsidiaries, and to pay all or a portion of the costs incurred by us in connection with the biomet merger.
zimmer holdings is the borrower under the bridge credit agreement. borrowings under the bridge credit agreement bear interest at floating rates based upon libor plus an applicable margin determined by reference to our senior unsecured long-term credit rating, or at an alternate base rate. the bridge credit agreement contains customary affirmative and negative covenants and events of default for an unsecured financing arrangement, including, among other things, limitations on consolidations, mergers and sales of assets. financial covenants include a consolidated indebtedness to consolidated ebitda ratio of no greater than 5.0 to 1.0. we were in compliance with all covenants under the bridge credit agreement as of december 31, 2014. if our credit rating falls below investment grade, additional restrictions would result, including restrictions on investments and payment of dividends.
we will pay a funding fee if we borrow under the bridge credit agreement as well as duration fees based on the outstanding principal amount of the loans in the amount and on the dates specified in the bridge credit agreement. in addition, we pay a fee on the daily actual unused commitment for the period from and including july 23, 2014 through the day the commitments under the bridge credit agreement terminate.
we have a term loan agreement with one of the lenders under the senior credit facility for 11.7 billion japanese yen (japan term loan) that will mature on may 31, 2018. borrowings under the japan term loan bear interest at a fixed rate of 0.61 percent per annum until maturity.
we also have other available uncommitted credit facilities totaling $31.9 million.
we currently have investment grade credit ratings from standard and poors ratings services (s&p) of a- and moodys investor services (moodys) of baa1. after the announcement of the biomet merger, s&p placed a creditwatch with negative implications on our rating and has indicated that it expects to lower our rating to bbb if the merger is completed. moodys placed our rating on review for downgrade and expects to lower our rating to baa3 if the merger is completed.
we place our cash and cash equivalents in highly-rated financial institutions and limit the amount of credit exposure to any one entity. we invest only in high-quality financial instruments in accordance with our internal investment policy.
as of december 31, 2014, we had short-term and long-term investments in debt securities with a fair value of $868.9 million. these investments are in debt securities of many different issuers and, therefore, we believe we have no significant concentration of risk with a single issuer. all of these debt securities remain highly-rated and we believe the risk of default by the issuers is low.
as of december 31, 2014, $1,090.1 million of our cash and cash equivalents and short-term and long-term investments were held in jurisdictions outside of the u.s. and are expected to be indefinitely reinvested for continued use in foreign operations. repatriation of these assets to the u.s. may have tax consequences. $844.0 million of this amount is denominated in u.s. dollars and, therefore, bears no foreign currency translation risk. the balance of these assets is denominated in currencies of the various countries where we operate.
28
zimmer holdings, inc.   2014 form 10-k annual report management believes that cash flows from operations and available borrowings under the senior credit facility or from the public and private debt markets are sufficient to meet our working capital, capital expenditure and debt service needs and to fund our pending merger with biomet, as well as return cash to stockholders in the form of dividends. should additional investment opportunities arise, we believe that our earnings, balance sheet and cash flows will allow us to obtain additional capital, if necessary.
contractual obligations we have entered into contracts with various third parties in the normal course of business that will require future payments. the following table illustrates our contractual obligations (in millions):
contractual obligations               total            2015          2016          2018            2020
and 2017      and 2019             and thereafter long-term debt                     $1,402.9              $            $        $602.9          $800.0

other long-term liabilities           405.1                        154.5         125.4           125.2
total contractual obligations      $2,913.3          $119.4        $347.5        $893.6        $1,552.8
$63.3 million of the other long-term liabilities on our balance sheet as of december 31, 2014 are liabilities related to defined benefit pension plans. defined benefit plan liabilities are based upon the underfunded status of the respective plans; they are not based upon future contributions. due to uncertainties regarding future plan asset performance, changes in interest rates and our intentions with respect to voluntary contributions, we are unable to reasonably estimate future contributions beyond 2015. therefore, this table does not include any amounts related to future contributions to our plans. see note 14 to our consolidated financial statements for further information on our defined benefit plans.
also included in other long-term liabilities on our balance sheet are liabilities related to unrecognized tax benefits and corresponding interest and penalties thereon. due to the uncertainties inherent in these liabilities, such as the ultimate timing and resolution of tax audits, we are unable to reasonably estimate the amount or period in which potential tax payments related to these positions will be made. therefore, this table does not include any obligations related to unrecognized tax benefits. additionally, other long-term liabilities on our balance sheet include long-term deferred tax liabilities, primarily related to intangible assets acquired in business combinations and fixed assets. we have excluded these liabilities from this table as well, as they do not represent liabilities that will be settled in cash. see note 15 to our consolidated financial statements for further information on these tax-related accounts.
we have entered into various agreements that may result in future payments dependent upon various events such as the achievement of certain product r&d milestones, sales milestones, or, at our discretion, to maintain exclusive rights to distribute a product. since there is uncertainty on the timing or whether such payments will have to be made, we have not included them in this table. these payments could range from $0 to $60 million.
critical accounting estimates our financial results are affected by the selection and application of accounting policies and methods. significant accounting policies which require managements judgment are discussed below.
excess inventory and instruments  we must determine as of each balance sheet date how much, if any, of our inventory may ultimately prove to be unsaleable or unsaleable at our carrying cost. similarly, we must also determine if instruments on hand will be put to productive use or remain undeployed as a result of excess supply. accordingly, inventory and instruments are written down to their net realizable value. to determine the appropriate net realizable value, we evaluate current stock levels in relation to historical and expected patterns of demand for all of our products and instrument systems and components. the basis for the determination is generally the same for all inventory and instrument items and categories except for work-in-process inventory, which is recorded at cost. obsolete or discontinued items are generally destroyed and completely written off. management evaluates the need for changes to inventory and instruments net realizable values based on market conditions, competitive offerings and other factors on a regular basis.
income taxes - our income tax expense, deferred tax assets and liabilities and reserves for unrecognized tax benefits reflect managements best assessment of estimated future taxes to be paid. we are subject to income taxes in the u.s. and numerous foreign jurisdictions. significant judgments and estimates are required in determining the consolidated income tax expense.
we estimate income tax expense and income tax liabilities and assets by taxable jurisdiction. realization of deferred tax assets in each taxable jurisdiction is dependent on our ability to generate future taxable income sufficient to realize the benefits. we evaluate deferred tax assets on an ongoing basis and provide valuation allowances unless we determine it is more likely than not that the deferred tax benefit will be realized. federal income taxes are provided on the portion of the income of foreign subsidiaries that is expected to be remitted to the u.s.
the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws and regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions across our global operations. we are subject to regulatory review or audit in virtually all of those jurisdictions and those reviews and audits may require extended periods of time to resolve. we record our income tax provisions based on our knowledge of all relevant facts and circumstances, including existing tax laws, our experience with previous settlement agreements, the
29
zimmer holdings, inc.   2014 form 10-k annual report status of current examinations and our understanding of how the tax authorities view certain relevant industry and commercial matters.
we recognize tax liabilities in accordance with the financial accounting standards boards (fasb) guidance on income taxes and we adjust these liabilities when our judgment changes as a result of the evaluation of new information not previously available. due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties, the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from our current estimate of the tax liabilities. these differences will be reflected as increases or decreases to income tax expense in the period in which they are determined.
commitments and contingencies  accruals for product liability and other claims are established with the assistance of internal and external legal counsel based on current information and historical settlement information for claims, related legal fees and for claims incurred but not reported. we use an actuarial model to assist management in determining an appropriate level of accruals for product liability claims. historical patterns of claim loss development over time are statistically analyzed to arrive at factors which are then applied to loss estimates in the actuarial model.
in addition to our general product liability, we have recorded provisions totaling $471.7 million related to the durom cup, including $21.5 million in 2014. see note 19 to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the durom cup.
goodwill and intangible assets  we evaluate the carrying value of goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets annually, or whenever events or circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. we evaluate the carrying value of finite life intangible assets whenever events or circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. significant assumptions are required to estimate the fair value of goodwill and intangible assets, most notably estimated future cash flows generated by these assets. as such, these fair value measurements use significant unobservable inputs. changes to these assumptions could require us to record impairment charges on these assets.
in the fourth quarter of 2012, we determined our u.s. spine reporting units carrying value was in excess of its estimated fair value. fair value was determined using a weighting of income and market approaches. fair value under the income approach was determined by discounting to present value the estimated future cash flows of the reporting unit. fair value under the market approach utilized the guideline public company methodology, which uses valuation indicators determined from other businesses that are similar to our u.s. spine reporting unit.
as a result, we recorded a goodwill impairment charge for the u.s. spine reporting unit of $96.0 million in 2012. see note 8 to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion and the factors that contributed to these impairment charges and the factors that could lead to further impairment. in 2014 and 2013, we employed a similar combination of income and market approaches to estimate this reporting units fair value and determined there were no impairment charges necessary. for our annual impairment test in 2014, the goodwill balance of the u.s. spine reporting unit was $41.0 million. due to improved operating performance of our u.s. spine reporting unit and improving macroenomic conditions, including higher valuation indicators used in our market approach, the u.s. spine reporting units estimated fair value was in excess of its carrying value of net assets by 24 percent for our 2014 impairment test. our international spine goodwill and related net assets are not tested separately for goodwill impairment as they are part of reporting units that contain other product categories.
we have four other reporting units with goodwill assigned to them. our 2013 annual impairment test indicated the estimated fair value of the u.s. dental reporting unit was in excess of its carrying value of net assets by 11 percent. for the annual impairment test in 2014, the goodwill balance of the u.s. dental reporting unit was $169.1 million. in our 2014 annual impairment test, due to improved operating performance and improving macroenomic conditions, including higher valuation indicators used in our market approach, the u.s. dental reporting units estimated fair value was in excess of its carrying value of net assets by 24 percent.
in 2014, for our three other reporting units annual impairment test, we performed a qualitative assessment of changes in fair value from the 2013 income approach. a qualitative assessment was performed because the estimated fair value of each of the reporting units was significantly in excess of the carrying value of its net assets in the 2013 impairment test.
share-based payment  we measure share-based payment expense at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and recognize expense over the requisite service period. determining the fair value of share-based awards at the grant date requires judgment, including estimating the expected life of stock options and the expected volatility of our stock. additionally, we must estimate the amount of share-based awards that are expected to be forfeited. we estimate expected volatility based upon the implied volatility of actively traded options on our stock. the expected life of stock options and estimated forfeitures are based upon our employees historical exercise and forfeiture behaviors. the assumptions used in determining the grant date fair value and the expected forfeitures represent managements best estimates.
recent accounting pronouncements see note 2 to our consolidated financial statements to see how recent accounting pronouncements have affected or may affect our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

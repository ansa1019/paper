(unless indicated otherwise, dollars in millions except per share amounts)
overview we create, manufacture and supply flavors and fragrances for the food, beverage, personal care and household-products industries either in the form of compounds or individual ingredients. our flavors and fragrance compounds combine a large number of ingredients that are blended, mixed or reacted together to produce proprietary formulas created by our perfumers and flavorists.
flavors are the key building blocks that impart taste in processed food and beverage products and, as such, play a significant role in determining consumer preference of the end products in which they are used. while we are a global leader, our flavors business is more regional in nature, with different formulas that reflect local tastes and ingredients. as a leading creator of flavors, we help our customers deliver on the promise of delicious and healthy foods and drinks that appeal to consumers. our flavors compounds are ultimately used by our customers in four end-use categories: (1) savory, (2) beverages, (3) sweet, pharmaceutical and oral care ("sweet"), and (4) dairy.
our fragrances are a key component in the world's finest perfumes and best-known consumer brands, including beauty care, fabric care, personal wash and home care products. in 2014, we announced that we realigned our creative and commercial teams within our fragrance compounds activities resulting in two newly-defined broad market categories, (1) fine fragrances and (2) consumer fragrances. consumer fragrances consists of five end-use categories: fabric care, home care, personal wash, hair care and toiletries. prior to the realignment, our fragrance compounds activities consisted of two broad categories (1) fine fragrance and beauty care and (2) functional fragrances. in addition, fragrance ingredients, which are used internally and sold to third parties, including customers and competitors, for use in preparation of compounds, are also included in the fragrances business unit.
the flavors and fragrances market is part of a larger market which supplies a variety of ingredients and components that consumer products companies utilize in their products. the broader market includes large multinational companies or smaller regional and local participants which supply products such as seasonings, texturizers, spices, enzymes, certain food related commodities, fortified products and cosmetic ingredients. the flavors and fragrances market is estimated to be at least $18 billion; however the exact size of the global market is not available due to fragmentation of data. we, together with the other top three companies are estimated to comprise approximately two-thirds of the total estimated sales in the global flavors and fragrances sub-segment of the broader market.
development of new flavors and fragrance compounds is driven by a variety of sources, including requests from our customers, who are in need of a specific flavor or fragrance for use in a new or modified consumer product, or as a result of internal initiatives stemming from our consumer insights program. our product development team works in partnership with our scientists and researchers to optimize the consumer appeal of the flavor or fragrance. it then becomes a collaborative process between our researchers, our product development team and our customers to perfect the flavor or fragrance so that it is ready to be included in the final consumer product.
our 25 largest customers accounted for 53% of total sales in 2014; this percentage has remained fairly constant for several years. a key factor for commercial success is inclusion on our strategic customers' core supplier lists, which provides opportunities to win new business. we are on the core supplier lists of a large majority of our global and strategic customers within fragrances and flavors.
sales in 2014 grew 5% both on a reported basis and in local currency (lc) terms, with the acquisition of aromor adding approximately 1% to both reported and local currency basis amounts. flavors achieved lc growth of 4% and fragrances
27
achieved lc growth of 7% in 2014. the lc growth reflects new win performance (net of losses) in both flavors and fragrance compounds partially offset by volume erosion on existing business. in addition, fragrance ingredients sales were up 18% driven largely by the aromor acquisition. overall, our 2014 results continued to be driven by our strong emerging market presence that represented 50% of total sales and experienced 6% lc growth in 2014. from a geographic perspective, all regions delivered lc growth on a consolidated basis in 2014; led by latin america (la) with 7% lc sales growth.
the year 2014 included an extra week of activity, due to the timing of our fiscal year-end (as discussed in note 1 of the consolidated financial statements). the impact of this week was not material to our results of operations for the year ended december 31, 2014.

financial performance overview reported sales for 2014 increased 5% year-over-year (including approximately 1% growth from the acquisition of aromor). we continue to benefit from our diverse portfolio of end-use product categories and geographies and had growth in all four regions and in consumer fragrances, fragrance ingredients and flavor compounds. both flavors and fragrances benefited from new win performance (net of losses) that was partially offset by volume erosion on existing business. exchange rate variations were flat in year-over-year sales. the effect of exchange rates can vary by business and region depending upon the mix of sales by country as well as the relative percentage of local sales priced in u.s. dollars versus local currencies. lc sales growth of 5% in 2014 was consistent with our long-term strategic target of 4%-6% lc growth. we saw good lc sales growth during each quarter of 2014, despite the impact of volume erosion on existing business. regarding our 2015 outlook,
28
we believe that lc sales growth will be in line with our long-term targets, while operating profit growth is expected to be at the low end of the range, in light of a stronger u.s. dollar versus most currencies and higher incentive compensation expense. in addition, we believe eps growth will be high single-digits, driven by operating profit growth.
on a long-term basis we expect that sales growth for the industry will generally be in line with the underlying assumptions that support our long-term strategic goals, albeit with some risk in the near term given the continuing global economic uncertainty. we believe changing social habits resulting from increased disposable income, improved focus on personal health and wellness awareness should help drive growth of our consumer product customers' businesses.
gross margins increased 60 basis points (bps) year-over-year, due to solid sales growth, and benefits from cost and productivity initiatives, that more than offset the slightly unfavorable price versus input cost dynamic during 2014. however, the overall raw material cost base remains elevated, including certain categories where prices remain near all time highs. we believe input costs will increase approximately 1% in 2015 as higher prices on certain categories, such as naturals, will more than offset potential benefits associated with oil-based derivatives that are expected to occur later in 2015. we continue to seek improvements in our margins through operational performance and mix enhancement.
operating profit increased $76.0 million to $592.3 million (19.2% of sales) in 2014 compared to $516.3 million (17.5% of sales) in 2013. included in 2014 were operational improvement initiative costs of $2.5 million, restructuring and other charges, net of $1.3 million and $5.1 million of accelerated depreciation included in cost of goods sold related to the fragrance ingredients rationalization and several locations in asia. excluding these charges, adjusted operating profit was $601.3 million (19.5% of sales) for 2014. included in 2013 were operational improvement initiative costs of $3.7 million primarily related to closing a smaller facility in europe and certain manufacturing activities in asia while transferring production to larger facilities in each respective region and accelerated depreciation associated with several locations in asia, as well as restructuring costs of $7.4 million related to the fragrance ingredients rationalization. in addition, 2013 included a $13.0 million charge related to the spanish capital tax case. excluding these charges, adjusted operating profit was $540.4 million (18.3% of sales) for 2013. the year-over-year improvement reflects sales volume growth combined with reduced r&d, selling and administrative expenses as a percentages of sales, all of which were driven largely by favorable year-over-year incentive compensation expenses. the results of aromor were not significant to the consolidated financial performance of the company for 2014.
although we are in the process of refreshing the key elements of our strategic priorities, we continued to execute against the core elements of the strategic priorities identified during our in depth 2010 strategic assessment. in particular, ensuring that we have adequate resources and capabilities in place to support planned growth in emerging markets through investments and installing key technologies globally was the primary driver related to the $143.2 million (4.6% of sales) of capital spending during 2014. we anticipate capital spending in 2015 to be 4-5% of sales, net of potential grants and other reimbursements from government authorities that we expect to receive as we continue to prioritize investments in emerging markets and flavors.
cash flows from operations were $518.4 million or 16.8% of sales in 2014 as compared to cash flows from operations of $407.6 million, or 13.8% of sales, during 2013. excluding an incremental pension contribution of $15 million year-over-year and total spanish tax payments of $33 million (related to the 2003 and 2011 fiscal years) made during 2013, our adjusted cash flow from operations was $455.6 million in 2013, representing an increase of $62.8 million in 2014 from 2013.

cost of goods sold includes the cost of materials and manufacturing expenses; raw materials generally constitute 70% of the total. r&d expenses relate to the development of new and improved molecules and technologies, technical product support and compliance with governmental regulations. s&a expenses include expenses necessary to support our commercial activities and administrative expenses principally associated with staff groups that support our overall operating activities.
2014 in comparison to 2013
sales sales for 2014 totaled $3.1 billion, an increase of 5% from the prior year on both a reported and lc basis, with the acquisition of aromor adding approximately 1% to both reported and lc basis amounts. the lc growth reflects new win performance (net of losses) in both flavors and fragrance compounds partially offset by volume erosion on existing business. in addition, fragrance ingredients sales were up 18% (which includes the benefit of the aromor acquisition). overall lc growth was driven by 6% growth in emerging markets.

flavors business unit on a reported basis, flavors sales increased 2%. excluding the impact of foreign currency, lc sales for the flavors business increased 4% versus the prior year period. the overall performance reflects new wins offset by volume erosion on existing business. overall high single-digit growth in beverage combined with low single-digit growth in savory and mid single-digit growth in dairy was partially offset by low single-digit declines in sweet. regionally, the flavors business delivered lc growth in la, eame and ga, led by la, while sales declined in noam. sales in la were driven by high double-digit gains in beverage. sales in ga were led by mid single-digit gains in savory and sales in eame were driven by double-digit gains in beverage. the declines in noam were primarily driven by low single-digit declines in beverage and sweet, which were only partially offset by double-digit gains in dairy. eame performance continues to be led by our performance in the emerging market countries within the region. globally, flavors growth was led by high single-digit growth in emerging markets. overall, emerging markets represented approximately 52% of total flavors sales.
fragrances business unit the fragrances business was up 7% in both reported and lc terms. year-over-year, 2014 lc sales performance was led by double-digit growth in fragrance ingredients, high single-digit growth in fabric care and mid single-digit growth in hair care categories, as well as low single-digit growth in fine fragrances. lc growth within the regions was led by ga at 11% reflecting double-digit gains in the fabric care and fragrance ingredients. eame experienced lc sales growth of 8% reflecting double-digit gains in fragrance ingredients and high single-digit gains in fabric care. la had lc sales growth of 3% reflecting double-digit gains in hair care and personal wash. noam lc sales increased 4% reflecting double-digit gains in home care and mid to high single-digit gains in fabric care and hair care categories that more than offset low single-digit declines in fragrance ingredients. overall, emerging markets represented 47% of total fragrances sales.

_______________________
(1)   local currency sales growth is calculated by translating prior year sales at the exchange rates for the corresponding 2014 period.
•   noam reported sales growth of 1% reflecting a decline of 1% in flavors as double-digit growth in dairy was more than offset by volume declines in sweet and beverage, and 4% growth in fragrances. consumer fragrances sales were up 8% versus last year as new wins and volume gains in home care and fabric care were only partially offset by lower volumes on existing business in fragrance ingredients.
•   eame lc growth reflects 4% growth in flavors primarily resulting from double-digit gains in beverages. this growth was mainly due to new wins within our emerging markets in the region, as well as volume increases. total fragrances growth of 8% was driven by double-digit growth in fragrance ingredients as well as high single-digit growth in fabric care.
•   la lc sales growth of 7% was driven by double-digit gains in flavors, driven by beverage. total fragrances growth reflects double-digit gains in hair care and mid single-digit gains in fabric care.
•   ga delivered lc sales growth of 6%, led by mid single-digit gains in savory. both consumer fragrances and fine fragrances experienced high single-digit growth led by double-digit growth in fabric care and high single-digit growth in fine fragrances. in addition, ga experienced fragrance ingredients lc sales growth of 33%.

cost of goods sold cost of goods sold, as a percentage of sales, decreased 60 bps, on both a reported and adjusted basis, to 55.9% in 2014 compared to 56.5% in 2013 (or 55.6% and 56.2% on an adjusted basis in 2014 and 2013, respectively). included in cost of goods sold was $7.6 million of charges related to restructuring and operational improvement initiative costs in 2014 and $8.8 million of restructuring and operational improvement initiative costs in 2013.
research and development (r&d)
r&d expenses decreased approximately $6.2 million versus the prior year. overall, r&d expenses decreased 60 bps as a percentage of sales from 8.8% in 2013 to 8.2% in 2014. this decrease is primarily driven by lower incentive compensation expense.
selling and administrative (s&a)
s&a, as a percentage of sales, decreased 40 bps to 16.7% versus 17.1%. excluding the $13.0 million spanish capital tax charge (as discussed in note 17 to the consolidated financial statements) in 2013, adjusted s&a expenses, as a percentage of sales, were 16.7% in 2013, consistent with the current year.
restructuring and other charges restructuring and other charges primarily consist of separation costs for employees, including severance, outplacement and other benefit costs.

flavors business unit flavors segment profit totaled $331.3 million in 2014 (22.7% of sales) consistent with $323.6 million (22.7% of sales) in the comparable 2013 period. the increase in segment profit was driven by lower incentive compensation expense.
fragrances business unit fragrances segment profit totaled $335.4 million in 2014 (20.6% of sales), compared to $283.7 million (18.5% of sales) reported in 2013. the improvement in segment profit and profit margin was primarily due to strong sales growth combined with gross margin expansion, ongoing cost discipline, and lower incentive compensation expense.
global expenses global expenses represent corporate and headquarter-related expenses which include legal, finance, human resources and r&d and other administrative expenses that are not allocated to an individual business unit. in 2014, global expenses were $65.4 million compared to $66.9 million during 2013. the decrease is principally driven by lower incentive compensation expense.
interest expense in 2014, interest expense decreased $0.7 million to $46.1 million, as a result of the refinancing of our debt in 2013. average cost of debt was 4.9% for the 2014 period compared to 4.7% in 2013.
other (income) expense, net other (income) expense, net decreased approximately $12.8 million to $2.8 million of income in 2014 versus $15.6 million of income in 2013. the decrease was largely driven by a $14.2 million gain related to the sale of non-operating assets that occurred during 2013.
income taxes the effective tax rate was 24.5% in 2014 as compared to 27.1% in 2013. excluding the $2.6 million tax benefit associated with the pretax restructuring charges and operational improvement initiative costs as well as the $3.8 million tax benefit related to the reserve reversal for the 2001 spanish dividend withholding tax case (as discussed in note 9 of the consolidated financial statements), the adjusted tax rate for 2014 is 25.3%. excluding the tax charge of $6.2 million related to the 2002-2003 income tax cases (as discussed in note 9 of the consolidated financial statements) and net of the $3.9 million tax benefit associated with the pretax spanish capital tax charge (as discussed in note 17 of the consolidated financial statements), the adjusted tax rate for 2013 was 25.7%. the year-over-year reduction reflects a benefit from mix of earnings and lower loss provisions partially offset by a higher cost of repatriation.

2013 in comparison to 2012
sales sales for 2013 totaled $3.0 billion, an increase of 5% from the prior year. excluding currency impacts, lc sales grew by 5% (or 6% on a like-for-like basis, excluding the effects of the exit of low margin sales activities in flavors), driven principally by new wins and the realization of price increases. lc sales growth was largely driven by new customer wins, with price offset by volume reductions on existing business, primarily in fragrance ingredients.
flavors business unit on a reported basis, flavors sales increased 3%. excluding the impact of foreign currency, lc sales for the flavors business increased 4% versus the prior year period. excluding the impact of a 2% decline in sales associated with the strategic decision to exit certain lower margin sales activities, lc sales increased 6% on a like-for-like basis. the increase was driven by growth from new wins. lc growth was led by double-digit gains in beverages, mid single-digit gains in savory and single-digit gains in sweet, all of which benefited from new wins, supported by our innovative technology. regionally, the business benefited from mid to high single-digit lc growth in ga, eame and la, which was partially offset by low single-digit lc declines in noam. on a like-for-like basis, noam experienced mid single-digit growth. lc growth in eame and ga reflect growth in all categories led by double-digit growth in beverages in eame and high single-digit gains in savory and dairy in ga. la lc growth reflects double-digit growth in beverages. sales in noam were led by double-digit gains in beverages. eame performance was led by our performance in the emerging market countries within the region. globally, flavors growth was led by high single-digit growth in emerging markets. overall, emerging markets represented approximately 51% of total flavors sales.
fragrances business unit the fragrances business was up 6% in both reported and lc terms compared to flat lc sales in 2012 over 2011. new wins across fragrance compounds were partially offset by volume declines in fragrance ingredients principally related to the transition of volume to fragrance compounds. year-over-year, 2013 lc sales performance was led by double-digit growth in fabric care and high single-digit growth in fine fragrances and hair care categories along with mid single-digit gains in toiletries and home care. offsetting these gains was a 4% decline in fragrance ingredients. lc growth within the regions was led by ga at 13% reflecting double-digit gains in the hair care and toiletries categories and double-digit gains in fabric care and high single-digit growth in fragrance ingredients. la experienced lc sales growth of 11% reflecting double-digit gains in fine fragrances and the fabric care and personal wash categories and eame had lc sales growth of 4% reflecting double-digit gains in fine fragrances and mid to high single-digit gains in fabric care, hair care and toiletries categories, with both regions partially offset by mid single-digit declines in fragrance ingredients. noam lc sales decreased reflecting double-digit gains in home care and hair care categories that were more than offset by high single-digit declines in fine fragrances, fabric care and fragrance ingredients. overall, emerging markets represented 47% of total fragrances sales.

(1)   local currency sales growth is calculated by translating prior year sales at the exchange rates for the corresponding 2013 period.
•   noam reported sales decline reflects a 2% flavors decline as double-digit growth in beverages was more than offset by volume declines in sweet and dairy, driven primarily by the exit of low margin sales activities. in fragrances, consumer fragrances sales were up 4% versus last year as new wins and volume gains in home care were offset by lower volumes on existing business in fabric care. fine fragrances sales declined 6% as a result of mid single-digit

declines in fine fragrances. on a like-for-like basis, excluding the effects of the exit of low margin sales activities, noam flavors experienced mid single-digit growth.
•   eame lc growth was led by 6% growth in flavors resulting from double-digit gains in beverages along with mid single-digit growth in savory. this growth was mainly due to new wins within our emerging markets in the region, as well as volume increases. on a like-for-like basis, excluding the effects of the exit of low margin sales activities, eame flavors experienced high single-digit growth. fine fragrances had lc sales growth of 11% and consumer fragrances experienced 4% lc growth driven by high single-digit gains in fabric care and mid single-digit growth in hair care and toiletries, which more than offset volume declines in fragrance ingredients of 6% year-over-year.
•   la lc sales growth of 10% was driven by double-digit gains in fragrance compounds, reflecting double-digit lc sales growth in fabric care, personal wash and fine fragrances, and mid single-digit growth in hair care and toiletries categories, which were only partially offset by mid single-digit volume declines in fragrance ingredients. flavors lc sales growth was 8%, driven by double-digit gains in beverages and mid single-digit gains in savory, which were only partially offset by single-digit declines in sweet (as a result of exiting low margin sales activities). on a like-for-like basis, excluding the effects of the exit of low margin sales activities, la flavors experienced double-digit growth.
•   ga delivered lc sales growth of 9%, led by high single-digit gains in savory and dairy, along with mid single-digit growth in beverages and sweet categories. on a like-for-like basis, excluding the effects of the exit of low margin sales activities, ga flavors experienced high single-digit growth. consumer fragrances experienced double-digit growth led by high double-digit growth in fabric care, hair care and toiletries. in addition, ga experienced fragrance ingredients lc sales growth of 8%.
cost of goods sold cost of goods sold, as a percentage of sales, decreased 180 bps to 56.5% in 2013 compared to 58.3% in 2012. the improvement versus prior year was mainly driven by a slightly favorable input cost environment, manufacturing efficiencies, favorable sales mix and price realization. overall, raw material costs have decreased slightly on a year-over-year basis.
research and development (r&d)
r&d expenses increased approximately $26.1 million versus the prior year as a result of additional investments in technology and innovation, consistent with our strategy to accelerate levels of innovation into the marketplace. our product portfolio is actively managed to support gross margin expansion and be aligned with the strategic priorities identified for each of our operating segments. overall, r&d expenses increased 50 bps as a percentage of sales from 8.3% in 2012 to 8.8% in 2013.
selling and administrative (s&a)
s&a, as a percentage of sales, increased 100 bps to 17.1% versus 16.1%. excluding the $13.0 million spanish capital tax charge (as discussed in note 17 to the consolidated financial statements), adjusted s&a expenses, as a percentage of sales, were 16.7%, an increase of 60 bps from the prior year. the increase in adjusted s&a expenses was driven by higher incentive compensation, planned spend in sales activities (mainly in emerging markets) as well as the mark-to-market costs of our deferred compensation plan awards.
restructuring and other charges restructuring and other charges primarily consist of separation costs for employees, including severance, outplacement and other benefit costs.

fragrance ingredients rationalization during the second quarter of 2013, the company announced that it intended to close its fragrance ingredients manufacturing facility in augusta, georgia by july 2014 and planned to consolidate production into other company facilities. the company recorded total charges of $7.4 million during 2013, consisting of $2.2 million of pre-tax charges related to
35
severance included in restructuring and other charges, net and $5.2 million of non-cash charges related to accelerated depreciation included in cost of goods sold.
strategic initiative in december 2011, we recorded a charge to cover a restructuring which involved a reduction in workforce as well as a realignment of responsibilities in our fragrances business unit. this alignment partly addresses issues identified in our 2010 strategic review process towards improving the underperforming areas of our portfolio. it resulted in the redeployment of creative resources in emerging markets and the reorganization from a regional to a global category structure. we implemented a plan to streamline business operations globally which resulted in the elimination of 72 positions, across fragrances, flavors and corporate functions. as a result, we recorded a provision for severance costs of $9.8 million to restructuring and other charges. we recorded an additional net charge of $1.7 million during the twelve months ended december 31, 2012, principally attributable to adjustments based on the final separation terms with affected employees. we realized pre-tax savings of approximately $8 million in 2012.
european rationalization plan during the second quarter 2011, we executed a partial settlement of our pension obligations with the former employees of the drogheda, ireland facility. as a result, we recorded a charge of $3.9 million related to the european rationalization plan to cover settlements and special termination benefits. this settlement was funded primarily through pension plan investment trust assets.
we also reversed $1.2 million of employee-related liabilities in 2011 due to certain employees accepting other roles within the company, offset by $0.6 million of additional costs incurred.
based upon the period-end estimates regarding the separation agreements, we increased our provision for severance costs by $4.4 million in 2010. the remaining $5.7 million of the restructuring charges in 2010 was mainly due to accelerated depreciation and other restructuring related costs pertaining to the rationalization of our fragrances and ingredients operations in europe.
in the aggregate, as of december 31, 2013, we have recorded expenses of $34.1 million relating to the european rationalization plan and $11.5 million for the strategic initiative, of which $41.5 million was recorded to restructuring and other charges, net and $11.6 million was recorded to cost of goods sold, r&d and selling and administrative expenses.

flavors business unit flavors segment profit totaled $323.6 million in 2013 (22.7% of sales) compared to $298.3 million (21.6% of sales) in the comparable 2012 period. the improvement in profitability was mainly driven by strong volume growth, favorable category mix, including the impact of exiting low margin sales activities, and the net impact of price versus input costs, which were
36
partially offset by ongoing investments in r&d, higher employee costs and increased incentive compensation related to strong 2013 performance.
fragrances business unit fragrances segment profit totaled $283.7 million in 2013 (18.5% of sales), compared to $238.4 million (16.5% of sales) reported in 2012. the increase in profitability was driven by the strong sales growth combined with further gross margin expansion and ongoing cost discipline, which more than offset increased r&d and incentive compensation related to strong 2013 performance.
global expenses global expenses represent corporate and headquarter-related expenses which include legal, finance, human resources and r&d and other administrative expenses that are not allocated to an individual business unit. in 2013, global expenses were $66.9 million compared to $48.4 million during 2012. the increase principally includes higher incentive compensation and pension costs.
interest expense in 2013, interest expense increased $5.0 million to $46.8 million. the increase in interest expense principally reflects new long-term borrowings from our senior note offering in the second quarter of 2013. average cost of debt was 4.7% for the 2013 period compared to 4.6% in 2012.
other (income) expense, net other (income) expense, net increased approximately $17.1 million to $15.6 million of income in 2013 versus $1.5 million of expense in 2012. the increase was largely driven by a $14.2 million gain related to the sale of non-operating assets that occurred during 2013.
income taxes the effective tax rate was 27.1% in 2013 as compared to 42.7% in 2012. excluding the tax charge of $6.2 million related to the 2002-2003 income tax cases (as discussed in note 9 of the consolidated financial statements) and net of the $3.9 million tax benefit associated with the pretax spanish capital tax charge (as discussed in note 17 of the consolidated financial statements), the adjusted tax rate for 2013 was 25.7%. included in 2012 results are tax charges of $72.4 million associated with the spanish tax settlement and pre-tax restructuring charges of $1.7 million ($1.1 million after-tax). excluding these items, the adjusted effective tax rate for 2012 was 26.4%. the 2012 period also includes a provision of $12.4 million related to the spanish dividend withholding tax cases, which was partially offset by a $10.6 million benefit due to a corporate restructuring of certain of our foreign subsidiaries, a lower cost of remittances and other reserve adjustments on uncertain tax positions. the year-over-year reduction also reflects the reinstatement of the u.s. federal r&d credit in 2013 partially offset by a higher cost of repatriation.
liquidity and capital resources cash and cash equivalents we had cash and cash equivalents of $478.6 million at december 31, 2014 compared to $405.5 million at december 31, 2013, of which $249.1 million of the balance at december 31, 2014 was held outside the united states. cash balances held in foreign jurisdictions are, in most circumstances, available to be repatriated to the united states; however, they would be subject to united states federal income taxes, less applicable foreign tax credits. we have not provided u.s. income tax expense on accumulated earnings of our foreign subsidiaries because we have the ability and plan to reinvest the undistributed earnings indefinitely.
effective utilization of the cash generated by our international operations is a critical component of our tax strategy. strategic dividend repatriation from foreign subsidiaries creates u.s. taxable income, which enables us to realize u.s. deferred tax assets. the company regularly repatriates, in the form of dividends from its non-u.s. subsidiaries, a portion of its current year earnings to fund financial obligations in the u.s. these repatriations of current year earnings totaled $248.0 million, $128.0 million and $97.6 million in 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively.
cash flows from operating activities operating cash flows in 2014 were $518.4 million compared to $407.6 million in 2013, which included $48 million of cash payments related to the spanish tax cases and incremental u.s. pension contributions, and $323.8 million in 2012, which included an outflow of cash of $105.5 million associated with the spanish tax settlement (as discussed in note 9 to the
37
consolidated financial statements). the cash flow impact associated with core working capital (trade receivables, inventories and accounts payable) improved compared to 2013. operating cash flows versus the prior year also reflect strong net income growth and improvements in working capital as a percentage of sales. although we have appealed the lower court ruling on our spanish capital tax case, we made payment of $11.2 million (representing the principal amount) to the spanish government relating to the case during the first quarter of 2014, which is refundable if we prevail on our appeal.
working capital (current assets less current liabilities) totaled $1,191.2 million at year-end 2014 compared to $1,092.5 million at december 31, 2013. this increase in working capital of $98.7 million primarily reflects strong sales growth and inventory increases associated with plant startups. the company sold certain accounts receivable on a non-recourse basis to unrelated financial institutions under "factoring" agreements that are sponsored, solely and individually, by certain customers. we believe that participating in the factoring programs strengthens our relationships with these customers and provides operational efficiencies. we estimate that, as a result of participating in the programs, there was a beneficial impact to cash inflows from operations of approximately $33 million, $7 million and $18 million in 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. the cost of participating in these programs was immaterial to our results in all periods.
cash flows used in investing activities net investing activities in 2014 utilized $221.3 million compared to $105.4 million and $114.3 million in 2013 and 2012, respectively. the increase in the investing activities was principally driven by the acquisition of aromor in the first quarter of 2014.
additions to property, plant and equipment were $143.2 million, $134.2 million and $126.1 million in 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively, and are again expected to be 4-5% of sales in 2015, net of potential grants and other reimbursements from government authorities that we expect to receive. investments were largely focused on emerging markets and new technology consistent with our strategy.
on january 16, 2014, the company completed the acquisition of aromor flavors and fragrances ltd., a privately held manufacturer and marketer of complex specialty ingredients that are used in fragrances and flavors. iff funded the transaction with cash.
cash flows (used in) provided by financing activities net financing activities in 2014 had an outflow of $202.3 million compared to an outflow of $217.0 million and an inflow of $25.4 million in 2013 and 2012, respectively. the decrease in outflow of cash used in financing activities in 2014 as compared to 2013 principally reflects higher incremental dividend payments and treasury share repurchases in 2014 which were more than offset by the repayment of long-term debt of $100 million made in july 2013. the outflow of cash used in financing activities in 2013 compared to the inflow of cash in 2012 principally reflects the repayment of long-term debt of $100 million made in 2013 and changes in the revolving credit facility borrowings in 2013 compared to 2012.
at december 31, 2014, we had $942.3 million of debt outstanding compared to $932.8 million outstanding at december 31, 2013.
we paid dividends totaling $133.2 million, $87.3 million and $130.9 million in 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. the cash dividend declared per share in 2014, 2013 and 2012 was $1.72, $1.46 and $1.30, respectively.
in december 2012, the board of directors authorized a $250 million share repurchase program, which commenced in the first quarter of 2013 and is expected to be completed by the end of 2014. based on the total remaining amount of $109 million available under the repurchase program, approximately 1.1 million shares, or 1.4% of shares outstanding (based on the market price and shares outstanding as of december 31, 2014) could be repurchased under the program as of december 31, 2014. the purchases will be made from time to time on the open market or through private transactions as market and business conditions warrant. repurchased shares will be placed into treasury stock.
capital resources operating cash flow provides the primary source of funds for capital investment needs, dividends paid to shareholders and debt repayments. we anticipate that cash flows from operations and availability under our existing credit facilities are sufficient to meet our investing and financing needs for at least the next eighteen months. we regularly assess our capital structure, including both current and long-term debt instruments, as compared to our cash generation and investment needs in order to provide ample flexibility and to optimize our leverage ratios. we believe our existing cash balances are sufficient to meet our debt service requirements.
38
credit facility and senior notes we supplement short-term liquidity with access to capital markets, mainly through bank credit facilities and issuance of commercial paper. we did not issue commercial paper during 2014 and 2013.
credit facility in april 2014, we amended and restated our unsecured revolving credit facility, including to modify the available tranches, reduce the applicable margin on the interest rate on advances under the credit facility and extend the maturity date of the credit facility to april 2019.
there are two tranches under the credit facility. the tranche a facility is available in u.s. dollars, euros, swiss francs, japanese yen and british sterling in an aggregate amount up to an equivalent of $456.0 million, with a sublimit of $25.0 million for swing line borrowings. the tranche b facility is available in euros, swiss francs, japanese yen and british sterling in an aggregate amount up to an equivalent of $494.0 million. the credit facility is available for general corporate purposes and may be extended for up to two additional one-year periods at the company's request, subject to the agreement of the lenders having commitments representing more than 50% of the aggregate commitments of all lenders under the credit facility. borrowings under the credit facility bear interest at an annual rate of libor plus a margin, currently 112.5 bps, linked to our credit rating. the interest rate under our credit facility at december 31, 2014 was 1.41%. the credit facility contains various affirmative and negative covenants, including the requirement for us to maintain, at the end of each fiscal quarter, a ratio of net debt for borrowed money to adjusted ebitda in respect of the previous 12-month period of not more than 3.25 to 1. based on this ratio, at december 31, 2014 our covenant compliance would provide overall borrowing capacity of $1,831.8 million.
on april 26, 2013, the company repaid the full amount outstanding under the credit facility ($283.1 million). as of december 31, 2014 we had no borrowings under the credit facility. the amount which we are able to draw down on under the credit facility is limited by financial covenants as described in more detail below. our drawdown capacity on the credit facility was $940.4 million at december 31, 2014. see note 8 to the consolidated financial statements for further information on the credit facility.
at december 31, 2014 and 2013 we were in compliance with all financial and other covenants, including the net debt to adjusted ebitda ratio. at december 31, 2014 our net debt/adjusted ebitda(1) ratio was 0.65 to 1 as defined by the credit facility, well below the financial covenants of existing outstanding debt. failure to comply with the financial and other covenants under our debt agreements would constitute default and would allow the lenders to accelerate the maturity of all indebtedness under the related agreement. if such acceleration were to occur, we would not have sufficient liquidity available to repay the indebtedness. we would likely have to seek amendments under the agreements for relief from the financial covenants or repay the debt with proceeds from the issuance of new debt or equity, and/or asset sales, if necessary. we may be unable to amend the agreements or raise sufficient capital to repay such obligations in the event the maturities are accelerated.

senior notes senior notes - 2013. in april 2013, we issued $300.0 million face amount of 3.20% senior notes ("senior notes - 2013") due 2023 at a discount of $0.3 million, to take advantage of attractive borrowing rates and maintain efficiency and flexibility in our capital structure, and received proceeds of $297.8 million. the senior notes -2013 bear interest at a rate of 3.20% per year, with interest payable on may 1 and november 1 of each year, commencing on november 1, 2013. see note 8 to the consolidated financial statements for further information on the senior notes - 2013.
senior notes - 2007. in september 2007, we issued an aggregate of $500.0 million of senior unsecured notes in four series, with $250.0 million due in 2017, $100.0 million due in 2019, $50 million due in 2022 and $100.0 million due in 2027. see note 8 to the consolidated financial statements for further information on the senior notes - 2007.
senior notes - 2006. in 2006, we issued an aggregate of $375.0 million of senior unsecured notes in four series, of which $250.0 million has been repaid, and the remaining $125.0 million is due in 2016. see note 8 to the consolidated financial statements for further information on the senior notes - 2013.
other commitments compliance with existing governmental requirements regulating the discharge of materials into the environment has not materially affected our operations, earnings or competitive position. in 2014 and 2013, we spent $4.3 million and $1.7 million on capital projects and $19.2 million and $18.9 million, respectively, in operating expenses and governmental charges for the purpose of complying with such regulations. expenditures for these purposes will continue for the foreseeable future. in addition, we are party to a number of proceedings brought under the comprehensive environmental response, compensation and liability act or similar state statutes. it is expected that the impact of any judgments in or voluntary settlements of such proceedings will not be material to our financial condition, results of operations or liquidity.
contractual obligations at december 31, 2014, we had contractual payment obligations due within the time periods as specified in the following table:

the table above does not include $23.1 million of the total unrecognized tax benefits for uncertain tax positions and approximately $2.2 million of associated accrued interest, of which $1.2 million is expected to be paid in the next 12 months. due to the high degree of uncertainty regarding the timing of potential cash flows, the company is unable to make a reasonable estimate of the amount and period in which the remaining liabilities might be paid.
critical accounting policies and use of estimates our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements. as disclosed in note 1, the preparation of financial statements in conformity with u.s. generally accepted accounting principles ("gaap") requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts and accompanying disclosures. these estimates are based on management's best judgment of current events and actions that we may undertake in the future. actual results may ultimately differ from estimates.
those areas requiring the greatest degree of management judgment or deemed most critical to our financial reporting involve:
the periodic assessment of potential impairment of intangible assets acquired in business combinations. we currently have net intangible assets, including goodwill, of $752.0 million. in assessing the potential for impairment of goodwill, management uses the most current actual and forecasted operating data available and current market based assumptions in accordance with the criteria in asc 350. in 2012, the company re-evaluated its reporting unit structure and identified three reporting units: (1) flavors, (2) fragrance compounds and (3) fragrance ingredients. prior to 2012, the company had identified two reporting units, flavors and fragrances. as a result, in 2012 the company reallocated the goodwill previously allocated to its fragrances reporting unit to its fragrance compounds and fragrance ingredients reporting units.
the company performed the annual goodwill impairment test, utilizing the two-step approach for the flavors, fragrance compounds and fragrance ingredients reporting units, by assessing the fair value of our reporting units based on discounted cash flows. we completed our annual goodwill impairment test as of november 30, 2014, which indicated no impairment of goodwill, as the estimated fair values substantially exceeded the carrying values of each of these reporting units.
the analysis and evaluation of income taxes. we account for taxes under the asset and liability method. under this method, deferred income taxes are recognized for temporary differences between the financial statement and tax return bases of assets and liabilities. a valuation allowance is recognized if, based on the weight of available evidence, it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. the assessment of the need for a valuation allowance requires management to make estimates and assumptions about future earnings, reversal of existing temporary differences and available tax planning strategies. if actual experience differs from these estimates and assumptions, the recorded deferred tax asset may not be fully realized resulting in an increase to income tax expense in our results of operations.
the company has not established deferred tax liabilities for undistributed foreign earnings as it has plans to and intends to indefinitely reinvest those earnings to finance foreign activities. the unrecognized deferred tax liability on these undistributed earnings approximates $219 million.
we are subject to income taxes in the u.s. and numerous foreign jurisdictions. significant judgment is required in evaluating our uncertain tax positions and determining our provision for income taxes. we first determine whether it is "more likely than not" that we would sustain our tax position if the relevant tax authority were to audit the position with full knowledge of all the relevant facts and other information. for those tax positions that meet this threshold, we measure the amount of tax benefit based on the largest amount of tax benefit that we have a greater than 50% chance of realizing in a final settlement with the relevant authority. those tax positions failing to qualify for initial recognition are recognized in the first interim period in which they meet the more likely than not standard. this evaluation is made at the time that we adopt a tax position and whenever there is new information and is based upon management's evaluation of the facts, circumstances and information available at the reporting date. we maintain a cumulative risk portfolio relating to all of our uncertainties in income taxes in order to perform this analysis, but the evaluation of our tax positions requires significant judgment and estimation in part because, in certain cases, tax law is subject to varied interpretation, and whether a tax position will ultimately be sustained
41
may be uncertain. we do not currently believe that any of our pending tax assessments, even if ultimately resolved against us, would have a material impact on our results of operations and cash flows.
the evaluation of potential litigation and environmental liabilities, where changing circumstances, rules and regulations require regular reassessment of related practices and anticipated costs. we are subject to certain legal claims regarding products and other matters, as well as environmental-related matters. significant management judgment is involved in determining when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the extent to which it can be reasonably estimated.
we regularly assess potential liabilities with respect to all legal claims based on the most recent available information, in consultation with outside counsel we have engaged on our behalf to handle the defense of such matters. to the extent a liability is considered to be probable and reasonably estimable, we recognize a corresponding liability; if the reasonably estimated liability is a range, we recognize that amount considered most likely, or in the absence of such a determination, the minimum reasonably estimated liability. to the extent such claims are covered by various insurance policies, we separately evaluate the right to recovery and estimate the related insurance claim receivable. management judgments involve determination as to whether a liability has been incurred, the reasonably estimated amount of that liability, and any potential insurance recovery.
we regularly evaluate potential environmental exposure in terms of total estimated cost and the viability of other potentially responsible parties ("prp's") associated with our exposure. recorded liabilities are adjusted periodically as remediation efforts progress and additional information becomes available. critical management assumptions relate to expected total costs to remediate and the financial viability of prp's to share such costs.
determination of the various assumptions employed in the valuation of pension and retiree health care expense and associated obligations. amounts recognized in the consolidated financial statements related to pension and other postretirement benefits are determined from actuarial valuations. inherent in such valuations are assumptions including expected return on plan assets, discount rates at which the liabilities could be settled, rates of increase in future compensation levels, mortality rates and health care cost trend rates. these assumptions are updated annually and are disclosed in note 13 to the consolidated financial statements. in accordance with gaap, actual results that differ from the assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods and, therefore, affect expense recognized and obligations recorded in future periods.
we consider a number of factors in determining and selecting assumptions for the overall expected long-term rate of return on plan assets. we consider the historical long-term return experience of our assets, the current and expected allocation of our plan assets, and expected long-term rates of return. we derive these expected long-term rates of return with the assistance of our investment advisors. we base our expected allocation of plan assets on a diversified portfolio consisting of domestic and international equity securities, fixed income, real estate, and alternative asset classes.
we consider a variety of factors in determining and selecting our assumptions for the discount rate at december 31. for the u.s. plans, the discount rate was based on the internal rate of return for a portfolio of moody's aaa, aa and merrill lynch aaa-aa high quality bonds with maturities that are consistent with the projected future benefit payment obligations of the plan. the rate of compensation increase for all plans and the medical cost trend rate for the applicable u.s. plans are based on plan experience.
with respect to the u.s. plans, the expected rate of return on plan assets was determined based on an asset allocation model using the current target allocation, real rates of return by asset class and an anticipated inflation rate. the target asset allocation consists of approximately: 40% in equity securities and 60% in fixed income securities. the plan has achieved a compounded annual rate of return of 8.0% over the previous 20 years. at december 31, 2014, the actual asset allocation was: 40% in equity securities; 59% in fixed income securities; and 1% in cash equivalents.
the expected rate of return for the non-u.s. plans employs a similar set of criteria adapted for local investments, inflation rates and in certain cases specific government requirements. the target asset allocation, for the non-u.s. plans, consists of approximately: 40% - 60% in fixed income securities; 20% - 40% in equity securities; 5% - 20% in real estate; and 5% - 10% in alternative investments. at december 31, 2014, the actual asset allocation was: 62% in fixed income investments; 26% in equity investments; 7% in real estate investments; 4% in alternative investments and 1% in cash and cash equivalents.
changes in pension and other post-employment benefits, and associated expenses, may occur in the future due to changes in these assumptions. the impact that a 0.25% decrease in the discount rate or a 1% change in the medical cost trend rate would have on our pension and other post-employment benefit expense, as applicable, is as follows:

the ongoing assessment of the valuation of inventory, given the large number of natural ingredients employed, the quality of which may be diminished over time. we hold a majority of our inventory as raw materials, providing the greatest degree of flexibility in manufacture and use. as of december 31, 2014, we maintained 48% of our inventory as raw materials. materials are evaluated based on shelf life, known uses and anticipated demand based on forecasted customer order activity and changes in product/sales mix. management policy provides for an ongoing assessment of inventory with adjustments recorded when an item is deemed to be slow moving or obsolete.
we believe that we have considered relevant circumstances that we may be currently subject to, and the financial statements accurately reflect our best estimate of the impact of these items in our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows for the years presented. we have discussed the decision process and selection of these critical accounting policies with the audit committee of the board of directors.
new accounting standards in march 2013, the financial accounting standards board ("fasb") issued authoritative guidance clarifying the accounting for the release of cumulative translation adjustments into net income when a parent either sells a part or all of its investment in a foreign entity or no longer holds a controlling financial interest in a subsidiary or group of assets that is a nonprofit activity or a business within a foreign entity. the guidance was effective prospectively for reporting periods beginning after december 15, 2013. the adoption of this statement did not have an impact on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
in july 2013, the fasb issued authoritative guidance related to the financial statement presentation of unrecognized tax benefits. this update clarifies that an unrecognized tax benefit, or a portion of an unrecognized tax benefit, should be presented in the financial statements as a reduction to a deferred tax asset for a net operating loss carryforward, a similar tax loss, or a tax credit carryforward, except to the extent a net operating loss carryforward, a similar tax loss, or a tax credit carryforward is not available at the reporting date under the tax law of the applicable jurisdiction to settle any additional income taxes that would result from the disallowance of a tax position or the tax law of the applicable jurisdiction does not require the entity to use, and the entity does not intend to use, the deferred tax asset for such purpose. in such situations, the unrecognized tax benefit should be presented in the financial statements as a liability and should not be combined with deferred tax assets. the guidance was effective prospectively for reporting periods beginning after december 15, 2013. the adoption of this statement did not have a significant impact on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
in may 2014, the fasb issued authoritative guidance to clarify the principles to be used to recognize revenue. the guidance is applicable to all entities and is effective for annual and interim periods beginning after december 15, 2016. early adoption is not permitted. the company is currently evaluating the impact that this new standard will have on its consolidated financial statements.
non-gaap financial measures the company uses non-gaap financial operating measures in this annual report, including: (i) local currency sales (which eliminates the effects that result from translating its international sales in u.s. dollars), (ii) like-for-like sales (which eliminated the effects of local currency and the strategic decision to exit certain low margin sales in 2013), (iii) adjusted operating profit and operating profit margin (which excludes the operational improvement initiative and restructuring charges), (iv) adjusted effective tax rate (which excludes the sale of a non-operating assets, tax and litigation settlements, restructuring charges and operational improvement initiative costs) and (v) adjusted cash flows from operations (which excludes the spanish tax payments made and the year-over-year incremental pension contribution). the company also provides the non-gaap measures adjusted ebitda (which excludes certain specified items and non-cash items as set forth in the company's debt
43
agreements) and net debt (which is adjusted for deferred gain on interest rate swaps and cash and cash equivalents) solely for the purpose of providing information regarding the company's compliance with debt covenants contained in its debt agreements.
we have included each of these non-gaap measures in order to provide additional information regarding our underlying operating results and comparable year-over-year performance. such information is supplemental to information presented in accordance with gaap and is not intended to represent a presentation in accordance with gaap. in discussing our historical and expected future results and financial condition, we believe it is meaningful for investors to be made aware of and to be assisted in a better understanding of, on a period-to-period comparable basis, financial amounts both including and excluding these identified items, as well as the impact of exchange rate fluctuations and the exit of certain low margin sales activities on operating results and financial condition. we believe such additional non-gaap information provides investors with an overall perspective of the period-to-period performance of our business. in addition, management internally reviews each of these non-gaap measures to evaluate performance on a comparative period-to-period basis in terms of absolute performance, trends and expected future performance with respect to our business. a material limitation of these non-gaap measures is that such measures do not reflect actual gaap amounts; for example, costs associated with operational improvements and restructuring activities involve actual cash outlays. we compensate for such limitations by using these measures as one of several metrics, including gaap measures. these non-gaap measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies.

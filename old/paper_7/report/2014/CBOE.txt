overview cboe holdings, inc. is the holding company for chicago board options exchange, incorporated, cboe futures exchange, llc, c2 options exchange, incorporated and other subsidiaries.
the company's principal business is operating markets that offer for trading options on various market indexes (index options), mostly on an exclusive basis, and futures contracts, as well as on non-exclusive "multiply-listed" options, such as options on the stocks of individual corporations (equity options) and options on other exchange-traded products (etp options), such as exchange-traded funds (etf options) and exchange-traded notes (etn options). the company operates three stand-alone exchanges, but reports the results of its operations in one reporting segment.
cboe is our primary options market and offers trading in listed options through a single system that integrates electronic trading and traditional open outcry trading on our trading floor in chicago. this integration of electronic trading and traditional open outcry trading into a single exchange is known as our hybrid trading model. cfe, our all-electronic futures exchange, offers trading of futures on the vix index and other products. c2 is our all-electronic exchange that also offers trading for listed options, and may operate with a different market model and fee structure than cboe. all of our exchanges operate on our proprietary technology platform known as cboe command.
business trends
•   transaction fees accounted for 70.9%, 69.4% and 69.7% of total operating revenues for the year ended december 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively.
•   index options and futures contracts accounted for 81.8%, 78.8% and 67.7% of our transaction fees for the year ended december 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively.
•   our share of total exchange-traded options contracts for the year ended december 31, 2014 was 29.9% up from 27.9% and 27.8% in 2013 and 2012, respectively.
•   operating expenses were 49.2%, 50.0% and 52.3%, of total operating revenues for the years ended december 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively.
•   employee costs, representing our largest expense category, were 19.7%, 20.6% and 20.3%, of total operating revenues for the years ended december 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively.
•   in december 2014, we entered into an agreement with the financial industry regulatory authority ("finra") to provide a majority of regulatory services to the cboe and c2 options markets. we do not expect revenue generated from regulatory fees to be materially impacted by the agreement with finra. as a result of this agreement, we will experience a shift in expenses from employee costs to outside services.
business strategy we believe that the derivatives industry, especially the listed options and futures industry, has significant growth potential, including through new participants and products. we expect to further expand our business and increase our revenues and profitability by pursuing the following growth strategies:
•   we intend to continue developing innovative proprietary products that meet the needs of the derivatives industry, both through strategic relationships and internal development.
•   we intend to continue our efforts to expand the use of our products internationally. at the core of that effort is extending trading hours in our exclusive options and futures products.
•   we have designed our fee schedule to provide economic benefits to market participants that concentrate their overall trading activity at our exchanges.
33
•   we intend to continue to enhance our trading platform by continuing to invest in hardening and augmenting the functionality and capacity of our trading systems.
•   we seek to attract participants from the over-the-counter market, through customizing options products and through offering products similar to those traded over-the-counter.
•   we evaluate strategic opportunities that we believe will enhance stockholder value.
components of operating revenues transaction fees the primary and largest source of operating revenues is transaction fees. transaction fees are a function of many variables with the main three being: (1) exchange fee rates; (2) trading volume mix (products traded); and (3) transaction mix between order type. because transaction fees are assessed on a per contract basis, transaction fee revenue is highly correlated to the volume of contracts traded on the company's exchanges. while exchange fee rates are established by the company, trading volume and transaction mix are influenced by a number of factors, including price competition, price volatility in the underlying securities and national and international economic and political conditions.
revenue is recorded as transactions occur on a trade-date basis. the main products we trade are equity, index and etp options and futures contracts.
•   equity options reflect trading in options contracts on the stocks of individual companies.
•   index options reflect trading in index options contracts on market indexes.
•   etp options include etf options that are options on baskets of stocks designed to generally track an index, but which trade like individual stocks, and etn options that are options on senior, unsecured, unsubordinated debt securities issued by an underwriting bank.
•   futures contracts are standardized, transferable, exchange-traded contracts that require delivery of a commodity, bond, currency, stock index or other benchmark interests at a specified price and on a specified future date, which are settled in cash.
the company believes that the number of investors that use options represents a growing proportion of the total investing public and that the increasing use of options represents a long-term trend that will continue in the future. furthermore, we believe significant opportunities exist to expand the use of options by both institutional and professional investors and for the migration of activity from the over-the-counter market to exchanges.
while there is no certainty, we expect that the industry-wide and company-specific factors that contributed to past volume changes will continue to contribute to future volume changes. however, additional factors may arise that could also impact trading volume which may result in increases or decreases in our trading volume, such as new or existing competition, or other events. considering these factors, we do not expect past trading volumes to be an indicator of future trading volume.
access fees access fees represent fees assessed to trading permit holders for the opportunity to trade, including fees for trading-related functionality, on cboe, c2 and cfe. the cboe program contains a tier-based market-maker appointment system with different trading permits based on trading function and, in the case of market-makers, the assessment of a surcharge for certain cboe proprietary products. beginning in mid-2013, cboe implemented sliding scales for all market-maker and floor broker trading permits held by affiliated trading permit holders and tph organizations that are used in any options classes other than certain proprietary indexes. the number of trading permits made available is limited.
exchange services and other fees to facilitate trading, the company offers technology services, terminal and other equipment rentals, maintenance services, trading floor space and telecommunications services. trading floor and equipment rentals are generally on a month-to-month basis. facilities, systems services and other fees are generally monthly fee-based, although certain services are influenced by trading volume or other defined metrics, while others are based solely on demand.
34
market data fees market data fees represent income derived from the sale of our transaction information through the options price reporting authority ("opra") and primarily through our subsidiary, market data express, llc ("mdx"). through mdx, we sell historical options data, as well as real-time data for certain proprietary products and indexes. it also provides market data through cboe streaming markets, a high-availability, low latency streaming data feed. opra is a limited liability company consisting of representatives of the member exchanges, including cboe and c2, authorized by the sec to provide consolidated options information. opra gathers market data from various options exchanges, including cboe and c2, and, in turn, disseminates this data to third parties who pay fees to opra to access the data. revenue generated by opra from the dissemination of market data is shared among opra members according to the number of total cleared options transactions by each of the member exchanges as calculated each quarter. opra is not consolidated with the company.
regulatory fees regulatory fees are charged to trading permit holders in support of our regulatory responsibilities as self-regulatory organizations under the exchange act. regulatory fees include an options regulatory fee under which fees are based on industry-wide customer volume of trading permit holders and designated examining authority fees for certain trading permit holders. this source of revenue could decline in the future if the number of customer contracts executed by trading permit holders declines and rates are not increased or are decreased or if our costs to perform our regulatory responsibilities stabilize or decrease.
the sec requires that the revenues derived from certain of the fees from our regulatory functions, some of which are included in this revenue category, and regulatory fines must be used for regulatory purposes. expenses related to our regulatory functions are included in our operating expenses, mainly in employee costs and outside services.
in december 2014, we entered into an agreement with the financial industry regulatory authority ("finra") to provide certain regulatory services to the cboe and c2 options markets. additionally, cboe entered into a separate agreement with finra, under which it assigned to finra the responsibility to perform regulatory services for the options regulatory surveillance authority ("orsa"). finra began performing the services on january 1, 2015.
other revenue the following sub-categories are the sources of revenue within this category:
•   revenue generated through various licensing agreements;
•   revenue generated through regulatory service agreements with other options exchanges (in 2015, we will no longer generate revenue from these regulatory service agreements);
•   revenue derived from fines assessed for rule violations;
•   revenue generated through our order routing cancel fee and position transfer fee;
•   revenue associated with advertisements through our corporate web site, www.cboe.com;
•   revenue generated from courses and seminars offered through cboe's options institute;
•   rental of commercial space in the lobby of our building; and
•   other sources of revenue.
components of operating expenses most of our expenses do not vary directly with changes in our trading volume except royalty fees and trading volume incentives.
employee costs employee costs are our most significant expense and include salaries and benefits, stock-based compensation, incentive compensation, severance and employer taxes. salaries and benefits represent our largest expense category and tend to be driven by both our staffing requirements and the general dynamics of the employment market. stock-based compensation is a non-cash expense related to equity awards. stock-based compensation can vary depending on the quantity and fair value of the award on the date of grant and the related service period.
depreciation and amortization
35
depreciation and amortization expense results from the depreciation of long-lived assets purchased and the amortization of purchased and internally developed software.
data processing data processing expense consists primarily of costs related to the maintenance of computer equipment supporting our system architecture, circuits supporting our wide area network, support for production software, fees paid to information vendors for displaying data and off-site system hosting fees.
outside services outside services consist primarily of consulting services, which include: the supplementation of staff for activities primarily related to systems development and maintenance and legal, regulatory and audit and tax advisory services.
royalty fees royalty fees primarily consist of license fees paid for the use of underlying indexes in our proprietary products usually based on contracts traded. the company has licenses with the owners of the s&p 500 index, s&p 100 index and certain other s&p indexes, the djia, the nasdaq 100 and the russell indexes. this category also includes fees paid to market participants for order flow that they direct or cause to be directed to our exchanges and fees related to the dissemination of market data related to s&p indexes.
trading volume incentives trading volume incentives consist of market linkage expenses incurred to send certain orders to other exchanges. if a competing exchange quotes a better price, we route the customer's order to that exchange and pay certain of the associated costs. regardless of whether the transaction is traded at our options exchanges, the order flow potential enhances our overall market position and participation and provides cost savings to customers.
travel and promotional expenses travel and promotional expenses primarily consist of advertising, costs for special events, sponsorship of industry conferences, options education seminars and travel related expenses.
facilities costs facilities costs primarily consist of expenses related to owned and leased properties including rent, maintenance, utilities, real estate taxes and telecommunications costs.
other expenses other expenses represent costs necessary to support our operations but are not included in the above categories.
other income/(expense)
income and expenses incurred through activities outside of our core operations are considered non-operating and are classified as other income/(expense). these activities primarily include interest earned on the investing of excess cash and investments in other business ventures.
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of the company's consolidated financial statements requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. on an ongoing basis, the company evaluates its estimates, including those related to areas that require a significant level of judgment or are otherwise subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty. the company bases its estimates on historical experience, observance of trends in particular areas, information available from outside sources and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. information from these sources form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that may not be readily apparent from other sources. actual amounts may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.
we have identified the policies below as critical to our business operations and the understanding of our results of operations. the impact of, and any associated risks related to, these policies on our business operations is discussed throughout "management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations." for a detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies, see note 1 to our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10-k.

revenue recognition
•   transaction fees revenue is considered earned upon the execution of the trade recognized on a trade-date basis and presented net of applicable volume discounts. in the event liquidity providers prepay transaction fees, revenue is recognized based on the attainment of volume thresholds resulting in the amortization of the prepayment over the calendar year.
•   access fee revenue is recognized during the period access is granted and assurance of collectability is provided.
•   exchange services and other fees revenue is recognized during the period the service is provided.
•   market data fees from opra are allocated based upon the share of total options transactions cleared for each of the opra members and is received quarterly. revenue from our market data services is recognized in the period the data is provided.
•   regulatory fees are recognized primarily on a trade-date basis.
income taxes deferred income taxes arise from temporary differences between the tax basis and book basis of assets and liabilities. the company accounts for income taxes under the asset and liability method, which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of the events that have been included in the consolidated financial statements. under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the differences between the book and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to be reversed. the effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in the period that includes the enactment date. the company files tax returns for federal, state and local income tax purposes. a valuation allowance is recognized if it is anticipated that some or all of a deferred tax asset may not be realized.
if the company considers that a tax position is "more-likely-than-not" to be sustained upon audit, based solely on the technical merits of the position, it recognizes the tax benefit. the company measures the tax benefit by determining the largest amount that is greater than 50% likely of being realized upon settlement, presuming that the tax position is examined by the appropriate taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information. these assessments can be complex and require specific analysis to determine the impact of the position, as such the company often obtains assistance from external advisors. the company considers the information and arrives at the percentage to apply as a possible uncertain portion related to the position. to the extent that the company's estimates change or the final tax outcome of these matters is different than the amounts recorded, such differences will impact the income tax provision in the period in which such determinations are made. uncertain tax positions are classified as current only when the company expects to pay cash within the next twelve months. interest and penalties, if any, are recorded within the provision for income taxes in the company's consolidated statements of income and are classified on the consolidated balance sheets with the related liability for unrecognized tax benefits.
recent accounting pronouncements in april 2014, the fasb issued asu 2014-08, reporting discontinued operations and disclosures of disposals of components of an entity, an amendment to fasb asc topic 205, presentation of financial statements and fasb asc topic 360, property, plant and equipment. the update revises the definition of discontinued operations by limiting discontinued operations reporting to disposals of components of an entity that represent strategic shifts that have (or will have) a major effect on an entity's operations and financial results, removing the lack of continuing involvement criteria and requiring discontinued operations reporting for the disposal of an equity method investment that meets the definition of discontinued operations. the update also requires expanded disclosures for discontinued operations, including disclosure of pretax profit or loss of an individually significant component of an entity that does not qualify for discontinued operations reporting. this asu is effective prospectively for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after december 15, 2014. the company has elected early adoption of the guidance and does not believe it will impact our consolidated balance sheets, statements of income, comprehensive income or cash flows.
in may 2014, the fasb issued asu 2014-09, revenue from contracts with customers. this standard outlines a single comprehensive model for entities to use in accounting for revenue arising from contracts with customers and supersedes most current revenue recognition guidance, including industry-specific guidance. in addition, it provides guidance on accounting for certain revenue-related costs including when to capitalize costs associated with obtaining and fulfilling a contract. the guidance provides companies with two implementation methods. companies can choose to apply the standard retrospectively to each prior reporting period presented (full retrospective application) or retrospectively with the cumulative effect of initially applying the standard as an adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings of the annual reporting period that includes the date of initial application (modified retrospective application). this guidance is effective for annual reporting periods
37
beginning after december 15, 2016, including interim periods within that reporting period. early application is not permitted. the company is in the process of evaluating this guidance, though we do not expect it will materially impact our consolidated balance sheets, statements of income, comprehensive income or cash flows.

•   the increase in total operating revenues was primarily driven by higher transaction fees and market data fees. the increase in transaction fees was primarily driven by an 11.6% increase in total volume in 2014. we experienced volume growth across all product categories. as reported by the occ, total industry cleared options contract volume was 4.3 billion contracts in 2014, a 4% increase from 2013.
•   the increase in total operating expenses was primarily driven by higher employee costs, depreciation and amortization, data processing and royalty fees, partially offset by lower outside services. employee costs reflect accelerated stock-based compensation expense and severance expense related to the transition of regulatory services to finra. the increase in royalty fees primarily resulted from higher volume in licensed and proprietary products.
•   the increase in total other expense was primarily driven by an impairment charge of $3.0 million related to our investment in ipxi holdings, llc ("ipxi"), partially offset by a reduction in equity losses in other investments.

transaction fees transaction fees increased 10.2% to $437.8 million for the year ended december 31, 2014, representing 70.9% of total operating revenues, compared with $397.2 million for the prior year period, or 69.4% of total operating revenues. this increase was largely driven by an 11.6% increase in trading volume, partially offset by a 1.2% decrease in the average revenue per contract. the increase in trading volume was across all product categories and the decrease in average revenue per contract primarily resulted from a shift in volume mix and an increase in volume based incentives. we believe volume across our product segments increased year over year due to market volatility, increased use of our proprietary products most directly tied to volatility and success in capturing market share. trading volume is impacted by many factors, including: macroeconomic events, market volatility, regulatory actions or considerations, availability of capital, competition, pricing and number of trading days in the period.
average revenue per contract, discussed in more detail below, is impacted by our fee structure, which includes volume based incentive programs, mix of products traded, the account type (customer, firm, market-maker, etc.) and the manner in which a trade is executed (electronic, open-outcry, etc.). the implementation of fee changes, which may increase or decrease our average revenue per contract, is primarily to ensure that we are competitive in the options marketplace and to ultimately improve and continue to drive order flow to our exchanges. we cannot predict the trading patterns of market participants, which may be based on factors outside our control, but we can attempt to price our products at levels that are competitive in our market.

factors contributing to the change in total average revenue per contract for the year ended december 31, 2014 compared to the same period in 2013 included:
•   product mix-we experienced a shift in overall product mix. as a percentage of total volume, equities increased to 36.9% from 36.5%, indexes decreased to 30.7% from 31.4% and futures increased to 3.8% from 3.4%. equities represent our lowest average revenue per contract, while index options and futures generate our highest options average revenue per contract and our highest total average revenue per contract, respectively.
40
•   rate structure- our rate structure includes sliding scales, volume discounts, volume incentive programs and caps on fees as part of our effort to increase liquidity and market share in multiply-listed options. average revenue per contract on multiply-listed options (equities and exchange-traded products) decreased 19.1% and 12.5%, respectively. these decreases resulted primarily from increases in volume-based incentives for these products. average revenue per contract on futures increased 3.4%. the increase was primarily due to fee changes implemented in 2014.
access fees access fees for the year ended december 31, 2014 decreased to $59.3 million from $61.0 million in the comparable prior year period. the decrease in access fees was primarily due to incentive programs for market-maker trading permits and floor brokers implemented in may 2013 and a reduction in the number of trading permits.
the demand for trading permits could be impacted by market fluctuations that affect trading volume.
exchange services and other fees exchange services and other fees for the year ended december 31, 2014 increased 2.1% to $38.0 million from $37.3 million in the comparable period in the prior year. the increase was primarily due to increased demand for technology services, terminal and other equipment rentals and certain services impacted by trading volume.
market data fees market data fees increased 22.2% to $30.4 million for the year ended december 31, 2014 from $24.9 million in the prior year. market data fees represent income derived from opra as well as the company's market data services, which for the year ended december 31, 2014 were $15.0 million and $15.4 million, respectively, and for the same period in 2013, were $12.9 million and $12.0 million, respectively. income derived from opra is allocated based on each exchange's share of total cleared options transactions. the company's share of opra income for the period ended december 31, 2014 increased to 24.9% from 21.7% for the same period in 2013 as a result of an increase in the company's share of total cleared options transactions. revenue generated from the company's market data services, which provide current and historical options and futures data, increased $3.4 million, resulting primarily from an increase in subscribers and rates for certain market data services.
regulatory fees regulatory fees increased 1.2% for the year ended 2014 to $37.1 million from $36.7 million in the same period in the prior year. regulatory fees are primarily generated by the options regulatory fee that we charge on all trading permit holder customer volume industry-wide which increased compared to the prior period. the higher revenue attributed to volume was partially offset by cboe and c2 lowering their respective options regulatory fee rates as of august 1, 2014, and a decrease in regulatory fees received for other regulatory services, primarily related to cboe stock exchange, llc ("cbsx"), which ceased trading operations on april 30, 2014.
under the rules of each of our options exchanges, as required by the sec, any revenue derived from regulatory fees and fines cannot be used for non-regulatory purposes.
in december 2014, we entered into an agreement with the financial industry regulatory authority ("finra") to provide a majority of the regulatory services to the cboe and c2 options markets. the company does not expect revenue generated from regulatory fees to be materially impacted by the agreement with finra.
concentration of revenue all contracts traded on our exchanges must be cleared through clearing members of the occ. at december 31, 2014, there were one hundred seven trading permit holders that are clearing members of the occ. two clearing members accounted for 46% of transaction and other fees collected through the occ in 2014. the next largest clearing member accounted for approximately 11% of transaction and other fees collected through the occ. no one trading permit holder using the clearing services of the top two clearing member firms represented more than 42% of transaction and other fees collected through the occ, for the respective clearing member, in 2014. should a clearing member withdraw from cboe, we believe the trading permit holder portion of that clearing member's trading activity would likely transfer to another clearing member.
the two largest clearing members mentioned above clear the majority of the market-maker sides of transactions at cboe, c2 and at all of the u.s. options exchanges. if either of these clearing members were to withdraw from the business of market-maker clearing and market-makers were unable to transfer to another clearing member, this could create significant disruption to the u.s. options markets, including ours.

operating expenses total operating expenses increased $17.2 million, or 6.0%, to $303.4 million for the year ended 2014 from $286.2 million in the year ago period, resulting from higher employee costs, depreciation and amortization, data processing and royalty fees, partially offset by lower outside services. expenses decreased to 49.2% of total operating revenues in the year ended 2014 compared with 50.0% in the same period in 2013.
the following summarizes changes in operating expenses for the year ended december 31, 2014 compared to 2013.

employee costs for the year ended december 31, 2014, employee costs were $121.7 million, or 19.7% of total operating revenues, compared with $118.1 million, or 20.6% of total operating revenues, in the same period in 2013. this represented an increase of $3.6 million, or 3.1%, resulting from higher salaries of $3.6 million, driven primarily by annual pay adjustments, higher payroll taxes of $0.5 million and higher health insurance costs of $0.4 million, higher severance expense of $2.4 million, primarily due to transition of a majority of regulatory services to finra, and higher annual incentive compensation of $2.0 million, which is aligned with performance targets, partially offset by lower stock-based compensation expense of $5.2 million.
in december 2014, we entered into an agreement with finra to provide certain regulatory services to the cboe and c2 options markets. as part of the agreement, a significant number of our regulatory staff, as well as certain systems staff supporting our regulatory functions, transitioned to finra resulting in a headcount reduction of over 100 employees. as a result of the reduction in headcount, we expect employees costs to be lower in 2015.
depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization increased by $5.4 million to $39.9 million for the year ended december 31, 2014 compared with $34.5 million for the same period in 2013. the increase in depreciation and amortization primarily resulted from increased capital spending to harden and enhance our trading platform and operations.
data processing data processing expenses increased $1.3 million to $19.2 million for the year ended december 31, 2014 compared with $17.9 million in the prior-year period. the increase in data processing expenses is primarily due to higher costs for hardware and software maintenance.
outside services expenses related to outside services decreased to $32.0 million for the year ended december 31, 2014 from $34.5 million in the prior-year period. the $2.5 million decrease is primarily due to lower costs related to litigation, partially offset by higher costs for contract programmers. the company received an insurance reimbursement for legal expenses of $1.5 million in 2013.
in december 2014, we entered into an agreement with finra to provide certain regulatory services to the cboe and c2 options markets. as noted above, certain staff transitioned from cboe to finra. as a result of the transition, costs for former employees in regulatory and systems staff supporting our regulatory functions, will be included in outside services in 2015. as a result, we expect outside services to be in higher in 2015. we do not expect this change to result in a material increase in total operating expenses in 2015.
42
royalty fees royalty fees for the year ended december 31, 2014 were $66.1 million compared with $56.6 million for the prior year period, an increase of $9.5 million. the increase is primarily due to higher trading volume in licensed and proprietary products and an increase in royalty rates as a result of the amendment the company executed with s&p opco llc ("s&p"), effective as of march 2013, relating to the company's license to trade options and futures and create products based on certain s&p indexes and higher fees associated with dissemination of certain market data.
operating income as a result of the items above, operating income in 2014 was $313.8 million compared to $285.9 million in 2013, an increase of $27.9 million.
other expense net loss from investment in affiliates net loss from investment in affiliates was $4.2 million for the year ended december 31, 2014 compared with $2.2 million for the same period in the prior year. the loss in 2014 and 2013 primarily included the company's share of the operating loss of signal trading systems, llc and, in 2014, the impairment of our investment in ipxi which totaled $3.0 million. see note 3 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on the company's investment in signal trading systems, llc and ipxi.
income before income taxes as a result of the items above, income before income taxes in 2014 was $309.7 million compared to $283.7 million in 2013, an increase of $26.0 million.
income tax provision for the year ended december 31, 2014, the income tax provision was $120.0 million compared with $107.7 million for the same period in 2013. this increase is primarily a result of higher taxable income and a higher effective tax rate. the effective tax rate was 38.7% and 38.0% for the year ended december 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively.
net income as a result of the items above, net income allocated to common stockholders in 2014 was $188.4 million compared to $173.9 million in 2013, an increase of $14.5 million. basic and diluted net income per share allocated to common stockholders were $2.21 and $1.99 for the years ended december 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively.

there were a number of factors that contributed to the increase in our average revenue per contract in 2013 compared to 2012. these include:
•   product mix-the increase in the average revenue per contract reflected a shift in the volume mix by product. index options and futures contracts accounted for 31.4% and 3.4% of total trading volume in 2013, up from 26.8% and 2.1% in 2012, respectively. index options generated total average revenue per contract of $0.670 representing the highest options average revenue per contract, while futures contracts generated our highest total average revenue per contract of $1.570.
•   spx options, vix options and vix futures- for the year ended december 31, 2013 as compared to the prior year period, the total trading volume in spx options, vix options and vix futures increased by 18.9%, 29.1% and 67.9%, respectively.
access fees access fees for the year ended december 31, 2013 decreased to $61.0 million from $64.1 million in the comparable prior year period. the decrease in access fees was primarily due to the implementation of an incentive programs for market-maker trading permits and floor brokers implemented in may 2013, which lowered monthly access fees.
exchange services and other fees exchange services and other fees for the year ended december 31, 2013 increased 18.8% to $37.3 million from $31.4 million in the comparable period in the prior year, resulting from the introduction of a network access option offered in connection with the company's data center move to new jersey in december 2012.
market data fees market data fees increased 2.3% to $24.9 million for the year ended december 31, 2013 from $24.3 million in the same period in the prior year. opra and company market data fees for 2013 and 2012 were $12.9 million and $12.0 million and $15.0 million and $9.3 million, respectively. the company's share of opra income for the period ended december 31, 2013 decreased to 21.7% from 24.4% for the same period in 2012 as a result of a decrease in the company's share of total cleared options transactions. revenue generated from the company's market data services increased $2.7 million, resulting primarily from an increase in subscribers to cboe streaming markets and other market data services and an increase in subscriber rates.
regulatory fees regulatory fees increased 74.5% for the year ended 2013 to $36.7 million from $21.0 million in the same period in the prior year, resulting from cboe and c2 increasing their options regulatory fee rates and higher trading permit holder customer volume industry-wide as compared to the same period in 2012. in september 2013, cboe decreased its options regulatory fee rate and c2 suspended its options regulatory fee rate.
operating expenses total operating expenses increased $18.0 million, or 6.7%, to $286.2 million for the year ended 2013 from $268.2 million in the year ago period, resulting from higher employee costs, depreciation and amortization and royalty fees, partially offset by lower data processing, outside services, trading volume incentives and other expense. expenses decreased to 50.0% of total operating revenues in the year ended 2013 compared with 52.3% in the same period in 2012.

the increase in stock-based compensation of $8.5 million resulted from the amortization of stock-compensation expense relating to the february 2013 and may 2013 grants and the recognition of $4.0 million of accelerated stock-based compensation related to the february 2013 grant to certain executives due to provisions contained in their employment arrangements and the recognition of the remaining value of stock grants awarded, in june 2010, to employees in the company's regulatory division who were no longer eligible to receive equity-based compensation.

royalty fees royalty fees expense for the year ended december 31, 2013 were $56.6 million compared with $46.1 million for the prior year period, an increase of $10.5 million. the increase is primarily due to higher trading volume in licensed index products and an increase in royalty rates as a result of the amendment the company executed with s&p to the existing s&p agreement.
trading volume incentives trading volume incentives decreased $2.0 million to $4.3 million for the year ended december 31, 2013 compared to $6.3 million for the prior year period. the decrease was primarily due to lower volume in multiply-listed options products, modifications in the criteria for contracts qualifying for certain quantity-based fee waivers and adjustments to the fees paid by the company for transactions linked to away exchanges.

md&a overview management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (md&a) is intended to inform the reader about matters affecting the financial condition and results of operations of aflac incorporated and its subsidiaries for the three-year period ended december 31, 2014. as a result, the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the related consolidated financial statements and notes. this md&a is divided into the following sections:
•   our business
•   performance highlights
•   critical accounting estimates
•   results of operations, consolidated and by segment
•   analysis of financial condition, including discussion of market risks of financial instruments
•   capital resources and liquidity, including discussion of availability of capital and the sources and uses of cash our business aflac incorporated (the parent company) and its subsidiaries (collectively, the company) primarily sell supplemental health and life insurance in the united states and japan. the company's insurance business is marketed and administered through american family life assurance company of columbus (aflac), which operates in the united states (aflac u.s.) and as a branch in japan (aflac japan). most of aflac's policies are individually underwritten and marketed through independent agents. aflac u.s. also markets and administers group products through continental american insurance company (caic), branded as aflac group insurance. our insurance operations in the united states and our branch in japan service the two markets for our insurance business.
performance highlights yen-denominated income statement accounts are translated to u.s. dollars using a weighted-average japanese yen/u.s. dollar foreign exchange rate, while yen-denominated balance sheet accounts are translated to u.s. dollars using a spot japanese yen/u.s. dollar foreign exchange rate. the spot yen/dollar exchange rate at december 31, 2014 was 120.55, or 12.6% weaker than the december 31, 2013 spot yen/dollar exchange rate of 105.39. the weighted-average yen/dollar exchange rate for the year ended december 31, 2014 was 105.46, or 7.5% weaker than the weighted-average yen/dollar exchange rate of 97.54 for the same period in 2013.
reflecting the weaker yen/dollar exchange rate, total revenues were down 5.1% to $22.7 billion in 2014, compared with $23.9 billion in 2013. net earnings in 2014 were $3.0 billion, or $6.50 per diluted share, compared with $3.2 billion, or $6.76 per diluted share, in 2013.
results for 2014 included pretax net realized investment gains of $215 million ($140 million after-tax), compared with net realized investment gains of $399 million ($259 million after-tax) in 2013. net investment gains in 2014 consisted of $31 million ($20 million after-tax) of other-than-temporary impairment losses; $215 million of net gains ($140 million after-tax) from the sale or redemption of securities; and $31 million of net gains ($20 million after-tax) from valuing derivatives. shareholders' equity included a net unrealized gain on investment securities and derivatives of $4.7 billion at december 31, 2014, compared with a net unrealized gain of $1.0 billion at december 31, 2013.
in november 2014, the parent company issued $750 million of senior notes through a u.s. public debt offering. we entered into cross-currency interest rate swaps to economically convert the dollar-denominated principal and interest on the senior notes we issued into yen-denominated obligations. in october 2014, the parent company and aflac entered into a 364-day uncommitted bilateral line of credit that provides for borrowings in the amount of $100 million. for further information regarding these transactions, see note 9 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements and the capital resources and liquidity section of this md&a.
we repurchased 19.7 million shares of our common stock in the open market for $1.2 billion under our share repurchase program in 2014, compared with 13.2 million shares repurchased in 2013.
35
critical accounting estimates we prepare our financial statements in accordance with u.s. generally accepted accounting principles (gaap). these principles are established primarily by the financial accounting standards board (fasb). in this md&a, references to gaap issued by the fasb are derived from the fasb accounting standards codificationtm (asc). the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires us to make estimates based on currently available information when recording transactions resulting from business operations. the estimates that we deem to be most critical to an understanding of aflac's results of operations and financial condition are those related to the valuation of investments and derivatives, deferred policy acquisition costs (dac), liabilities for future policy benefits and unpaid policy claims, and income taxes. the preparation and evaluation of these critical accounting estimates involve the use of various assumptions developed from management's analyses and judgments. the application of these critical accounting estimates determines the values at which 93% of our assets and 73% of our liabilities are reported as of december 31, 2014, and thus has a direct effect on net earnings and shareholders' equity. subsequent experience or use of other assumptions could produce significantly different results.
investments and derivatives aflac's investments in debt, perpetual and equity securities include both publicly issued and privately issued securities. for publicly issued securities, we determine the fair values from quoted market prices readily available from public exchange markets and price quotes and valuations from third party pricing vendors. for the majority of privately issued securities within our investment portfolio, a third party pricing vendor has developed valuation models to determine fair values. for the remaining privately issued securities, we use non-binding price quotes from outside brokers. we also routinely review our investments that have experienced declines in fair value to determine if the decline is other than temporary. the identification of distressed investments, the determination of fair value if not publicly traded and the assessment of whether a decline is other than temporary involve significant management judgment.
our team of experienced credit professionals must apply considerable judgment in determining the likelihood of the security recovering in value while we own it. factors that may influence this include our assessment of the issuer's ability to continue making timely payments of interest and principal, the overall level of interest rates and credit spreads, and other factors. this process requires consideration of risks which can be controlled to a certain extent, such as credit risk, and risks which cannot be controlled, such as interest rate risk. management updates its evaluations regularly and reflects impairment losses in the company's income statement as such evaluations are revised.
our derivative activities include foreign currency, interest rate and credit default swaps in variable interest entities (vies) that are consolidated; foreign currency swaps associated with certain senior notes and our subordinated debentures; foreign currency forwards and options used in hedging foreign exchange risk and options on interest rate swaps (or interest rate swaptions) used in hedging interest rate risk on u.s. dollar-denominated securities in aflac japan's portfolio; and foreign currency forwards and options used to hedge certain portions of forecasted cash flows denominated in yen. inputs used to value derivatives include, but are not limited to, interest rates, credit spreads, foreign currency forward and spot rates, and interest volatility. with the exception of the derivatives associated with our vie investments, the fair values of the derivatives referenced above are based on the amounts we would expect to receive or pay to terminate the derivatives. for derivatives associated with vies where we are the primary beneficiary, we receive valuations from a third party pricing vendor.
see notes 1, 3, 4 and 5 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.
deferred policy acquisition costs and policy liabilities aflac's products are generally long-duration fixed-benefit indemnity contracts. we make estimates of certain factors that affect the profitability of our business to match expected policy benefits and deferrable acquisition costs with expected policy premiums. these factors include persistency, morbidity, mortality, investment yields and expenses. if actual results match the assumptions used in establishing policy liabilities and the deferral and amortization of acquisition costs, profits are expected to emerge ratably over the life of the policy. however, because actual results will vary from the assumptions, profits as a percentage of earned premiums will vary from year to year.
we measure the adequacy of our policy reserves and recoverability of dac annually by performing gross premium valuations on our business. our testing indicates that our insurance liabilities are adequate and that our dac is recoverable.
36
deferred policy acquisition costs certain costs of acquiring new business are deferred and amortized over the policy's premium payment period in proportion to anticipated premium income. future amortization of dac is based upon our estimates of persistency, interest and future premium revenue generally established at the time of policy issuance. however, the unamortized balance of dac reflects actual persistency. see note 6 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for a detail of the dac activity for the past two years.
policy liabilities the following table provides details of policy liabilities by segment and in total as of december 31.

total consolidated policy liabilities     $83,933             $89,402
our policy liabilities, which are determined in accordance with applicable guidelines as defined under gaap and actuarial standards of practice, include two components that involve analysis and judgment: future policy benefits and unpaid policy claims, which accounted for 78% and 4% of total policy liabilities as of december 31, 2014, respectively.
future policy benefits provide for claims that will occur in the future and are generally calculated as the present value of future expected benefits to be incurred less the present value of future expected net benefit premiums. we calculate future policy benefits based on assumptions of morbidity, mortality, persistency and interest. these assumptions are generally established at the time a policy is issued. the assumptions used in the calculations are closely related to those used in developing the gross premiums for a policy. as required by gaap, we also include a provision for adverse deviation, which is intended to accommodate adverse fluctuations in actual experience.
unpaid policy claims include those claims that have been incurred and are in the process of payment as well as an estimate of those claims that have been incurred but have not yet been reported to us. we compute unpaid policy claims on a non-discounted basis using statistical analyses of historical claims payments, adjusted for current trends and changed conditions. we update the assumptions underlying the estimate of unpaid policy claims regularly and incorporate our historical experience as well as other data that provides information regarding our outstanding liability.
our insurance products provide fixed-benefit amounts per occurrence that are not subject to medical-cost inflation. furthermore, our business is widely dispersed in both the united states and japan. this geographic dispersion and the nature of our benefit structure mitigate the risk of a significant unexpected increase in claims payments due to epidemics and events of a catastrophic nature. claims incurred under aflac's policies are generally reported and paid in a relatively short time frame. the unpaid claims liability is sensitive to morbidity assumptions, in particular, severity and frequency of claims. severity is the ultimate size of a claim, and frequency is the number of claims incurred. our claims experience is primarily related to the demographics of our policyholders.
37
as a part of our established financial reporting and accounting practices and controls, we perform actuarial reviews of our policyholder liabilities on an ongoing basis and reflect the results of those reviews in our results of operations and financial condition as required by gaap.
for aflac japan, our review in 2014 and 2013 indicated no need to strengthen liabilities associated with policies in japan. our review in 2012 indicated that we needed to strengthen the liability associated primarily with a block of care policies and closed block of dementia policies in japan, primarily due to low investment yields. we strengthened our future policy benefits liability by $81 million in 2012 as a result of this review.
for aflac u.s., our review in 2014 indicated no need to strengthen liabilities associated with policies in the united states. our review in 2013 and 2012 indicated that we needed to strengthen the liability associated primarily with long-term care in the united states. we strengthened our future policy benefits liability by $20 million in both 2013 and 2012 as a result of this review.
the table below reflects the growth of the future policy benefits liability for the years ended december 31.

as of december 31, 2014, the decrease in total consolidated future policy benefits liability in dollars was primarily driven by the weakening of the yen against the u.s. dollar, compared with december 31, 2013. the growth of the future policy benefits liability in yen for aflac japan and in dollars for aflac u.s. has been due to the aging of our in-force block of business and the addition of new business.
in computing the estimate of unpaid policy claims, we consider many factors, including the benefits and amounts available under the policy; the volume and demographics of the policies exposed to claims; and internal business practices, such as incurred date assignment and current claim administrative practices. we monitor these conditions closely and make adjustments to the liability as actual experience emerges. claim levels are generally stable from period to period; however, fluctuations in claim levels may occur. in calculating the unpaid policy claim liability, we do not calculate a range of estimates. the following table shows the expected sensitivity of the unpaid policy claims liability as of december 31, 2014, to changes in severity and frequency of claims.

other policy liabilities, which accounted for 18% of total policy liabilities as of december 31, 2014, consisted primarily of discounted advance premiums on deposit from policyholders in conjunction with their purchase of certain aflac japan insurance products. these advanced premiums are deferred upon collection and recognized as premium revenue over the contractual premium payment period. advanced premiums represented 47% and 53% of the december 31, 2014 and
38
2013 other policy liabilities balances, respectively. see the aflac japan segment subsection of this md&a for further information.
income taxes income tax provisions are generally based on pretax earnings reported for financial statement purposes, which differ from those amounts used in preparing our income tax returns. deferred income taxes are recognized for temporary differences between the financial reporting basis and income tax basis of assets and liabilities, based on enacted tax laws and statutory tax rates applicable to the periods in which we expect the temporary differences to reverse. the evaluation of a tax position in accordance with gaap is a two-step process. under the first step, the enterprise determines whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon examination by taxing authorities. the second step is measurement, whereby a tax position that meets the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold is measured to determine the amount of benefit to recognize in the financial statements. a valuation allowance is established for deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that an amount will not be realized. the determination of a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets requires management to make certain judgments and assumptions.
in evaluating the ability to recover deferred tax assets, our management considers all available evidence, including taxable income in open carry back years, the existence of cumulative losses in the most recent years, forecasted earnings, future taxable income exclusive of reversing temporary differences and carryforwards, future taxable temporary difference reversals, and prudent and feasible tax planning strategies. in the event we determine it is not more likely than not that we will be able to realize all or part of our deferred tax assets in the future, a valuation allowance would be charged to earnings in the period such determination is made. likewise, if it is later determined that it is more likely than not that those deferred tax assets would be realized, the previously provided valuation allowance would be reversed. future economic conditions and market volatility, including increases in interest rates or widening credit spreads, can adversely impact the company's tax planning strategies and in particular the company's ability to utilize tax benefits on previously recognized capital losses. our judgments and assumptions are subject to change given the inherent uncertainty in predicting future performance and specific industry and investment market conditions.
interest rates and credit spreads in both the united states and japan are not the only factors that impact the company's unrealized gain/loss position and the evaluation of a need for a valuation allowance on the company's deferred tax asset, but they do have a direct and significant effect on both. based on our methodology described above for evaluating the need for a valuation allowance, we have determined that it is more likely than not that our deferred tax assets will be realized in the future, therefore we have not recorded a valuation allowance as of december 31, 2014.
see note 10 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.
new accounting pronouncements during the last three years, various accounting standard-setting bodies have been active in soliciting comments and issuing statements, interpretations and exposure drafts. for information on new accounting pronouncements and the impact, if any, on our financial position or results of operations, see note 1 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements.
results of operations the following discussion includes references to our performance measures, operating earnings and operating earnings per diluted share, that are not based on accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america ("gaap"). operating earnings is the measure of segment profit or loss we use to evaluate segment performance and allocate resources. consistent with gaap accounting guidance for segment reporting, operating earnings is our measure of segment performance. aflac believes that an analysis of operating earnings is vitally important to an understanding of our underlying profitability drivers and trends of our insurance business. furthermore, because a significant portion of our business is conducted in japan, we believe it is equally important to understand the impact of translating japanese yen into u.s. dollars.
aflac defines operating earnings (a non-gaap financial measure) as the profits derived from operations. operating earnings includes interest cash flows associated with notes payable but excludes items that cannot be predicted or that are outside of management's control, such as realized investment gains and losses from securities transactions, impairments, and derivative and hedging activities; nonrecurring items; and other non-operating income (loss) from net earnings. aflac's derivative activities are primarily used to hedge foreign exchange and interest rate risk in our investment portfolio as well as manage foreign exchange risk for certain notes payable and forecasted cash
39
flows denominated in yen. our management uses operating earnings to evaluate the financial performance of aflac's insurance operations because realized gains and losses from securities transactions, impairments, and derivative and hedging activities, as well as other and nonrecurring items, tend to be driven by general economic conditions and events or related to infrequent activities not directly associated with the company's insurance operations, and therefore may obscure the underlying fundamentals and trends in aflac's insurance operations.
the following table is a reconciliation of items impacting operating and net earnings and operating and net earnings per diluted share for the years ended december 31.

securities transactions and impairments during 2014, we realized pretax investment gains, net of losses, of $215 million ($140 million after-tax) from sales and redemptions of securities. these net gains primarily resulted from gains on sales of jgbs and our u.s. treasury holdings, currency gains from transactions by our externally managed portfolio of u.s. dollar-denominated bank loans, and assorted other bond sales and calls. we realized pretax investment losses of $31 million ($20 million after-tax) as a result of the recognition of other-than-temporary impairment losses on certain securities.
during 2013, we realized pretax investment gains, net of losses, of $262 million ($170 million after-tax) from sales and redemptions of securities. these net gains primarily resulted from sales of japanese government bonds (jgbs) as part of a portfolio repositioning exercise. we also realized modest gains from bond tender offers of several of our holdings. we realized pretax investment losses of $199 million ($129 million after-tax) as a result of the recognition of other-than-temporary impairment losses on certain securities.
during 2012, we realized pretax investment gains, net of losses, of $474 million ($309 million after-tax) from sales and redemptions of securities. these net gains primarily resulted from sales of jgbs in a bond-swap program in the third quarter of 2012 and sales resulting from our efforts to reduce risk exposure in our investment portfolio. we realized pretax investment losses of $977 million ($635 million after-tax) as a result of the recognition of other-than-temporary impairment losses on certain securities.

for additional information regarding realized investment gains and losses, see notes 3 and 4 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements.
foreign currency translation aflac japan's premiums and most of its investment income are received in yen. claims and expenses are paid in yen, and we have yen-denominated assets that support yen-denominated policy liabilities. these and other yen-denominated financial statement items are translated into dollars for financial reporting purposes. we translate aflac japan's yen-denominated income statement into dollars using an average exchange rate for the reporting period, and we translate its yen-denominated balance sheet using the exchange rate at the end of the period.
due to the size of aflac japan, where our functional currency is the japanese yen, fluctuations in the yen/dollar exchange rate can have a significant effect on our reported results. in periods when the yen weakens, translating yen into dollars results in fewer dollars being reported. when the yen strengthens, translating yen into dollars results in more dollars being reported. consequently, yen weakening has the effect of suppressing current period results in relation to the comparable prior period, while yen strengthening has the effect of magnifying current period results in relation to the comparable prior period. as a result, we view foreign currency translation as a financial reporting issue for aflac and not an economic event to our company or shareholders. because changes in exchange rates distort the growth rates of our operations, management evaluates aflac's financial performance excluding the impact of foreign currency translation.
income taxes our combined u.s. and japanese effective income tax rate on pretax earnings was 34.3% in 2014, 34.4% in 2013 and 33.4% in 2012. the lower effective income tax rate for 2012 reflected the favorable outcome of a routine tax exam for the years 2008 and 2009, which reduced income tax expense by $29.5 million. total income taxes were $1.5 billion in 2014, compared with $1.7 billion in 2013 and $1.4 billion in 2012. japanese income taxes on aflac japan's results account for most of our consolidated income tax expense. see note 10 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.

earnings guidance our original objective for 2014 was to increase operating earnings per diluted share by 2% to 5% over 2013, and we revised the objective during the year to a 3% to 4% increase, excluding the effect of foreign currency translation. we reported 2014 net earnings per diluted share of $6.50. adjusting that number for after-tax realized investment gains ($.24 per diluted share), other non-operating income ($.10 per diluted share), and foreign currency translation (an expense of $.26 per diluted share), we finished the year at the high end of our revised objective with a 3.9% increase in operating earnings per diluted share.
earnings growth from 2014 will create tough comparisons in 2015. our objective for 2015 is to increase operating earnings per diluted share by 2% to 7% over 2014, excluding the effect of foreign currency translation. interest rates in both japan and the united states are at historic lows, with cash flows to investments being lower in 2015 than in prior years. the progression of the benefit ratios in japan and the united states, which have seen favorable trends in 2014, could also have a significant impact on our results. if we achieve our objective for 2015, the following table shows the likely results for operating earnings per diluted share, including the impact of foreign currency translation using various yen/dollar exchange rate scenarios.

(2)actual 2014 weighted-average exchange rate insurance operations aflac's insurance business consists of two segments: aflac japan and aflac u.s. aflac japan, which operates as a branch of aflac, is the principal contributor to consolidated earnings. gaap financial reporting requires that a company report financial and descriptive information about operating segments in its annual and interim period financial statements. furthermore, we are required to report a measure of segment profit or loss, certain revenue and expense items, and segment assets.
we evaluate our sales efforts using new annualized premium sales, an industry operating measure. new annualized premium sales, which include both new sales and the incremental increase in premiums due to conversions, represent the premiums that we would collect over a 12-month period, assuming the policies remain in force. for aflac japan, new annualized premium sales are determined by applications submitted during the reporting period. for aflac u.s., new annualized premium sales are determined by applications that are issued during the reporting period. premium income, or earned premiums, is a financial performance measure that reflects collected or due premiums that have been earned ratably on policies in force during the reporting period.

the relatively small change in premium income in yen for 2014 was influenced by the impact of weak first sector sales in 2014 and 2013 in addition to premiums ceded in the 2014 and 2013 reinsurance transactions. annualized premiums in force at december 31, 2014, were 1.59 trillion yen, compared with 1.57 trillion yen in 2013 and 1.49 trillion yen in 2012. the increases in annualized premiums in force in yen of 1.7% in 2014, 5.0% in 2013 and 11.1% in 2012 reflect the sales of new policies combined with the high persistency of aflac japan's business. annualized premiums in force, translated into dollars at respective year-end exchange rates, were $13.2 billion in 2014, $14.9 billion in 2013, and $17.2 billion in 2012.
aflac japan's investment portfolios include dollar-denominated securities and reverse-dual currency securities (yen-denominated debt securities with dollar coupon payments). dollar-denominated investment income from these assets accounted for approximately 46% of aflac japan's investment income in 2014, compared with 44% in 2013 and 33% in 2012. this percentage increase in 2014 and 2013 is due to our higher allocation to u.s. dollar-denominated investments. in years when the yen strengthens in relation to the dollar, translating aflac japan's dollar-denominated investment income into yen lowers growth rates for net investment income, total operating revenues, and pretax operating earnings in yen terms. in years when the yen weakens, translating dollar-denominated investment income into yen magnifies growth rates for net investment income, total operating revenues, and pretax operating earnings in yen terms. excluding foreign currency changes from the respective prior year, dollar-denominated investment income accounted for approximately 44% of aflac japan's investment income during 2014, compared with 39% in 2013 and 33% in 2012.
the following table illustrates the effect of translating aflac japan's dollar-denominated investment income and related items into yen by comparing certain segment results with those that would have been reported had yen/dollar exchange rates remained unchanged from the prior year.

in 2014, the benefit ratio decreased compared with 2013, reflecting lower incurred claims which are offsetting the mix of in-force shift to first sector products. in addition, the reinsurance agreements that we entered into at the end of third quarter 2013 and the beginning of fourth quarter 2014 reduced the benefit ratio by approximately 50 basis points in 2014. the benefit ratio has also been influenced by the effect of low investment yields, which impacts our profit margin by reducing the spread between investment yields and required interest on policy reserves (see table and discussion in the interest rate risk subsection of this md&a). in 2014, the operating expense ratio increased primarily due to the change in the mix of business for new sales. in total, the pretax operating profit margin improved in 2014, compared with 2013. for 2015, we anticipate the pretax operating profit margin to be comparable with the 2013 and 2014 levels.

the foundation of aflac japan's product portfolio has been, and continues to be, our third sector cancer and medical products. sales of third sector products increased 6.1% in 2014, compared with the same period in 2013, achieving the high end of our 2% to 7% sales target. we have been focusing more on promotion of our cancer and medical products following the repricing of our first sector life products in april 2013. in september 2014, aflac japan introduced a new product called new cancer days which provides enhanced coverage, including outpatient treatments and multiple cancer occurrence benefits. at the same time, premiums for this product have been lowered for most ages compared to prior plans. cancer insurance sales were up 176% for the fourth quarter of 2014, compared with 2013, reflecting a favorable response to the new cancer product and the advertising to promote it. with continued cost pressure on japan's health care system, we expect the need for third sector products will continue to rise in the future, and we remain convinced that the medical and cancer products aflac japan provides will continue to be an important part of our product portfolio.
aflac japan's first sector product sales were down 47.3% in 2014, compared with 2013. we expect that for 2015, the sale of first sector products will continue to be down in comparison to 2014, as our focus remains on less interest-sensitive third sector products.
at december 31, 2014, we had agreements to sell our products at 371 banks, or more than 90% of the total number of banks in japan. we believe we have significantly more banks selling our supplemental health insurance products than any other insurer operating in japan. as expected, sales of the first sector ways product declined sharply in 2014, leading to a 47.3% decline in bank channel sales, compared with 2013. bank channel sales accounted for 21.5% of new annualized premium sales in 2014 for aflac japan, compared with 31.3% in 2013.
we remain committed to selling through our traditional channels. these channels, consisting of affiliated corporate agencies, independent corporate agencies and individual agencies, accounted for 76.1% of total new annualized premium sales for aflac japan in 2014. in 2014, we recruited more than 900 new sales agencies. at december 31, 2014, aflac japan was represented by approximately 14,500 sales agencies and more than 121,100 licensed sales associates employed by those agencies.
aflac japan and japan post holdings entered into a new agreement in july 2013, further expanding a partnership that was established in 2008 (see japanese regulatory environment). at the end of june 2014, japan post insurance (kampo) received fsa regulatory approval to enter into an agency contract with aflac japan to begin distributing aflac japan's cancer insurance products at all of kampo's 79 directly managed sales offices. aflac japan has developed a unique aflac-branded cancer product for japan post and kampo that was introduced on october 1, 2014. in the fourth quarter of 2014, the number of postal outlets selling our cancer products expanded to approximately 10,000, and japan post intends to further expand the number of post offices that offer aflac's cancer products to 20,000 postal outlets by the end of first quarter 2016. we believe this alliance with japan post will further benefit our cancer insurance sales.
we believe that there is still a continued need for our products in japan. our sales target and focus in 2015 will continue to be centered around the sale of aflac japan's third sector products, including cancer and medical. although we have experienced a decline in sales from our traditional channels, we believe they have been, and remain, key to our success. we have developed partnerships with new channels to help offset this decline and increase our overall sales growth. these channels include japan post, and we are making steady progress with our sales through postal outlets. in 2015, we believe that third sector sales will average a 15% increase for the first nine months of the year. however, we believe sales of third sector products in the fourth quarter of 2015 could be down in comparative percentage terms, given the difficult prior year comparisons.

japanese economy the bank of japan's january 2015 monthly report of recent economic and financial developments stated the following about the japanese economy. japan's economy continues to recover moderately. public investment has plateaued at a high level while housing investment, which continued to decline following the consumption tax hike, has recently started to bottom out. private consumption has remained resilient due to steady improvement in employment and income. the report projected that japan's economy is expected to recover moderately, and the effects such as those of the decline in demand following the consumption tax hike are expected to dissipate. exports are expected to increase moderately due to the improving overseas economies. as for domestic demand, public investment is expected to flatten at a high level and subsequently begin to decline moderately. private consumption is expected to remain resilient due to steady improvement in employment and income, and the effects of the decline in demand following the consumption tax hike are expected to dissipate gradually. housing investment is projected to gradually regain its resilience as well.
japanese regulatory environment in 2005, legislation aimed at privatizing japan's postal system (japan post) was enacted into law. the privatization laws split japan post into four operating entities that began operations in october 2007. in 2007, one of these entities selected aflac japan as its provider of cancer insurance to be sold through its post offices, and, in 2008, we began selling cancer insurance through these post offices. japan post has historically been a popular place for consumers to purchase insurance products. legislation to reform the postal system passed the diet in april 2012 and resulted in the merger of two of the postal operating entities (the one that delivers the mail and the one that runs the post offices) on october 1, 2012. in july 2013, aflac japan entered into a new agreement with japan post holdings to further expand a partnership that was established in 2008 (see aflac japan sales).
on january 16, 2014, japan's fsa issued a reporting order pursuant to the insurance business law to all insurance companies, including aflac japan, entitled "regarding the rectification, etc. of insurance agency employees." companies have been ordered to ascertain conditions on the ground regarding sales agents, facilitate the discontinuation of the practice of subcontracting (i.e., the use of non-employee contractors to sell insurance on behalf of insurance agencies), and report to the fsa no later than april 30, 2015. in light of the company's current mix of distribution channels, the use of non-employee contractors is not a major channel for the company in japan.
in june 2013, a revision to the financial instruments and exchange act established a post-funded orderly resolution regime for financial institutions to prevent a financial crisis in the event of a financial institution's failure. this regime came into effect in march 2014, but is not expected to have a material impact on the company's operations in japan.
aflac japan investments the level of investment income in yen is affected by available cash flow from operations, the timing of investing the cash flow, yields on new investments, the effect of yen/dollar exchange rates on dollar-denominated investment income, and other factors. aflac japan has historically invested primarily in japan government bonds (jgbs) and privately issued securities. privately issued securities generally have higher yields than those available on jgbs and other publicly traded debt instruments. all of the privately issued securities we have purchased were rated investment grade at the time of purchase. these securities were generally either privately negotiated arrangements or were issued with documentation consistent with standard medium-term note programs. many of these investments have protective covenants appropriate to the specific investment. these may include a prohibition of certain activities by the borrower, maintenance of certain financial measures, and specific conditions impacting the payment of our notes.
in order to address our challenge of investing in japan's low-interest-rate environment and reduce the proportion of privately issued securities in our overall portfolio, we have invested in higher-yielding u.s. dollar-denominated publicly-traded investment grade corporate fixed-maturity securities, and have entered into foreign currency forwards and options to hedge the currency risk on the fair value of the u.s. dollar securities. we started this program as part of our strategic review of portfolio allocation, maintain it as part of our on-going portfolio allocation, and will allocate new money into the program based on multiple factors including market conditions, overall portfolio make-up, investment alternatives, needs of the business, and other factors.
funds available for investment include cash flows from operations, investment income, and funds generated from maturities, redemptions, securities lending, and other securities transactions. securities lending is also used from time to time to accelerate the availability of funds for investment. aflac japan purchased debt security investments at an aggregate acquisition cost of approximately 1.0 trillion yen in 2014 (approximately $10.0 billion), 2.5 trillion yen in 2013 (approximately $25.4 billion) and 2.7 trillion yen in 2012 (approximately $34.4 billion).

given the volatility in the u.s. interest rate environment, aflac japan did not purchase any additional u.s. dollar-denominated fixed maturities as part of the program discussed above during the last six months of 2013. however, we did resume purchasing investment-grade u.s. dollar-denominated securities during 2014. despite resuming the purchase of u.s. dollar-denominated investments, which generally yield more than jgbs, we experienced an overall decrease in the new money yield in 2014, compared to 2013. although we allocated some cash to u.s. dollar-denominated investments, a significant portion of our investable cash flow during this period was allocated to the purchase of jgbs and, within our u.s. dollar securities allocation, a sizable purchase of u.s. treasury securities, which were sold in the fourth quarter of 2014.
we use specific criteria to judge the credit quality of both existing and prospective investments. furthermore, we use several methods to monitor these criteria, including credit rating services and internal credit analysis. the ratings referenced in the two tables below are based on the ratings designations provided by the major credit rating agencies (moody's investors service (moody's), standard & poor's ratings services (s&p), and fitch ratings (fitch)) or, if not rated, are determined based on our internal credit analysis of such securities. for investment-grade securities where the ratings assigned by the major credit agencies are not equivalent, we use the second lowest rating that is assigned. for a description of the ratings methodology that we use when a security is split-rated (one rating agency rates the security as investment grade while another rating agency rates the same security as below investment grade), see "market risks of financial instruments - below-investment-grade and split-rated securities" in the analysis of financial condition section of this md&a.
the distributions by credit rating of aflac japan's purchases of debt securities for the years ended december 31, based on acquisition cost, were as follows:
composition of purchases by credit rating
2014                             2013          2012

total         100.0   %     100.0   %     100.0   %
purchases of securities are determined through an evaluation of multiple factors including credit risk, relative pricing and return potential of the security, liquidity of the instrument, broad business and portfolio considerations, and other market based and company specific factors. the large increase in aaa rated purchases in 2014 resulted from our decision to allocate part of our u.s. dollar securities allocation to u.s. treasuries, in addition to our purchases of investment-grade corporate bonds. higher purchases of aa rated securities in 2014 and 2013 compared with 2012 were primarily due to additional purchases of jgbs. the increase in purchases of a rated securities in 2013 and bbb rated securities in 2012 was related primarily to the purchase of u.s. dollar-denominated corporate fixed-income publicly traded securities for the aflac japan portfolio as discussed above. the purchases of bb or lower rated securities during 2014, 2013 and 2012 were related to a program that we initiated in 2011 to invest in senior secured bank loans to u.s. and

(1) yields are reported before the cost of the foreign currency forwards that hedge foreign exchange risk of u.s. dollar-denominated publicly-traded corporate bonds.
the decline in the aflac japan new money yield is primarily due to the allocation to lower yielding jgbs and the allocation from u.s. corporate bonds to u.s. treasuries for a period in 2014, given aflac's view on the relative value of credit investments at that time.

the significant shift of investments rated aa to a is due to the downgrade of our investment in jgbs from aa to a during the fourth quarter of 2014.

(1)see the insurance operations section of this md&a for our definition of segment operating earnings.
the benefit ratio decreased in 2014, compared with 2013, reflecting lower benefit reserve growth from new product designs. the expense ratio increased in 2014, compared with 2013, largely due to increased spending associated with changes in the aflac u.s. sales structure and increases in amortization of deferred acquisition costs related to changes in business mix. these fluctuations resulted in an overall improvement in the pretax operating profit margin in 2014, compared with 2013. in 2015, we expect the benefit and expense ratios to be relatively stable compared with 2014.

in 2014, our traditional u.s. sales forces included more than 9,300 u.s. associates who were actively producing business on a weekly basis. we believe that the average weekly producing sales associates metric allows our sales management to actively monitor progress and needs on a real-time basis. beyond expanding the size and capabilities of our traditional sales force, we remain encouraged about establishing and developing relationships with insurance brokers that typically handle the larger-case market.
50
the addition of group products has expanded our reach and enabled us to generate more sales opportunities with larger employers, brokers, and our traditional sales agents. we anticipate that the appeal of our group products will continue to enhance our opportunities to connect with larger businesses and their employees. our portfolio of group and individual products offers businesses the opportunity to give their employees a more valuable and comprehensive selection of benefit options.
beginning in the third quarter and continuing into the fourth quarter of 2014, aflac u.s. implemented tactical initiatives centered around providing competitive compensation to our sales hierarchy and positioning us to more effectively and consistently execute on the u.s. sales strategy across all states. these measures are designed to more effectively link sales management's success to aflac's success. for example, we enhanced compensation through an incentive bonus for the first level of our sales management, district sales coordinators, who are primarily responsible for selling aflac products and training new sales associates. additionally, we eliminated the commission-based position of state sales coordinator. to better manage our state operations, we introduced the new position of market director, effective october 1, 2014. market directors are salaried with the opportunity to earn sales-related bonuses. we expect this position change will enhance performance management and better align compensation with new business results. we believe these changes made to the u.s. sales organization were instrumental in achieving a 14.1% sales increase during the fourth quarter of 2014, driving full-year 2014 aflac u.s. sales up .7% which exceeded our most recent sales expectation for the year.
with the evolving business market and the coverage standardization that will result from health care reform in the united states, we believe aflac's voluntary products will become more relevant than ever. our products provide cash benefits that can be used to help with increasing out-of-pocket medical expenses, help cover household costs, or protect against income and asset loss. our group products and relationships with insurance brokers that handle the larger-case market are helping us as we expand our reach selling to larger businesses. we are regularly evaluating the marketplace to identify opportunities to bring the most relevant, cost-effective products to our customers. we believe the need for our products remains very strong, and we continue to work on enhancing our distribution capabilities to access employers of all sizes, including initiatives that benefit our field force and the broker community. at the same time, we are seeking opportunities to leverage our brand strength and attractive product portfolio in the evolving health care environment. for 2015, our objective is for aflac u.s. new annualized premium sales to increase 3% to 7%, with a target of 5%.
u.s. economy operating in the u.s. economy continues to be challenging. while ongoing uncertainty around health care reform implementation has prompted many businesses and consumers to postpone decisions related to health care coverage, we believe that the need for our products remains strong, and that the united states remains a sizeable and attractive market for our products.
u.s. regulatory environment the affordable care act (aca) is intended to give americans of all ages and income levels access to comprehensive major medical health insurance. the major elements of the bill became effective on january 1, 2014. the primary subject of the legislation is major medical insurance; as enacted, the aca does not materially affect the design of our insurance products. however, indirect consequences of the legislation and regulations, including short-term uncertainty related to implementation, could present challenges and/or opportunities that could potentially have an impact on our sales model, financial condition and results of operations. our experience with japan's national health care environment leads us to believe that the need for our products will only increase over the coming years.
the dodd-frank act created, among other things, a financial stability oversight council (the council). in april 2012, the council released a final rule describing the general process it will follow in determining whether to designate a nonbank financial company for supervision by the board of governors of the u.s. federal reserve system (the board). the council may designate by a two-thirds vote whether certain nonbank financial companies, including certain insurance companies and insurance holding companies, could pose a threat to the financial stability of the united states, in which case such nonbank financial companies would become subject to prudential regulation by the board. on april 3, 2013, the board published a final rule that establishes the requirements for determining when a nonbank financial company is "predominantly engaged in financial activities" - a prerequisite for designation by the council. prudential regulation by the board includes supervision of capital requirements, leverage limits, liquidity requirements and examinations. the board may limit such company's ability to enter into mergers, acquisitions and other business combination transactions, restrict its ability to offer financial products, require it to terminate one or more activities, or impose conditions on the manner in which it conducts activities. the council designated two insurers in 2013 and an additional insurer in 2014 as a systematically important financial institution (sifi) in 2014. on december 18, 2014, president obama signed the
51
insurance capital standards clarification act into law. this legislation will clarify the board's authority to apply insurance-based capital standards for insurance companies subject to federal supervision. although aflac is a nonbank financial company predominantly engaged in financial activities as defined in the dodd-frank act, we do not believe aflac will be considered a company that poses a threat to the financial stability of the united states.
title vii of the dodd-frank act and regulations issued thereunder may have an impact on aflac's derivative activity, including activity on behalf of aflac japan, in particular rules and rule proposals to require central clearing and collateral for certain types of derivatives. the five u.s. banking regulators and the u.s. commodity futures trading commission (cftc) recently re-proposed for comment their rules regarding collateral for uncleared swaps. if adopted as proposed, such rules may result in increased collateral requirements for aflac or impose limits on the types of collateral we are permitted to post.
the dodd-frank act also established a federal insurance office (fio) under the u.s. treasury department to monitor all aspects of the insurance industry and of lines of business other than certain health insurance, certain long-term care insurance and crop insurance. traditionally, u.s. insurance companies have been regulated primarily by state insurance departments. in december 2013, the fio released a report entitled "how to modernize and improve the system of insurance regulation in the united states." the report was required by the dodd-frank act, and included 18 recommended areas of near-term reform for the states, including addressing capital adequacy and safety/soundness issues, reform of insurer resolution practices, and reform of marketplace regulation. the report also listed nine recommended areas for direct federal involvement in insurance regulation. some of the recommendations outlined in the fio report released in december 2013 have been implemented. of the nine recommended areas for direct federal involvement in insurance regulation that are applicable to aflac, president obama has signed the national association of registered agents and brokers reform act into law in january 2015, which simplifies the agent and broker licensing process across state lines. the fio has also engaged with the supervisory colleges to monitor financial stability and identify regulatory gaps for large national and internationally active insurers.
on december 10, 2013, five u.s. financial regulators adopted a final rule implementing the "volcker rule," which was created by section 619 of the dodd-frank act. the volcker rule generally prohibits "banking entities" from engaging in "proprietary trading" and making investments and conducting certain other activities with "private equity funds and hedge funds." the final rule becomes effective april 1, 2014; however, at the time the agencies released the final volcker rule, the federal reserve announced an extension of the conformance period for all banking entities until july 21, 2015. in response to industry questions regarding the final volcker rule, the five u.s. financial regulators, which included the office of the comptroller of the currency (occ); the federal reserve; the federal deposit insurance corporation (fdic); the sec and the u.s. cftc, issued a clarifying interim final rule on january 14, 2014 that permits banking entities to retain interests in certain collateralized debt obligations (cdos) backed by trust preferred securities if the cdo meets certain requirements.
on december 18, 2014, the federal reserve announced a second extension to the volcker rule conformance period, to give banking entities until july 21, 2016, to conform investments in and relationships with covered funds and foreign funds that were in place prior to december 31, 2013 (legacy covered funds). the federal reserve also announced its intention to act in the future to grant banking entities an additional one-year extension of the conformance period until july 21, 2017, to conform ownership interests in and relationships with these legacy covered funds. the federal reserve did not act to extend the conformance period for proprietary trading activities.
nonbank financial companies such as aflac that are not affiliated with an insured depository institution or otherwise brought within the definition of "banking entity" generally will not be subject to the volcker rule's prohibitions. however, the prohibitions of the volcker rule could impact financial markets generally, for example, through reduced liquidity in certain markets or the exiting of positions by banking entities as the end of the conformance period approaches.
the dodd-frank act requires extensive rule-making and other future regulatory action, which in some cases will take a period of years to implement. at the current time, it is not possible to predict with any degree of certainty what impact, if any, the dodd-frank act will have on our u.s. business, financial condition, or results of operations.
aflac u.s. investments the level of investment income is affected by available cash flow from operations, the timing of investing the cash flow, yields on new investments, and other factors. aflac u.s. has invested primarily in investment grade corporate bonds.
52
funds available for investment include cash flows from operations, investment income, and funds generated from maturities, redemptions, and other securities transactions. aflac u.s. purchased debt security investments at an aggregate acquisition cost of approximately $1.1 billion in 2014, compared with $1.4 billion in 2013 and $1.5 billion in 2012. the following table presents the composition of debt security purchases for aflac u.s. by sector, as a percentage of acquisition cost, for the years ended december 31.

we use specific criteria to judge the credit quality of both existing and prospective investments. furthermore, we use several methods to monitor these criteria, including credit rating services and internal credit analysis. the ratings referenced in the two tables below are based on the ratings designations provided by the major credit rating agencies (moody's, s&p, and fitch) or, if not rated, are determined based on our internal credit analysis of such securities. for investment-grade securities where the ratings assigned by the major credit agencies are not equivalent, we use the second lowest rating that is assigned. for a description of the ratings methodology that we use when a security is split-rated (one rating agency rates the security as investment grade while another rating agency rates the same security as below investment grade), see "market risks of financial instruments - below-investment-grade and split-rated securities" in the analysis of financial condition section of this md&a.
the distributions by credit rating of aflac's u.s. purchases of debt securities for the years ended december 31, based on acquisition cost, were as follows:

the increase in the aflac u.s. new money yield in 2014 is primarily due to the differential in interest rates between intermediate and longer duration bonds during much of the year, and wider credit spreads later in the year.

market risks of financial instruments our investment philosophy is to fulfill our fiduciary responsibility to invest assets in a prudent manner to meet the present and future needs of our policyholders' contractual obligations while maximizing the long-term financial return on assets consistent with the company goal of maximizing long-term shareholder value with defined risk appetites, limits, and maintaining adequate liquidity.

because we invest in fixed-income securities, our financial instruments are exposed primarily to three types of market risks: currency risk, interest rate risk, and credit risk.
currency risk the functional currency of aflac japan's insurance operations is the japanese yen. all of aflac japan's premiums, claims and commissions are received or paid in yen, as are most of its other expenses. most of aflac japan's cash and liabilities are yen-denominated. aflac japan's investments consisted primarily of yen-denominated securities of $63.1 billion, at amortized cost, at december 31, 2014. however, aflac japan also owns dollar-denominated securities of $13.2
55
billion, at amortized cost, whose fair value is hedged against currency risk as well as $7.0 billion of securities, at amortized cost, that are not hedged as of december 31, 2014. due to this investment allocation, yen-denominated investment income accounted for 54% of aflac japan's investment income in 2014, with the remainder denominated in u.s. dollars. in addition, aflac incorporated has yen-denominated debt obligations.
we are exposed to currency risk as an economic event only when yen funds are actually converted into dollars. this occurs when we repatriate yen-denominated funds from aflac japan to aflac u.s. the exchange rates prevailing at the time of repatriation will differ from the exchange rates prevailing at the time the yen profits were earned. a portion of the yen repatriation may be used to service aflac incorporated's yen-denominated notes payable with the remainder converted into dollars. in order to hedge foreign exchange risk for a portion of the profit repatriation received in yen from aflac japan in july 2014 and december 2014, we had foreign exchange forwards and options as part of a hedging strategy on 52.5 billion yen and 50.0 billion yen, respectively. as of december 31, 2014, we had foreign exchange forwards to hedge foreign exchange risk on 157.5 billion yen of future profit repatriation from aflac japan.
in addition to profit repatriation, certain investment activities for aflac japan expose us to economic currency risk when yen are converted into dollars. as noted above, we invest a portion of our yen cash flows in dollar-denominated assets. this requires that we convert the yen cash flows to u.s. dollars before investing. as previously discussed, for certain of our u.s. dollar-denominated securities, we enter into foreign currency forward and option contracts to hedge the currency risk on the fair value of the securities. the dollar coupon payments received on these investments are not hedged and are subject to foreign exchange fluctuations, which are realized in earnings. also, aflac japan has invested in reverse-dual currency securities (rdcs, or yen-denominated debt securities with dollar coupon payments), which exposes aflac to changes in foreign exchange rates. the foreign currency effect on the yen-denominated securities is accounted for as a component of unrealized gains or losses on available-for-sale securities in accumulated other comprehensive income, while the foreign currency effect on the dollar coupons is realized in earnings. the rdcs provided a higher yield at the time of purchase than those available on japanese government or other public corporate bonds, while still adhering to our investment standards at the time of the transaction. the yen/dollar exchange rate would have to strengthen to approximately 28 before the yield on these instruments would equal that of a comparable jgb instrument.
aside from the activities discussed above, we generally do not convert yen into dollars; however, we do translate financial statement amounts from yen into dollars for financial reporting purposes. therefore, reported amounts are affected by foreign currency fluctuations. we report unrealized foreign currency translation gains and losses in accumulated other comprehensive income. in periods when the yen weakens against the dollar, translating yen into dollars causes fewer dollars to be reported. when the yen strengthens, translating yen into dollars causes more dollars to be reported. the weakening of the yen relative to the dollar will generally adversely affect the value of our yen-denominated investments in dollar terms. we attempt to minimize the exposure of shareholders' equity to foreign currency. we accomplish this by investing a portion of aflac japan's investment portfolio in dollar-denominated securities and by the parent company's issuance of yen-denominated debt (for additional information, see the discussion under the hedging activities subsection of md&a). as a result, the effect of currency fluctuations on our net assets is reduced.
the following table demonstrates the effect of foreign currency fluctuations by presenting the dollar values of our yen-denominated assets and liabilities, and our consolidated yen-denominated net asset exposure at selected exchange rates as of december 31.

(3) does not include u.s. dollar-denominated bonds that have corresponding cross-currency swaps in consolidated vies we are required to consolidate certain vies. some of the consolidated vies in aflac japan's portfolio use foreign currency swaps to convert foreign denominated cash flows to yen, the functional currency of aflac japan, in order to minimize cash flow fluctuations. foreign currency swaps exchange an initial principal amount in two currencies, agreeing to re-exchange the currencies at a future date, at an agreed upon exchange rate. there may also be periodic exchanges of payments at specified intervals based on the agreed upon rates and notional amounts. prior to consolidation, our beneficial interest in these vies was a yen-denominated available-for-sale fixed maturity security. upon consolidation, the original yen-denominated investment was derecognized and the underlying fixed-maturity or perpetual securities and cross-currency swaps were recognized. the combination of a u.s. dollar-denominated investment and cross-currency swap economically creates a yen-denominated investment and has no impact on our net investment hedge position.
similarly, the combination of the u.s. corporate bonds and the foreign currency forwards and options that we have entered into, as discussed in the aflac japan investment subsection of md&a, economically creates a yen-denominated investment that qualifies for inclusion as a component of our investment in aflac japan for net investment hedge purposes.
for additional information regarding our aflac japan net investment hedge, see the hedging activities subsection of md&a.

interest rate risk our primary interest rate exposure is to the impact of changes in interest rates on the fair value of our investments in debt and perpetual securities. we monitor our investment portfolio on a quarterly basis utilizing a full valuation methodology, measuring price volatility, and sensitivity of the fair values of our investments to interest rate changes on the debt and perpetual securities we own. for example, if the current duration of a debt security or perpetual security is 10, then the fair value of that security will increase by approximately 10% if market interest rates decrease by 100 basis points, assuming all other factors remain constant. likewise, the fair value of the debt security or perpetual security will decrease by approximately 10% if market interest rates increase by 100 basis points, assuming all other factors remain constant.
the estimated effect of potential increases in interest rates on the fair values of debt and perpetual securities we own; derivatives, excluding credit default swaps, and notes payable as of december 31 follows:

(1)excludes capitalized lease obligations there are various factors that affect the fair value of our investment in debt and perpetual securities. included in those factors are changes in the prevailing interest rate environment, which directly affect the balance of unrealized gains or losses for a given period in relation to a prior period. decreases in market yields generally improve the fair value of debt and perpetual securities, while increases in market yields generally have a negative impact on the fair value of our debt and perpetual securities. however, we do not expect to realize a majority of any unrealized gains or losses because we generally have the intent and ability to hold such securities until a recovery of value, which may be maturity. for additional information on unrealized losses on debt and perpetual securities, see note 3 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements.

(1)represents investments for aflac japan that support policy obligations and therefore excludes aflac japan's annuity products and investment income from the dollar-denominated investment portfolio we continue to monitor the spread between our new money yield and the required interest assumption for newly issued products in both the united states and japan and will re-evaluate those assumptions as necessary. over the next two years, we have yen-denominated securities that will mature with yields in excess of aflac japan's current net investment yield of 2.09%. these securities total $1.2 billion at amortized cost and have an average yield of 4.16%. currently, when debt and perpetual securities we own mature, the proceeds may be reinvested at a yield below that of the interest required for the accretion of policy benefit liabilities on policies issued in earlier years. however, adding riders to our older policies has helped offset negative investment spreads on these policies. overall, adequate profit margins exist in aflac japan's aggregate block of business because of changes in the mix of business and favorable experience from mortality, morbidity and expenses.
we had an interest rate swap agreement related to the 5.5 billion yen variable interest rate samurai notes that we issued in july 2011 and redeemed in july 2014. this agreement effectively converted the variable interest rate notes to fixed rate notes to eliminate the volatility in our interest expense. we have interest rate swaps related to some of our consolidated vies. these interest rate swaps are primarily used to convert interest receipts on floating-rate fixed-maturity securities contracts to fixed rates.
interest rate swaptions are options on interest rate swaps. we have entered into interest rate collars, combinations of two swaption positions, in order to hedge certain dollar-denominated available-for-sale securities that are held in the aflac japan segment. we have used collars to protect against significant changes in the fair value associated with interest rate changes of our dollar-denominated available-for-sale securities. in order to minimize cost, we set the strike price on each collar so that the premium paid for the 'payer leg' is offset by the premium received for having sold the 'receiver leg'.
periodically, depending on general economic conditions, we may enter into other derivative transactions to hedge interest rate risk.
for further information on our interest rate derivatives, see note 4 of the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements.
credit risk a significant portion of our investment portfolio consists of fixed income or perpetual securities that expose us to the credit risk of the underlying issuer. we carefully evaluate this risk on every new investment and closely monitor the credit risk of our existing investment portfolio. we incorporate the needs of our products and liabilities, the overall requirements of the business, and other factors in addition to our underwriting of the credit risk for each investment in the portfolio.
59
evaluating the underlying risks in our credit portfolio involves a multitude of factors including but not limited to our assessment of the issuers business activities, assets, products, market position, financial condition, and future prospects. we also must incorporate the assessment of the nationally recognized statistical rating organizations (nrsros) in assigning credit ratings to our specific portfolio holdings. we employ a team of experienced credit investment professionals to perform extensive internal assessments of the credit risks for all our portfolio holdings and potential new investments.
the ratings of our securities referenced in the two tables below are based on the ratings designations provided by major nrsros (moody's, s&p and fitch) or, if not rated, are determined based on our internal analysis of such securities. for investment-grade securities where the ratings assigned by the major credit agencies are not equivalent, we use the second lowest rating that is assigned. for a description of the ratings methodology that we use when a security is split-rated, see "market risks of financial instruments - below-investment-grade and split-rated securities" in the analysis of financial condition section of this md&a.
the distributions by credit rating of our purchases of debt securities for the years ended december 31, based on acquisition cost, were as follows:

purchases of securities from period to period are determined based on multiple objectives including appropriate portfolio diversification, the relative value of a potential investment and availability of investment opportunities, liquidity, credit and other risk factors while adhering to our investment policy guidelines. we did not purchase any perpetual securities during the periods presented in the table above. the increase in purchases of aaa rated securities during 2014 was due to the purchase of u.s. treasury securities in the aflac japan portfolio. the increase in purchases of aa rated securities in 2014 and 2013 was primarily due to the purchase of jgbs. the relatively higher purchases of a rated securities in 2013 and bbb rated securities in 2012 were related primarily to the purchase of u.s. dollar-denominated corporate fixed-income publicly traded securities for the aflac japan portfolio as discussed further in the results of operations - aflac japan segment section of this md&a. the purchases of bb or lower rated securities in 2014, 2013 and 2012 were for a program to invest in senior secured bank loans to u.s. and canadian corporate borrowers, most of which have below-investment-grade ratings. the program is managed externally by third party firms specializing in this asset class. this mandate requires a minimum average credit quality of bb-/ba3, prohibits loans rated below b/b2, and restricts exposure to any individual credit to less than 3% of the program's assets. the objectives of this program include enhancing the yield on invested assets, achieving further diversification of credit risk, and mitigating the risk of rising interest rates through the acquisition of floating rate assets.

the significant shift of investments rated aa to a is due to the downgrade of aflac japan's investment in jgbs from aa to a during the fourth quarter of 2014. as of december 31, 2014, our direct and indirect exposure to securities in our investment portfolio that were guaranteed by third parties was immaterial both individually and in the aggregate.
subordination distribution the majority of our total investments in debt and perpetual securities was senior debt at december 31, 2014 and 2013. we also maintained investments in subordinated financial instruments that primarily consisted of lower tier ii, upper tier ii, and tier i securities, listed in order of seniority. the lower tier ii securities are debt instruments with fixed maturities. our upper tier ii and tier i investments consisted of debt instruments with fixed maturities and perpetual securities, which have an economic maturity as opposed to a stated maturity.
the following table shows the subordination distribution of our debt and perpetual securities as of december 31.

investment concentrations one of our largest sector concentrations as of december 31, 2014, was banks and financial institutions. approximately 14% and 15% of our total portfolio of debt and perpetual securities, on an amortized cost basis, was in the bank and financial institution sector at december 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. within the countries we approve for investment opportunities, we primarily invest in financial institutions that are strategically crucial to each approved country's economy. the bank and financial institution sector is a highly regulated industry and plays a strategic role in the global economy. within this sector, our credit risk by geographic region or country of issuer at december 31, 2014, based on amortized cost, was: europe, excluding the united kingdom (29%); united states (27%); australia (8%); japan (8%); united kingdom (9%); and other (19%).

* if aggregated, our total exposure under the berkshire hathaway family of companies would have placed it among our top 20 exposures. however, we consider berkshire hathaway energy company and burlington northern santa fe, llc holdings distinct from those of the parent company and believe it appropriate to report them separately.
as previously disclosed, we own long-dated debt instruments in support of our long-dated policyholder obligations. some of our largest global investment holdings are positions that were purchased many years ago and increased in size due to merger and consolidation activity among the issuing entities. in addition, many of our largest holdings are yen-denominated, therefore strengthening of the yen can increase our position in dollars, and weakening of the yen can

decrease our position in dollars. our global investment guidelines establish concentration limits for our investment portfolios.

investments in european countries since 2008, many countries in europe, and specifically greece, ireland, italy, portugal, and spain (collectively the "peripheral eurozone" countries), have been experiencing a debt crisis. collective action by multiple parties including the european central bank (ecb), international monetary fund (imf), european council, and individual member states' governments has improved market perception of the situation. although risks ranging from individual country downgrades to dissolution of the entire union have been greatly reduced and recent economic indicators suggest some improvement, overall economic activity remains subdued throughout the region. as many eurozone economies struggle with sustainable economic growth following the region's recent sovereign debt and banking crisis, the ecb has launched a quantitative easing (qe) stimulus program. throughout the crisis we have taken steps to improve the risk profile of our portfolio by selling certain holdings throughout europe, including the periphery countries.
the primary factor considered when determining the domicile of investment exposure is the legal domicile of the issuer. however, other factors such as the location of the parent guarantor, the location of the company's headquarters or major business operations (including location of major assets), location of primary market (including location of revenue generation) and specific country risk publicly recognized by rating agencies can influence the assignment of the country (or geographic) risk location. when the issuer is a special financing vehicle or a branch or subsidiary of a global company, then we consider any guarantees and/or legal, regulatory and corporate relationships of the issuer relative to its ultimate parent in determining the proper assignment of country risk.
european sovereign debt crisis - monitoring and mitigating exposure during most of 2011, we saw the european sovereign crisis persist and escalate. during the crisis in 2011 and 2012, we undertook a derisking program to reduce significant concentrations within our investment portfolio, most notably perpetual securities issued by financial institutions and instruments issued by other peripheral eurozone issuers. we remain diligent in monitoring our portfolio and continually evaluate opportunities to manage risk within our portfolio.
our internal team of experienced credit professionals has continued to monitor the impact of the crisis on our individual investment holdings' overall credit quality. our analysis includes factors beyond a baseline assessment of a company's assets, operations, financial statements, and credit metrics that may provide support for the instruments we own. specifically, for our investments in european banks and financial institutions, we monitor the importance of the issuer to its local financial system, the likelihood of government support, and our investment's position in the capital structure of the issuer. for our investments in european utilities, we monitor the role of the issuer in its local economy as a provider of necessary infrastructure, and we monitor the value of the underlying assets owned by the issuer. for our investment in european corporates, industrials, and other commercial entities, we monitor the general credit quality of the issuer, the geographical mix of the issuer's customers (i.e. domestic vs. foreign), the geographical breakdown of the issuer's assets (i.e. domestic versus foreign), the value of the underlying assets owned by the issuer, capitalization of the issuer, and overall profitability and cash generation ability of the issuer. we monitor nrsro actions and the likely actions for our investment exposures, as well as overall market conditions. by performing these analyses, we make a determination on the probability of timely payment of principal and interest of the issuers of our investments.
some of our peripheral eurozone fixed income investments contain covenants that we believe mitigate our risk to the issuer. these covenants could include put options that allow us to return our holdings to the issuer at a predetermined price, usually par, should the issuer be downgraded to below investment grade by a rating agency, plus restrictions on the ability to incur additional debt, sell assets, or provide collateral for indebtedness. as of december 31, 2014, all of the issuers of our holdings from peripheral eurozone countries were current on their obligations to us, and we believe they have the ability to meet their obligations to us.
apart from our direct investments in peripheral eurozone sovereign debt totaling $262 million, our other exposures as of december 31, 2014 to the european sovereign debt crisis were investments in peripheral eurozone banks and financial institutions of $491 million, peripheral eurozone non-banks (excluding sovereigns) of $2.2 billion, core eurozone1 banks and financial institutions of $2.0 billion, core eurozone non-banks (excluding sovereigns) of $4.2 billion, core eurozone sovereigns of $486 million, and non-eurozone2 holdings throughout the balance of europe of $5.7 billion, all at amortized cost. other investment risks stemming from the european sovereign debt crisis that are not possible to measure include the impact of slower economic activity throughout europe and its impact on global economic growth and market disruption including illiquidity and impaired valuations due to heightened concerns and lack of investor confidence.
1core eurozone includes germany, france, netherlands, austria, belgium and finland.
2non-eurozone europe includes the united kingdom, switzerland, sweden, norway, denmark, czech republic and poland.

although by most measures the crisis in europe has stabilized and is showing signs of improvement, we continue to monitor the situation closely. among the areas that we believe warrant continued attention include the heightened interrelationship between political, monetary, fiscal, and economic forces; the pace of underlying structural reforms; the possibility of continued contagion to additional sovereigns and other entities; further stress on the banking systems throughout the region; and the impact on the underlying economic fundamentals throughout the eurozone.
securities by type of issuance we have investments in both publicly and privately issued securities. our ability to sell either type of security is a function of overall market liquidity which is impacted by, among other things, the amount of outstanding securities of a particular issuer or issuance, trading history of the issue or issuer, overall market conditions, and idiosyncratic events affecting the specific issue or issuer.

(1)principal payments in yen and interest payments in dollars aflac japan has invested in privately issued securities to better match liability characteristics and secure higher yields than those available on japanese government or other public corporate bonds. aflac japan's investments in yen-denominated privately issued securities consist primarily of non-japanese issuers and have longer maturities, thereby allowing us to improve our asset/liability matching and our overall investment returns. most of our privately issued

securities were issued under medium-term note programs and have standard documentation commensurate with credit ratings of the issuer, except when internal credit analysis indicates that additional protective and/or event-risk covenants were required.
below-investment-grade and split-rated securities we use specific criteria to judge the credit quality of both existing and prospective investments. the ratings referenced in the tables below are based on the ratings designations provided by the major credit rating agencies (moody's, s&p, and fitch) or, if not rated, are determined based on our internal credit analysis of such securities. when the ratings issued by the rating agencies differ, we utilize the second lowest rating, regardless of how many of the three rating agencies actually rated the instrument. split-rated securities are those where the ratings are not equivalent and one or more of the ratings is investment grade and one or more is below investment grade. for these split-rated securities, if there are only two ratings assigned by the credit rating agencies, we take the lower below-investment-grade rating. if there are three ratings assigned, and two of the three are below investment grade, we consider it a below-investment-grade security. if there are three ratings and two are investment grade, we consider it an investment grade security unless our evaluation and assessment shows a below-investment-grade rating is warranted despite two of the three rating agencies rating it investment grade.
the below-investment-grade securities shown in the following table at december 31 were investment grade at the time of purchase and were subsequently downgraded using the above described methodology.

(1) includes perpetual security we invest in senior secured bank loans to u.s. and canadian corporate borrowers, most of which have below-investment-grade ratings. the program is managed externally by third party firms specializing in this asset class. this mandate requires a minimum average credit quality of bb-/ba3, prohibits loans rated below b/b2, and prohibits exposure to any individual credit greater than 3% of the program's assets. the objectives of this program include enhancing the yield on invested assets, achieving further diversification of credit risk, and mitigating the risk of rising interest rates through the acquisition of floating rate assets. our investments in this program totaled $501 million at december 31, 2014, compared with $451 million at december 31, 2013, on an amortized cost basis.
excluding the senior secured bank loans discussed above that were rated below investment grade when initially purchased, below-investment-grade debt and perpetual securities represented 3.4% of total debt and perpetual securities at december 31, 2014, compared with 3.7% at december 31, 2013, on an amortized cost basis. debt and perpetual securities classified as below investment grade at december 31, 2014 and 2013 were generally reported as available for sale and carried at fair value.
split-rated securities, excluding the senior secured bank loan investments discussed above, totaled $2.2 billion as of december 31, 2014, compared with $2.7 billion as of december 31, 2013, and represented 2.3% of total debt and perpetual securities, at amortized cost, at december 31, 2014, compared with 2.6% at december 31, 2013.
for the interest rate, foreign currency, and credit default swaps associated with our vie investments for which we are the primary beneficiary, we bear the risk of foreign exchange, interest rate, and/or credit loss due to counterparty default even though we are not a direct counterparty to those contracts. we are a direct counterparty to the foreign currency swaps that we have on certain of our senior notes and subordinated debentures; foreign currency forwards; foreign currency options; and interest rate swaptions, therefore we are exposed to credit risk in the event of nonperformance by the counterparties in those contracts. the risk of counterparty default for our vie swaps, senior note and subordinated debenture swaps, foreign currency forwards and options, and swaptions is mitigated by collateral posting requirements the counterparty must meet. if collateral posting agreements are not in place, the counterparty risk associated with foreign currency forwards and foreign currency options is the risk that at expiry of the contract, the counterparty is unable to deliver the agreed upon amount of yen at the agreed upon price or delivery date, thus exposing the company to additional unhedged exposure to u.s. dollars in the aflac japan investment portfolio. see note 4 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for more information.

(1)includes perpetual security the declines in the fair values noted above were a result of changes in interest rates, movement in the yen/dollar exchange rate, and/or changes in credit spreads driven by the issuer's underlying credit quality. as we believe these issuers have the ability to continue making timely payments of principal and interest, we view these changes in fair value to be temporary and do not believe it is necessary to impair the carrying value of these securities. see the unrealized investment gains and losses section in note 3 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for further discussions of unrealized losses related to financial institutions, including perpetual securities, and other corporate investments.
investment valuation and cash we estimate the fair values of our securities on a monthly basis. we monitor the estimated fair values obtained from our custodian, pricing vendors and brokers for consistency from month to month, while considering current market conditions. we also periodically discuss with our custodian and pricing brokers and vendors the pricing techniques they use to monitor the consistency of their approach and periodically assess the appropriateness of the valuation level assigned to the values obtained from them. if a fair value appears unreasonable, we will re-examine the inputs and assess the reasonableness of the pricing data with the vendor. additionally, we may compare the inputs to relevant market indices and other performance measurements. the output of this analysis is presented to the company's valuation and classifications subcommittee, or vcs. based on the analysis provided to the vcs, the valuation is confirmed or may be revised if there is evidence of a more appropriate estimate of fair value based on available market data. we have performed verification of the inputs and calculations in any valuation models to confirm that the valuations represent reasonable estimates of fair value.
cash and cash equivalents totaled $4.7 billion, or 4.3% of total investments and cash, as of december 31, 2014, compared with $2.5 billion, or 2.3%, at december 31, 2013. for a discussion of the factors affecting our cash balance, see the operating activities, investing activities and financing activities subsections of this md&a.

see note 7 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on our policy liabilities.
notes payable notes payable totaled $5.3 billion at december 31, 2014, compared with $4.9 billion at december 31, 2013. in november 2014, the parent company issued senior notes totaling $750 million through a u.s. public debt offering. we entered into cross-currency interest rate swaps to economically convert the dollar-denominated principal and interest on the senior notes into yen-denominated obligations. we intend to use the net proceeds of the issuance for general corporate purposes, including capital contributions to subsidiaries, if needed. in july 2014, we redeemed 28.7 billion yen of our fixed rate samurai notes and 5.5 billion yen of our variable rate samurai notes upon their maturity (a total of approximately $335 million using the exchange rate on the date of redemption). see note 9 of the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on our notes payable.
benefit plans aflac japan and aflac u.s. have various benefit plans. for additional information on our japanese and u.s. plans, see note 14 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements.
policyholder protection the japanese insurance industry has a policyholder protection system that provides funds for the policyholders of insolvent insurers. legislation enacted regarding the framework of the life insurance policyholder protection corporation (lippc) included government fiscal measures supporting the lippc. on december 27, 2011, japan's fsa announced the plans to enhance the stability of the lippc by extending the government's fiscal support of the lippc through march 2017. accordingly, the fsa submitted legislation to the diet on january 27, 2012 to extend the government's fiscal support framework, and the legislation was approved on march 30, 2012. effective april 2014, the annual lippc contribution amount for the total life industry was lowered from 40 billion yen to 33 billion yen.
hedging activities net investment hedge our primary exposure to be hedged is our investment in aflac japan, which is affected by changes in the yen/dollar exchange rate. to mitigate this exposure, we have taken the following courses of action. first, aflac japan maintains certain unhedged dollar-denominated securities, which serve as an economic currency hedge of a portion of our investment in aflac japan. second, we have designated the majority of the parent company's yen-denominated liabilities (samurai and uridashi notes and yen-denominated loans) as non-derivative hedging instruments and certain foreign currency forwards and options as derivative hedges of our net investment in aflac japan. we make our net investment hedge designation at the beginning of each quarter. if the total of the designated parent company non-derivative and derivatives notional is equal to or less than our net investment in aflac japan, the hedge is deemed to be effective, and the exchange effect on the yen-denominated liabilities and the change in estimated fair value of the derivatives are reported in the unrealized foreign currency component of other comprehensive income. we estimate that if the designated net investment hedge positions exceeded our net investment in aflac japan by 10 billion yen, we would report a foreign exchange gain/loss of approximately $1 million for every 1% yen weakening/strengthening in the end-of-period yen/dollar exchange rate. our net investment hedge was effective during the years ended december 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012.

the yen net asset figure calculated for hedging purposes differs from the yen-denominated net asset position as discussed in the currency risk subsection of md&a. as disclosed in that subsection, the consolidation of the underlying assets in certain vies requires that we derecognize our yen-denominated investment in the vie and recognize the underlying fixed-maturity or perpetual securities and cross-currency swaps. while these u.s. dollar investments will create foreign currency fluctuations, the combination of the u.s. dollar-denominated investment and the cross-currency swap economically creates a yen-denominated investment that qualifies for inclusion as a component of our investment in aflac japan. similarly, the combination of the u.s. corporate bonds and the foreign currency forwards that we have entered into, as discussed in the aflac japan investment subsection of md&a, economically creates a yen-denominated investment that qualifies for inclusion as a component of our net investment in aflac japan.
the dollar values of our yen-denominated net assets, including economic yen-denominated investments for net investment hedging purposes as discussed above, are summarized as follows (translated at end-of-period exchange rates) for the years ended december 31:
(in millions)                                           2014                  2013
aflac japan net assets                                       $14,665                  $12,315
aflac japan unhedged dollar-denominated net assets            (8,672   )               (7,621   )
consolidated yen-denominated net assets (liabilities)         $5,993                   $4,694
for the hedge of our net investment in aflac japan, we have designated certain of the parent company's yen-denominated liabilities, certain unhedged u.s. dollar investments and foreign currency forwards and options as a hedge of our net investment in aflac japan. our consolidated yen-denominated net asset position was partially hedged at $1.6 billion as of december 31, 2014 and partially hedged at $1.1 billion as of december 31, 2013.
cash flow hedges we had freestanding derivative instruments related to our consolidated vie investments that are reported in the consolidated balance sheet at fair value within other assets and other liabilities. as of december 31, 2014, two of the freestanding swaps that are used within vies to hedge the risk arising from changes in foreign currency exchange rates qualified for hedge accounting.
we had an interest rate swap agreement related to the 5.5 billion yen variable interest rate samurai notes that we issued in july 2011 and redeemed in july 2014. by entering into this contract, we swapped the variable interest rate to a fixed interest rate of 1.475%. we had designated this interest rate swap as a hedge of the variability in our interest cash flows associated with the variable interest rate samurai notes. this hedge was effective during the years ended december 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively.
fair value hedges we have entered into foreign currency forwards and options to mitigate the foreign exchange risk associated with new investments in u.s. dollar-denominated fixed-maturities that support yen-denominated liabilities within our aflac japan segment.
we have entered into interest rate swaptions to mitigate the interest rate risk associated with our u.s. dollar-denominated fixed-maturities that support yen-denominated liabilities within our aflac japan segment.
see note 4 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on our hedging activities.
off-balance sheet arrangements as of december 31, 2014, we had no material letters of credit, standby letters of credit, guarantees or standby repurchase obligations. see note 15 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for information on material unconditional purchase obligations that are not recorded on our balance sheet.

capital resources and liquidity aflac provides the primary sources of liquidity to the parent company through dividends and management fees. the following table presents the amounts provided for the years ended december 31.

the primary uses of cash by the parent company are shareholder dividends, the repurchase of its common stock and interest on its outstanding indebtedness. the parent company's sources and uses of cash are reasonably predictable and are not expected to change materially in the future. for additional information, see the financing activities subsection of this md&a.
the parent company also accesses debt security markets to provide additional sources of capital. we filed a shelf registration statement with the sec in may 2012 that allows us to issue an indefinite amount of senior and subordinated debt, in one or more series, from time to time until may 2015. in march 2014, we filed a shelf registration statement with japanese regulatory authorities that allows us to issue up to 100 billion yen of yen-denominated samurai notes in japan through march 2016. if issued, these yen-denominated samurai notes would not be available to u.s. persons. we believe outside sources for additional debt and equity capital, if needed, will continue to be available. for additional information, see note 9 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements.
the principal sources of cash for our insurance operations are premiums and investment income. the primary uses of cash by our insurance operations are investments, policy claims, commissions, operating expenses, income taxes and payments to the parent company for management fees and dividends. both the sources and uses of cash are reasonably predictable.
when making an investment decision, our first consideration is based on product needs. our investment objectives provide for liquidity through the purchase of investment-grade debt securities. these objectives also take into account duration matching, and because of the long-term nature of our business, we have adequate time to react to changing cash flow needs.
as a result of policyholder aging, claims payments are expected to gradually increase over the life of a policy. therefore, future policy benefit reserves are accumulated in the early years of a policy and are designed to help fund future claims payments. we expect our future cash flows from premiums and our investment portfolio to be sufficient to meet our cash needs for benefits and expenses.
in october 2014, the parent company and aflac entered into a 364-day uncommitted bilateral line of credit that provides for borrowings in the amount of $100 million. borrowings will bear interest at the rate quoted by the bank and agreed upon at the time of making such loan and will have a three-month maturity period. there are no related facility fees, upfront expenses or financial covenant requirements. borrowings under this credit agreement may be used for general corporate purposes. as of december 31, 2014, we did not have any borrowings outstanding under our $100 million credit agreement. borrowings under the financing agreement will mature no later than three months after the last drawdown date of october 15, 2015.
the parent company and aflac have a senior unsecured revolving credit facility agreement with a syndicate of financial institutions in the amount of 50 billion yen. this credit agreement provides for borrowings in japanese yen or the equivalent of japanese yen in u.s. dollars on a revolving basis. borrowings will bear interest at libor plus the applicable margin of 1.125%. in addition, the parent company and aflac are required to pay a facility fee of .125% on the commitments. borrowings under the credit agreement may be used for general corporate purposes, including a capital contingency plan for our japanese operations. borrowings under the financing agreement mature at the termination date of the credit agreement. the agreement requires compliance with certain financial covenants on a quarterly basis. this credit agreement will expire on the earlier of march 29, 2018, or the date of termination of the commitments upon an event of default as defined in the agreement. as of december 31, 2014, we did not have any borrowings outstanding under our 50 billion yen revolving credit agreement.

our financial statements convey our financing arrangements during the periods presented. we have not engaged in material intra-period short-term financings during the periods presented that are not otherwise reported in our balance sheet. we were in compliance with all of the covenants of our notes payable and lines of credit at december 31, 2014. we have not entered into transactions involving the transfer of financial assets with an obligation to repurchase financial assets that have been accounted for as a sale under applicable accounting standards, including securities lending transactions. see notes 1, 3, and 4 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for more information on our securities lending and derivative activities. with the exception of disclosed activities in those referenced footnotes, we do not have a known trend, demand, commitment, event or uncertainty that would reasonably result in our liquidity increasing or decreasing by a material amount. our cash and cash equivalents include unrestricted cash on hand, money market instruments, and other debt instruments with a maturity of 90 days or less when purchased, all of which has minimal market, settlement or other risk exposure.
the following table presents the estimated payments by period of our major contractual obligations as of december 31, 2014. we translated our yen-denominated obligations using the december 31, 2014, exchange rate. actual future payments as reported in dollars will fluctuate with changes in the yen/dollar exchange rate.

liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits in the amount of $15 have been excluded from the tabular disclosure above because the timing of cash payment is not reasonably estimable.
(1)liability amounts are those reported on the consolidated balance sheet as of december 31, 2014.
(2)the estimated payments due by period reflect future estimated cash payments to be made to policyholders and others for future policy benefits. these projected cash outflows are based on assumptions for future policy persistency, mortality, morbidity, and other assumptions comparable with our experience, consider future premium receipts on current policies in force, and assume market growth and interest crediting consistent with assumptions used in amortizing deferred acquisition costs. these cash outflows are undiscounted with respect to interest and, as a result, the sum of the cash outflows shown for all years in the table of $237,568 exceeds the corresponding liability amount of $65,646. we have made significant assumptions to determine the future estimated cash outflows related to the underlying policies and contracts. due to the significance of the assumptions used, actual cash outflow amounts and timing will differ, possibly materially, from these estimates.
(3)includes assumptions as to the timing of policyholders reporting claims for prior periods and the amount of those claims. actual amounts and timing of unpaid policy claims payments may differ significantly from the estimates above.
(4)not applicable for more information on our major contractual obligations, see the applicable note in the notes to the consolidated financial statements as indicated in the line items in the table above.
consolidated cash flows we translate cash flows for aflac japan's yen-denominated items into u.s. dollars using weighted-average exchange rates. in years when the yen weakens, translating yen into dollars causes fewer dollars to be reported. when the yen strengthens, translating yen into dollars causes more dollars to be reported.

the decrease in aflac japan operating cash flows during 2014 and 2013 was largely due to a decline in the sales of the ways product which resulted in a reduced amount of cash received from discounted advance premiums.

prudent portfolio management dictates that we attempt to match the duration of our assets with the duration of our liabilities. currently, when our fixed-maturity securities and perpetual securities mature, the proceeds may be reinvested at a yield below that required for the accretion of policy benefit liabilities on policies issued in earlier years. however, the long-term nature of our business and our strong cash flows provide us with the ability to minimize the effect of mismatched durations and/or yields identified by various asset adequacy analyses. when needed or when market opportunities arise, we dispose of selected fixed-maturity and perpetual securities that are available for sale to improve the duration matching of our assets and liabilities, improve future investment yields, and/or re-balance our portfolio. as a result, dispositions before maturity can vary significantly from year to year. dispositions before maturity were approximately 6% of the annual average investment portfolio of fixed maturities and perpetual securities available for sale during the year ended december 31, 2014, compared with 16% in 2013 and 15% in 2012. in october 2014, we sold a total of $1.4 billion of u.s. treasuries, which we had purchased earlier that year for aflac japan. in december 2014, we sold $1.0 billion of additional u.s. dollar-denominated assets held by aflac japan. the proceeds of these sales will be reinvested in other assets, consistent with our normal portfolio management and asset allocation process.
financing activities consolidated cash used by financing activities was $147 million in 2014, compared with cash provided by financing activities of $1.1 billion in 2013 and $1.9 billion in 2012.
in november 2014, the parent company issued $750 million of senior notes through a u.s. public debt offering. the company intends to use the net proceeds of the issuance for general corporate purposes, including capital contributions to subsidiaries, if needed. in july 2014, we redeemed 28.7 billion yen of our fixed rate samauri notes and 5.5 billion yen of our variable rate samurai notes upon their maturity (a total of approximately $335 million using the exchange rate on the date of redemption).

in june 2013, the parent company issued $700 million of senior notes through a u.s. public debt offering. we used part of these net proceeds for the debt redemptions in 2014. the balance of the net proceeds will be used to repay, redeem or repurchase, in whole or in part, the parent company's $300 million senior notes due august 2015 and general corporate purposes, including capital contributions to subsidiaries, if needed.
in february 2012, the parent company issued $750 million of senior notes through a u.s. public debt offering. in june 2012, we paid $337 million to redeem 26.6 billion yen of samurai notes using proceeds from the february debt offering. in july 2012, the parent company issued $250 million of senior notes through a u.s. public debt offering. in september 2012, the parent company issued $450 million of subordinated debentures through a u.s. public debt offering, and in october 2012, the underwriters exercised their option, pursuant to the underwriting agreement, to purchase an additional $50 million principal amount of these subordinated debentures.
see note 9 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for further information on the debt issuances discussed above.
cash returned to shareholders through dividends and treasury stock purchases was $1.9 billion in 2014, compared with $1.4 billion in 2013 and $721 million in 2012.
see our preceding discussion in this capital resources and liquidity section of md&a regarding the five-year senior unsecured revolving credit facility agreement entered into by the parent company and aflac in march 2013 in the amount of 50 billion yen and the 364-day uncommitted bilateral line of credit entered into by the parent company and aflac in october 2014 in the amount of $100 million. as of december 31, 2014, no borrowings were outstanding under our 50 billion yen revolving credit agreement or our $100 million 364-day uncommitted bilateral line of credit.
we were in compliance with all of the covenants of our notes payable and lines of credit at december 31, 2014.

regulatory restrictions aflac is domiciled in nebraska and is subject to its regulations. the nebraska department of insurance imposes certain limitations and restrictions on payments of dividends, management fees, loans and advances by aflac to the parent company. the nebraska department of insurance statutes require prior approval for dividend distributions that exceed the greater of the net income from operations, which excludes net realized investment gains, for the previous year determined under statutory accounting principles, or 10% of statutory capital and surplus as of the previous year-end. in addition, the nebraska insurance department must approve service arrangements and other transactions within the affiliated group of companies. these regulatory limitations are not expected to affect the level of management fees or dividends paid by aflac to the parent company. a life insurance company's statutory capital and surplus is determined according to rules prescribed by the naic, as modified by the insurance department in the insurance company's state of domicile. statutory accounting rules are different from gaap and are intended to emphasize policyholder protection and company solvency. similar laws apply in new york and south carolina, the domiciliary jurisdictions of the parent company's other insurance subsidiaries, aflac new york and caic.
the continued long-term growth of our business may require increases in the statutory capital and surplus of our insurance operations. aflac's insurance operations may secure additional statutory capital through various sources, such as internally generated statutory earnings or equity contributions by the parent company from funds generated through debt or equity offerings. the naic's risk-based capital (rbc) formula is used by insurance regulators to help identify inadequately capitalized insurance companies. the rbc formula quantifies insurance risk, business risk, asset risk and interest rate risk by weighing the types and mixtures of risks inherent in the insurer's operations. aflac's company action level rbc ratio was 945% as of december 31, 2014. aflac's rbc ratio remains high and reflects a strong capital and surplus position. as of december 31, 2014, aflac's total adjusted capital of $11.2 billion exceeded the company action level required capital and surplus of $1.2 billion by $10.0 billion. the maximum amount of dividends that can be paid to the parent company by aflac without prior approval of nebraska's director of insurance is the greater of the net income from operations, which excludes net realized investment gains, for the previous year determined under statutory accounting principles, or 10% of statutory capital and surplus as of the previous year-end. dividends declared by aflac during 2015 in excess of $2.4 billion would require such approval. see note 13 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for information regarding the impact of permitted practices by the nebraska department of insurance on our statutory capital and surplus. the naic considers its solvency modernization initiative (smi) process relating to updating the u.s. insurance solvency regulation framework to be ongoing. the smi has focused on key issues such as capital requirements, governance and risk management, group supervision, reinsurance, statutory accounting and financial reporting matters. many of these key issues have been finalized and/or are near completion; however, the naic still has some ongoing initiatives related to smi, such as monitoring the international efforts on group capital requirements and group supervision.
in addition to limitations and restrictions imposed by u.s. insurance regulators, japan's fsa may not allow profit repatriations from aflac japan if the transfers would cause aflac japan to lack sufficient financial strength for the protection of policyholders. the fsa maintains its own solvency standard which is quantified through the solvency margin ratio (smr). aflac japan's smr is sensitive to interest rate and foreign exchange rate changes, therefore we continue to evaluate alternatives for reducing this sensitivity. in the event of a rapid change in interest rates, we have a senior unsecured revolving credit facility in the amount of 50 billion yen as a capital contingency plan. we have already undertaken various measures to mitigate the sensitivity of aflac japan's smr. for example, we employ policy reserve matching (prm) investment strategies, which is a japan-specific accounting treatment that reduces smr interest rate sensitivity since prm-designated investments are carried at amortized cost consistent with corresponding liabilities. for u.s. gaap, prm investments are categorized as available-for-sale. we also have interest rate swaptions to mitigate increases in u.s. interest rates and the related impact to the available-for-sale investment portfolio in japan. in the fourth quarter of 2014, aflac japan entered into an additional quota share arrangement to cede a portion of hospital benefits of one of our closed products. under this coinsurance indemnity type of reinsurance, aflac japan released approximately 55 billion yen of fsa reserves. (see notes 3, 4 and 8 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional
76
information on our investment strategies, hedging activities, and reinsurance, respectively.) as of december 31, 2014, aflac japan's smr had increased to 857%, compared with 777% at december 31, 2013.
aflac is subject to the naic's own risk and solvency assessment (orsa), effective january 1, 2015. through the orsa requirements, aflac is expected to regularly, no less than annually, conduct an orsa to assess the adequacy of its risk management framework, and its current and estimated projected future solvency position; internally document the process and results of the assessment; and provide a confidential high-level orsa summary report annually to the lead state commissioner if the insurer is a member of an insurance group. aflac has developed a roadmap of key decisions, activities, and enhancements that will allow us to deliver an orsa summary report ready for regulatory submission by the end of 2015.
payments are made from aflac japan to the parent company for management fees and to aflac u.s. for allocated expenses and remittances of earnings. the following table details aflac japan remittances for the years ended december 31.

(1)includes u.s. dollar-denominated securities which were $209 million at amortized cost and had accrued interest of $4 million (totaling approximately 16.8 billion yen) as of the remittance date in the fourth quarter of 2014, we began to increase the frequency of capital transfers from japan to the united states to better manage cash flow. this capital repatriation is reflected in aflac japan's smr as of december 31, 2014.
we had entered into foreign exchange forwards and options as part of an economic hedge on foreign exchange risk on 52.5 billion yen of profit repatriation received in july 2014 and 50.0 billion yen of repatriation received in december 2014, resulting in $7 million and $45 million of additional funds received, respectively, when the yen was exchanged into dollars.

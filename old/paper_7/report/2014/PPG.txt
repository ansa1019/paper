item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations strategic transformation during 2014 and 2013, ppg has completed several steps in its strategic transformation into a more focused coatings and specialty materials company.
in november 2014, ppg completed the acquisition of comex, an architectural coatings company headquartered in mexico city, mexico. comex manufactures coatings and related products in mexico and sells them in mexico and central america principally through approximately 3,700 stores that are independently owned and operated by more than 700 concessionaires.
in march 2014, ppg completed the sale of its 51% ownership interest in its transitions optical joint venture and 100% of its optical sunlens business to essilor.
in april 2013, ppg completed the acquisition of the north american architectural coatings business of akzo nobel n.v. the acquisition included the purchase of a number of leading brands and 526 paint stores, net of redundant store closures, in the u.s., canada and the caribbean.
in january 2013, ppg completed the separation of its commodity chemicals business and the merger of the subsidiary holding the ppg commodity chemicals business with a subsidiary of georgia gulf corporation ("georgia gulf").
refer to note 2, "acquisitions and dispositions" under item 8 of this form 10-k for financial information relating to these transactions.
18 2014 ppg annual report and form 10-k performance in 2014 compared with 2013
performance overview net sales increased $1.1 billion, or 8%, from the prior year to $15,360 million primarily due to sales from acquired businesses (4%), higher sales volumes (3%) and higher selling prices (1%). acquired businesses added about $600 million of sales in 2014, primarily due to the first quarter 2014 sales of the acquired akzo nobel north american architectural coatings business which closed in april 2013, as well as two months of sales of the acquired comex business which closed in early november 2014. additionally, the company completed several other smaller acquisitions in 2014 and 2013, for which partial year impacts are included in the 2014 results. year-over-year sales volumes, excluding acquisition-related impacts, were fairly consistent across all regions advancing 3.5% overall. the sales growth was led by a 4.3% improvement in the u.s. and canada, with growth rates generally uniform each quarter of the year. asia-pacific sales also grew 3.9%, and latin america sales grew 3.5% year-over-year. sales for the europe, middle-east and africa region grew 2.4%, with growth primarily occurring in the first half of the year. pricing advanced slightly in aggregate, with a focus on offsetting cost inflation.
cost of sales, exclusive of depreciation and amortization, increased $477 million, or 6%, from the prior year to $8,791 million primarily due to higher sales volumes and the inclusion of cost of sales from acquired businesses partially offset by lower manufacturing costs and the impact of foreign currency translation. cost of sales as a percentage of sales improved 1% to 57% in 2014 compared to 58% in 2013.
selling, general and administrative expenses increased $272 million, or 8%, from the prior year to $3,758 million, primarily due to the inclusion of acquired businesses and overhead cost inflation. selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales was 24.5% in 2014 and 24.4% in 2013.
in 2013, the company recorded a pre-tax restructuring charge of $98 million related to a restructuring plan focused on achieving cost synergies through improved productivity and efficiencies. the restructuring plan primarily related to the acquired akzo nobel north american architectural coatings business, but also included smaller targeted actions for ppg's legacy architectural business, as well as other businesses where market conditions remain very challenging, most notably protective and marine coatings and certain european businesses such as architectural coatings and fiber glass.
in the fourth quarter 2014, the company recorded a pre-tax charge of $317 million representing costs related to a debt refinancing undertaken to lower the company's future interest costs. the charge consists of an aggregate make-whole cash premium of $179 million for the redemption of public notes, an aggregate cash premium of $43 million for debt redeemed through a tender offer, a realization of net unamortized losses of $89 million on interest rate swaps and forward starting swaps, and a balance of unamortized fees and discounts of $6 million related to the debt redeemed. refer to note 8, "borrowings and lines of credit" in item 8 of this form 10-k for additional information.
other charges increased $32 million from the prior year to $221 million primarily due to higher legacy environmental remediation charges. the company recorded pre-tax environmental charges for the environmental remediation at a former chromium manufacturing plant and associated sites in new jersey of $136 million and $89 million in 2014 and 2013, respectively.
other income increased $133 million from the prior year to $260 million due primarily to gains realized on the sales of assets by an equity affiliate and our flat glass business.
the effective tax rate on income before income taxes was 18.3% and 20.6% in 2014 and 2013, respectively. the company's adjusted effective tax rate on income before income taxes, excluding certain nonrecurring charges was 23.9% in 2014 and 23.1% in 2013. see the regulation g reconciliation below for details of ppg's adjusted effective tax rate from continuing operations.
diluted earnings-per-share for the year ended december 31, 2014 were $15.03, comprised of net income from continuing operations of $8.10 and discontinued operations, net of tax of $6.93. these diluted earnings per share from continuing operations compare to $6.55 in the year ended december 31, 2013. operationally, each reporting segment delivered earnings growth of at least 15%. the company benefited from the 5.7 million shares of stock repurchased in 2013 as well as the 3.8 million shares of stock repurchased during 2014. the diluted earnings per share from discontinued operations relates to the transitions optical joint venture and sunlens business which were sold in march of 2014.
regulation g reconciliation - results from operations ppg industries believes investors' understanding of the company's operating performance is enhanced by the disclosure of income before income taxes, ppg's effective tax rate, tax expense, net income from continuing operations and earnings per diluted share adjusted for nonrecurring charges. ppg's management considers this information useful in providing insight into the company's ongoing operating performance because it excludes the impact of items that cannot reasonably be expected to recur on an ongoing basis. income before income taxes, the effective tax rate, tax expense, net income from continuing operations and earnings per diluted share adjusted for these items are not recognized financial measures determined in accordance with u.s. generally accepted accounting principles ("gaap") and should not be considered a substitute for income before income taxes, the effective tax rate, tax expense, net income from continuing operations or earnings per diluted share or other financial measures as computed in accordance with u.s. gaap. in addition, adjusted income before income taxes, adjusted effective tax rate, adjusted tax expense, adjusted net income from continuing operations and adjusted earnings per diluted share from continuing operations may not be comparable to similarly titled measures as reported by other companies.

performance of reportable business segments performance coatings performance coatings net sales increased $764 million, or approximately 10% from 2013, to $8,698 million primarily due to net sales from acquisitions, including the akzo nobel north american architectural coatings acquisition and comex, partially offset by unfavorable currency translation. acquisitions contributed an 8% increase in net sales for the year. prices increased modestly, and segment volumes, excluding acquisitions, advanced nearly 2% across all major regions.
architectural coatings-emea sales volumes improved by low-single digit percentages year-over-year aided by partial demand recovery in some regions and in comparison to strengthening prior year levels. sales volume improvement occurred early in the year, aided by favorable weather conditions,
20 2014 ppg annual report and form 10-k which was partially offset by lower year-over-year sales volumes late in the year.
the protective and marine coatings business experienced modest sales improvement, driven primarily by sales volume increases in the north american and european protective markets. marine new-build sales volumes were negative early in the year, but positive late in the year.
the aerospace and automotive refinish businesses both delivered slightly higher sales volumes year-over-year in each major region. demand trends in the overall aerospace industry continued to remain favorable globally. refinish growth was supported by higher emerging region activity and solid growth in the developed regions, including benefits from the expansion of the vehicle parc in asia, higher north american demand and a partial demand recovery in europe. excluding the impacts of acquisitions and currency, architectural coatings, america and asia pacific, net sales were up modestly year over year.
segment income increased $162 million, or 16% from the prior year, to $1,205 million primarily due to the increase in net sales and acquisitions, including the further realization of cost synergies, partially offset by cost inflation.
in the first quarter of 2015, moderate north american architectural coatings market demand growth is expected to continue, including growth in both residential and non-residential end use-markets. the company will be making growth-related investments during 2015 in certain architectural coatings distribution channels in the region. this includes additional sales and marketing efforts and the addition of new company-owned store locations. the protective and marine business is expected to deliver year-over-year sales volume growth in the first quarter of 2015 due to improving asian marine new build end-use market demand.
looking forward for the segment, the comex acquisition is expected to add between $180 to $200 million of sales in the first quarter 2015. additionally, based on current exchange rates, we expect foreign currency translation to be unfavorable in sequential and year-over-year sales and earnings comparisons.
industrial coatings industrial coatings segment net sales increased $288 million, or 6% from the prior year, to $5,552 million primarily due to sales volume growth of 6%. ppg's global automotive oem business grew net sales by high single-digit percentages year-over-year, and continued a multi-quarter trend of outperforming global industry growth. ppg continues to benefit from the adoption of new technologies and ongoing focus on customer service and customer process improvement initiatives. growth accelerated in the industrial coatings business, aided by continued north american and emerging region strength, and european demand remained positive year-over-year. packaging coatings year-over-year net sales were lower, reflecting continued weakness in europe. specialty coatings and materials net sales grew year-over-year aided by higher sales volumes in oled materials, optical materials, precipitated silicas and teslin®.
segment income increased $127 million, or 15% from the year ended december 31, 2013, to $951 million primarily due to the benefit from sales volume growth and improved manufacturing costs as a result of our continued focus on increased productivity and efficiency.
the industrial coatings segment is our most geographically diverse segment and currency translation is expected to negatively impact year-over-year financial results in the first quarter of 2015. on a sequential quarter basis, we expect that higher sales seasonally will be partly offset by unfavorable currency translation as current rates are below fourth quarter average conversion rates for many currencies. recent global industrial production trends are expected to continue, resulting in generally consistent demand growth for ppg products.
glass glass net sales increased $43 million, or 4% compared to the prior year, to $1,110 million primarily due to higher pricing and sales volumes in flat glass and higher sales volumes in fiber glass. sales volumes in flat glass reflect improvements in residential and non-residential end-use market demand, partly offset by unfavorable currency translation, primarily the canadian dollar.
segment income increased $25 million from 2013, to $81 million as the benefit of manufacturing cost improvements and the impact of improved sales were partially offset by higher costs stemming from scheduled maintenance projects. higher natural gas-based energy costs early in the year were also a negative factor although this impact declined later in the year.
looking ahead, overall demand growth is expected to continue in flat glass, as is the favorable value-added product mix. mixed global fiber glass demand trends are expected to continue. unfavorable currency translation is also expected sequentially and year-over-year, although the majority of the segment sales are u.s. dollar denominated.
the segment will incur higher pension and other post-employment benefits ("opeb") expense in 2015 versus 2014 stemming from revised mortality assumptions and a lower year-end discount rate. however, year-over-year earnings comparisons will benefit from the absence of first quarter 2014 costs associated with significant plant maintenance projects.
review and outlook during 2014, overall economic conditions remained mixed among the major global economies, with the pace of economic activity in each region fairly constant throughout the year. demand was also varied by major coatings end-use market; however, we realized global growth in nearly all end-use categories. these economic trends were an important element in ppg's aggregate sales volume growth of 3.5% compared to the previous year. ppg achieved sales volume growth of greater than 2% in each major region for the year, and sales volume growth improved in every major region versus 2013 growth levels.
year-over-year sales volumes grew about 4% in the u.s. and canada in 2014, with sales volume growth adding to strong prior year gains and broad-based growth across many ppg businesses. the u.s. and canada remained ppg's largest region representing 47% of 2014 sales. during 2014, industrial activity continued to improve in the region aided by low regional energy costs, continued demand and production increases in several industries, including automotive oem and aerospace.
2014 ppg annual report and form 10-k 21
construction spending in the region continued to recover in a measured manner. u.s. housing starts grew moderately during the year and were supplemented by continued, modest improvement in the residential remodeling market. non-residential construction demand remained suppressed early in the year but exhibited stronger but inconsistent growth in the latter portion of the year. although smaller in size, demand growth in the canadian construction market was also modest. growth in the region and various end-use markets was also aided somewhat by lower u.s. unemployment rates which improved throughout the year. falling energy and gasoline prices late in the year are expected to result in improved consumer spending and additional regional growth prospects for ppg entering 2015.
the pace of european economic activity remained subdued in 2014, with the region continuing to face limited employment growth. industrial production and gross domestic product growth was mixed by country and generally weak across the region. regional demand was strongest early in the year aided somewhat by modest winter weather conditions, with ppg year-over-year sales volumes advancing by about 5% in the first quarter. demand trends were more muted for the remainder of the year, with full year regional sales volume growth of 2%. however, the level of demand was not consistent across the various countries in the region, as certain eastern european countries and the u.k. experienced solid demand growth, while other large countries in the region, including france, remained challenged from a demand perspective. europe remains a very large region for ppg, representing just under one-third of ppg's 2014 sales. overall company sales volumes in the region are still down nearly 20% in comparison to 2008 pre-recession levels, reflecting economic weakness in prior years without any substantive or broad recovery. from a currency perspective, late in the year the euro weakened considerably against the u.s. dollar. while the regional economy remains muted, a lower euro may aid exports in 2015. additionally, global oil prices rapidly descended late in 2014, and the european economies stand to benefit considerably if prices remain at low levels in 2015 given the large level of oil imported in the region and no significant detriment to lower oil pricing given the minimal amount of oil production regionally.
in the aggregate, emerging region economies continued to expand during 2014; however, growth rates varied considerably by country, and overall emerging region economic growth was lower than previous years. the emerging market regions of asia and latin america represented 22% of ppg's sales 2014 sales, with asia the largest emerging region having sales of about $2.5 billion. company sales volumes increased in asia overall by about 4%, with china sales volume growth considerably higher. china remained ppg's second largest individual country from a sales perspective in 2014. as a result of the comex acquisition, ppg has notably expanded our sales in emerging regions. in 2015, mexico may overtake china as ppg's second largest individual country from a sales perspective. the largest gains in asia were in the industrial coatings segment, including the benefit of just below 10% industry growth in chinese automotive production. offsetting these improvements was muted demand in a few end-use markets, including consumer electronics and certain heavy-duty equipment subsectors. also, marine new-build activity was lower early in the year, but began to grow later in the year. demand in the latin american economies remained erratic due to a variety of economic factors, including high inflation rates and weakening currencies in comparison to the u.s. dollar. ppg's latin american sales volumes were up 3.5% for the year, with differences by end-use market and country. heading into 2015, ppg anticipates consistent overall company sales volume growth in emerging regions supported by more moderate growth in china, and less negative or improving demand in certain other emerging countries.
looking ahead to 2015, we anticipate growth rates will remain mixed by region, with north american and asian economies continuing to grow at rates generally consistent with 2014. we anticipate growth will remain the strongest in the u.s. economy, including a further strengthening of initial growth that started in 2014 in non-residential construction. increased global demand is expected in the automotive oem and aerospace industries. we expect emerging regions growth to remain mixed, but we expect ppg to post solid aggregate growth based on the specific end-use markets the company supplies. our base case assumption is that european growth will remain mixed by country but subdued overall, but that exports may benefit from a weaker euro versus other currencies and lower global energy pricing.
in april 2013, ppg completed the acquisition of akzo nobel's north american architectural coatings business. the company targeted $200 million in annual savings relating to business synergies stemming from the acquisition. throughout 2014 and 2013, ppg executed actions relating to capturing these synergies, and substantially all of the actions were completed by the end of 2014, achieving the targeted annual run-rate savings one year ahead of schedule. we will realize incremental annual saving of about $20 million in 2015, related to synergy capture actions completed during 2014 that will not reach their anniversary until 2015.
during 2014, ppg also finalized substantially all of the actions related to previously announced company restructuring programs, except for a few remaining actions related to the 2013 restructuring plan which are expected to be completed during the first half of 2015. ppg remains aggressive with respect to cost management, and will continually monitor the company's cost structure relative to projected regional and end use-market demand levels. the company will proactively make adjustments to its cost structure as appropriate.
raw materials are a significant input cost in the manufacture of coatings. ppg typically experiences fluctuating prices for energy and raw materials driven by various factors, including supply and demand imbalances, global industrial activity levels and changes in supplier feedstock costs and inventories. given the recent volatility in certain energy-based input costs, the company is not able to predict with certainty the 2015 full year impact of related changes in raw material pricing. also, given the distribution nature of many of our businesses, logistics and distribution costs are sizable costs, as are wages and benefits but to a lesser degree. for 2014, in aggregate, these cost components were similar year-over-year with certain categories
22 2014 ppg annual report and form 10-k increasing, such as logistics costs and wages in certain regions, while others were flat or declined modestly.
pension and postretirement benefit costs, excluding curtailments and special termination benefits, were $123 million in 2014, down $54 million from $177 million in 2013. in 2015, we expect pension and other postretirement benefit costs to increase by approximately $60 to $65 million due to revised mortality assumptions and a lower liability discount rate as measured at year-end 2014. during 2014, ppg's cash contributions to defined benefit pension plans totaled $41 million. total cash contributions to global defined benefit pension plans were $174 million and $80 million in 2013 and 2012, respectively. we expect to make mandatory contributions to our non-u.s. plans in the range of $10 million to $20 million in 2015.
in an effort to offset the adverse impact of cost inflation on income from continuing operations, in 2014 the company implemented modestly higher selling prices, with overall pricing up one-half of one percent for the year. selective pricing actions are currently planned in 2015, with actions expected to differ by business and region.
a variety of foreign currencies began to weaken in the second half of 2014 versus the u.s. dollar. based on mid-january 2015 exchange rates, the company expects year-over-year currency translation will unfavorably impact 2015 sales by $650 million to $750 million, and 2015 earnings by about $65 million to $75 million. since mid-january, certain foreign currencies have continued to weaken versus the u.s. dollar, thus the unfavorable currency translation impact to 2015 sales and earnings could be larger than the mid-january 2015 ranges stated above. the company generally purchases raw materials, incurs manufacturing cost and sells finished products in the same currency, so it typically incurs more modest transactional-related currency impacts to earnings.
the company expects $55 million of lower net interest expense for 2015 due to a debt refinancing completed in the fourth quarter of 2014, partially offset by lower interest income from lower aggregate cash and short-term investment balances in 2015. the net interest savings will vary by quarter. year-over-year net interest expense is expected to be approximately $20 million lower in the first quarter, and range from $10 million to $15 million lower in the second, third and fourth quarters.
we expect our ongoing effective tax rate from continuing operations to be in the range of 24.0% to 25.0% in 2015. this rate is slightly higher than the 2014 rate primarily due to the impact of earnings from the acquired business of comex, which are primarily earned in mexico, where the statutory tax rate is higher than the company's effective global tax rate. because of the differences in the tax rates in the countries in which we operate, a shift in the geographic mix of earnings will impact our overall ongoing tax rate.
over the past five years, the company used $3.3 billion of cash to repurchase about 28 million shares of stock, and the company ended the year with approximately $1.7 billion remaining under the current authorization from the board of directors. ppg announced in january 2014, its intention to deploy between $3.0 billion and $4.0 billion of incremental cash over an 18 to 24 month period. during 2014, the company deployed approximately $3.2 billion of cash for acquisitions, including repayment of acquired debt, and share repurchases. in january 2015, the company announced a new cash deployment target for acquisitions and share repurchases of between $1.5 billion and $2.5 billion for years 2015 and 2016 combined. the company expects continued strong free cash flow in 2015.

performance in 2013 compared with 2012
performance overview net sales increased $1,579 million, or 12% from the prior year, to $14,265 million primarily due to sales of acquired businesses, which increased net sales by approximately 10%. the akzo nobel north american architectural coatings business acquired in april 2013 contributed approximately $1,165 million in net sales while the acquisitions of deft, an aerospace coatings business acquired in may 2013, and the spraylat coatings business acquired in december 2012, contributed approximately $166 million combined.
overall sales volumes, excluding acquisitions, were level with the prior year as sales volume growth in the industrial coatings and glass segments as well as the aerospace business was offset by a volume declines in the other businesses in the performance coatings segment. sales volumes were inconsistent by region. the u.s. and canada and the latin america regions' sales volumes were up nearly 3% year over year. growth occurred in many end-use markets in asia pacific, although total sales volumes for the region were nearly level year over year due to declines stemming from lower marine new-build end-use market demand. sales volumes in europe were down 3% year over year due to weak demand that occurred in the first half of the year. the 2013 volume decline in europe continued the trend experienced since the recession began in 2009. higher selling prices added just over 1% to net sales which included the carryover impact from 2012 price increases to offset current year inflation in certain cost components, including increases in transportation, energy and labor costs. the impact of foreign currency translation on net sales was flat for the year, although results were mixed by currency.
cost of sales, exclusive of depreciation and amortization, increased $715 million, or 9% from the prior year, to $8,314 million primarily due to the inclusion of cost of sales from acquired businesses partially offset by lower manufacturing costs. cost of sales as a percentage of sales in 2013 was 58.3% compared to 59.9% in 2012. this decrease is largely due to shifts in sales margin mix related to the businesses acquired.
selling, general and administrative expenses increased by $499 million, or 17% from the prior year, to $3,486 million
2014 ppg annual report and form 10-k 23
principally related to the inclusion of acquired businesses and overhead cost inflation partly offset by the impact of our continued focus on cost management, including savings from restructuring actions initiated in 2012. as a percent of sales, selling, general and administrative expenses increased slightly to 24.4% in 2013 from 23.5% in 2012 primarily due to the addition of acquired businesses which have higher distribution related costs.
depreciation expense increased $41 million, or 14% from the prior year, to $333 million primarily due to the depreciation of the acquired businesses.
the pre-tax restructuring charge of $98 million relates to a restructuring plan approved in the third quarter of 2013 focused on achieving cost synergies, through improved productivity and efficiency, related to the acquired north american architectural coatings business, but also includes smaller targeted actions for ppg's legacy architectural business, as well as other businesses where market conditions remain very challenging, most notably protective and marine coatings and certain european businesses such as architectural coatings and fiber glass.
other charges decreased $34 million, or 15% from the prior year, to $189 million primarily due to lower legacy environmental remediation charges in 2013. in 2013, the largest charge included in other charges relates to a pre-tax charge of $89 million for the environmental remediation at a former chromium manufacturing plant and associated sites in new jersey and a pre-tax charge of $12 million related to environmental remediation at a legacy chemical manufacturing site. the 2012 other charges included a pre-tax charge of $159 million, related primarily to the environmental remediation at the former chromium manufacturing plant and associated sites in new jersey.
other income decreased $11 million, or 8% from the prior year, to $127 million primarily due to lower equity earnings, primarily from our asian fiber glass joint ventures as a result of a decline in demand in the personal computer market and lower licensing earnings in the glass segment.
the effective tax rate on income before income taxes was 20.6% and 17.9% in 2013 and 2012, respectively. the company's adjusted effective tax rate on income before income taxes, excluding certain charges was 23.1% in 2013 and 21.4% in 2012. see the regulation g reconciliation below for details of ppg's adjusted effective tax rate from continuing operations.
diluted earnings-per-share for 2013 were $22.27 per-share, comprised of net income from continuing operations of $6.55 per-share and discontinued operations, net of tax of $15.72 per-share. the increase in diluted earnings-per-share resulted from higher net income and a reduction in the number of shares outstanding as a result of the 10.8 million ppg shares tendered to the company in the exchange offer in connection with the separation and merger of the company's former commodity chemicals business as well as the approximately 5.7 million shares repurchased during 2013. for more information about the separation and merger of the company's former commodity chemicals business, see note 2, "acquisitions and dispositions ," under item 8 of this form 10-k.
regulation g reconciliation - results from operations ppg industries believes investors' understanding of the company's operating performance is enhanced by the disclosure of income before income taxes, ppg's effective tax rate, tax expense, net income from continuing operations and earnings per diluted share adjusted for nonrecurring charges. ppg's management considers this information useful in providing insight into the company's ongoing operating performance because it excludes the impact of items that cannot reasonably be expected to recur on an ongoing basis. income before income taxes, the effective tax rate, tax expense, net income from continuing operations and earnings per diluted share adjusted for these items are not recognized financial measures determined in accordance with u.s. generally accepted accounting principles ("gaap") and should not be considered a substitute for income before income taxes, the effective tax rate, tax expense, net income from continuing operations or earnings per diluted share or other financial measures as computed in accordance with u.s. gaap. in addition, adjusted income before income taxes, adjusted effective tax rate, adjusted tax expense, adjusted net income from continuing operations and adjusted earnings per diluted share from continuing operations may not be comparable to similarly titled measures as reported by other companies.

performance coatings performance coatings net sales increased $1,035 million, or 15% from the prior year, to $7,934 million primarily due to net sales from businesses acquired (18%) and modestly higher pricing partially offset by lower sales volumes (5%). sales volumes remained varied by region and business. sales volume growth continued in the aerospace coatings business where industry demand remains strong. automotive refinish sales volumes were level with the prior year as growth in the asia pacific and latin american regions offset sales volume declines in europe, while the north american refinish sales volumes were consistent with 2012. offsetting the segment sales volume gains was a decline in sales volume in the protective and marine coatings business due to further, notable weakness in the asian marine new-build market reflecting lower global demand. u.s. and canada architectural coatings sales volume declined by low-single-digit percentages with mid-to-high single digit percentage same store growth in company-owned stores, lower sales in national retail accounts and lower sales in the independent dealer channel. the lower sales volume in the national account channel was due to a previously disclosed change in products sold to a large retail customer. emea architectural coatings sales declined vs. prior year primarily due to lower sales volumes (down mid-single-digit percentages) as economic conditions worsened in most european countries. however, market demand improved somewhat in the second half of the year but remained negative overall and mixed across the region. poor weather conditions in the first half of 2013 were also a contributor to the decline in emea architectural coatings sales volumes. the decline in emea architectural coatings sales volumes was partially offset by the impacts of favorable pricing and foreign currency translation. segment income was $1,043 million for 2013, an increase of $154 million, or 17%, compared to the prior year primarily due to the income from acquired businesses, lower overhead and manufacturing costs stemming from prior restructuring actions and ongoing cost management, offset partially by the negative impact on segment income from the lower sales volumes.
industrial coatings industrial coatings net sales increased $509 million, or 11% from the prior year, to $5,264 million primarily due to sales volume growth (6%) and net sales from acquired businesses (4%). in 2013, ppg's global automotive oem coatings sales volumes grew 10%, outpacing global industry auto production growth of about 3% year-over-year. the industrial coatings business experienced varied sales volume results by region compared with the prior year, as strong improvements across emerging regions and modestly higher sales volumes in north america were offset by weak demand in europe. packaging coatings sales volumes grew modestly in asia pacific and latin america, were down low-single-digits year-over-year in europe and essentially flat in north america. specialty coatings and materials sales volumes increased as the silicas business business achieved higher year over year sales volumes in both the u.s. and europe as a result of solid demand growth. segment income increased $147 million, or 22% from the prior year, to $824 million primarily due to the impact from the higher sales coupled with ongoing cost management initiatives and the benefits from the company's restructuring actions initiated in 2012.

glass glass segment net sales increased $35 million, or 3% from the prior year, to $1,067 million primarily due to higher fiber glass sales volumes. sales volumes in fiber glass increased modestly, reflecting higher global demand in various end-use markets. segment income was $56 million, a decrease of $7 million, or 11% from the prior year, primarily due to input cost inflation, including higher natural gas costs, lower licensing income and lower fiber glass equity earnings stemming from weaker personal computer production activity in asia. these negative factors more than offset reductions in manufacturing costs.

as discussed in item 3 and note 13, although the result of any future litigation of such lawsuits and claims is inherently unpredictable, management believes that, in the aggregate, the outcome of all lawsuits and claims involving ppg, including asbestos-related claims in the event the proposed asbestos settlement described in note 13 does not become effective, will not have a material effect on ppg's consolidated financial position or liquidity; however, any such outcome may be material to the results of operations of any particular period in which costs, if any, are recognized.
it is ppg's policy to accrue expenses for contingencies when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. reserves for environmental contingencies are exclusive of claims against third parties and are generally not discounted. in management's opinion, the company operates in an environmentally sound manner and the outcome of the company's environmental contingencies will not have a material effect on ppg's financial position or liquidity; however, any such outcome may be material to the results of operations of any particular period in which costs, if any, are recognized. management anticipates that the resolution of the company's environmental contingencies will occur over an extended period of time.
as of december 31, 2014 and 2013, ppg had reserves for environmental contingencies totaling $317 million and $337 million, respectively, of which $141 million and $133 million, respectively, were classified as current liabilities. pre-tax charges against income for environmental remediation costs in 2014, 2013 and 2012 totaled $144 million, $108 million and $166 million, respectively, and are included in "other charges" in the accompanying consolidated statement of income. cash outlays related to environmental remediation were $165 million, $111 million, and $62 million in 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively.
in addition to the amounts currently reserved for environmental remediation, the company may be subject to loss contingencies related to environmental matters now estimated to be approximately $75 million to $200 million which is lower than the estimate of $100 million to $200 million as of december 31, 2013 as a result of the additional environmental remediation charge recorded in the third quarter of 2014 explained below. such unreserved losses are reasonably possible but are not currently considered to be probable of occurrence. these reasonably possible unreserved losses relate to environmental matters at a number of sites. the loss contingencies related to these sites include significant unresolved issues such as the nature and extent of contamination at these sites and the methods that may have to be employed to remediate them. the impact of evolving programs, such as natural resource damage claims, industrial site re-use initiatives and state remediation programs, also adds to the present uncertainties with regard to the ultimate resolution of this unreserved exposure to future loss. the company's assessment of the potential impact of these environmental contingencies is subject to considerable uncertainty due to the complex, ongoing and evolving process of investigation and remediation, if necessary, of such environmental contingencies, and the potential for technological and regulatory developments.
the company continues to analyze, assess and remediate the environmental issues associated with ppg's former chromium manufacturing plant in jersey city, n.j. and associated sites ("new jersey chrome"). during the third quarters of 2014 and 2013, ppg completed assessments of costs incurred to date versus current progress and the potential cost impacts of the most recent information. based on these assessments, the company recorded reserve adjustments of $136 million and $89 million in the third quarters of 2014 and 2013, respectively. principal factors impacting costs included a refinement in the estimate of the mix of hazardous to non-hazardous soils to be excavated, an overall increase in soil volumes to be excavated, enhanced water management requirements, decreased daily soil excavation rates due to site conditions, initial estimates for remedial actions related to groundwater, and increased oversight and management costs.
a charge of $145 million was recorded in the first quarter of 2012 as a result of updated information the company compiled about the sites that was used to develop a new estimate of the cost to remediate these sites. the updated information was compiled in connection with the preparation of a final draft soil remedial action work plan and cost estimate.
the charges for estimated environmental remediation costs for the previous three years have been significantly higher than ppg's historical range. excluding the charges related to new jersey chrome, pre-tax charges against income for environmental remediation have ranged between $10 million and $30 million per year for the past 10 years.
information will continue to be generated from the ongoing groundwater remedial investigation activities related to new jersey chrome and will be incorporated into a final draft remedial action work plan for groundwater expected to be submitted to new jersey department of environmental protection in late 2015 or 2016.
26 2014 ppg annual report and form 10-k liquidity and capital resources during the past three years, ppg has had sufficient financial resources to meet its operating requirements, to fund our capital spending, including acquisitions, share repurchases and pension plans and to pay increasing dividends to shareholders.
cash from continuing operating activities was $1,807 million, $1,562 million, and $1,410 million in 2014, 2013, and 2012, respectively. increases in cash from continuing operating activities in 2014 compared to 2013 and in 2013 compared to 2012 were aided by higher income from continuing operations, including income from acquired businesses.
operating working capital is a subset of total working capital and represents (1) receivables from customers, net of allowance for doubtful accounts, (2) inventories, and (3) trade liabilities. see note 3, "working capital detail" under item 8 of this form 10-k for further information related to the components of the company's operating working capital. we believe operating working capital represents the key components of working capital under the operating control of our businesses. operating working capital at december 31, 2014 and 2013 was $2.5 billion and $2.6 billion, respectively. a key metric we use to measure our working capital management is operating working capital as a percentage of sales (fourth quarter sales annualized).

operating working capital at december 31, 2014 decreased $189 million compared with the prior year. trade receivables from customers, net, as a percentage of 2014 fourth quarter sales, annualized, was 16.0%, down slightly from 16.2% for 2013. days sales outstanding was 54 days in 2014, a 3 day improvement from 2013. inventories on a fifo basis as a percentage of 2014 fourth quarter sales, annualized, was 13.5% compared to 13.6% in 2013. inventory turnover was 4.8 times in 2014 and 4.5 times in 2013.
total capital spending, including acquisitions, was $2,700 million, $1,477 million and $452 million in 2014, 2013, and 2012, respectively. spending related to modernization and productivity improvements, expansion of existing businesses and environmental control projects was $587 million, $494 million and $330 million in 2014, 2013, and 2012, respectively, and is expected to be in the range of 3.5% to 4.0% of sales during 2015. capital spending, excluding acquisitions, as a percentage of sales was 3.8%, 3.5% and 2.6% in 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. capital spending related to business acquisitions amounted to $2,113 million, $983
million, and $122 million in 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. in addition, the company acquired and repaid $314 million of debt from acquired companies. a primary focus for the company in 2015 will continue to be prudent cash deployment focused on profitable income growth, including pursuing opportunities for additional strategic acquisitions.
in november 2014, the company acquired comex, an architectural coatings company with headquarters in mexico city, mexico. in 2014, ppg also completed the acquisition of several smaller companies. the total cost of the 2014 acquisitions, including acquired debt repaid, was $2,427 million, net of cash acquired.
in march 2014, ppg received $1.735 billion in cash proceeds for the sale of its 51% ownership interest in its transitions optical joint venture and 100% of its optical sunlens business to essilor.
in april 2013, the company acquired the north american architectural coatings business of akzo nobel, n.v., amsterdam and certain assets of a privately-owned u.s. based specialty coatings company. the total cost of 2013 acquisitions was $983 million.
in january 2013, ppg received $900 million in cash proceeds in connection with the closing of the separation of its commodity chemicals business and subsequent merger of the subsidiary holding the ppg commodity chemicals business with a subsidiary of georgia gulf. refer to note 2, "acquisitions and dispositions" under item 8 of this form 10-k for financial information regarding these discontinued operations.
the company's share repurchase activity in 2014, 2013 and 2012 was about 3.8 million shares at a cost of $750 million, 5.7 million shares at a cost of $1 billion and 1 million shares at a cost of $92 million, respectively. we anticipate completing additional share repurchases during 2015. the company has approximately $1.7 billion remaining under the current authorization from the board of directors, which was approved in 2014. the current authorized repurchase program has no expiration date.
in addition, about 10.8 million shares were added to treasury stock as a result of the january 2013 exchange transaction that was part of the separation of ppg's former commodity chemicals business.
dividends paid to shareholders totaled $361 million, $345 million and $358 million in 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. ppg has paid uninterrupted annual dividends since 1899, and 2014 marked the 43rd consecutive year of increased annual per-share dividend payments to shareholders. the company raised its per-share dividend 10% in april 2014.
we did not have a mandatory contribution to our u.s. defined benefit pension plans in 2014. we made a voluntary contribution of $2 million and $50 million to these plans in 2014 and 2013, respectively. we did not make any contributions to our u.s. defined benefit plans in 2012. we currently do not expect to make mandatory contributions to our
2014 ppg annual report and form 10-k 27
u.s. defined benefit pension plans in 2015. we made contributions to our non-u.s. defined benefit pension plans of $39 million, $124 million and $80 million for 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively, some of which were required by local funding requirements. we expect to make mandatory contributions to our non-u.s. plans in the range of $10 million to $20 million in 2015.
in the fourth quarter of 2014, ppg completed a debt refinancing which involved paying approximately $1.7 billion to redeem public notes which was funded by cash proceeds of approximately $1.2 billion from cash on hand and from several debt issuances described below.
in november 2014, ppg completed a public offering of $300 million in aggregrate principal amount of its 2.30% notes due 2019. these notes were issued pursuant to ppg's existing shelf registration statement. also in november 2014, ppg entered into three euro-denominated borrowings. ppg entered into a euribor based variable rate 3-year €500 million bank loan and privately placed a 15-year €80 million 2.5% fixed interest note and a 30-year €120 million 3.0% fixed interest note. refer to note 8, "borrowings and lines of credit" under item 8 of this form 10-k for financial information regarding these debt obligations.
also in 2014, ppg increased by $300 million the borrowing capacity under its 2012 five-year credit agreement (the "credit agreement") with several banks and financial institutions as further discussed in note 8, "borrowings and lines of credit" under item 8 of this form 10-k. the credit agreement now provides for a $1.5 billion unsecured revolving credit facility. the credit agreement will terminate on september 12, 2017. during the years ended december 31, 2014 and 2013, there were no borrowings outstanding under the credit agreement.
in 2013, ppg repaid its $600 million 5.75% notes due march 15, 2013.
in july 2012, ppg completed a public offering of $400 million in aggregate principal amount of its 2.70% notes due 2022 (the "2022 notes"). the 2022 notes were offered by the company pursuant to its existing shelf registration statement. the proceeds of this offering of $397 million, net of discount and issuance costs, were used to repay a portion of the $600 million of 5.75% notes in march 2013. the remaining unamortized discount and issuance costs related to the 2022 notes were recognized in earnings in 2014 as a result of the debt refinancing.
also during the year ended december 31, 2012 the company assumed $120 million of debt in an acquisition; repaid $119 million of that debt, and repaid the $71 million of 6.875% notes upon their maturity.
the ratio of total debt, including capital leases, to total debt and equity was 44% at december 31, 2014 up from 41% in 2013.
the company has $5.0 billion and $3.9 billion of undistributed earnings of non-u.s. subsidiaries as of december 31, 2014 and december 31, 2013, respectively.  these amounts relate to approximately 200 subsidiaries in more than 60 taxable jurisdictions. as discussed in note 2, "acquisitions and dispositions" under item 8 of this form 10-k, ppg recorded a deferred u.s. income tax liability of $247 million on the foreign earnings generated from the sale of its transitions optical joint venture in 2014. no significant deferred u.s. income taxes have been provided on the remaining $4.2 billion of ppg's undistributed earnings as they are considered to be reinvested for an indefinite period of time or will be repatriated when it is tax effective to do so. the company estimates repatriation of undistributed earnings of non-u.s. subsidiaries as of december 31, 2014 and december 31, 2013 would have resulted in a u.s. tax cost of approximately $200 million and $250 million, respectively.
we continue to believe that our cash on hand and short term investments, cash from operations and the company's available debt capacity will continue to be sufficient to fund our operating activities, capital spending, including acquisitions, dividend payments, debt service, amounts due under the proposed asbestos settlement, share repurchases, contributions to pension plans, and ppg's significant contractual obligations. these significant contractual obligations, along with amounts due under the proposed asbestos settlement are presented in the following table.

(3)   we have recorded an obligation equal to the net present value of the aggregate cash payments, along with the ppg stock and other assets to be contributed to a trust under the proposed asbestos settlement. however, ppg has no obligation to pay any amounts under this settlement until the funding effective date, as more fully discussed in note 13, "commitments and contingent liabilities," under item 8 of this form 10-k.
28 2014 ppg annual report and form 10-k at december 31, 2014, the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits for uncertain tax positions, including an accrual of related interest and penalties along with positions only impacting the timing of tax benefits, was approximately $78 million. the timing of payments will depend on the progress of examinations with tax authorities. ppg does not expect a significant tax payment related to these obligations within the next year. the company is unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate as to when any significant cash settlements with taxing authorities may occur.
the unconditional purchase commitments are principally take-or-pay obligations related to the purchase of certain materials, including industrial gases, natural gas, coal and electricity, consistent with customary industry practice.
see note 8, "borrowings and lines of credit," under item 8 of this form 10-k for details regarding the use and availability of committed and uncommitted lines of credit, letters of credit, guarantees and debt covenants.
in addition to the amounts available under the lines of credit, the company has an automatic shelf registration statement on file with the sec pursuant to which it may issue, offer and sell from time to time on a continuous or delayed basis any combination of securities in one or more offerings.
off-balance sheet arrangements the company's off-balance sheet arrangements include the operating leases and unconditional purchase commitments disclosed in the "liquidity and capital resources" section in the contractual obligations table as well as letters of credit and guarantees as discussed in note 8, "borrowings and lines of credit," under item 8 of this form 10-k.
critical accounting estimates management has evaluated the accounting policies used in the preparation of the financial statements and related notes presented under item 8 of this form 10-k and believes those policies to be reasonable and appropriate. we believe that the most critical accounting estimates made in the preparation of our financial statements are those related to accounting for contingencies, under which we accrue a loss when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated, and to accounting for pensions, other postretirement benefits, business combinations, goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets with indefinite lives because of the importance of management judgment in making the estimates necessary to apply these policies.
contingencies contingencies, by their nature, relate to uncertainties that require management to exercise judgment both in assessing the likelihood that a liability has been incurred as well as in estimating the amount of potential loss. the most important contingencies impacting our financial statements are those related to the collectability of accounts receivable, to environmental remediation, to pending, impending or overtly threatened litigation against the company and to the resolution of matters related to open tax years. for more information on these matters, see note 3, "working capital detail," note 11,
"income taxes" and note 13, "commitments and contingent liabilities" under item 8 of this form 10-k.
defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans accounting for pensions and other postretirement benefits involves estimating the cost of benefits to be provided well into the future and attributing that cost over the time period each employee works. to accomplish this, extensive use is made of assumptions about inflation, investment returns, mortality, turnover, medical costs and discount rates. the company has established a process by which management reviews and selects these assumptions annually. see note 12, "employee benefit plans," under item 8 for information on these plans and the assumptions used.
the discount rate used in accounting for pensions and other postretirement benefits is determined by reference to a current yield curve and by considering the timing and amount of projected future benefit payments. the weighted average discount rate assumption at december 31, 2014 is 4.0% for our u.s. defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans. the weighted average discount rate assumption for our u.s. defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans at december 31, 2013 was 4.83%. a change in the discount rate of 100 basis points, with all other assumptions held constant, would impact 2015 net periodic benefit expense for our defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans by approximately $24 million and $15 million, respectively.
the expected return on plan assets assumption used in accounting for our pension plans is determined by evaluating the mix of investments that comprise plan assets and external forecasts of future long-term investment returns. for 2014, the return on plan assets assumption for our u.s. defined benefit pension plans was 7.25%. this assumption is unchanged for 2015. a change in the rate of return of 100 basis points, with other assumptions held constant, would impact 2015 net periodic pension expense by approximately $26 million.
business combinations in accordance with the accounting guidance for business combinations, the company uses the acquisition method of accounting to allocate costs of acquired businesses to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values at the dates of acquisition. the excess costs of acquired businesses over the fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed were recognized as goodwill. the valuations of the acquired assets and liabilities will impact the determination of future operating results. in addition to using management estimates and negotiated amounts, the company uses a variety of information sources to determine the estimated fair values of acquired assets and liabilities including: third-party appraisals for the estimated value and lives of identifiable intangible assets and property, plant and equipment; third-party actuaries for the estimated obligations of defined benefit pension plans and similar benefit obligations; and legal counsel or other experts to assess the obligations associated with legal, environmental and other contingent liabilities. the business and technical judgment of management was used in determining which intangible assets have indefinite lives and in determining the useful lives of finite-lived intangible assets in accordance
2014 ppg annual report and form 10-k 29
with the accounting guidance for goodwill and other intangible assets.
goodwill and intangible assets as discussed in note 1, "summary of significant accounting policies," under item 8 of this form 10-k, the company tests goodwill and identifiable intangible assets with indefinite lives for impairment at least annually. the company tests indefinite-lived intangible assets and goodwill for impairment by either performing a qualitative evaluation or a quantitative test. the qualitative evaluation is an assessment of factors, including reporting unit or asset specific financial information as well as industry, market and general economic conditions, to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair values of a reporting unit or asset is less than its carrying amount, including goodwill when testing goodwill for impairment. the company may elect to bypass this qualitative assessment for some or all of its reporting units and indefinite-lived intangible assets and perform a quantitative test. fair values under the quantitative test are estimated using discounted cash flow methodologies that are based on projections of the amounts and timing of future revenues and cash flows. based on the 2014 impairment tests, none of our goodwill or identifiable intangible assets with indefinite lives was impaired.
we believe that the amounts recorded in the financial statements under item 8 of this form 10-k related to these contingencies, pensions, other postretirement benefits, business combinations, goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets with indefinite lives are based on the best estimates and judgments of the appropriate ppg management, although actual outcomes could differ from our estimates.
currency from december 31, 2013 to december 31, 2014, the u.s. dollar strengthened against the currencies in the countries in which ppg operates, most notably the euro and the mexican peso. as a result, consolidated net assets at december 31, 2014 decreased by $623 million, compared to december 31, 2013. comparing exchange rates during 2014 to those of 2013, in the countries in which ppg operates, the u.s. dollar was weaker overall, which had an immaterial favorable impact on full year 2014 income before income taxes from the translation of these foreign earnings into u.s. dollars.
from december 31, 2012 to december 31, 2013, the u.s. dollar strengthened against certain currencies in the countries in which ppg operates, while weakening against others, the most notable being the euro. as a result, consolidated net assets at december 31, 2013 decreased by $44 million, compared to december 31, 2012. comparing exchange rates during 2013 to those of 2012, in the countries in which ppg operates, the u.s. dollar was weaker in certain countries, which had a favorable impact on full year 2013 income before income taxes of $11 million from the translation of these foreign earnings into u.s. dollars.
the u.s. dollar weakened from year-end december 31, 2011 to year-end december 31, 2012, against certain currencies in the countries in which ppg operates, most notably against the euro, the british pound sterling, polish zloty, and the south korean won. a $141 million increase in ppg consolidated net assets and shareholders' equity resulted from translating ppg's foreign denominated net assets to u.s. dollars at december 31, 2012, compared to december 31, 2011. comparing exchange rates during 2012 to those of 2011, in the countries in which ppg operates, the u.s. dollar was generally stronger, particularly against the euro, which had an unfavorable impact on full year 2012 income before income taxes of approximately $40 million from the translation of these foreign earnings into u.s. dollars.
forward-looking statements the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 provides a safe harbor for forward-looking statements made by or on behalf of the company. management's discussion and analysis and other sections of this annual report contain forward-looking statements that reflect the company's current views with respect to future events and financial performance.
you can identify forward-looking statements by the fact that they do not relate strictly to current or historic facts. forward-looking statements are identified by the use of the words "aim," "believe," "expect," "anticipate," "intend," "estimate," "project," "outlook," "forecast" and other expressions that indicate future events and trends. any forward-looking statement speaks only as of the date on which such statement is made, and the company undertakes no obligation to update any forward looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as otherwise required by applicable law. you are advised, however, to consult any further disclosures we make on related subjects in our reports to the securities and exchange commission. also, note the following cautionary statements.
many factors could cause actual results to differ materially from the company's forward-looking statements. such factors include global economic conditions, increasing price and product competition by foreign and domestic competitors, fluctuations in cost and availability of raw materials, the ability to maintain favorable supplier relationships and arrangements, difficulties in integrating acquired businesses and achieving expected synergies therefrom, economic and political conditions in international markets, the ability to penetrate existing, developing and emerging foreign and domestic markets, foreign exchange rates and fluctuations in such rates, fluctuations in tax rates, the impact of future legislation, the impact of environmental regulations, unexpected business disruptions, the unpredictability of existing and possible future litigation, including litigation that could result if the proposed asbestos settlement does not become effective, the realization of anticipated cost savings from restructuring initiatives, and ppg's ability to integrate the comex business acquisition and to achieve anticipated synergies. however, it is not possible to predict or identify all such factors. consequently, while the list of factors presented here and under item 1a is considered representative, no such list should be considered to be a complete statement of all potential risks and uncertainties. unlisted factors may present significant additional obstacles to the realization of forward-looking statements.
consequences of material differences in the results compared with those anticipated in the forward-looking statements could include, among other things, business disruption, operational problems, financial loss, legal liability to third parties, other factors set forth in item 1a of this form 10-k
30 2014 ppg annual report and form 10-k and similar risks, any of which could have a material adverse effect on the company's consolidated financial condition, results of operations or liquidity.

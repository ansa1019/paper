overview our company. digital realty trust, inc. completed its initial public offering of common stock, or our ipo, on november 3, 2004. we believe that we have operated in a manner that has enabled us to qualify, and have elected to be treated, as a reit under sections 856 through 860 of the code. our company was formed on march 9, 2004. during the period from our formation until we commenced operations in connection with the completion of our ipo, we did not have any corporate activity other than the issuance of shares of digital realty trust, inc. common stock in connection with the initial capitalization of the company. our operating partnership was formed on july 21, 2004.
business and strategy. our primary business objectives are to maximize: (i) sustainable long-term growth in earnings and funds from operations per share and unit, (ii) cash flow and returns to our stockholders and our operating partnership's unitholders through the payment of distributions and (iii) return on invested capital. we expect to achieve our objectives by focusing on our core business of investing in and developing technology-related real estate. a significant component of our current and future internal growth is anticipated through the development of our existing space held for development and acquisition of new properties. we target high quality, strategically located properties containing applications and operations critical to the day-to-day operations of corporate enterprise datacenter and technology industry tenants and properties that may be developed for such use. most of our properties contain fully redundant electrical supply systems, multiple power feeds, above-standard cooling systems, raised floor areas, extensive in-building communications cabling and high-level security systems. we focus solely on technology-related real estate because we believe that the growth in corporate datacenter adoption and the technology-related real estate industry generally will continue to be superior to that of the overall economy.
as of december 31, 2014, we owned an aggregate of 131 properties, including 14 properties held as investments in unconsolidated joint ventures, with approximately 24.6 million rentable square feet including approximately 1.3 million square feet of space under active development and approximately 1.2 million square feet of space held for future development. the 14 properties held as investments in unconsolidated joint ventures have an aggregate of approximately 1.9 million rentable square feet. the 14 parcels of developable land we own comprised approximately 178 acres. at december 31, 2014, approximately 1.3 million square feet was under construction for turn-key flex®, powered base building® and custom solutions products, all of which are expected to be income producing on or after completion, in six u.s. domestic markets, one european market, one canadian market, one australian market and our singapore market, consisting of approximately 0.7 million square feet of base building construction and 0.6 million square feet of data center construction.
we have developed detailed, standardized procedures for evaluating new real estate investments to ensure that they meet our financial, technical and other criteria. we expect to continue to acquire additional assets as a part of our growth strategy. we intend to aggressively manage and lease our assets to increase their cash flow. we may continue to build out our development portfolio when justified by anticipated returns.
we may acquire properties subject to existing mortgage financing and other indebtedness or we may incur new indebtedness in connection with acquiring or refinancing these properties. debt service on such indebtedness will have a priority over any cash dividends with respect to digital realty trust, inc.'s common stock and preferred stock. we currently intend to limit our indebtedness to 60% of our total enterprise value and, based on the closing price of digital realty trust, inc. common stock on december 31, 2014 of $66.30, our ratio of debt to total enterprise value was approximately 31%. our total enterprise value is defined as the sum of the market value of digital realty trust, inc.'s outstanding common stock (which may decrease, thereby increasing our debt to total enterprise value ratio), excluding options issued under our company's incentive award plan, plus the liquidation value of digital realty trust, inc.'s preferred stock, plus the aggregate value of our operating partnership's units not held by digital realty trust, inc. (with the per unit value equal to the market value of one share of

index to financial statements digital realty trust, inc. common stock and excluding long-term incentive units, class c units and class d units), plus the book value of our total consolidated indebtedness.
revenue base. as of december 31, 2014, we owned 131 properties through our operating partnership, including 14 properties held as investments in unconsolidated joint ventures and developable land. these properties are mainly located throughout the u.s., with 21 properties located in europe, three properties in australia, two properties in canada and two properties in asia. we, through our predecessor, acquired our first portfolio property in january 2002 and have added properties through acquisition and development activities as follows:

(8)   43790 devin shafron drive and 21551 beaumeade circle, which were previously included as part of the devin shafron buildings and beaumeade circle portfolio, respectively, are now each separately included in the property count because they were separately contributed to an unconsolidated joint venture in september 2013.
(9)   43915 devin shafron drive, which was previously included as part of the devin shafron buildings, is now separately included in the property count because it was separately contributed to an unconsolidated joint venture in september 2014.
as of december 31, 2014, the properties in our portfolio, including the 14 properties held as investments in unconsolidated joint ventures, were approximately 93.2% leased excluding approximately 1.3 million square feet of space under active development and approximately 1.2 million square feet of space held for future development. due to the capital-intensive and long-term nature of the operations being supported, our lease terms are generally longer than standard commercial leases. as of december 31, 2014, our average lease term at signing is approximately 12 years, with an average of approximately six years remaining. our scheduled lease expirations through december 31, 2016 are 14.7% of rentable square feet excluding month-to-month leases, space under active development and space held for future development as of december 31, 2014.
on september 27, 2013, we formed a joint venture with an investment fund managed by prudential real estate investors (prei®). we contributed nine powered base building® data centers totaling 1.06 million square feet and valued at approximately $366.4 million (excluding $2.8 million of closing costs). the prei®-managed fund took an 80% interest in the joint venture and we retained a 20% interest. the joint venture is structured to provide a current annual preferred return from cash flow first to the prei®-managed interest, then to our interest, after which a portion of any excess cash flows is shared by the partners based on their respective interests and the remaining portion is paid to us as a promote interest. we perform the day-to-day accounting and property management functions for the joint venture and, as such, we earn a management fee for the services provided. although we are the managing member of the joint venture and manage the day-to-day activities, all significant decisions, including approval of annual budgets and setting the amount of our management fees require approval of the prei® member. thus we concluded we do not own a controlling interest and will account for our interest in the joint venture as an equity method investment, which will result in a reduction in same-store revenues and net income from these properties on our income statement relative to historical periods.
on march 5, 2014, we contributed the 636 pierce street property, which we acquired in december 2013, to our unconsolidated joint venture with prei®. the property was valued at approximately $40.4 million and subject to $26.1 million in debt, which the joint venture assumed. the prei® fund contributed approximately $11.4 million in cash for their 80% share of the net asset value of $14.3 million. subsequent to the closing, the joint venture refinanced its existing debt with $23.0 million drawn from the joint venture's bank facility. including the refinancing costs, the prei® fund contributed $17.5 million for the 636 pierce street property, bringing its contributed capital in the joint venture to $164.8 million.
on april 7, 2014, the operating partnership sold 6 braham street to the tenant pursuant to a sale of the ownership interests in the operating partnership's wholly owned subsidiary that owned the building for £25.0 million (or approximately $41.5 million based on the exchange rate as of april 7, 2014). the transaction after costs and various tenant prepayments resulted in net proceeds of approximately £22.6 million (or approximately $37.5 million based on the exchange rate as of april 7, 2014) and a net gain of approximately $15.9 million.
on september 9, 2014, we formed a joint venture with an affiliate of griffin capital essential asset reit, inc. (gcear). we contributed to the joint venture the property located at 43915 devin shafron drive (building a) in ashburn, virginia, which is a turn-key flex® data center property valued at approximately $185.5 million (excluding approximately $2.1 million of closing costs). gcear contributed cash to the joint venture and will hold an 80% interest in the joint venture. we retained a 20% interest in the joint venture. the joint venture arranged a $102.0 million five-year secured bank loan at libor plus 225 basis points, representing a loan-to-value ratio of approximately 55%. the joint venture entered into an interest rate swap agreement to effectively fix the interest rate on approximately $51.0 million of borrowings under the loan through september 2019. two one-year extensions of the maturity date are available under the loan agreement, which the joint venture may exercise if certain conditions are met. proceeds from this loan offset the initial cash capital contribution amount required from gcear and was used to provide us with a special distribution on account of a portion of the contribution value of the property. the transaction generated approximately $167.5 million of net proceeds to us, comprised of our share of the initial draw-down on the bank loan in addition to gcear's equity contribution, less our share of closing costs. accordingly we recognized a gain of approximately $93.5 million on the sale of the 80% interest in the joint venture during the three months ended september 30, 2014.

index to financial statements factors which may influence future results of operations global market and economic conditions united states and international market and economic conditions in recent years have been unprecedented and challenging with tighter credit conditions and slower economic growth in many markets in which we own properties and conduct our operations. the u.s. and global economies have experienced a recession and face continued concerns about the systemic impact of adverse economic conditions, such as high energy costs, geopolitical issues, the availability and cost of credit, unstable global financial and mortgage markets, high corporate, consumer and governmental debt levels, ongoing sovereign debt and economic issues in european countries, and high unemployment. the european debt crisis has raised concerns regarding the debt burden of certain countries using the euro as their currency and their ability to meet future financial obligations. while recent economic trends across the eurozone have been largely positive, concerns remain regarding the creditworthiness of certain european countries which could lead to the re-introduction of individual currencies in one or more eurozone countries. these potential developments, or market perceptions concerning these and related issues, could adversely affect our leasing and financing activities, rents we receive, potential acquisitions and development projects in europe.
as a result of these conditions, general economic conditions and the cost and availability of capital have been and may again be adversely affected in some or all of the markets in which we own properties and conduct our operations. renewed or increased turbulence in the u.s., european, asia pacific and other international financial markets and economies may adversely affect our ability, and the ability of our tenants, to replace or renew maturing liabilities on a timely basis, access the capital markets to meet liquidity and capital expenditure requirements and may result in adverse effects on our, and our tenants', financial condition and results of operations.
in addition, our access to funds under our global revolving credit facility depends on the ability of the lenders that are parties to such facilities to meet their funding commitments to us. we cannot assure you that long-term disruptions in the global economy and the return of tighter credit conditions among, and potential failures or nationalizations of, third party financial institutions as a result of such disruptions will not have an adverse effect on our lenders. if our lenders are not able to meet their funding commitments to us, our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition could be adversely affected.
if we do not have sufficient cash flow to continue operating our business and are unable to borrow additional funds, access our existing lines of credit or raise equity or debt capital, we may need to source alternative ways to increase our liquidity. such alternatives may include, without limitation, curtailing development activity, disposing of one or more of our properties possibly on disadvantageous terms or entering into or renewing leases on less favorable terms than we otherwise would.
foreign currency exchange risk. for the years ended december 31, 2014 and 2013, we had foreign operations in the united kingdom, ireland, france, the netherlands, switzerland, canada, singapore, australia, japan and hong kong, and, as such, are subject to risk from the effects of exchange rate movements of foreign currencies, which may affect future costs and cash flows. our foreign operations are conducted in the british pound sterling, euro, swiss franc, australian dollar, singapore dollar, canadian dollar, hong kong dollar and the japanese yen. our primary currency exposures are to the british pound sterling, euro and the singapore dollar. we attempt to mitigate a portion of the risk of currency fluctuation by financing our investments in the local currency denominations, although there can be no assurance that this will be effective. as a result, changes in the relation of any such foreign currency to u.s. dollars may affect our revenues, operating margins and distributions and may also affect the book value of our assets and the amount of stockholders' equity.
rental income. the amount of rental income generated by the properties in our portfolio depends on several factors, including our ability to maintain or improve the occupancy rates of currently leased space and to lease currently available space and space available from lease terminations. excluding approximately 1.3 million square feet of space under active development and approximately 1.2 million square feet of space held for future development as of december 31, 2014, the occupancy rate of the properties in our portfolio, including the 14 properties held as investments in unconsolidated joint ventures, was approximately 93.2% of our net rentable square feet.
as of december 31, 2014, we had over 650 tenants in our portfolio, including the 14 properties held in our managed portfolio of unconsolidated joint ventures. as of december 31, 2014, approximately 91% of our leases (on a rentable square footage basis) contained base rent escalations that were either fixed (generally ranging from 2% to 4%) or indexed based on a consumer price index or other similar inflation related index. we cannot assure you that these escalations will cover any increases in our costs or will otherwise keep rental rates at or above market rates.
the amount of rental income generated by us also depends on maintaining or increasing rental rates at our properties, which in turn depends on several factors, including supply and demand and market rates for data center space. included in our approximately 20.3 million net rentable square feet, excluding space under active development and space held for future
51
index to financial statements development and 14 properties held as investments in unconsolidated joint ventures, at december 31, 2014 is approximately 0.6 million square feet of datacenter space with extensive installed tenant improvements available for lease. since our ipo, we have leased approximately 4.0 million square feet of similar space, including turn-key flex® space. our turn-key flex® product is an effective solution for tenants who prefer to utilize a partner with the expertise or capital budget to provide extensive datacenter infrastructure and security. our expertise in datacenter construction and operations enables us to lease space to these tenants at a premium over other uses. in addition, as of december 31, 2014, we had approximately 1.3 million square feet of space under active development and approximately 1.2 million square feet of space held for future development, or approximately 10% of the total rentable space in our portfolio, including one vacant property comprising approximately 0.1 million square feet and the 14 properties held as investments in unconsolidated joint ventures. our ability to grow earnings depends in part on our ability to develop space and lease development space at favorable rates, which we may not be able to obtain. development space requires significant capital investment in order to develop datacenter facilities that are ready for use and, in addition, we may require additional time or encounter delays in securing tenants for development space. we may purchase additional vacant properties and properties with vacant development space in the future. we will require additional capital to finance our development activities, which may not be available or may not be available on terms acceptable to us, including as a result of the conditions described above under "global market and economic conditions."
in addition, the timing between when we sign a new lease with a tenant and when that lease commences and we begin to generate rental income may be significant and may not be easily predictable. certain leases may provide for staggered commencement dates for additional space, the timing of which may be delayed significantly.
economic downturns, including as a result of the conditions described above under "global market and economic conditions," or regional downturns affecting our markets or downturns in the technology-related real estate industry that impair our ability to lease or renew or re-lease space, or otherwise reduce returns on our investments or the ability of our tenants to fulfill their lease commitments, as in the case of tenant bankruptcies, could adversely affect our ability to maintain or increase rental rates at our properties.
52
index to financial statements scheduled lease expirations. our ability to re-lease expiring space at rental rates equal to or in excess of current rental rates will impact our results of operations. in addition to approximately 1.5 million square feet of available space in our portfolio, which excludes approximately 1.3 million square feet of space under active development and approximately 1.2 million square feet of space held for future development as of december 31, 2014 and the two properties held as investments in our non-managed unconsolidated joint ventures, leases representing approximately 8.0% and 6.7% of the net rentable square footage of our portfolio are scheduled to expire during the years ending december 31, 2015 and 2016, respectively.
during the year ended december 31, 2014, we signed new leases totaling approximately 1.4 million square feet of space and renewal leases totaling approximately 1.3 million square feet of space. the following table summarizes our leasing activity in the year ended december 31, 2014:

(1)   for some of our properties, we calculate square footage based on factors in addition to contractually leased square feet, including power, required support space and common area.
(2)   rental rates represent annual estimated cash rent per rentable square foot adjusted for straight-line rents in accordance with gaap. gaap rental rates are inclusive of tenant concessions, if any.
(3)   excludes short term leases.
(4)   commencement dates for the leases signed range from 2014 to 2017.
(5)   includes leases signed for new and re-leased space.
our ability to re-lease or renew expiring space at rental rates equal to or in excess of current rental rates will impact our results of operations. we continue to see strong demand in most of our key markets for datacenter space and, subject to the supply of available datacenter space in these markets, expect the rental rates we are likely to achieve on any new, re-leased or renewed datacenter space leases for 2015 expirations on an average aggregate basis will generally be higher than the rates currently being paid for the same space on a gaap basis and flat on a cash basis. for the year ended december 31, 2014, rents on renewed space increased by an average of 6.3% on a gaap basis on our turn-key flex® space compared to the expiring rents and increased by an average of 26.5% on a gaap basis on our powered base building® space compared to the expiring rents. our past performance may not be indicative of future results, and we cannot assure you that leases will be renewed or that our properties will be re-leased at all or at rental rates equal to or above the current average rental rates. further, re-leased/
53
index to financial statements renewed rental rates in a particular market may not be consistent with rental rates across our portfolio as a whole and may fluctuate from one period to another due to a number of factors, including local real estate conditions, local supply and demand for datacenter space, competition from other datacenter developers or operators, the condition of the property and whether the property, or space within the property, has been developed.
market concentration. we depend on the market for technology-based real estate in specific geographic regions and significant changes in these regional markets can impact our future results. as of december 31, 2014, our portfolio, including the 14 properties held as investments in unconsolidated joint ventures, was geographically concentrated in the following metropolitan markets:

(1)   annualized rent is monthly contractual rent (defined as cash base rent before abatements) under existing leases as of december 31, 2014 multiplied by 12. the aggregate amount of abatements for the year ended december 31, 2014 was approximately $31.1 million.
operating expenses. our operating expenses generally consist of utilities, property and ad valorem taxes, property management fees, insurance and site maintenance costs, as well as rental expenses on our ground and building leases. in particular, our buildings require significant power to support the datacenter operations contained in them. many of our leases contain provisions under which the tenants reimburse us for a portion of property operating expenses and real estate taxes incurred by us. however, we generally are not entitled to reimbursement of property operating expenses, other than utility expense, and real estate taxes under our leases for turn-key flex® facilities. we also incur general and administrative expenses, including expenses relating to our asset management function, as well as significant legal, accounting and other expenses related to corporate governance, sec reporting and compliance with the various provisions of the sarbanes-oxley act. increases or decreases in such operating expenses will impact our overall performance. we expect to incur additional operating expenses as we continue to expand.
climate change legislation. in june 2009, the u.s. house of representatives approved comprehensive clean energy and climate change legislation intended to cut greenhouse gas, or ghg, emissions, create new clean energy jobs and enhance the energy independence of the united states, which included a cap-and-trade program for ghg emissions. the u.s. senate did not subsequently pass similar legislation. new climate change legislation was introduced in the u.s. senate in 2013, but significant opposition to federal climate change legislation exists. as a result, near-term action to reduce ghg emissions likely will be focused on regulatory agencies, primarily the u.s. environmental protection agency, or epa, and state actions. the epa has been moving aggressively to regulate ghg emissions from automobiles and large stationary sources, including electricity producers, using its own authority under the clean air act. the epa made an endangerment finding in 2009 that
54
index to financial statements allows it to create regulations imposing emission reporting, permitting, control technology installation, and monitoring requirements applicable to certain emitters of ghgs, including facilities that provide electricity to our data centers, although the materiality of the impacts will not be known until all regulations are finalized.
the epa has already finalized its ghg "reporting rule," which requires that certain emitters, including electricity generators, monitor and report ghg emissions. the epa has also finalized rules imposing permitting and control technology requirements upon certain newly-constructed or modified facilities which emit ghgs under the clean air act new source review prevention of significant deterioration, or nsr psd, and title v permitting programs. as a result, newly-issued nsr psd or title v permits for new or modified electricity generating and other facilities may need to address ghg emissions, including by requiring the installation of best available control technology. in addition, the epa proposed in april 2012 a rule that would set a ghg emission standard applicable to new electricity generating units, and the epa re-proposed the rule in september 2013. in june 2014, the epa released a proposal to regulate carbon dioxide emissions from existing power plants and set mandatory co2 reduction targets for each state, an effort designed to achieve a thirty percent co2 emission reduction over 2005 levels by 2030. epa announced in january 2015 that it plans to issue in summer 2015 final rules regulating carbon dioxide emissions from new and existing power plants. at the state level, california implemented a ghg cap-and-trade program that began imposing compliance obligations on industrial sectors, including electricity generators and importers, in january 2013. in addition, since 2005 the european union (including the united kingdom) has been operating under a cap-and-trade program, which directly affects the largest emitters of ghgs, including electricity producers from whom we purchase power.
the cost of electric power comprises a significant component of our operating expenses. any additional taxation or regulation of energy use, including as a result of (i) new legislation that congress may pass, (ii) the regulations that the epa has proposed or finalized, (iii) regulations under legislation that states have passed or may pass, or (iv) any further reductions in the eu program could significantly increase our costs, and we may not be able to effectively pass all of these costs on to our tenants. these matters could adversely impact our business, results of operations, or financial condition.
interest rates. as of december 31, 2014, we had approximately $553.9 million of variable rate debt subject to interest rate swap agreements on certain tranches of our unsecured term loan, along with $526.0 million and $422.7 million of variable rate debt that was outstanding on the global revolving credit facility and the unswapped portion of the unsecured term loan, respectively. the availability of debt and equity capital may decrease as a result of the circumstances described above under "global market and economic conditions." the effects on commercial real estate mortgages, if available, include, but may not be limited to: higher loan spreads, tightened loan covenants, reduced loan to value ratios resulting in lower borrower proceeds and higher principal payments. potential future increases in interest rates and credit spreads may increase our interest expense and fixed charges and negatively affect our financial condition and results of operations, potentially impacting our future access to the debt and equity capital markets. increased interest rates may also increase the risk that the counterparties to our swap agreements will default on their obligations, which could further increase our interest expense. if we cannot obtain capital from third party sources, we may not be able to acquire or develop properties when strategic opportunities exist, satisfy our debt service obligations or pay the cash dividends to digital realty trust, inc.'s stockholders necessary to maintain its qualification as a reit.
demand for datacenter space. our portfolio of properties consists primarily of technology-related real estate and datacenter real estate in particular. a decrease in the demand for, or increase in supply of, datacenter space, internet gateway facilities or other technology-related real estate would have a greater adverse effect on our business and financial condition than if we owned a portfolio with a more diversified tenant base or less specialized use. we have invested in building out additional inventory primarily in what we anticipate will be our active major markets prior to having executed leases with respect to this space. we believe that demand continues to exceed supply in most markets in which we operate, particularly in dallas, northern virginia and dublin; whereas we anticipate that our silicon valley market may be at risk of significant over-supply. however, until this inventory is leased up, which will depend on a number of factors, including available datacenter space in these markets, our return on invested capital is negatively impacted. our development activities make us particularly susceptible to general economic slowdowns, including recessions and the other circumstances described above under "global market and economic conditions," as well as adverse developments in the corporate datacenter, internet and data communications and broader technology industries. any such slowdown or adverse development could lead to reduced corporate it spending or reduced demand for datacenter space. reduced demand could also result from business relocations, including to markets that we do not currently serve. changes in industry practice or in technology, such as virtualization technology, more efficient computing or networking devices, or devices that require higher power densities than today's devices, could also reduce demand for the physical datacenter space we provide or make the tenant improvements in our facilities obsolete or in need of significant upgrades to remain viable. in addition, the development of new technologies, the adoption of new industry standards or other factors could render many of our tenants' current products and services obsolete or unmarketable and contribute to a downturn in their businesses, thereby increasing the likelihood that they default under their
55
index to financial statements leases, become insolvent or file for bankruptcy. in addition, demand for datacenter space in our properties, or the rates at which we lease space, may be adversely impacted either across our portfolio or in specific markets as a result of an increase in the number of competitors, or the amount of space being offered in our markets and other markets by our competitors.
critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with u.s. generally accepted accounting principles, or gaap. the preparation of these financial statements in conformity with gaap requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amount of revenues and expenses in the reporting period. our actual results may differ from these estimates. we have provided a summary of our significant accounting policies in note 2 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report. we describe below those accounting policies that require material subjective or complex judgments and that have the most significant impact on our financial condition and consolidated results of operations. our management evaluates these estimates on an ongoing basis, based upon information currently available and on various assumptions management believes are reasonable as of the date on the front cover of this report.
investments in real estate acquisition of real estate. the price that we pay to acquire a property is impacted by many factors including the condition of the property and improvements, the occupancy of the building, the term and rate of in-place leases, the creditworthiness of the tenants, favorable or unfavorable financing, above or below-market ground leases and numerous other factors.
accordingly, we are required to make subjective assessments to allocate the purchase price paid to acquire investments in real estate among the identifiable assets including intangibles and liabilities assumed based on our estimate of the fair value of such assets and liabilities. this includes determining the value of the property and improvements, land, ground leases, if any, and tenant improvements. additionally, we evaluate the value of in-place leases on occupancy and market rent, the value of the tenant relationships, the value (or negative value) of above (or below) market leases, any debt or deferred taxes assumed from the seller or loans made by the seller to us and any building leases assumed from the seller. each of these estimates requires a great deal of judgment and some of the estimates involve complex calculations. these allocation assessments have a direct impact on our results of operations. for example, if we were to allocate more value to land, there would be no depreciation with respect to such amount. if we were to allocate more value to the property as opposed to allocating to the value of in-place tenant leases, this amount would be recognized as an expense over a much longer period of time. this potential effect occurs because the amounts allocated to property are depreciated over the estimated lives of the property whereas amounts allocated to in-place tenant leases are amortized over the estimated term (including renewal and extension assumptions) of the leases. additionally, the amortization of the value (or negative value) assigned to above (or below) market rate leases is recorded as an adjustment to rental revenue as compared to amortization of the value of in-place tenant leases and tenant relationships, which is included in depreciation and amortization in our condensed consolidated income statements.
from time to time, we will receive offers for sale of our properties, either solicited or unsolicited. for those offers that are accepted, the prospective buyer will usually require a due diligence period before consummation of the transaction. it is not unusual for matters to arise that result in the withdrawal or rejection of the offer during this process. we classify real estate as "held for sale" when all criteria under the gaap guidance has been met.
capitalization of costs. direct and indirect project costs that are clearly associated with the development of properties are capitalized as incurred. project costs include all costs directly associated with the development of a property, including construction costs, interest, property taxes, insurance, legal fees and costs of personnel working on the project. indirect costs that do not clearly relate to the projects under development are not capitalized and are charged to expense as incurred.
capitalization of costs begins when the activities necessary to get the development project ready for its intended use begin, which include costs incurred before the beginning of construction. capitalization of costs ceases when the development project is substantially complete and ready for its intended use. determining when a development project commences, and when it is substantially complete and ready for its intended use involves a degree of judgment. we generally consider a development project to be substantially complete and ready for its intended use upon receipt of a certificate of occupancy. if and when development of a property is suspended pursuant to a formal change in the planned use of the property, we will evaluate whether the accumulated costs exceed the estimated value of the project and write off the amount of any such excess accumulated costs. for a development project that is suspended for reasons other than a formal change in the planned use of such property, the accumulated project costs are evaluated for impairment consistent with our impairment policies for long-lived assets. capitalized costs are allocated to the specific components of a project that are benefited.
56
index to financial statements useful lives of assets. we are required to make subjective assessments as to the useful lives of our properties for purposes of determining the amount of depreciation to record on an annual basis with respect to our investments in real estate. these assessments have a direct impact on our net income because if we were to shorten the expected useful lives of our investments in real estate we would depreciate such investments over fewer years, resulting in more depreciation expense and lower net income on an annual basis.
asset impairment evaluation. we review each of our properties for indicators that its carrying amount may not be recoverable. examples of such indicators may include a significant decrease in the market price of the property, a change in the expected holding period for the property, a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which the property is being used in its physical condition or expected to be used based on the underwriting at the time of acquisition, an accumulation of costs significantly in excess of the amount originally expected for the acquisition or development of the property, or a history of operating or cash flow losses of the property. when such impairment indicators exist, we review an estimate of the future undiscounted net cash flows (excluding interest charges) expected to result from the real estate investment's use and eventual disposition and compare that estimate to the carrying value of the property. we consider factors such as future operating income, trends and prospects, as well as the effects of leasing demand, competition and other factors. if our future undiscounted net cash flow evaluation indicates that we are unable to recover the carrying value of a real estate investment, an impairment loss is recorded to the extent that the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value of the property. these losses have a direct impact on our net income because recording an impairment loss results in an immediate negative adjustment to net income. the evaluation of anticipated cash flows is highly subjective and is based in part on assumptions regarding future occupancy, rental rates and capital requirements that could differ materially from actual results in future periods. since cash flows on properties considered to be long-lived assets to be held and used are considered on an undiscounted basis to determine whether the carrying value of a property is recoverable, our strategy of holding properties over the long-term directly decreases the likelihood of their carrying values not being recoverable and therefore requiring the recording of an impairment loss. if our strategy changes or market conditions otherwise dictate an earlier sale date, an impairment loss may be recognized and such loss could be material. if we determine that the asset fails the recoverability test, the affected assets must be reduced to their fair value.
we generally estimate the fair value of rental properties utilizing a discounted cash flow analysis that includes projections of future revenues, expenses and capital improvement costs that a market participant would use based on the highest and best use of the asset, which is similar to the income approach that is commonly utilized by appraisers. in certain cases, we may supplement this analysis by obtaining outside broker opinions of value.
revenue recognition rental revenue is recognized using the straight-line method over the terms of the tenant leases. deferred rents included in our condensed consolidated balance sheets represent the aggregate excess of rental revenue recognized to date on a straight-line basis versus the contractual rental payments under the terms of the leases. many of our leases contain provisions under which the tenants reimburse us for a portion of property operating expenses and real estate taxes incurred by us. however, we generally are not entitled to reimbursement of property operating expenses, other than utility expense, and real estate taxes under our leases for turn-key flex® facilities. such reimbursements are recognized in the period that the expenses are incurred. lease termination fees are recognized over the remaining term of the lease, effective as of the date the lease modification is finalized, assuming collection is not considered doubtful. as discussed above, we recognize amortization of the value of acquired above or below-market tenant leases as a reduction of rental revenue in the case of above-market leases or an increase to rental revenue in the case of below-market leases.
we must make subjective estimates as to when our revenue is earned and the collectability of our accounts receivable related to minimum rent, deferred rent, expense reimbursements, lease termination fees and other income. we specifically analyze accounts receivable and historical bad debts, tenant concentrations, tenant creditworthiness and current economic trends when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for bad debts. these estimates have a direct impact on our net revenue because a higher bad debt allowance would result in lower net revenue, and recognizing rental revenue as earned in one period versus another would result in higher or lower net revenue for a particular period.
share-based awards we recognize compensation expense related to share-based awards. we generally amortize this compensation expense over the vesting period of the award. the calculation of the fair value of share-based awards is subjective and requires several assumptions over such items as expected stock volatility, dividend payments and future company results. these assumptions have a direct impact on our net income because a higher share-based awards amount would result in lower net income for a particular period.

our property portfolio has experienced consistent and significant growth since the first property acquisition in january 2002. as a result of this growth, our period-to-period comparison of our financial performance focuses on the impact on our revenues and expenses resulting both from the property additions to our portfolio, as well as on a "same store" property basis (same store properties are properties that were owned as of december 31, 2012 and excludes 10 properties that were contributed to our joint venture with the prei®-managed fund in september 2013 and march 2014 and one property that was contributed to our joint venture with the gcear affiliate in september 2014 along with any properties that have been sold) and on a stabilized portfolio basis. our stabilized portfolio includes properties owned as of december 31, 2012 with less than 5% of total rentable square feet under development and excludes properties that were undergoing, or were expected to undergo, development activities in 2013-2014 and properties sold or contributed to joint ventures. the following table identifies each of the properties in our portfolio acquired from january 1, 2012 through december 31, 2014.

same store rental revenues increased for the year ended december 31, 2014 compared to the same period in 2013 primarily as a result of new leases at our properties during 2014, including leases of completed development space, the largest of which were for space in the sentrum portfolio, 43940 digital loudoun plaza, 350 east cermak road and 2121 south price road. same store growth was driven by the delivery of approximately 443,000 square feet of leased data center space from within our same store development platform during the last 12 months. in our same store portfolio, we calculate the change in rental rates on renewals signed during the quarter as compared to the previous rent on that same space. during the twelve months ended december 31, 2014, the percentage increase was 12.4% on a gaap basis. same store rental revenues increased for the year ended december 31, 2014 as compared to the same period in 2013 as a result of the increase in rentable square feet of leased data center space. during the twelve months ended december 31, 2014, we also delivered approximately 195,000

index to financial statements square feet of un-leased data center space which was one of the drivers impacting occupancy which increased slightly to 93.2% as of december 31, 2014 from 92.6% as of december 31, 2013. same store tenant reimbursement revenues increased for the year ended december 31, 2014 as compared to the same period in 2013 primarily as a result of new leasing and higher utility and operating expenses being billed to our tenants, the largest occurrences of which were at the sentrum portfolio, 365 south randolphville road, 43940 digital loudoun plaza and 350 east cermak road.
excluding the effect of 11 properties contributed to our unconsolidated joint ventures and 6 braham street (sold in april 2014), non-same store properties revenues increased approximately $11.7 million for the year ended december 31, 2014 compared to the same period in 2013. for the year ended december 31, 2014, 1500 towerview road, 7401 e. ben white boulevard and 371 gough road contributed $6.3 million, or 79%, respectively, of the non-same store increase in rental revenues and tenant reimbursements compared to the same period in 2013.

same store rental revenues increased for the year ended december 31, 2013 compared to the same period in 2012 primarily as a result of new leases at our properties during 2013, including leases of completed development space, the largest of which were for space in 29a international business park, 43940 digital loudoun plaza, 98 radnor drive and 3825 nw aloclek place. same store growth was driven by the delivery of approximately 585,000 square feet of leased data center space from within our same store development platform during the last 12 months. in our same store portfolio, we calculate the change in rental rates on renewals signed during the quarter as compared to the previous rent on that same space. during the twelve months ended december 31, 2013, the percentage increase was 17.6% on a gaap basis. same store rental revenues increased for the year ended december 31, 2013 as compared to the same period in 2012 as a result of the increase in rentable square feet of leased data center space. during the twelve months ended december 31, 2013, we also delivered approximately 119,000 square feet of un-leased data center space which was one of the drivers impacting occupancy which decreased slightly to 91.2% as of december 31, 2013 from 93.3% as of december 31, 2012 along with certain leases expiring at one of our non-technical properties during 2013. rental revenue included amounts earned from leases with the tel(x) group, inc., or tel(x), which was sold to an unrelated third party in 2011, of approximately $48.6 million and $45.7 million for the year ended december 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively. same store tenant reimbursement revenues increased for the year ended december 31, 2013 as compared to the same period in 2012 primarily as a result of new leasing and higher utility and operating expenses being billed to our tenants, the largest occurrences of which were at 29a international business park, 365 south randolphville road and 350 east cermak road.
non-same store properties increases were caused by properties acquired during the period from january 1, 2012 to december 31, 2013. for the year ended december 31, 2013, the sentrum portfolio, 9333, 9355, 9377 grand avenue and 400 s. akard contributed $56.3 million, or approximately 84%, of the total non-same store increase in total operating expenses (excluding construction management) compared to the same period in 2012.

same store rental property operating and maintenance expenses increased in the year ended december 31, 2014 compared to the same period in 2013 primarily as a result of higher consumption and utility rates in several of our properties along with development projects being placed into service leading to higher utility expense in 2014. in 2013, a non-cash $10.0 million straight-line rent expense adjustment was recorded in rental property operating and maintenance expenses related to a lease amendment executed in september 2010, $7.5 million of this amount related to prior years. this adjustment was deemed to be immaterial to both the current year and prior year financial statements taken as a whole.
same store property taxes increased by approximately $3.7 million in the year ended december 31, 2014 compared to the same period in 2013, primarily as a result of higher supplemental property tax assessments at three of our properties in 2014.
same store depreciation and amortization expense increased by approximately $69.7 million in the year ended december 31, 2014 compared to the same period in 2013, principally because of depreciation of development projects that were placed into service in late 2013 and during 2014.
general and administrative expenses increased by approximately $27.5 million in the year ended december 31, 2014 compared to the same period in 2013 primarily due to the growth of our company, with an increase in headcount from 784 in 2013 to 860 in 2014, resulting in additional compensation, along with higher professional fees, marketing expenses and $12.7 million severance related to the departure of our former chief executive officer, michael foust recorded in the year ended december 31, 2014. the severance was determined in accordance with the non-cause termination provisions of mr. foust's existing employment agreement and applicable equity award agreements with the company.
same store interest expense decreased by approximately $25,000 for the year ended december 31, 2014 as compared to the same period in 2013 primarily as a result of interest on our 2023 notes that were issued in april 2014 partially offset by

index to financial statements lower average outstanding mortgage loan balances during 2014 compared to 2013 primarily due to the repayment of the following mortgage loans: clonshaugh industrial estate ii (june 2013), 1500 space park drive (july 2013), paul van vlissingenstraat 16 (july 2013), chemin de l'epinglier 2 (july 2013), mundells roundabout (october 2013), gyroscoopweg 2e-2f (october 2013) and 360 spear street (november 2013) along with the redemption of the 2029 debentures in april 2014. during the years ended december 31, 2014 and 2013, we capitalized interest of approximately $20.4 million and $26.3 million, respectively.
excluding the effect of 11 properties contributed to our unconsolidated joint ventures (in 2013 and 2014) and 6 braham street (sold in april 2014), non-same store expenses (excluding construction management and transactions expenses) increased approximately $5.4 million for the year ended december 31, 2014, respectively, compared to the same period in 2013. for the year ended december 31, 2014, 371 gough road, 7401 e. ben white boulevard, 1500 towerview road and 8201 e. riverside drive contributed $4.1 million, or 76% of the total non-same store increase in total operating expenses (excluding construction management and transactions expenses) compared to the same period in 2013.
transactions expense decreased by approximately $3.3 million in the year ended december 31, 2014 compared to the same period in 2013, principally because there have been no significant acquisitions in 2014 compared to the acquisition of seven properties in the year ended december 31, 2013.

pre-stabilized interest expense increased approximately $23.1 million for the year ended december 31, 2014, as compared to the same period in 2013 primarily as a result of interest expense on our 2023 notes, which were issued in april 2014.
transactions expense decreased by approximately $3.3 million in the year ended december 31, 2014, compared to the same period in 2013, principally because there have been no significant acquisitions in 2014 compared to the acquisition of seven properties in the year ended december 31, 2013.

stabilized rental property operating and maintenance expenses increased approximately $15.4 million in year ended december 31, 2013, compared to the same period in 2012 primarily as a result of a $10.0 million non-cash straight-line rent expense adjustment related to our leasehold interest at 111 8th avenue in new york recorded during the three months ended september 30, 2013.
stabilized property taxes increased by approximately $9.5 million in the year ended december 31, 2013, compared to the same period in 2012, primarily as a result of supplemental property taxes from prior tax years for certain properties in the stabilized portfolio recorded in 2013.

impairment of investments in real estate we are currently in the process of identifying certain non-core investment properties we intend to sell as part of our capital recycling strategy. our capital recycling program is designed to identify non-strategic and underperforming assets that can be sold to generate proceeds that will support the funding of our core investment activity. we expect our capital recycling initiative will likewise have a meaningfully positive impact on overall return on invested capital. during this process, we are evaluating the carrying value of certain investment properties identified for potential sale to ensure the carrying value is recoverable in light of a potentially shorter holding period. as a result of our evaluation, during the year ended december 31, 2014, we recognized $126.5 million of impairment losses on five properties located in the midwest, northeast and west regions. as of december 31, 2014, these properties do not meet the criteria to be classified as held for sale.
gain on sale of property during the year ended december 31, 2014, we recognized a gain on sale of property of $15.9 million, related to the disposition of 6 braham street, which sold for £25.0 million (or approximately $41.5 million based on the exchange rate as of april 7, 2014, the date of sale).
gain on contribution of properties to unconsolidated joint ventures during the year ended december 31, 2014, we recognized gains of $95.4 million, respectively, related to the contribution of two properties to two unconsolidated joint ventures. we received net proceeds of approximately $178.9 million in connection with these two transactions and retained a 20% interest in each of the joint ventures.
during the year ended december 31, 2013, we recognized a gain of $115.6 million related to the contribution of nine properties to an unconsolidated joint venture. we received net proceeds of approximately $328.6 million in connection with this transaction and retained a 20% interest in the joint venture.
liquidity and capital resources of the parent company in this "liquidity and capital resources of the parent company" section and in the "liquidity and capital resources of the operating partnership" section below, the term, our "parent company", refers to digital realty trust, inc. on an unconsolidated basis, excluding our operating partnership.
analysis of liquidity and capital resources our parent company's business is operated primarily through our operating partnership of which our parent company is the sole general partner and which it consolidates for financial reporting purposes. because our parent company operates on a consolidated basis with our operating partnership, the section entitled "liquidity and capital resources of the operating partnership" should be read in conjunction with this section to understand the liquidity and capital resources of our parent company on a consolidated basis and how our company is operated as a whole.
our parent company issues public equity from time to time, but does not otherwise generate any capital itself or conduct any business itself, other than incurring certain expenses in operating as a public company which are fully reimbursed by the operating partnership. our parent company itself does not hold any indebtedness other than guarantees of the indebtedness of
68
index to financial statements our operating partnership and certain of its subsidiaries, and its only material asset is its ownership of partnership interests of our operating partnership. therefore, the consolidated assets and liabilities and the consolidated revenues and expenses of our parent company and our operating partnership are the same on their respective financial statements, except for immaterial differences related to cash, other assets and accrued liabilities that arise from public company expenses paid by our parent company. however, all debt is held directly or indirectly at the operating partnership level. our parent company's principal funding requirement is the payment of dividends on its common and preferred shares. our parent company's principal source of funding for its dividend payments is distributions it receives from our operating partnership.
as the sole general partner of our operating partnership, our parent company has the full, exclusive and complete responsibility for our operating partnership's day-to-day management and control. our parent company causes our operating partnership to distribute such portion of its available cash as our parent company may in its discretion determine, in the manner provided in our operating partnership's partnership agreement. our parent company receives proceeds from its equity issuances from time to time, but is generally required by our operating partnership's partnership agreement to contribute the proceeds from its equity issuances to our operating partnership in exchange for partnership units of our operating partnership.
our parent company is a well-known seasoned issuer with an effective shelf registration statement filed on april 23, 2012 that allows our parent company to register an unspecified amount of various classes of equity securities. as circumstances warrant, our parent company may issue equity from time to time on an opportunistic basis, dependent upon market conditions and available pricing. any proceeds from such equity issuances would be generally contributed to our operating partnership in exchange for additional equity interests in our operating partnership. our operating partnership may use the proceeds to acquire additional properties, to fund development opportunities and for general working capital purposes, including potentially for the repurchase, redemption or retirement of outstanding debt or equity securities.
the liquidity of our parent company is dependent on our operating partnership's ability to make sufficient distributions to our parent company. the primary cash requirement of our parent company is its payment of dividends to its stockholders. our parent company also guarantees our operating partnership's, as well as certain of its subsidiaries', unsecured debt. if our operating partnership or such subsidiaries fail to fulfill their debt requirements, which trigger parent company guarantee obligations, then our parent company will be required to fulfill its cash payment commitments under such guarantees. however, our parent company's only asset is its investment in our operating partnership.
we believe our operating partnership's sources of working capital, specifically its cash flow from operations, and funds available under its global revolving credit facility are adequate for it to make its distribution payments to our parent company and, in turn, for our parent company to make its dividend payments to its stockholders. however, we cannot assure you that our operating partnership's sources of capital will continue to be available at all or in amounts sufficient to meet its needs, including making distribution payments to our parent company. the lack of availability of capital could adversely affect our operating partnership's ability to pay its distributions to our parent company, which would in turn, adversely affect our parent company's ability to pay cash dividends to its stockholders.
digital realty trust, inc. entered into equity distribution agreements in june 2011, which we refer to as the 2011 equity distribution agreements, with each of merrill lynch, pierce, fenner & smith incorporated, citigroup global markets inc., credit suisse securities (usa) llc, deutsche bank securities inc. and morgan stanley & co. llc, or the agents, under which it can issue and sell shares of its common stock having an aggregate offering price of up to $400.0 million from time to time through, at its discretion, any of the agents as its sales agents. the sales of common stock made under the 2011 equity distribution agreements will be made in "at the market" offerings as defined in rule 415 of the securities act. to date, digital realty trust, inc. has generated net proceeds of approximately $342.7 million from the issuance of approximately 5.7 million common shares under the 2011 equity distribution agreements at an average price of $60.35 per share after payment of approximately $3.5 million of commissions to the sales agents and before offering expenses. no sales were made under the program during the years ended december 31, 2014 and 2013. as of december 31, 2014, shares of common stock having an aggregate offering price of $53.8 million remained available for offer and sale under the program.
on march 26, 2014 and april 7, 2014, our parent company issued an aggregate of 14.6 million shares of its 7.375% series h cumulative redeemable preferred stock for total net proceeds, after underwriting discounts and estimated offering expenses, of $353.3 million, including the proceeds from the partial exercise of the underwriters' over-allotment option. we used the net proceeds from the offerings to temporarily repay borrowings under our global revolving credit facility.
on april 1, 2014, digital stout holding, llc, a wholly owned subsidiary of digital realty trust, l.p, issued £300.0 million (or approximately $498.9 million based on the april 1, 2014 exchange rate of £1.00 to $1.66) aggregate principal amount of its 4.750% guaranteed notes due 2023, or the 2023 notes. the 2023 notes are senior unsecured obligations of digital stout holding, llc and are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by digital realty trust, inc. and digital realty trust, l.p. interest on the 2023 notes is payable semiannually in arrears at a rate of 4.750% per annum. the 2023 notes will mature on

index to financial statements october 13, 2023. we used the net proceeds from the offering of the 2023 notes to temporarily repay borrowings under our global revolving credit facility.
on april 18, 2014, the operating partnership redeemed for cash approximately $5.2 million in aggregate principal amount of the 2029 debentures pursuant to its option under the indenture governing the 2029 debentures at a price equal to 100% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon up to april 18, 2014. in connection with the redemption, the holders of approximately $261.2 million in aggregate principal amount of the 2029 debentures exchanged such 2029 debentures for an aggregate of 6,734,938 restricted shares of digital realty trust, inc. common stock pursuant to the terms of the indenture governing the 2029 debentures.
on july 11, 2014, we issued an aggregate of 134,974 restricted shares of common stock of digital realty trust, inc. in exchange for approximately $5.2 million in cash to certain previous holders of the 2029 debentures. the holders had the right to exchange the 2029 debentures for shares of digital realty trust, inc. common stock, but inadvertently failed to exercise such rights. as a result, the 2029 debentures were redeemed by the operating partnership for cash. we agreed to issue the restricted shares of the common stock to the holders in exchange for the redemption payment that they received in the original redemption, effectively putting such holders in the same place as if they had originally exercised their rights to exchange their 2029 debentures for the shares of digital realty trust, inc. common stock.
future uses of cash our parent company may from time to time seek to retire, redeem or repurchase its equity or the debt securities of our operating partnership through cash purchases and/or exchanges for equity securities in open market purchases, privately negotiated transactions or otherwise. such repurchases, redemptions or exchanges, if any, will depend on prevailing market conditions, our liquidity requirements, contractual restrictions or other factors. the amounts involved may be material.
we are also subject to the commitments discussed below under "dividends and distributions."
dividends and distributions our parent company is required to distribute 90% of its taxable income (excluding capital gains) on an annual basis in order for it to continue to qualify as a reit for federal income tax purposes. accordingly, our parent company intends to make, but is not contractually bound to make, regular quarterly distributions to its common stockholders from cash flow from our operating partnership's operating activities. while historically our parent company has satisfied this distribution requirement by making cash distributions to its stockholders, it may choose to satisfy this requirement by making distributions of cash or other property. all such distributions are at the discretion of our parent company's board of directors. our parent company considers market factors and our operating partnership's performance in addition to reit requirements in determining distribution levels. our parent company has distributed at least 100% of its taxable income annually since inception to minimize corporate level federal income taxes. amounts accumulated for distribution to stockholders are invested primarily in interest-bearing accounts and short-term interest-bearing securities, which are consistent with our intention to maintain our parent company's status as a reit.
as a result of this distribution requirement, our operating partnership cannot rely on retained earnings to fund its on-going operations to the same extent that other companies whose parent companies are not reits can. our parent company may need to continue to raise capital in the debt and equity markets to fund our operating partnership's working capital needs, as well as potential developments at new or existing properties, acquisitions or investments in existing or newly created joint ventures. in addition, our parent company may be required to use borrowings under our operating partnership's global revolving credit facility, if necessary, to meet reit distribution requirements and maintain our parent company's reit status.
our parent company has declared the following dividends on its common and preferred stock for the years ended december 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012 (in thousands):

distributions out of our parent company's current or accumulated earnings and profits are generally classified as ordinary income whereas distributions in excess of our company's current and accumulated earnings and profits, to the extent of a stockholder's u.s. federal income tax basis in our parent company's stock, are generally classified as a return of capital. distributions in excess of a stockholder's u.s. federal income tax basis in our parent company's stock are generally characterized as capital gain. cash provided by operating activities has been generally sufficient to fund distributions on an annual basis, however, we may also need to utilize borrowings under the global revolving credit facility to fund distributions.
the expected tax treatment of distributions paid on our parent company's common and preferred stock paid in 2014 is as follows: approximately 82% ordinary income and 18% capital gain distribution. the tax treatment of distributions paid on our parent company's common and preferred stock paid in 2013 was as follows: approximately 75% ordinary income and 25% capital gain distribution. the tax treatment of distributions paid on our parent company's common stock paid in 2012 was as follows: approximately 91% ordinary income, 8% return of capital and 1% capital gain distribution. the tax treatment of distributions paid on our parent company's preferred stock paid in 2012 was as follows: approximately 99% ordinary income and 1% capital gain distribution.

analysis of liquidity and capital resources our parent company is our sole general partner and consolidates our results of operations for financial reporting purposes. because we operate on a consolidated basis with our parent company, the section entitled "liquidity and capital resources of the parent company" should be read in conjunction with this section to understand our liquidity and capital resources on a consolidated basis.
as of december 31, 2014, we had $41.3 million of cash and cash equivalents, excluding $11.6 million of restricted cash. restricted cash primarily consists of interest-bearing cash deposits required by the terms of several of our mortgage loans for a variety of purposes, including real estate taxes, insurance, anticipated or contractually obligated tenant improvements, as well as capital expenditures.
our short-term liquidity requirements primarily consist of operating expenses, development costs and other expenditures associated with our properties, distributions to our parent company in order for it to make dividend payments on its preferred stock, distributions to our parent company in order for it to make dividend payments to its stockholders required to maintain its reit status, distributions to the unitholders in our operating partnership, capital expenditures, debt service on our loans and, potentially, acquisitions. we expect to meet our short-term liquidity requirements through net cash provided by operations, restricted cash accounts established for certain future payments and by drawing upon our global revolving credit facility.
on august 15, 2013, we refinanced our global revolving credit facility, increasing the total borrowing capacity to $2.0 billion from $1.8 billion. the global revolving credit facility has an accordion feature that would enable us to increase the borrowing capacity of the credit facility to $2.55 billion, subject to the receipt of lender commitments and other conditions precedent. the refinanced facility matures on november 3, 2017, with two six-month extension options available. the interest rate for borrowings under the expanded facility equals the applicable index plus a margin which is based on the credit ratings of our long-term debt and is currently 110 basis points. an annual facility fee on the total commitment amount of the facility, based on the credit rating of our long-term debt and currently 20 basis points, is payable quarterly. funds may be drawn in u.s., canadian, singapore, australian and hong kong dollars, as well as euro, british pound sterling, swiss franc, japanese yen and mexican peso denominations. as of december 31, 2014, borrowings under the global revolving credit facility bore interest at an overall blended rate of 1.84% comprised of 1.27% (u.s. dollars), 1.61% (british pound sterling), 1.13% (euros), 3.74% (australian dollars), 1.34% (hong kong dollars), 1.17% (japanese yen), 1.64% (singapore dollars) and 2.39% (canadian dollars). the interest rates are based on 1-month libor, 1-month euribor, 1-month bbr, 1-month hibor, 1-month jpy libor, 1-month sidor and 1-month cdor, respectively, plus a margin of 1.10%. the facility also bore a base borrowing rate of 3.35% (usd) which is based on u.s. prime rate plus a margin of 0.10%. we have used and intend to use borrowings under the global revolving credit facility to acquire additional properties, fund development opportunities and to provide for working capital and other corporate purposes, including potentially for the repurchase, redemption or retirement of outstanding debt or equity securities. as of december 31, 2014, we have capitalized approximately $18.0 million of financing costs related to the global revolving credit facility. as of december 31, 2014, approximately $526.0 million was drawn under this facility and $9.3 million of letters of credit were issued, leaving approximately $1.4 billion available for use.
on august 15, 2013, we refinanced the senior unsecured multi-currency term loan facility, increasing its total borrowing capacity to $1.0 billion from $750.0 million. pursuant to the accordion feature, total commitments can be increased to $1.1 billion, subject to the receipt of lender commitments and other conditions precedent. the facility matures on april 16, 2017, with two six-month extension options available. interest rates are based on our senior unsecured debt ratings and are currently 120 basis points over the applicable index for floating rate advances. funds may be drawn in u.s, singapore and australian dollars, as well as euro and british pound sterling denominations with the option to add hong kong dollars and japanese yen upon an accordion exercise. based on exchange rates in effect at december 31, 2014, the balance outstanding is approximately $1.0 billion. we have used borrowings under the term loan for acquisitions, repayment of indebtedness, development, working capital and general corporate purposes. the covenants under the term loan facility are consistent with our global revolving credit facility and, as of december 31, 2014, we were in compliance with all of such covenants. as of december 31, 2014, we have capitalized approximately $8.4 million of financing costs related to the unsecured term loan.

index to financial statements million from the issuance of approximately 5.7 million shares of common stock under the 2011 equity distribution agreements at an average price of $60.35 per share after payment of approximately $3.5 million of commissions to the sales agents before offering expenses. the proceeds from the issuances were contributed to us in exchange for the issuance of approximately 5.7 million common units to our parent company. no sales were made under the program during the years ended december 31, 2014 and 2013. as of december 31, 2014, shares of common stock having an aggregate offering price of $53.8 million remained available for offer and sale under the program.
on march 5, 2014, we contributed the 636 pierce street property, which we acquired in december 2013, to our unconsolidated joint venture with a fund managed by prudential real estate investors (prei®) that was formed in september 2013. the property was valued at approximately $40.4 million and subject to $26.1 million in debt, which the joint venture assumed. the prei® fund contributed approximately $11.4 million in cash for their 80% share of the net asset value of $14.3 million. subsequent to the closing, the joint venture refinanced the existing debt with $23.0 million drawn from the joint venture's bank facility. including the refinance costs, the prei® fund contributed $17.5 million for the 636 pierce street property, bringing their contributed capital in the joint venture to $164.8 million. we recognized a gain of approximately $1.9 million on the sale of the 80% interest during the three months ended march 31, 2014.
on april 7, 2014, the operating partnership sold 6 braham street to the tenant pursuant to a sale of the ownership interests in the operating partnership's wholly owned subsidiary that owned the building for £25.0 million (or approximately $41.5 million based on the exchange rate as of april 7, 2014). the transaction after costs and various tenant prepayments resulted in net proceeds of approximately £22.6 million (or approximately $37.5 million based on the exchange rate as of april 7, 2014) and a net gain of approximately $15.9 million.
on september 9, 2014, we formed a joint venture with an affiliate of griffin capital essential asset reit, inc. (gcear). we contributed to the joint venture the property located at 43915 devin shafron drive (building a) in ashburn, virginia, which is a turn-key flex® data center property valued at approximately $185.5 million (excluding approximately $2.1 million of closing costs). gcear contributed cash to the joint venture and will hold an 80% interest in the joint venture. we retained a 20% interest in the joint venture. the joint venture arranged a $102.0 million five-year secured bank loan at libor plus 225 basis points, representing a loan-to-value ratio of approximately 55%. the joint venture entered into an interest rate swap agreement to effectively fix the interest rate on approximately $51.0 million of borrowings under the loan through september 2019. two one-year extensions of the maturity date are available under the loan agreement, which the joint venture may exercise if certain conditions are met. proceeds from this loan offset the initial cash capital contribution amount required from gcear and was used to provide us with a special distribution on account of a portion of the contribution value of the property. the transaction generated approximately $167.5 million of net proceeds to us, comprised of our share of the initial draw-down on the bank loan in addition to gcear's equity contribution, less our share of closing costs. accordingly we recognized a gain of approximately $93.5 million on the sale of the 80% interest in the joint venture during the year ended december 31, 2014.
on october 17, 2014, we closed on the sale of our $17.1 million investment in a developer of data centers in the southwestern u.s. and mexico, generating net proceeds of approximately $31.7 million. we recognized a gain on sale of approximately $14.6 million.
the growing acceptance by private institutional investors of the data center asset class has generally pushed capitalization rates lower; as such private investors typically have lower return expectations than we do. as a result, we anticipate that near-term acquisitions activity will comprise a smaller percentage of our growth until seller price expectations realign with our return requirements.

land inventory and space held for development reflect cumulative cost spent pending future development. base building construction consists of ongoing improvements to building infrastructure in preparation for future datacenter fit-out. datacenter construction includes 0.6 million square feet of turn key flex®, powered base building®, and custom solutions product with a cost to date of approximately $370.0 million. generally, we expect to deliver the space within 12 months; however, lease commencement dates may significantly impact final delivery schedules. equipment pool and other inventory represent the value of long-lead equipment and materials required for timely deployment and delivery of datacenter construction fit-out. campus, tenant improvements and other costs include the value of development work which benefits space recently converted to our operating portfolio and is composed primarily of shared infrastructure projects and first generation tenant improvements.
in may 2013, we received insurance settlement proceeds of approximately $8.6 million related to disputed construction costs, a portion of which has been recorded as a gain on settlement in our consolidated income statement included elsewhere in this report.
future uses of cash our properties require periodic investments of capital for tenant-related capital expenditures and for general capital improvements. as of december 31, 2014, we had approximately 1.3 million square feet of space under active development and approximately 1.2 million square feet of space held for future development and we also owned approximately 0.6 million net rentable square feet of datacenter space with extensive installed tenant improvements. turn-key flex® space is move-in-ready space for the placement of computer and network equipment required to provide a datacenter environment. depending on demand for additional turn-key flex® space, we expect to incur significant tenant improvement costs to build out and develop these types of spaces. at december 31, 2014, the approximate 1.3 million square feet of space under active development was under construction for turn-key flex®, powered base building® and custom solutions (formerly referred to as build-to-suit) products, all of which are expected to be income producing on or after completion, in five u.s. domestic markets, one european market, one canadian market, two australian markets and our singapore market, consisting of approximately 0.7 million square feet of base building construction and 0.6 million square feet of data center construction. at december 31, 2014, we had commitments under construction contracts for approximately $156.5 million. we currently expect to incur approximately $750.0 million to $850.0 million of capital expenditures for our development programs during the year ending december 31,

total capital expenditures (excluding indirect)               $804,807                  $1,091,226
for the year ended december 31, 2014, total capital expenditures decreased $286.4 million to approximately $804.8 million from $1,091.2 million for the same period in 2013. capital expenditures on our development projects plus our enhancement and improvements projects for the year ended december 31, 2014 were approximately $752.2 million, which reflects a decrease of approximately 28% from the same period in 2013. this decrease was primarily due to completion of and decreased spending for ground-up custom solutions projects, turn-key flex and base building improvements. our development capital expenditures are generally funded by our available cash and equity and debt capital.
indirect costs, including capitalized interest, capitalized in the years ended december 31, 2014 and 2013 were $70.5 million and $64.7 million, respectively. capitalized interest comprised approximately $20.4 million and $26.3 million, respectively, of the total indirect costs capitalized for the years ended december 31, 2014 and 2013. capitalized interest in the year ended december 31, 2014 decreased compared to the same period in 2013 due to a reduction in qualifying activities. excluding capitalized interest, the increase in indirect costs in the year ended december 31, 2014 compared to the same period in 2013 was primarily due to capitalized amounts relating to compensation expense of employees directly engaged in construction and leasing activities. see "-future uses of cash" above for a discussion of the amount of capital expenditures we expect to incur during the year ending december 31, 2015.
the environmental cleanup work required at the 47700 kato road and 1055 page avenue property resulting from a prior tenant's activities has been completed. the prior tenant of these buildings completed most of the remaining required environmental cleanup work.  we intend to seek recovery of past costs incurred for previous environmental cleanup work, as well as other damages.  we cannot at this time estimate the likelihood of recovery or the impact on our financial condition and results of operations, however, the amounts are not expected to be material.
we are also subject to the commitments discussed below under "commitments and contingencies," "off-balance sheet arrangements" and "distributions."
we actively pursue opportunities for potential acquisitions, with due diligence and negotiations often at different stages at different times. the dollar value of acquisitions for the year ending december 31, 2015 will be based on numerous factors, including tenant demand, leasing results, availability of debt or equity capital and acquisition opportunities.
we may from time to time seek to retire or repurchase our outstanding debt or the equity of our parent company through cash purchases and/or exchanges for equity securities of our parent company in open market purchases, privately negotiated transactions or otherwise. such repurchases or exchanges, if any, will depend on prevailing market conditions, our liquidity requirements, contractual restrictions or other factors. the amounts involved may be material.
we expect to meet our short- and long-term liquidity requirements, including to pay for scheduled debt maturities and to fund property acquisitions and non-recurring capital improvements, with net cash from operations, future long-term secured and unsecured indebtedness and the issuance of equity and debt securities and the proceeds of equity issuances by our parent company. we also may fund future short- and long-term liquidity requirements, including property acquisitions and non-recurring capital improvements using our global revolving credit facility pending permanent financing. if we are not able to obtain additional financing on terms attractive to us, or at all, including as a result of the circumstances described above under "factors which may influence future results of operations-global market and economic conditions", we may be required to reduce our acquisition or capital expenditure plans, which could have a material adverse effect upon our business and results of operations.

index to financial statements commitments and contingencies as part of the 29a international business park asset acquisition in 2010, the seller could earn additional consideration based on future net operating income growth in excess of certain performance targets, as defined in the agreements for the acquisition. as of december 31, 2014, certain leases executed subsequent to purchase have caused an amount to become probable of payment and therefore approximately $12.6 million has been accrued in accounts payable and accrued liabilities and capitalized to buildings and improvements in the consolidated balance sheet as of december 31, 2014. the maximum amount that could be earned by the seller is $50.0 million sgd (or approximately $37.7 million based on the exchange rate as of december 31, 2014). the earnout contingency expires in november 2020.
one of the tenants at our convergence business park property has an option to expand as part of their lease agreement, which expires in april 2017. as part of this option, development activities were not permitted on specifically identified expansion space within the property until april 2014. from april 2014 through april 2017, the tenant has the right of first refusal on any third party's bona fide offer to buy the adjacent land. if the tenant exercises their option, we may either construct and lease to the tenant an additional shell building on the expansion space at a stipulated rate of return on cost or sell the existing building and the expansion space to the tenant for a price of approximately $24.0 million and $225,000 per square acre, respectively, plus additional adjustments as provided in the lease.
as part of the acquisition of the sentrum portfolio, the seller could earn additional consideration based on future net returns on vacant space to be developed, but not currently leased, as defined in the purchase agreement for the acquisition. the initial estimate of fair value of the contingent consideration liability was approximately £56.5 million (or approximately $87.6 million based on the exchange rate as of july 11, 2012, the acquisition date). we have adjusted the contingent consideration to fair value at each reporting date with changes in fair value recognized in operating income. at december 31, 2014, the fair value of the contingent consideration for sentrum was £30.3 million (or approximately $47.2 million based on the exchange rate as of december 31, 2014) and is currently accrued in accounts payable and other accrued expenses in the consolidated balance sheet. we made earnout payments of approximately £6.2 million (or approximately $10.3 million based on the exchange rates as of the date of each payment) during the year ended december 31, 2014. during the year ended december 31, 2013, we made earnout payments of approximately £16.9 million (or approximately $25.8 million based on the exchange rates as of the date of each payment). from the acquisition date through december 31, 2014, we have made earnout payments of approximately £23.1 million (or approximately $36.1 million based on the exchange rates as of the date of each payment). the change in fair value of contingent consideration for sentrum was recorded as a reduction to operating expense of approximately $8.4 million, $1.8 million and $1.1 million for the years ended december 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. the fair value of this liability will be reassessed on a quarterly basis, with any changes being recognized in earnings. increases or decreases in the fair value of the liability can result from changes in discount periods, discount rates and probabilities that contingencies will be met. the earn-out contingency expires in july 2015.
during the year ended december 31, 2014, we rescinded the terms of a separation arrangement entered into with a former executive asserting that he has breached certain of his obligations and is no longer entitled to payment of previously accrued severance benefits, including cash payments and the vesting of certain equity awards. the former executive disputes our right to withhold his severance benefits and contends that he has not breached his obligations. in the latter portion of 2014, the former executive filed a demand for arbitration, which we challenged. we subsequently filed a complaint against the former executive for breach of contract and other claims. the former executive has asserted counterclaims against us for breach of contract and other claims. we cannot assure you of the outcome of this litigation. should we prevail, however, some or all of the previously accrued severance cost may be reversed. we cannot estimate the potential expense recovery, if any, at this time.
as of december 31, 2014, we were a party to interest rate swap agreements which hedge variability in cash flows related the u.s. libor and sgd-sor based tranches of the unsecured term loan. under these swaps, we pay variable-rate amounts in exchange for fixed-rate payments over the life of the agreements without exchange of the underlying principal amounts. see item 7a "quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk."

as of december 31, 2014, we had approximately $4.7 billion of outstanding consolidated long-term debt as set forth in the table above. our ratio of debt to total enterprise value was approximately 31% (based on the closing price of digital realty trust, inc.'s common stock on december 31, 2014 of $66.30). for this purpose, our total enterprise value is defined as the sum of the market value of digital realty trust, inc.'s outstanding common stock (which may decrease, thereby increasing our debt to total enterprise value ratio), excluding options issued under our incentive award plan, plus the liquidation value of digital realty trust, inc.'s preferred stock, plus the aggregate value of our operating partnership's units not held by digital realty trust, inc. (with the per unit value equal to the market value of one share of digital realty trust, inc.'s common stock and

cash provided by operating activities were consistent from 2014 to 2013 and increased in 2013 from 2012. the 2013 increase was due to increased revenues from new leasing at our same store properties, completed and leased development space and our acquisition of new operating properties which was partially offset by increased operating and interest expenses. we acquired 0, 7 and 15 properties during the years ended december 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively.
net cash used in investing activities decreased for 2014, as we had a decrease in cash paid for capital expenditures for the year ended december 31, 2014 ($852.4 million) as compared to the same period in 2013 ($1,189.5 million), along with a decrease in cash paid for acquisitions for the year ended december 31, 2014 ($24.3 million) as compared to in the same period in 2013 ($170.3 million).
net cash used in investing activities decreased in 2013 as compared to 2012, as we had a decrease in cash paid for acquisitions for the year ended december 31, 2013 ($170.3 million) as compared to the same period in 2012 ($1.6 billion) offset by an increase in cash paid for capital expenditures for the year ended december 31, 2013 ($1.2 billion) as compared to the same period in 2012 ($845.8 million). in addition, cash used in investing activities was lower in 2013 due to the contribution of properties to the joint venture with prudential in september 2013 ($328.6 million).

noncontrolling interests in operating partnership noncontrolling interests relate to the common units in our operating partnership that are not owned by digital realty trust, inc., which, as of december 31, 2014, amounted to 2.2% of our operating partnership common units. in conjunction with our formation, our operating partnership issued common units to third party sellers in connection with our acquisition of real estate interests from such third parties.
limited partners who acquired common units in connection with our formation have the right to require our operating partnership to redeem part or all of their common units for cash based upon the fair market value of an equivalent number of shares of digital realty trust, inc. common stock at the time of the redemption. alternatively, we may elect to acquire those common units in exchange for shares of digital realty trust, inc. common stock on a one-for-one basis, subject to adjustment in the event of stock splits, stock dividends, issuance of stock rights, specified extraordinary distributions and similar events. pursuant to registration rights agreements we entered into with third party contributors, we filed a shelf registration statement covering the issuance of the shares of our common stock issuable upon redemption of the common units, and the resale of those shares of common stock by the holders.
inflation many of our leases provide for separate real estate tax and operating expense escalations. in addition, many of the leases provide for fixed base rent increases. we believe that inflationary increases may be at least partially offset by the contractual rent increases and expense escalations described above.

index to financial statements funds from operations we calculate funds from operations, or ffo, in accordance with the standards established by the national association of real estate investment trusts, or nareit. ffo represents net income (loss) available to common stockholders (computed in accordance with u.s. gaap), excluding gains (or losses) from sales of property, impairment charges, real estate related depreciation and amortization (excluding amortization of deferred financing costs) and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures. management uses ffo as a supplemental performance measure because, in excluding real estate related depreciation and amortization and gains and losses from property dispositions, it provides a performance measure that, when compared year over year, captures trends in occupancy rates, rental rates and operating costs. we also believe that, as a widely recognized measure of the performance of reits, ffo will be used by investors as a basis to compare our operating performance with that of other reits. however, because ffo excludes depreciation and amortization and captures neither the changes in the value of our properties that result from use or market conditions, nor the level of capital expenditures and leasing commissions necessary to maintain the operating performance of our properties, all of which have real economic effect and could materially impact our financial condition and results from operations, the utility of ffo as a measure of our performance is limited. other reits may not calculate ffo in accordance with the nareit definition and, accordingly, our ffo may not be comparable to such other reits' ffo. accordingly, ffo should be considered only as a supplement to net income as a measure of our performance.

index to financial statements new accounting pronouncements issued but not yet adopted in may 2014, the financial accounting standards board (fasb) issued an update (asu 2014-09) establishing asc topic 606, revenue from contracts with customers.  asu 2014-09 establishes a single comprehensive model for entities to use in accounting for revenue arising from contracts with customers and supersedes most of the existing revenue recognition guidance.  asu 2014-09 requires an entity to recognize revenue when it transfers promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services and also requires certain additional disclosures.  asu 2014-09 is effective for interim and annual reporting periods in fiscal years that begin after december 15, 2016.  we are currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of asu 2014-09 on our consolidated financial statements.

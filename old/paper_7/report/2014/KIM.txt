executive summary kimco realty corporation is one of the nation's largest publicly-traded owners and operators of neighborhood and community shopping centers. as of december 31, 2014, the company had interests in 754 shopping center properties (the "combined shopping center portfolio"), aggregating 109.5 million square feet of gross leasable area ("gla") and 533 other property interests, primarily through the company's preferred equity investments and other real estate investments, totaling 11.7 million square feet of gla, for a grand total of 1,287 properties aggregating 121.2 million square feet of gla, located in 41 states, puerto rico, canada, mexico, and chile.
the executive officers are engaged in the day-to-day management and operation of real estate exclusively with the company, with nearly all operating functions, including leasing, asset management, maintenance, construction, legal, finance and accounting, administered by the company.
the company's strategy is to be the premier owner and operator of neighborhood and community shopping centers through investments primarily in the u.s. to achieve this strategy the company is (i) striving to transform the quality of its portfolio by disposing of lesser quality assets and acquiring larger higher quality properties in key markets identified by the company, (ii) simplifying its business by exiting mexico and south america and reducing the number of joint venture investments and (iii) pursuing redevelopment opportunities within its portfolio to increase overall value and certain development opportunities for long-term investment. the company has an active capital recycling program and during the second quarter of 2014, the company implemented a plan to accelerate the disposition of certain non-strategic u.s. properties. this plan effectively shortened the company's anticipated hold period for these properties and as such caused the company to recognize impairment charges on certain consolidated operating properties. if the company accepts sales prices for these assets that are less than their net carrying values, the company would be required to take additional impairment charges. in order to execute the company's strategy, the company intends to continue to strengthen its balance sheet by pursuing deleveraging efforts over time, providing it the necessary flexibility to invest opportunistically and selectively, primarily focusing on neighborhood and community shopping centers in the u.s. the company also has an institutional management business with domestic and foreign institutional partners for the purpose of investing in neighborhood and community shopping centers. in an effort to further its simplification strategy, the company is actively pursuing opportunities to reduce its institutional management business through partner buy-outs, property acquisitions from institutional joint ventures and/or third party property sales.

critical accounting policies the consolidated financial statements of the company include the accounts of the company, its wholly-owned subsidiaries and all entities in which the company has a controlling interest, including where the company has been determined to be a primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity in accordance with the consolidation guidance of the fasb accounting standards codification ("asc"). the company applies these provisions to each of its joint venture investments to determine whether the cost, equity or consolidation method of accounting is appropriate. the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions in certain circumstances that affect amounts reported in the accompanying consolidated financial statements and related notes. in preparing these financial statements, management has made its best estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities. these estimates are based on, but not limited to, historical results, industry standards and current economic conditions, giving due consideration to materiality. the most significant assumptions and estimates relate to revenue recognition and the recoverability of trade accounts receivable, depreciable lives, valuation of real estate and intangible assets and liabilities, valuation of joint venture investments and other investments, realizability of deferred tax assets and uncertain tax positions. application of these assumptions requires the exercise of judgment as to future uncertainties, and, as a result, actual results could materially differ from these estimates.
18
the company is required to make subjective assessments as to whether there are impairments in the value of its real estate properties, investments in joint ventures, marketable securities and other investments. the company's reported net earnings are directly affected by management's estimate of impairments and/or valuation allowances.
revenue recognition and accounts receivable base rental revenues from rental property are recognized on a straight-line basis over the terms of the related leases. certain of these leases also provide for percentage rents based upon the level of sales achieved by the lessee. these percentage rents are recorded once the required sales level is achieved. operating expense reimbursements are recognized as earned. rental income may also include payments received in connection with lease termination agreements. in addition, leases typically provide for reimbursement to the company of common area maintenance, real estate taxes and other operating expenses.
the company makes estimates of the uncollectability of its accounts receivable related to base rents, straight-line rent, expense reimbursements and other revenues. the company analyzes accounts receivable and historical bad debt levels, customer credit-worthiness and current economic trends when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts. in addition, tenants in bankruptcy are analyzed and estimates are made in connection with the expected recovery of pre-petition and post-petition claims. the company's reported net earnings are directly affected by management's estimate of the collectability of accounts receivable.
real estate the company's investments in real estate properties are stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation and amortization. expenditures for maintenance and repairs are charged to operations as incurred. significant renovations and replacements, which improve and extend the life of the asset, are capitalized.
upon acquisition of real estate operating properties, the company estimates the fair value of acquired tangible assets (consisting of land, building, building improvements and tenant improvements) and identified intangible assets and liabilities (consisting of above and below-market leases, in-place leases and tenant relationships, where applicable), assumed debt and redeemable units issued at the date of acquisition, based on evaluation of information and estimates available at that date. fair value is determined based on an exit price approach, which contemplates the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. if, up to one year from the acquisition date, information regarding fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed is received and estimates are refined, appropriate adjustments, if material, are made to the purchase price allocation on a retrospective basis. the company expenses transaction costs associated with business combinations in the period incurred.
depreciation and amortization are provided on the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets, as follows:
buildings and building improvements                 15 to 50 years

fixtures, leasehold and tenant improvements        terms of leases or useful
(including certain identified intangible assets)   lives, whichever is shorter the company is required to make subjective assessments as to the useful lives of its properties for purposes of determining the amount of depreciation to reflect on an annual basis with respect to those properties. these assessments have a direct impact on the company's net earnings.
on a continuous basis, management assesses whether there are any indicators, including property operating performance, changes in anticipated holding period and general market conditions, that the value of the real estate properties (including any related amortizable intangible assets or liabilities) may be impaired. a property value is considered impaired only if management's estimate of current and projected operating cash flows (undiscounted and unleveraged) of the property over its anticipated hold period is less than the net carrying value of the property. such cash flow projections consider factors such as expected future operating income, trends and prospects, as well as the effects of demand, competition and other factors. to the extent impairment has occurred, the carrying value of the property would be adjusted to reflect the estimated fair value of the property.
when a real estate asset is identified by management as held-for-sale, the company ceases depreciation of the asset and estimates the sales price of such asset net of selling costs. if, in management's opinion, the net sales price of the asset is less than the net book value of such asset, an adjustment to the carrying value would be recorded to reflect the estimated fair value of the property.
investments in unconsolidated joint ventures the company accounts for its investments in unconsolidated joint ventures under the equity method of accounting as the company exercises significant influence, but does not control, these entities. these investments are recorded initially at cost and are subsequently adjusted for cash contributions and distributions. earnings for each investment are recognized in accordance with each respective investment agreement and, where applicable, are based upon an allocation of the investment's net assets at book value as if the investment was hypothetically liquidated at the end of each reporting period.
19
the company's joint ventures and other real estate investments primarily consist of co-investments with institutional and other joint venture partners in neighborhood and community shopping center properties, consistent with its core business. these joint ventures typically obtain non-recourse third-party financing on their property investments, thus contractually limiting the company's exposure to losses to the amount of its equity investment, and, due to the lender's exposure to losses, a lender typically will require a minimum level of equity in order to mitigate its risk. the company's exposure to losses associated with its unconsolidated joint ventures is primarily limited to its carrying value in these investments. the company, on a limited selective basis, obtained unsecured financing for certain joint ventures. these unsecured financings are guaranteed by the company with guarantees from the joint venture partners for their proportionate amounts of any guaranty payment the company is obligated to make.
on a continuous basis, management assesses whether there are any indicators, including property operating performance and general market conditions, that the value of the company's investments in unconsolidated joint ventures may be impaired. an investment's value is impaired only if management's estimate of the fair value of the investment is less than the carrying value of the investment and such difference is deemed to be other-than-temporary. to the extent impairment has occurred, the loss shall be measured as the excess of the carrying amount of the investment over the estimated fair value of the investment.
the company's estimated fair values are based upon a discounted cash flow model for each joint venture that includes all estimated cash inflows and outflows over a specified holding period and, where applicable, any estimated debt premiums. capitalization rates, discount rates and credit spreads utilized in these models are based upon rates that the company believes to be within a reasonable range of current market rates.
realizability of deferred tax assets and uncertain tax positions the company is subject to federal, state and local income taxes on the income from its activities relating to its trs activities and subject to local taxes on certain non-u.s. investments. the company accounts for income taxes using the asset and liability method, which requires that deferred tax assets and liabilities be recognized based on future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis. deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply in the years in which temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in earnings in the period when the changes are enacted.
a reduction of the carrying amounts of deferred tax assets by a valuation allowance is required, if based on the evidence available, it is more likely than not (a likelihood of more than 50 percent) that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. the valuation allowance should be sufficient to reduce the deferred tax asset to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized.
the company considers all available evidence, both positive and negative, to determine whether, based on the weight of that evidence, a valuation allowance is needed. information about an enterprise's current financial position and its results of operations for the current and preceding years is supplemented by all currently available information about future years. the company must use judgment in considering the relative impact of negative and positive evidence.
the company believes, when evaluating deferred tax assets within its taxable reit subsidiaries, special consideration should be given to the unique relationship between the company as a reit and its taxable reit subsidiaries. this relationship exists primarily to protect the reit's qualification under the code by permitting, within certain limits, the reit to engage in certain business activities in which the reit cannot directly participate. as such, the reit controls which and when investments are held in, or distributed or sold from, its taxable reit subsidiaries. this relationship distinguishes a reit and taxable reit subsidiary from an enterprise that operates as a single, consolidated corporate taxpayer.
the company primarily utilizes a twenty year projection of pre-tax book income and taxable income as positive evidence to overcome any negative evidence. although items of income and expense utilized in the projection are objectively verifiable there is also significant judgment used in determining the duration and timing of events that would impact the projection. based upon the company's analysis of positive and negative evidence the company will make a determination of the need for a valuation allowance against its deferred tax assets. if future income projections do not occur as forecasted, the company will reevaluate the need for a valuation allowance. in addition, the company can employ additional strategies to realize its deferred tax assets, including transferring a greater portion of its property management business to the trs, sale of certain built-in gain assets, and reducing intercompany debt.
the company recognizes and measures benefits for uncertain tax positions, which requires significant judgment from management. although the company believes it has adequately reserved for any uncertain tax positions, no assurance can be given that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be different. the company adjusts these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the closing of a tax audit or the refinement of an estimate. changes in the recognition or measurement of uncertain tax positions could result in material increases or decreases in the company's income tax expense in the period in which a change is made, which could have a material impact on operating results (see footnote 21 of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this form 10-k).

interest expense decreased $8.4 million to $203.8 million for the year ended december 31, 2014, as compared to $212.2 million for the year ended december 31, 2013.  this decrease is primarily related to lower implied interest rates and reduced borrowing levels during 2014, as compared to 2013.
provision for income taxes, net decreased $10.3 million to $22.4 million for the year ended december 31, 2014, as compared to $32.7 million for the corresponding period in 2013. this change is primarily due to (i) a decrease in foreign tax expense of $9.5 million primarily relating to the sale of certain unconsolidated properties during 2013 within the company's latin american portfolio which were subject to foreign taxes at a consolidated reporting entity level offset by an increase in other foreign uncertain tax positions of $5.5 million, (ii) a decrease in tax provision of $9.1 million relating to a change in control gain recognized during the year ended december 31, 2013, (iii) a decrease in tax provision of $3.4 million related to gains on land sales during 2013, and (iv) a decrease in tax provision of $2.4 million related to gains on sale of certain marketable securities during 2013, partially offset by (v) a partial release of the deferred tax valuation allowance of $8.7 million during the year ended december 31, 2013 related to the company's fnc realty corp.

debt maturities for 2015 consist of: $483.1 million of consolidated debt; $525.7 million of unconsolidated joint venture debt; and $58.7 million of preferred equity debt, assuming the utilization of extension options where available. the 2015 consolidated debt maturities are anticipated to be extended, refinanced or repaid with operating cash flows and borrowings from the company's credit facility (which at december 31, 2014, had $1.65 billion available). the 2015 unconsolidated joint venture and preferred equity debt maturities are anticipated to be extended or repaid through debt refinancing and partner capital contributions, as deemed appropriate.

during 2014, the company repaid (i) its $100.0 million 5.95% senior unsecured notes, which matured in june 2014, and (ii) its remaining $194.6 million 4.82% senior unsecured notes, which also matured in june 2014.
additionally, during 2014, the company (i) assumed $742.0 million of individual non-recourse mortgage debt relating to the acquisition of 53 operating properties, including an increase of $39.4 million associated with fair value debt adjustments (ii) paid off $328.0 million of mortgage debt that encumbered 21 properties and (iii) obtained $15.7 million of individual non-recourse debt relating to one operating property.
in addition to the public equity and debt markets as capital sources, the company may, from time-to-time, obtain mortgage financing on selected properties and construction loans to partially fund the capital needs of its ground-up development projects. as of december 31, 2014, the company had over 370 unencumbered property interests in its portfolio.
in connection with its intention to continue to qualify as a reit for federal income tax purposes, the company expects to continue paying regular dividends to its stockholders. these dividends will be paid from operating cash flows. the company's board of directors will continue to evaluate the company's dividend policy on a quarterly basis as they monitor sources of capital and evaluate the impact of the economy and capital markets availability on operating fundamentals. since cash used to pay dividends reduces amounts available for capital investment, the company generally intends to maintain a conservative dividend payout ratio, reserving such amounts as it considers necessary for the expansion and renovation of shopping centers in its portfolio, debt reduction, the acquisition of interests in new properties and other investments as suitable opportunities arise and such other factors as the board of directors considers appropriate. cash dividends paid were $427.9 million in 2014, $400.4 million in 2013 and $382.7 million in 2012.
although the company receives substantially all of its rental payments on a monthly basis, it generally intends to continue paying dividends quarterly. amounts accumulated in advance of each quarterly distribution will be invested by the company in short-term money market or other suitable instruments. on october 28, 2014, the board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend per common share of $0.24 payable to shareholders of record on january 2, 2015, which was paid on january 15, 2015. additionally, on february 4, 2015, the company's board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.24 per common share payable to shareholders of record on april 6, 2015, which is scheduled to be paid on april 15, 2015.
the company is subject to taxes on its activities in canada, mexico, and chile.  in general, under local country law applicable to the structures the company has in place and applicable treaties, the repatriation of cash to the company from its subsidiaries and joint ventures in canada and mexico generally are not subject to withholding tax. the company does not anticipate the need to repatriate foreign funds from chile to provide for its cash flow needs in the u.s. and, as such, no significant withholding or transaction taxes are expected in the foreseeable future. the company will be subject to withholding taxes in chile on the distribution of any proceeds from sale transactions. the company is subject to and also includes in its tax provision non-u.s. income taxes on certain investments located in jurisdictions outside the u.s. these investments are held by the company at the reit level and not in the company's taxable reit subsidiary. accordingly, the company does not expect a u.s. income tax impact associated with the repatriation of undistributed earnings from the company's foreign subsidiaries.
contractual obligations and other commitments the company has debt obligations relating to its revolving credit facility, term loan, mtns, senior notes and mortgages with maturities ranging from less than one year to 20 years. as of december 31, 2014, the company's total debt had a weighted average term to maturity of 3.7 years. in addition, the company has non-cancelable operating leases pertaining to its shopping center portfolio. as of december 31, 2014, the company has 49 shopping center properties that are subject to long-term ground leases where a third party owns and has leased the underlying land to the company to construct and/or operate a shopping center. in addition, the company has 9 non-cancelable operating leases pertaining to its retail store lease portfolio. the following table summarizes the company's debt maturities (excluding extension options and fair market value of debt adjustments aggregating $40.1 million) and obligations under non-cancelable operating leases as of december 31, 2014 (in millions):

the company has $250.0 million of medium term notes, $100.0 million of unsecured notes and $134.7 million of secured debt scheduled to mature in 2015. the company anticipates satisfying these maturities with a combination of operating cash flows, its unsecured revolving credit facility, exercise of extension options, where available, and new debt issuances.
the company has issued letters of credit in connection with completion and repayment guarantees for loans encumbering certain of the company's redevelopment projects and guarantee of payment related to the company's insurance program. as of december 31, 2014, these letters of credit aggregate $24.9 million.
on a select basis, the company has provided guarantees on interest bearing debt held within real estate joint ventures. the company is often provided with a back-stop guarantee from its partners. the company had the following outstanding guarantees as of december 31, 2014 (amounts in millions):

(1)   during june 2013, the company sold its unconsolidated investment in the intown portfolio. the company continues to maintain its guarantee of a portion of the debt assumed by the buyer ($139.7 million as of december 31, 2014). the guarantee is collateralized by the buyer's ownership interest in the portfolio. additionally, the company has a commitment to provide financing up to the outstanding amount of the guaranteed portion of the loan for five years past the date of maturity. this commitment can be in the form of extensions with the current lender or a new lender or financing directly from the company to the buyer. on february 24, 2015, the outstanding debt balance of $139.7 million was fully repaid and as such, the company was relieved of its related commitments and guarantee.

(2)   as of december 31, 2014, the interest rates range from 3.62% to 4.97% and maturity dates with extensions range from 2015 to 2022.

in connection with the construction of its development/redevelopment projects and related infrastructure, certain public agencies require posting of performance and surety bonds to guarantee that the company's obligations are satisfied. these bonds expire upon the completion of the improvements and infrastructure. as of december 31, 2014, the company had $22.0 million in performance and surety bonds outstanding.
off-balance sheet arrangements unconsolidated real estate joint ventures the company has investments in various unconsolidated real estate joint ventures with varying structures. these joint ventures primarily operate shopping center properties or are established for development projects. such arrangements are generally with third-party institutional investors, local developers and individuals. the properties owned by the joint ventures are primarily financed with individual non-recourse mortgage loans, however, the company, on a selective basis, has obtained unsecured financing for certain joint ventures. these unsecured financings are guaranteed by the company with guarantees from the joint venture partners for their proportionate amounts of any guaranty payment the company is obligated to make (see guarantee table above). non-recourse mortgage debt is generally defined as debt whereby the lenders' sole recourse with respect to borrower defaults is limited to the value of the property collateralized by the mortgage. the lender generally does not have recourse against any other assets owned by the borrower or any of the constituent members of the borrower, except for certain specified exceptions listed in the particular loan documents (see footnote 7 of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this form 10-k). these investments include the following joint ventures:

30
the company has various other unconsolidated real estate joint ventures with varying structures. as of december 31, 2014, these other unconsolidated joint ventures had individual non-recourse mortgage loans aggregating $1.2 billion. the aggregate debt as of december 31, 2014, of all of the company's unconsolidated real estate joint ventures is $4.6 billion, of which the company's proportionate share of this debt is $1.8 billion. as of december 31, 2014, these loans had scheduled maturities ranging from one month to 19 years and bear interest at rates ranging from 1.92% to 8.39%. approximately $525.7 million of the aggregate outstanding loan balance matures in 2015, of which the company's proportionate share is $206.0 million. these maturing loans are anticipated to be repaid with operating cash flows, debt refinancing and partner capital contributions, as deemed appropriate (see footnote 7 of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this form 10-k).
other real estate investments the company previously provided capital to owners and developers of real estate properties through its preferred equity program. the company accounts for its preferred equity investments under the equity method of accounting. as of december 31, 2014, the company's net investment under the preferred equity program was $229.1 million relating to 443 properties, including 385 net leased properties. as of december 31, 2014, these preferred equity investment properties had individual non-recourse mortgage loans aggregating $717.0 million. these loans had scheduled maturities ranging from three months to 19 years and bear interest at rates ranging from 3.4% to 10.47%. due to the company's preferred position in these investments, the company's share of each investment is subject to fluctuation and is dependent upon property cash flows. the company's maximum exposure to losses associated with its preferred equity investments is primarily limited to its invested capital.
at december 31, 2014, the company had a 90% equity participation interest in an existing leveraged lease of 11 properties, which is reported as a net investment in leveraged lease in accordance with the fasb's lease guidance. the properties are leased under a long-term bond-type net lease whose primary term expires in 2016, with the lessee having certain renewal option rights. these 11 properties were encumbered by third-party non-recourse debt of $11.2 million that is scheduled to fully amortize during the primary term of the lease from a portion of the periodic net rents receivable under the net lease. as an equity participant in the leveraged lease, the company has no recourse obligation for principal or interest payments on the debt, which is collateralized by a first mortgage lien on the properties and collateral assignment of the lease. accordingly, this debt has been offset against the related net rental receivable under the lease.
funds from operations funds from operations ("ffo") is a supplemental non-gaap measure utilized to evaluate the operating performance of real estate companies. the national association of real estate investment trusts ("nareit") defines ffo as net income/(loss) attributable to common shareholders computed in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles ("gaap"), excluding (i) gains or losses from sales of operating real estate assets and (ii) extraordinary items, plus (iii) depreciation and amortization of operating properties and (iv) impairment of depreciable real estate and in substance real estate equity investments and (v) after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures calculated to reflect funds from operations on the same basis.
the company presents ffo as it considers it an important supplemental measure of our operating performance and believes it is frequently used by securities analysts, investors and other interested parties in the evaluation of reits, many of which present ffo when reporting results. comparison of our presentation of ffo to similarly titled measures for other reits may not necessarily be meaningful due to possible differences in the application of the nareit definition used by such reits.
the company also presents ffo as adjusted as an additional supplemental measure as it believes it is more reflective of the company's core operating performance. the company believes ffo as adjusted provides investors and analysts an additional measure in comparing the company's performance across reporting periods on a consistent basis by excluding items that we do not believe are indicative of our core operating performance. ffo as adjusted is generally calculated by the company as ffo excluding certain transactional income and expenses and non-operating impairments which management believes are not reflective of the results within the company's operating real estate portfolio.
31
ffo is a supplemental non-gaap financial measure of real estate companies' operating performances, which does not represent cash generated from operating activities in accordance with gaap and therefore should not be considered an alternative for net income as a measure of liquidity.  our method of calculating ffo and ffo as adjusted may be different from methods used by other reits and, accordingly, may not be comparable to such other reits.

combined same property net operating income combined same property net operating income ("combined same property noi") is a supplemental non-gaap financial measure of real estate companies' operating performance and should not be considered an alternative to net income in accordance with gaap or as a measure of liquidity. combined same property noi is considered by management to be an important performance measure of the company's operations and management believes that it is helpful to investors as a measure of the company's operating performance because it includes only the net operating income of properties that have been owned for the entire current and prior year reporting periods including those properties under redevelopment and excludes properties under development and pending stabilization. properties are deemed stabilized at the earlier of (i) reaching 90% leased or (ii) one year following a projects inclusion in operating real estate. as such, combined same property noi assists in eliminating disparities in net income due to the development, acquisition or disposition of properties during the particular period presented, and thus provides a more consistent performance measure for the comparison of the company's properties.
32
combined same property noi is calculated using revenues from rental properties (excluding straight-line rents, lease termination fees, above/below market rents and includes charges for bad debt) less operating and maintenance expense, real estate taxes and rent expense, plus the company's proportionate share of combined same property noi from unconsolidated real estate joint ventures, calculated on the same basis. our method of calculating combined same property noi may differ from methods used by other reits and, accordingly, may not be comparable to such other reits.

effects of inflation many of the company's leases contain provisions designed to mitigate the adverse impact of inflation. such provisions include clauses enabling the company to receive payment of additional rent calculated as a percentage of tenants' gross sales above pre-determined thresholds, which generally increase as prices rise, and/or escalation clauses, which generally increase rental rates during the terms of the leases. such escalation clauses often include increases based upon changes in the consumer price index or similar inflation indices. in addition, many of the company's leases are for terms of less than 10 years, which permits the company to seek to increase rents to market rates upon renewal. most of the company's leases require the tenant to pay an allocable share of operating expenses, including common area maintenance costs, real estate taxes and insurance, thereby reducing the company's exposure to increases in costs and operating expenses resulting from inflation. the company periodically evaluates its exposure to short-term interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates and will, from time-to-time, enter into interest rate protection agreements and/or foreign currency hedge agreements which mitigate, but do not eliminate, the effect of changes in interest rates on its floating-rate debt and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates.

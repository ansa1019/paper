item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read with the consolidated financial statements and the related notes in item 8, of this report.
the following discussion is based upon our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report, which have been prepared in accordance with u.s. generally accepted accounting principles ("u.s. gaap"). in the course of operating our business, we routinely make decisions as to the timing of the payment of invoices, the collection of receivables, the manufacturing and shipment of products, the fulfillment of orders, the purchase of supplies, and the building of inventory and spare parts, among other matters. each of these decisions has some impact on the financial results for any given period. in making these decisions, we consider various factors including contractual obligations, customer satisfaction, competition, internal and external financial targets and expectations, and financial planning objectives. for further information about our critical accounting policies and estimates, see "critical accounting policies and estimates" section included in this "management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations."
to aid in understanding our operating results for the periods covered by this report, we have provided an executive overview and a summary of the business and market environment. these sections should be read in conjunction with the more detailed discussion and analysis of our consolidated financial condition and results of operations in this item 7, our "risk factors" section included in item 1a of part i, and our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in item 8 of part ii of this report.
business and market environment at juniper networks, we design, develop, and sell products and services for high-performance networks to enable customers to build highly scalable, reliable, secure and cost-effective networks for their businesses, while achieving agility, efficiency and value through automation. we focus on customers and partners across our key verticals who view these network attributes as fundamental to their business; including global service providers, enterprises, financial services, cloud hosting providers, governments, research, and public sector organizations. product and solution differentiation, with a relentless customer focus, will allow us to achieve our primary goal of growing revenue faster than the market.
we sell our products in more than 100 countries in three geographic regions: americas; europe, middle east, and africa ("emea"); and asia pacific ("apac"). we sell our high-performance routing, switching, and security network products and service offerings to service provider and enterprise markets. our silicon, systems, and software represent innovations that transform the economics and experience of networking, helping customers achieve superior performance, greater choice, and flexibility, while reducing overall total cost of ownership. in addition to our products, we offer technical support and professional services, as well as education and training programs to our customers. together, our high-performance product and service offerings help our customers convert legacy networks that provide commoditized services into more valuable assets that provide differentiation, value, and increased performance, reliability, and security to end-users.
during 2014, we saw a slight decline in net revenues year-over-year, primarily due to reduced spending by u.s. carriers, however the diversity in our business across verticals such as cloud and cable providers helped to partially offset the decline. we expect the overall revenue environment to be challenging over the next several quarters, as market dynamics, including consolidation, are impacting demand from our largest u.s. service provider customers. we believe our product gross margins may continue to vary in the future due to competitive pricing pressures, which may be offset by additional operational efficiencies. nevertheless, we are focused on executing our strategy that is focused on designing, developing and selling products and services for high-performance networks. we believe our product portfolio continues to be strong, and we remain focused on operational excellence, cost discipline and targeted growth initiatives.
in 2014, we continued to invest in innovation and strengthening our product portfolio, which resulted in new product offerings across routing, switching, and security. in routing, we announced a virtualized version of our flagship mx series 3d universal edge routing platform, the vmx 3d universal edge router, to deliver the industry's first full-featured, carrier-grade virtualized router, giving service providers and enterprises the ability to seamlessly leverage the benefits of both virtual and physical networking. in switching, to address the networking requirements of large cloud providers and enterprise customers who build large and massive scale data centers, we announced ocx1100, the first switch to combine open compute project (ocp) hardware design with a carrier-class network operating system, junos os. we also announced a new line of ex4600 ethernet switches to fulfill the increasing demands for highly available access to cloud services and applications across enterprise campus networks.
additionally, we expanded our sdn portfolio with new software and hardware, including the northstar controller, a new traffic-engineering controller leveraging open, industry-standard protocols built to optimize service providers' transport networks, as well as the junos fusion software that controls thousands of independent network elements from a single management plane.
34
key strategic technology partnerships also delivered new solutions to address the high-performance network requirements of our service provider and enterprise customers. through integration with gainspeed's technology and our mx series 3d universal edge routers and ex series switches, we announced the virtual converged cable access platform, allowing cable operators to better automate and scale their edge/access infrastructure while creating a platform for new cloud-based services. additionally, we partnered with nokia to advance the telco cloud for mobile broadband and accelerate service creation by bringing together nokia's leading liquid core solution and the juniper networks metafabrictm data center architecture, including contrail. furthermore, we signed a go to market agreement with aruba to deliver an open, converged enterprise network solution by integrating aruba mobility solutions with juniper enterprise switches and routers, delivering ongoing product innovation to enterprise customers.
for security, we announced firefly perimeter a virtual version of our srx series service gateway, new advancements in our spotlight secure threat intelligence platform, junos space virtual director, an application that automates the management and deployment of firefly perimeter, as well as juniper argon secure, an advanced anti-malware service.
due to the recent underperformance of our security products and efforts to refocus our security offerings, we recorded a goodwill impairment charge of $850.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2014. we intend to focus on stabilizing revenues in our security reporting unit in 2015, and, as a result, we are pivoting our security strategy to focus on building integrated solutions that focus on network resiliency and business continuity across cloud, data center, branch, campus, and service provider mobile infrastructure, by taking advantage of the existing and ongoing innovation of our junos-based srx platform.
in 2014, we implemented a series of initiatives designed to streamline our organization, improve operational efficiencies, rationalize our product portfolios, and return capital to our shareholders. these actions were largely completed by the end of 2014.
in the first quarter of 2014, we realigned our organization into a one-juniper structure, which included consolidating each of our research and development ("r&d") and go-to-market functions to reduce complexity, increase clarity of responsibilities, and improve efficiency.
to improve operational efficiency, in 2014, we implemented various restructuring activities and structural cost saving actions across research and development, sales and marketing, and general and administrative expenses. we completed the 2014 restructuring plan through workforce reductions, facility consolidations or closures, asset write-downs, contract terminations and other actions. as a result, we recorded a total restructuring charge of $207.7 million in cost of sales and restructuring and other charges. in connection with the rationalization of our product portfolio, we completed the sale of junos pulse for total consideration of $230.7 million which resulted in a gain of $19.6 million in other income (expense), net in the consolidated statement of operations. as a result of these cost management actions, we achieved our total annualized operating expense savings commitment of $260.0 million compared to the fourth quarter of 2013.
in addition to these cost reduction activities, we introduced a capital allocation program to return capital to our stockholders through share repurchases and dividends. in 2014, we returned $2.3 billion of capital to our stockholders through the completion of a $1.2 billion accelerated share repurchase program ("asr") and the repurchase of $1.1 billion of our common stock subsequent to the asr. we also paid two quarterly cash dividends of $0.10 per share for an aggregate amount of $86.0 million and issued $350.0 million aggregate principal amount of 4.50% senior notes due 2024 ("2024 notes"), which allowed us to partially fund the asr. we intend to return $1.0 billion of aggregate share repurchases by the end of the second quarter of 2015 subject to raising additional debt financing.

________________________________
(*)   dso and book-to-bill are for the fourth quarter ended december 31, 2014, 2013, and 2012.
•   net revenues: during 2014, net revenues were slightly down, compared to 2013, as a result of a decline in net revenues from us carriers, partially offset by growing demand from cloud providers in the americas, as well as improving demand among service provider in emea. the year-over-year decline in our net revenues was primarily due to a decrease in net revenues from our routing and security products, partially offset by an increase in our switching products revenue and service revenue.
during 2013, compared to 2012, we experienced net revenue growth in the americas, in both service provider and enterprise, offset by a decline in revenue in apac and emea. the year-over-year increase in our net revenues during 2013 was primarily due to increases in edge routing, switching, and service revenue, partially offset by a decline in our security products revenue.
•   gross margin: our gross margin as a percentage of net revenues decreased during 2014, compared to 2013, as a result of higher inventory charges driven by product rationalizations in connection with our 2014 restructuring plan and charges related to an industry-wide memory product quality defect for a component from a third party supplier.
during 2013, compared to 2012, our gross margin as a percentage of net revenues increased primarily due to higher restructuring and other charges recorded in 2012, partially offset by higher inventory provisions in 2013 for legacy platforms.
•   operating (loss) income: during 2014, compared to 2013, we experienced a decline in operating (loss) income as a percentage of net revenues, primarily due to an $850.0 million goodwill impairment charge related to the security reporting
36
unit recorded in the fourth quarter of 2014, restructuring and other charges of $207.7 million, related to severance, facility consolidations and closures, asset-write-offs, and contract terminations in connection with our 2014 restructuring plan, as well as a component remediation charge of $20.7 million relating to the memory product quality defect.
our operating income as a percentage of revenues increased in 2013, compared to 2012, primarily due to growth in net revenues. also contributing to the increase in operating income were lower restructuring and other charges of $52.2 million compared to 2012.
•   cash dividends declared per common stock: during 2014, we declared two quarterly cash dividends of $0.10 per share, payable on september 23, 2014 and on december 23, 2014 to stockholders of record as of the close of business on september 2, 2014 and december 2, 2014, respectively, in the aggregate amount of $86.0 million. we had not previously paid cash dividends.
•   stock repurchase plan activity: under our stock repurchase program, we repurchased approximately 96.1 million shares of our common stock in the open market at an average price of $23.41 per share for an aggregate purchase of $2,250.0 million during the year ended december 31, 2014.
•   operating cash flows: operating cash flows decreased in 2014, compared to 2013, primarily due to lower cash collections from customers, higher payments primarily related to our 2014 restructuring plans, higher taxes paid, and lower prepayments compared to prior year.
operating cash flows increased in 2013, compared to 2012, primarily due to the timing of payments to our vendors, higher deferred revenue, and lower taxes paid, partially offset by the timing of payments for incentive compensation to our employees and the timing of receipts from our customers.
•   dso: dso is calculated as the ratio of ending accounts receivable, net of allowances, divided by average daily net sales for the preceding 90 days. dso for the quarter ended december 31, 2014 increased by 8 days, or 20% compared to the quarter ended december 31, 2013. during 2014, we transitioned certain distribution partners from a third party financing program to juniper's commercial payment terms. going forward, we expect dso to be in the range of 45 to 55 days.
dso increased by 6 days or 17% for the quarter ended december 31, 2013 compared to the quarter ended december 31, 2012. the increase was primarily due to large multi-year service renewals at the end of the period which increased our outstanding receivables compared to the same period in 2012.
•   book-to-bill: book-to-bill represents the ratio of product orders booked divided by product revenues during the respective period. book-to-bill was greater than one for the quarters ended december 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, indicating strong product demand.
•   deferred revenue: total deferred revenue increased slightly by $6.4 million to $1,075.7 million as of december 31, 2014, compared to $1,069.3 million as of december 31, 2013, primarily due to an increase in deferred service revenue of $25.8 million, primarily driven by the execution of several multi-year support agreements and annual agreement renewals. the increase in deferred service revenue was partially offset by a decrease in deferred product revenue of $19.4 million as a result of lower distributor inventory and multiple revenue releases in relation to previously deferred product revenue.
as of december 31, 2013 compared to december 31, 2012, total deferred revenue increased by $145.9 million, primarily due to an increase in deferred service revenue driven by the execution of several multi-year support agreements, and to a lesser extent an increase in annual agreement renewals, slightly offset by a decrease in deferred product revenue.
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of the financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with u.s. gaap requires us to make judgments, assumptions, and estimates that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes. on an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related to sales returns, pricing credits, warranty costs, allowance for doubtful accounts, impairment of long-term assets, especially goodwill and intangible assets, contract manufacturer exposures for carrying and obsolete material charges, assumptions used in the valuation of share-based compensation, and litigation. we base our estimates and assumptions on current facts, historical experience, and various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. for further information about our significant accounting policies, see note 2,
37
significant accounting policies, in notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 of part ii of this report, which describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements. the accounting policies described below are significantly affected by critical accounting estimates. such accounting policies require significant judgments, assumptions, and estimates used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements and actual results could differ materially from the amounts reported based on these policies. to the extent there are material differences between our estimates and the actual results, our future consolidated results of operations may be affected.
•   goodwill. we make significant estimates, assumptions, and judgments when valuing goodwill and other intangible assets in connection with the initial purchase price allocation of an acquired entity, as well as when evaluating impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets on an ongoing basis. these estimates are based upon a number of factors, including historical experience, market conditions, and information obtained from the management of the acquired company. critical estimates in valuing certain intangible assets include, but are not limited to, historical and projected customer retention rates, anticipated growth in revenue from the acquired customer and product base, and the expected use of the acquired assets. these factors are also considered in determining the useful life of the acquired intangible assets. the amounts and useful lives assigned to identified intangible assets impacts the amount and timing of future amortization expense.
goodwill represents the future economic benefits arising from other assets acquired in a business combination or an acquisition that are not individually identified and separately recorded. the excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair value of net assets of businesses acquired in a business combination is recognized as goodwill. we evaluate our goodwill for impairment on an annual basis, as of november 1st, or more frequently if an event occurs or facts and circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of our reporting units below their carrying amount.
goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level, which is one level below our operating segment level, by comparing the reporting unit's carrying value, including goodwill, to the fair value of the reporting unit. the reporting units are determined based on the components of our operating segment that constitutes a business for which discrete financial information is available and segment management regularly review the operating results of the component.
the provisions of the accounting standard for goodwill and other intangibles allows us to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform the two-step quantitative goodwill impairment test. while we are permitted to conduct a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is necessary to perform a two-step quantitative goodwill impairment test, for our annual goodwill impairment test in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014, we performed a quantitative test for all of our reporting units.
our goodwill impairment test involves a two-step process to identify goodwill impairment and measure the amount of goodwill impairment loss to be recognized, if any. the first step tests for potential impairment by comparing the fair value of reporting units with the reporting unit's net asset values. if the fair value of the reporting units exceeds the carrying value of the reporting unit's net assets, goodwill is not impaired and no further testing is required. if the fair value of the reporting units does not exceed the carrying value of the net assets assigned to the reporting unit, then we perform the second step of the impairment test in order to determine the implied fair value of the reporting unit's goodwill. the second step requires an assignment of the reporting unit's fair value to the reporting unit's assets and liabilities, using the relevant acquisition accounting guidance, to determine the implied fair value of the reporting unit's goodwill. the implied fair value of the reporting unit's goodwill is then compared with the carrying amount of the reporting unit's goodwill, and if the carrying value of a reporting unit's goodwill exceeds its implied fair value, we record an impairment loss equal to the difference.
in the first step, the fair value of each of our reporting units is determined using both the income and market valuation approaches. we believe the income approach and the market approach are equally representative of the reporting unit's fair value. under the income approach, the fair value of the reporting unit is based on the present value of estimated future cash flows that the reporting unit is expected to generate over its remaining life. under the market approach, the value of the reporting unit is based on an analysis that compares the value of the reporting unit to values of publicly-traded companies in similar lines of business. in the application of the income and market valuation approaches, we are required to make estimates of future operating trends and judgments on discount rates and other variables. determining the fair value of a reporting unit is highly judgmental in nature and involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions. we base our fair value estimates on assumptions we believe to be reasonable but that are unpredictable and inherently uncertain. actual future results related to assumed variables could differ from these estimates. in addition, we make certain judgments and assumptions in allocating shared assets and liabilities to determine the carrying values for each of our reporting units.
38
under the income approach, we calculate the fair value of a reporting unit based on the present value of estimated future cash flows. cash flow projections are based on management's estimates of revenue growth rates and operating margins, taking into consideration industry and market conditions. the discount rate used is based on the weighted-average cost of capital adjusted for the relevant risk associated with business-specific characteristics and the uncertainty related to the business's ability to execute on the projected cash flows. under the market approach, we estimate the fair value based on market multiples of revenue and earnings derived from comparable publicly-traded companies with similar operating and investment characteristics as the reporting units, and then apply a control premium which is determined by considering control premiums offered as part of the acquisitions that have occurred in market segments that are comparable with our reporting units. the income approach and the market approach are equally weighted to derive the fair value of the reporting unit.
prior to the second step, the long-lived assets, such as property, plant, and equipment, and purchased intangible assets subject to amortization, are reviewed for impairment. recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset, or asset group, to estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset, or asset group. if needed, an impairment charge is recognized by the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset, or asset group, exceeds its fair value.
in the second step, the reporting unit's fair value is allocated to all of the assets and liabilities, including any unrecognized intangible assets; such as, existing technology, backlog, and customer relationships, in a hypothetical analysis that calculates the implied fair value of goodwill in the same manner as if the reporting unit was being acquired in a business combination. if the implied fair value of the reporting unit's goodwill is less than the carrying value, the difference is recorded as an impairment loss. assumptions used in measuring the fair value of these assets and liabilities included the discount rates, customer renewal rates, and technology obsolescence rates used in valuing intangible assets, and pricing of comparable transactions in the market in valuing the tangible assets.
during our fiscal year 2014 annual goodwill impairment test, our reporting units were: routing, switching and security.
the fair value of the routing and switching reporting units significantly exceeded their carrying value. however the fair value of the security reporting unit did not exceed its carrying value and therefore we determined the security reporting unit's goodwill was impaired. in 2014, we re-aligned our go-to-market and research and development resources on projects with the highest potential for growth and continued to leverage our engineering efforts across our routing, switching, and security products. in the fourth quarter of 2014, we began to implement a new security strategy focused on network resiliency and performance based on the srx platform. as a result, we rationalized our security product portfolio including developing a new product roadmap and exiting certain point products, including the divestiture of junos pulse. these factors decreased our short-term and near-term revenue and profitability forecasts of the security reporting unit.
as a result, the carrying value of the security reporting unit's goodwill exceeded the implied fair value of goodwill, resulting in a goodwill impairment charge of $850.0 million which was recorded in the consolidated statement of operations.

•   inventory valuation and contract manufacturer liabilities. inventory consists primarily of component parts to be used in the manufacturing process and is stated at lower of average cost or market. a provision is recorded when inventory is determined to be in excess of anticipated demand or obsolete, to adjust inventory to its estimated realizable value. in determining the provision, we also consider estimated recovery rates based on the nature of the inventory. as of december 31, 2014 and december 31, 2013, our inventory balances were $62.5 million and $52.7 million, respectively.
we establish a liability for non-cancelable, non-returnable purchase commitments with our contract manufacturers for quantities in excess of our demand forecasts or obsolete materials charges for components purchased by the contract manufacturers based on our demand forecasts or customer orders. we also take estimated recoveries of aged inventory into consideration when determining the liability. as of december 31, 2014 and december 31, 2013, our contract manufacturer liabilities were $25.3 million and $22.9 million, respectively.
significant judgment is used in establishing our forecasts of future demand, recovery rates based on the nature and age of inventory, and obsolete material exposures. we perform a detailed analysis and review of data used in establishing our demand forecasts. if the actual component usage and product demand are significantly lower than forecast, which may be caused by factors within and outside of our control, or if there were a higher incidence of inventory obsolescence
39
because of rapidly changing technology and our customer requirements, we may be required to increase our inventory write-downs and contract manufacturer liabilities, which could have an adverse impact on our gross margins and profitability. we regularly evaluate our exposure for inventory write-downs and adequacy of our contract manufacturer liabilities. inventory and supply chain management remains an area of focus as we balance the risk of material obsolescence and supply chain flexibility in order to reduce lead times.
•   revenue recognition. revenue is recognized when all of the following criteria have been met: (1) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, (2) delivery has occurred, (3) sales price is fixed or determinable, and (4) collectability is reasonably assured. we enter into contracts to sell our products and services, and while some of our sales agreements contain standard terms and conditions, there are agreements that contain multiple elements or non-standard terms and conditions. as a result, significant contract interpretation may be required to determine the appropriate accounting, including whether the deliverables specified in a multiple element arrangement should be treated as separate units of accounting for revenue recognition purposes, and, if so, how the price should be allocated among the elements and when to recognize revenue for each element. changes in the allocation of the sales price between elements may impact the timing of revenue recognition but will not change the total revenue recognized on the contract.
under our revenue recognition policies, we allocate revenue to each element based on a selling price hierarchy. the selling price for a deliverable is based on our vendor-specific objective evidence ("vsoe") if available, third-party evidence ("tpe") if vsoe is not available, or estimated selling price ("esp") if neither vsoe nor tpe is available. we establish vsoe of selling price using the price charged for a deliverable when sold separately. tpe of selling price is established by evaluating largely interchangeable competitor products or services in stand-alone sales to similarly situated customers. we do not use tpe as we do not consider our products to be similar or interchangeable to our competitors' products in standalone sales to similarly situated customers. esp is established considering internal factors such as margin objectives, pricing practices and controls, customer segment pricing strategies and product life cycle. consideration is also given to market conditions such as industry pricing strategies and technology life cycles. when determining esp, we apply management judgment to establish margin objectives and pricing strategies and to evaluate market conditions and product life cycles. revenue from maintenance service contracts is deferred and recognized ratably over the contractual support period, which is generally one to three years.
•   income taxes. we are subject to income taxes in the united states and numerous foreign jurisdictions. significant judgment is required in evaluating our uncertain tax positions and determining our taxes. although we believe our reserves are reasonable, no assurance can be given that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be different from that which is reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals. we adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the closing of a tax audit or the refinement of an estimate. to the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters is different than the amounts recorded, such differences will affect the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made.
significant judgment is also required in determining any valuation allowance recorded against deferred tax assets. in assessing the need for a valuation allowance, we consider all available evidence, including past operating results, estimates of future taxable income, and the feasibility of tax planning strategies. in the event that we change our determination as to the amount of deferred tax assets that can be realized, we will adjust our valuation allowance with a corresponding impact to the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made.
our provision for income taxes is subject to volatility and could be adversely affected by earnings being lower than anticipated in countries that have lower tax rates and higher than anticipated in countries that have higher tax rates; by changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities; by expiration of or lapses in the r&d tax credit laws; by transfer pricing adjustments, including the effect of acquisitions on our intercompany r&d cost-sharing arrangement and legal structure; by tax effects of nondeductible compensation; by tax costs related to intercompany realignments; by changes in accounting principles; or by changes in tax laws and regulations, including possible u.s. changes to the taxation of earnings of our foreign subsidiaries, the deductibility of expenses attributable to foreign income, or the foreign tax credit rules. in addition, oecd's contemplated changes to numerous long-standing tax principles, if finalized and adopted by countries, will increase tax uncertainty and may adversely affect our provision for income taxes. significant judgment is required to determine the recognition and measurement attributes prescribed in the accounting guidance for uncertainty in income taxes. the accounting guidance for uncertainty in income taxes applies to all income tax positions, including the potential recovery of previously paid taxes, which if settled unfavorably could adversely affect our provision for income taxes or additional paid-in capital. in addition, we are subject to the continuous examination of our income tax returns by the irs and other tax authorities. we regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes. there can be no assurance that the outcomes from these continuous examinations will not have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition.
40
•   loss contingencies. we use significant judgment and assumptions to estimate the likelihood of loss or impairment of an asset, or the incurrence of a liability, in determining loss contingencies. an estimated loss contingency is accrued when it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. we record a charge equal to the minimum estimated liability for litigation costs or a loss contingency only when both of the following conditions are met: (i) information available prior to issuance of our consolidated financial statements indicates that it is probable that an asset had been impaired or a liability had been incurred at the date of the financial statements and (ii) the range of loss can be reasonably estimated. we regularly evaluate current information available to us to determine whether such accruals should be adjusted and whether new accruals are required.
recent accounting pronouncements see note 2, significant accounting policies, in notes to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of part ii of this report, for a full description of recent accounting pronouncements, including the expected dates of adoption and estimated effects on financial condition and results of operations, which is incorporated herein by reference.

2014 compared to 2013
routing product net revenues decreased in 2014, compared to 2013, as a result of weaker demand for core routing, partially offset by strong growth of our ptx series products. edge routing net revenues increased as a result of strong demand for our mx series products, partly offset by older edge routing platforms. the year-over year decline was driven by weakness from large us carriers, partially offset by strength from cloud providers.
switching product net revenues increased in 2014, compared to 2013, reflecting growth from both our qfabric system and our ex series products. during the year we saw strong adoption of qfabric data center switches by a growing number of customers, with especially strong demand from cloud providers in the americas.
security product net revenues decreased in 2014, compared to 2013, primarily due to a continuing decline in our legacy screen os products and the divestiture of our junos pulse product lines. sales of our srx platform declined slightly year-over-year, due to lower demand from u.s. carrier customers.
the increase in service revenue in 2014, compared to 2013, was primarily driven by new service contracts and strong contract renewals. service revenues are largely correlated with product revenues, therefore if product net revenues decline, it can have an impact on future service revenues.
41
2013 compared to 2012
routing product net revenues increased in 2013, compared to 2012, due to an increase in volume of sales of our edge routing products to both service provider and enterprise customers reflecting customer demand for the mx platform in particular.
switching product net revenues increased in 2013, compared to 2012, as a result of an increase in ex and qfabric product lines for both service provider and enterprise markets. also contributing to the increase in net revenues were new product introductions for the enterprise campus and data center infrastructure.
security product net revenues decreased in 2013, compared to 2012, primarily due to a decline in legacy screen os and our srx platform.
the increase in service revenue in 2013, compared to 2012, was primarily driven by strong contract renewals from our installed base across routing, switching and security products.

2014 compared to 2013
the increase in net revenues in the americas in 2014, compared to 2013, was primarily due to an increase in net revenues from service provider markets, partially offset by a decline in the enterprise market. the increase in net revenues in the service provider market was due to strong demand from cloud and cable providers, partially offset by a decrease in demand from carriers. the decline in the enterprise market resulted from a decline in net revenues due to recognition of revenue from a large u.s. federal government contract in 2013.
net revenues in emea slightly increased in 2014, compared to 2013, primarily due to stronger demand from service providers partially offset by a decrease in net revenues from the enterprise market, although demand from the public sector remained strong.
net revenues in apac decreased in 2014, compared to 2013, primarily due to a decline in net revenues from both the service provider and enterprise market.
2013 compared to 2012
net revenues in the americas increased in 2013, compared to 2012, primarily due to an increase in revenues from both the service provider and enterprise markets. the increase in service provider revenues was due to an increase in sales to cloud providers and cable providers, partially offset by a slight decrease in sales to carriers. the increase in enterprise revenues in 2013, compared to 2012, was primarily attributable to a broad-based improvement in customer demand as well as the recognition of a large u.s. federal government contract.
42
net revenues in emea decreased in 2013, compared to 2012, primarily due to a decline in revenues in the enterprise market attributable to certain large sales in 2012.
net revenues in apac decreased in 2013, compared to 2012, primarily due to lower revenues in enterprise resulting from weaker conditions in the china enterprise market. service provider revenues were relatively flat as a decline in sales with certain large service providers in japan were offset by higher revenue with certain large carriers in china. additionally, the recognition of revenue from a large service provider in singapore was offset by declines in revenues from other service providers in apac.

we sell our high-performance routing, switching, and security network products and service offerings to two primary markets: service provider and enterprise. determination of which market a particular revenue transaction relates to is based primarily upon the customer's industrial classification code, but may also include subjective factors such as the intended use of the product. the service provider market generally includes wireline and wireless carriers, and cable operators, as well as major internet content and application providers, including those that provide social networking and search engine services. the enterprise market generally is comprised of businesses; federal, state, and local governments; research and education institutions; and financial services.
2014 compared to 2013
net revenues from sales to the service provider market increased in 2014, compared to 2013, with growth in the americas and emea. the increase in service provider net revenues in the americas was driven by increased revenues from cloud and cable providers, partially offset by decreased revenues from large carriers. the increase in service provider net revenues in emea was attributable to growth with large carriers, while in apac net revenues in the service provider market declined as a result of lower demand with both small and large carriers. in addition, service provider demand for switching products continued to be strong.
net revenues from sales to the enterprise market decreased in 2014, compared to 2013, primarily due to a decline in sales in all geographic regions, however, revenue demand from public sector customers was higher for all three regions.
2013 compared to 2012
net revenues from sales to the service provider market increased in 2013, compared to 2012, primarily due to an increase in sales to cloud providers and cable providers in the americas, partially offset by a slight decrease in sales to wireless carriers, while the service provider market in emea and apac was relatively flat. in addition, service provider demand for switching and data center solutions in 2013 was stronger than in 2012.
net revenues from the enterprise market increased in 2013, compared to 2012, primarily due to broad-based growth in the americas enterprise market, as well as recognition of a large u.s. federal government contract, partially offset by weaker demand in apac and emea.
customer no customer accounted for greater than 10% of our net revenues during the year ended december 31, 2014 and 2013. during the year ended december 31, 2012, verizon accounted for 10.3% of our net revenues.

2014 compared to 2013
product gross margin decreased as a percentage of product net revenues in 2014, compared to 2013, primarily due to an increase in cost of revenues. the increase in cost of revenues was primarily due to asset write-downs of $41.5 million for product rationalizations in connection with our 2014 restructuring plan and $20.7 million in connection with an industry-wide memory product quality defect in a component from a third-party supplier. excluding the costs of the restructuring and component defect, product gross margin as a percentage of net revenues improved slightly primarily due to the favorability in product mix in the 2014 period.
service gross margin as a percentage of service net revenues decreased slightly in 2014, compared to 2013, primarily due to an increase in labor and logistics delivery costs to support new contracts and product introductions.
2013 compared to 2012
product gross margin percentage increased slightly in 2013, compared to 2012, primarily due to higher restructuring and other charges recorded in 2012, partially offset by higher inventory provisions in 2013 for legacy platforms. product gross margin benefited from cost reductions in the supply chain in 2013, which more than offset the impact of higher pricing discounts.
service gross margin as a percentage of service net revenues increased in 2013, compared to 2012, primarily due to higher service revenues and greater efficiency in the delivery of services.

our operating expenses have historically been driven in large part by personnel-related costs, including wages, commissions, bonuses, benefits, share-based compensation, and travel, particularly with respect to research and development and sales and marketing activities. facility and information technology ("it") departmental costs are allocated to each department based on usage and headcount. facility and it related headcount was 366, 396, and 368, as of december 31, 2014, 2013, and 2012, respectively. we had a total of 8,806, 9,483, and 9,234, employees as of december 31, 2014, 2013, and 2012, respectively.
2014 compared to 2013
research and development research and development expense decreased in 2014, compared to 2013, primarily due to lower personnel-related expenses as a result of restructuring actions and divestiture of our junos pulse product lines. research and development headcount decreased 8% from 4,135 as of december 31, 2013 to 3,797 as of december 31, 2014. the decrease in research and development personnel expense was partially offset by higher share-based compensation expense as a result of our acquisition of wandl, inc. in the first quarter, and engineering program costs in 2014, compared to 2013.
sales and marketing sales and marketing expense decreased in 2014, compared to 2013, primarily due to lower personnel-related expenses and other discretionary expenses due to our cost reduction efforts and creating efficiency in our sales activities. the decrease in personnel-related expenses is primarily due to headcount reductions. sales and marketing headcount decreased 11% from 2,626 as of december 31, 2013 to 2,348 as of december 31, 2014.
general and administrative general and administrative expense increased in 2014, compared to 2013, primarily due to higher litigation and investigation related costs incurred in the current period in connection with investigation into possible violations of the u.s. foreign corrupt practices act and, to a lesser extent, our patent litigation case with palo alto networks, inc. ("pan"), as well as other litigation matters. this increase was partially offset by personnel-related expenses as a result of headcount reductions of 8% from 513 as of december 31, 2013 to 470 as of december 31, 2014. our patent litigation with pan was settled in 2014.
restructuring and other charges restructuring and other charges increased in 2014, compared to 2013, due to higher charges recorded in 2014 in connection with our 2014 restructuring plan. during 2014, we implemented the 2014 restructuring plan and incurred restructuring charges of $166.2 million related to workforce reductions, contract terminations, project cancellations, and facility closures. the 2014
45
restructuring plan has been substantially completed as of december 31, 2014 and we do not expect to record significant future charges. see note 9, restructuring and other charges, in notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 of part ii of this report, for further discussion of our restructuring activities.
impairment of goodwill in the fourth quarter of 2014, we began to implement a new security strategy focused on network resiliency and performance based on the srx platform. as a result, we rationalized our security product portfolio including developing a new product roadmap and exiting certain point products, including the divestiture of junos pulse. these factors decreased our short term and near term revenue and profitability forecasts of the security reporting unit. during our fiscal year 2014 annual goodwill impairment test, the carrying value of our security reporting unit's goodwill exceeded the implied fair value of goodwill, resulting in a goodwill impairment charge of $850.0 million which was recorded in the consolidated statement of operations in part ii item 8 of this report. see note 7, goodwill and purchased intangibles, in notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 of part ii of this report, for further discussion on the impairment of goodwill.
2013 compared to 2012
research and development research and development expense decreased in 2013, compared to 2012, primarily due to lower depreciation expense of $28.3 million attributable to the extended useful lives of computers and equipment in 2013 as well as lower prototype development costs of $18.6 million. in addition, outside services, facilities, and it costs decreased related to the cancellation of certain projects and facility closures. the decrease in research and development expense was partially offset by increases in personnel-related expenses primarily attributable to higher share-based compensation expense, and to a lesser extent, higher variable compensation. research and development headcount increased 1% from 4,081 as of december 31, 2012 to 4,135 as of december 31, 2013. additionally, we continued to shift headcount to lower cost regions.
sales and marketing sales and marketing expense increased in 2013, compared to 2012, primarily due to higher personnel-related expenses related to an increase in commission expense driven by improved sales achievement, partially offset by lower share-based compensation expense and lower outside service and travel due to our cost reduction efforts and creating efficiency in our sales activities. sales and marketing headcount decreased 2% from 2,680 as of december 31, 2012 to 2,626 as of december 31, 2013 as a result of our restructuring activities.
general and administrative general and administrative expense increased in 2013, compared to 2012, primarily due to higher litigation costs. the increase in general and administrative expense was partially offset by lower personnel-related expenses, primarily share-based compensation expense. general and administrative headcount increased 6% from 486 as of december 31, 2012 to 513 as of december 31, 2013 to support our finance-related initiatives, including our erp implementation.
restructuring and other charges restructuring and other charges decreased in 2013, compared to 2012, due to higher charges recorded in 2012 in connection with our 2012 restructuring plan. during 2013, we implemented the 2013 restructuring plan and incurred restructuring charges of $39.1 million related to workforce reductions, contract terminations, project cancellations, and facility closures in connection with our plans. see note 9, restructuring and other charges, in notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 of part ii of this report, for further discussion of our restructuring activities.

2013 compared to 2012
share-based compensation expense remained consistent in 2013, compared to 2012. offsetting increases in expense related to rsas assumed in connection with our acquisition of contrail at the end of 2012 were decreases in actual shares vested and a decline in grant date fair values due to our lower stock prices.

47
2014 compared to 2013
interest income interest income increased in 2014 compared to 2013, primarily due to a higher balance of longer term investments yielding higher interest.
interest expense interest expense increased in 2014, compared to 2013, primarily due to the issuance of our 2024 notes in the first quarter of 2014. see note 10, long-term debt and financing, in notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 in part ii of this report for additional information regarding our 2024 notes.
gain on legal settlement during the year ended december 31, 2014, we entered into a settlement agreement with pan resolving patent litigation between the two companies, which resulted in a realized gain on legal settlement and subsequent sale of related securities of $196.1 million, net of legal fees.
gain on investments during the year ended december 31, 2014, we recorded a gain of $163.0 million, primarily related to the sale of investments which were converted from privately-held investments to publicly-traded equity upon ipo and subsequently sold. during the year ended december 31, 2013, net gain on investments was primarily comprised of a gain of $7.1 million related to the company's privately-held investments and publicly traded-equity investments.
gain on sale of junos pulse the sale of our junos pulse product portfolio was completed on october 1, 2014 and we recorded a gain of $19.6 million in other income (expense), net in the consolidated statement of operations. this sale was driven by product rationalization in connection with our initiative to focus on projects with the highest potential for growth. see note 8. other financial information, in notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 of part ii of this report for further discussion on the sale junos pulse.
2013 compared to 2012
interest income interest income decreased in 2013, compared to 2012, due to lower cash balances and interest rates, as well as a shift to certain investments yielding lower interest.
interest expense interest expense increased in 2013, compared to 2012, primarily due to higher capitalized interest in 2012 resulting from our phased sunnyvale campus build-out.
gain on investments gain on investments decreased in 2013, compared to 2012, due to higher net gains recorded in 2012 related to our privately-held investments which included a $14.7 million gain from the acquisition of our privately-held investment in contrail.
income tax provision the effective rate for 2014 differs from the federal statutory rate of 35% primarily due to the impact of the non-deductible goodwill charge and tax gain on sale of junos pulse offset by the benefit from release of the company's valuation allowance attributable to investment losses, the federal r&d credit, recognition of domestic production activities deductions, and earnings in foreign jurisdictions, which are subject to lower tax rates. the passage of tax increase prevention act of 2014 on december 19, 2014 retroactively reinstated the u.s. federal r&d tax credit from january 1, 2014 to december 31, 2014.
48
the effective rate for 2013 was lower than the federal statutory rate of 35% primarily due to the benefit of the federal r&d credit, a tax settlement with the irs, recognition of domestic production activities deductions, and earnings in foreign jurisdictions, which are subject to lower tax rates.
the effective tax rate for 2012 was substantially similar to the federal statutory rate of 35%. the effective rate for 2012 does not reflect the benefit of the federal r&d credit which expired on december 31, 2011.
our effective tax rate could fluctuate significantly on a quarterly basis and could be adversely affected to the extent earnings are lower than anticipated in countries that have lower statutory rates and higher than anticipated in countries that have higher statutory rates. our effective tax rate could also fluctuate due to changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets or liabilities, or by changes in tax laws, regulations, or accounting principles, as well as certain discrete items. as a result of the expiration of the federal research and development credit on december 31, 2014, we expect our effective tax rate to increase in 2015 see item1a of part i, "risk factors" of this report for a description of relevant risks which may adversely affect our results.
for a complete reconciliation of our effective tax rate to the u.s. federal statutory rate of 35% and further explanation of our income tax provision, see note 14, income taxes, in notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 of part ii of this report.

the significant components of our working capital are cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, and accounts receivable, reduced by accounts payable, accrued liabilities, and short-term deferred revenue. working capital decreased by $818.3 million during the year ended december 31, 2014, primarily due to a decrease in cash and cash equivalents as a result of our stock repurchase activities, tax payments, dividends, and purchase of capital equipment, as well as a decline in short term investments.
summary of cash flows as of december 31, 2014, our cash and cash equivalents decreased by $644.4 million from december 31, 2013 primarily due to purchases and retirement of our common stock in connection with our stock repurchase program, capital expenditures, federal estimated tax payment, dividend payout and higher payments related to all restructuring plans, partially offset by the issuance of the 2024 notes in february 2014, cash received from the sale of certain equity investments, cash received from the patent litigation settlement, and proceeds from the sale of junos pulse.

operating activities
2014 compared to 2013
cash flow from operations decreased by $82.5 million in 2014, compared to 2013, primarily due to lower cash collections from customers, higher payments related to our restructuring plans, higher taxes paid, and lower prepayments compared to prior year.
2013 compared to 2012
cash flows from operations increased by $208.2 million in 2013, compared to 2012, primarily due to higher net income, the timing of payments to our vendors, higher deferred revenue, and lower taxes paid, partially offset by the timing of payments for incentive compensation to our employees and the timing of collections on our outstanding receivables.
investing activities
2014 compared to 2013
net cash provided by investing was $434.0 million in 2014, compared to net cash used in investing of $561.0 million in 2013. the increase in net cash provided by investing activities was primarily due to higher proceeds from sale of investments and fewer purchases of investments, as well as proceeds received from the sale of junos pulse.
2013 compared to 2012
net cash used in investing activities decreased by $34.6 million in 2013, compared to 2012, primarily due to lower spending on acquisitions and asset purchases as well as lower capital expenditures as we completed our phased sunnyvale campus build-out, partially offset by higher purchases of investments.
financing activities
2014 compared to 2013
net cash used in financing activities increased by $1,422.5 million in 2014, compared to 2013, primarily due to purchases and retirement of our common stock and payment of cash dividends, partially offset by the issuance of the 2024 notes.
2013 compared to 2012
net cash used in financing activities decreased by $146.6 million in 2013, compared to 2012, primarily due to lower purchases and retirement of our common stock, partially offset by an increase in proceeds from employee stock option exercises as well as proceeds from customer financing arrangements.
stock repurchase activities in february 2014, the board approved a stock repurchase program that authorized us to repurchase up to $2.1 billion of our common stock ("2014 stock repurchase program"). in october 2014, the board authorized a $1.3 billion increase to the 2014 stock repurchase program for a total of $3.4 billion. as of december 31, 2014, there was $1.2 billion of authorized funds remaining under the 2014 stock repurchase program. we intend to repurchase $1.0 billion of our common stock by the end of the second quarter of 2015 as part of our three year capital return program, subject to raising additional debt financing. future share repurchases will be subject to a review of the circumstances at that time and will be made from time to time in private transactions or open market purchases as permitted by securities laws and other legal requirements. our stock repurchase programs may be discontinued at any time.

_______________________________
(1)   as part of the 2014 stock repurchase program, we entered into two separate accelerated share repurchase agreements (collectively, the "asr") with two financial institutions to repurchase $1.2 billion of our common stock. we made an up-front payment of $1.2 billion pursuant to the asr to repurchase our common stock. the aggregate number of shares ultimately purchased was determined based on a volume weighted average repurchase price, less an agreed upon discount. the shares received with respect to the asr have been retired. retired shares return to authorized but unissued shares of common stock.
dividends on july 22, 2014, we declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.10 per share of our common stock, or $43.8 million in the aggregate, to stockholders of record on september 2, 2014 which was paid on september 23, 2014. on october 23, 2014, we declared a cash dividend of $0.10 per share of common stock, or $42.2 million, on december 23, 2014 to stockholders of record as of the close of business on december 2, 2014. any future dividends, and the establishment of record and payment dates, are subject to approval by our board or an authorized committee thereof. see note 18, subsequent events, in notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 of part ii of this report for further discussion on our dividend declaration subsequent to december 31, 2014.
restructuring as of december 31, 2014, our restructuring liability was $17.0 million of which $9.4 million is related to severance, which are expected to be paid in full by the first quarter of 2015, $7.4 million related to facility closures, expected to be paid through march 2018, and $0.2 million related to contract and other charges. see note 9, restructuring and other charges, in notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 of part ii of this report for further discussion on our restructuring plans.
deferred revenue deferred product revenue represents unrecognized revenue related to shipments to distributors that have not sold through to end-users, undelivered product commitments, and other shipments that have not met all revenue recognition criteria. deferred product revenue is recorded net of the related costs of product revenue. deferred service revenue represents customer payments made in advance for services, which include technical support, hardware and software maintenance, professional services, and training.
the following table summarizes our deferred product and service revenues (in millions):
as of december 31,

51
as of december 31, 2014, net deferred product revenue decreased $19.4 million to $225.6 million, compared to $245.0 million as of december 31, 2013, as a result of lower distributor inventory and multiple revenue releases in relation to previously deferred product revenue. as of december 31, 2014, the increase in deferred service revenue of $25.8 million attributed to the execution of several multi-year support agreements, and an increase in annual agreement renewals.
off-balance sheet arrangements as of december 31, 2014 and 2013, we did not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities, which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes. it is not our business practice to enter into off-balance sheet arrangements. however, in the normal course of business, we enter into contracts consisting of guarantees of product and service performance, guarantees related to third-party customer-financing arrangements, customs and duties guarantees, and standby letters of credit for certain lease facilities. see "guarantees" below and note 16, commitments and contingencies, in notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 of part ii of this report for additional information regarding our guarantees.
contractual obligations our principal commitments consist of obligations outstanding under operating leases, purchase commitments, debt, and other contractual obligations. the following table summarizes our principal contractual obligations as of december 31, 2014 and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow in future periods (in millions):

(2) see note 10, long-term debt and financing, in notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 of part ii of this report for additional information regarding our debt.
as of december 31, 2014, we had $177.5 million included in long-term income taxes payable in the consolidated balance sheets for unrecognized tax positions. at this time, we are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing of payments related to this amount due to uncertainties in the timing of tax audit outcomes. as a result, this amount is not included in the table above.
revolving credit facility on june 27, 2014, we entered into a credit agreement with certain institutional lenders that provides for a five year $500.0 million unsecured revolving credit facility, with an option to increase the amount of the credit facility by up to an additional $200.0 million, subject to certain conditions. proceeds from borrowing made under the credit agreement may be used by us for working capital and general corporate purposes. revolving loans may be borrowed, repaid and reborrowed until june 27, 2019, at which time all amounts borrowed must be repaid. we will pay to each lender a facility fee on a quarterly basis based on the amount of each lender's commitment to make loans, of between 0.100% and 0.250% depending on our public debt rating. revolving loans may be prepaid without penalty, subject to customary breakage costs for loans bearing interest at the eurocurrency rate. we are also obligated to pay customary fees for a credit facility of this size and type.
the credit agreement includes customary events of default that, include among other things, non-payment of principal, interest or fees, inaccuracy of representations and warranties, violation of covenants, cross default to certain other indebtedness, bankruptcy and insolvency events involving the company or its material subsidiaries, material judgments, change of control and certain erisa events. the occurrence of an event of default could result in the acceleration of the obligations under the credit agreement.
52
a default interest rate shall apply, at the request of the required lenders, on all obligations during a payment event of default under the credit agreement at a rate per annum equal to 2.000% above the applicable interest rate.
the credit agreement requires us to maintain a leverage ratio no greater than 3.0x and an interest coverage ratio no less than 3.0x during the term of the credit facility. in addition, the credit agreement contains customary affirmative and negative covenants, including covenants that limit or restrict the ability of the company and its subsidiaries to, among other things, grant liens, merge or consolidate, dispose of all or substantially all of its assets, change their accounting or reporting policies, change their business and incur subsidiary indebtedness, in each case subject to customary exceptions for a credit facility of this size and type. as of december 31, 2014, the company was in compliance with all covenants in the credit agreement, and no amounts were outstanding. see note 10, long-term debt and financing, in notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 of part ii of this report.
guarantees we have entered into agreements with customers that contain indemnification provisions relating to potential situations where claims could be alleged that our products infringe the intellectual property rights of a third-party. we also have financial guarantees consisting of guarantees of product and service performance, guarantees related to third-party customer-financing arrangements, custom and duty guarantees, and standby letters of credit for certain lease facilities. under certain third-party customer financing arrangements that contain guarantee provisions, which have terms of up to four years, we are liable for the aggregate unpaid payments to the third-party financing company in the event of customer default. as of december 31, 2014, we have not made any payments under these arrangements. as of december 31, 2014 and december 31, 2013, we had $26.2 million and $40.1 million, respectively, in financing guarantees, bank guarantees, and standby letters of credit related to these financial guarantees of which $22.2 million in financing guarantees was recorded in other accrued liabilities and other long-term liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets as of december 31, 2014.
liquidity and capital resources liquidity and capital resources may be impacted by our operating activities as well as acquisitions and investments in strategic relationships that we have made or we may make in the future. additionally, in 2014, we indicated that we intend to return $4.1 billion to our stockholders in the form of stock repurchases and dividends from february 2014 through the end of 2016. to the extent we repurchase additional shares of our common stock under our stock repurchase program or pay cash dividends on our common stock, our liquidity may be impacted.
in august 2013, we filed an automatic shelf registration statement with the sec enabling us to offer for sale, from time to time, an unspecified amount of securities in one or more offerings and is intended to give us flexibility to take advantage of financing opportunities as needed or deemed desirable in light of market conditions. our 2024 notes were issued under the automatic shelf registration statement which was issued pursuant to a prospectus filed with the sec on february 28, 2014. any other offerings of securities under the automatic shelf registration statement will be made pursuant to a prospectus. in addition, the revolving credit facility under our credit agreement will also provide additional flexibility for future liquidity needs.
we have been focused on managing our annual equity usage as a percentage of our common stock outstanding to align with peer group competitive levels and have made changes in recent years to reduce the number of shares underlying the equity awards we grant. our intention for 2014 was to target the number of shares underlying equity awards granted on an annual basis at 2.50% or less of our common stock outstanding on a pure share basis (where each option, rsu, rsa or psa granted is counted as one share). based upon shares underlying options, rsus, rsas, and psas granted during 2014, we were at or below this target.
based on past performance and current expectations, we believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents, short-term, and long-term investments, together with cash generated from operations and access to capital markets and the revolving credit facility under the credit agreement will be sufficient to fund our operations, planned stock repurchases and dividends, and anticipated growth for at least the next twelve months. we believe our working capital is sufficient to meet our liquidity requirements for capital expenditures, commitments, and other liquidity requirements associated with our existing operations during the same period. however, our future liquidity and capital requirements may vary materially from those now planned depending on many factors, including, but not limited to:
•   level and mix of our product, sales, and gross profit margins;
•   our business, product, capital expenditures and r&amp;d plans;
•   repurchases of our common stock;
53
•   payment of dividends;
•   incurrence and repayment of debt and related interest obligations;
•   litigation expenses, settlements, and judgments, or similar items related to resolution of tax audits;
•   volume price discounts and customer rebates;
•   accounts receivable levels that we maintain;
•   acquisitions and/or funding of other businesses, assets, products, or technologies;
•   changes in our compensation policies;
•   capital improvements for new and existing facilities;
•   technological advances;
•   our competitors' responses to our products and/or pricing;
•   our relationships with suppliers, partners, and customers;
•   possible future investments in raw material and finished goods inventories;
•   expenses related to future restructuring plans;
•   tax expense associated with share-based awards;
•   issuance of share-based awards and the related payment in cash for withholding taxes in the current year and possibly during future years;
•   level of exercises of stock options and stock purchases under our equity incentive plans; and
•   general economic conditions and specific conditions in our industry and markets, including the effects of disruptions in global credit and financial markets, international conflicts, and related uncertainties.

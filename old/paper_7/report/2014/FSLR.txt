executive overview we are a global provider of solar energy solutions, focused on providing power solutions across key market segments. we design, manufacture, and sell pv solar modules with an advanced thin-film semiconductor technology, and we develop, design, construct, and sell pv solar power solutions that primarily use the solar modules we manufacture. we also manufacture crystalline silicon solar modules with proprietary high-power density, mono-crystalline technology, and we provide single-axis mounting systems with proprietary tracking capabilities. additionally, we provide o&m services to plant owners that use solar modules manufactured by us or by other third-party manufacturers. we have substantial, ongoing research and development efforts focused on module and systems level innovations. we are the world's largest thin-film pv solar module manufacturer and one of the world's largest pv solar module manufacturers. our mission is to create enduring value by enabling a world powered by clean, affordable solar energy.
certain highlights of our financial results and other key developments include:
•   net sales for 2014 increased by 3% to $3.4 billion compared to $3.3 billion in 2013. the increase was driven by higher systems business project revenue, partially offset by lower third-party module net sales. the increase in systems business project revenue was primarily attributable to higher revenue from the partial sale of our solar gen 2 project, the sale of our campo verde and macho springs projects, and the commencement of construction and related revenue recognition on multiple projects in california and our nyngan project in australia. these increases were partially offset by decreases in systems business project revenue resulting from our desert sunlight project as it nears substantial completion, our completed first phase of the imperial valley energy center south project, our completed amherstburg, belmont, and walpole projects, and the completion of the agua caliente project. the decrease in third-party module net sales was due to a 26% reduction in the volume of watts sold and a 19% decrease in the average selling price per watt.
•   gross profit decreased 1.7 percentage points to 24.4% during 2014 from 26.1% during 2013, primarily due to a mix of lower gross profit projects sold and under construction in 2014 and an adjustment for lower estimated recycling costs recorded in 2013. these decreases in gross profit were partially offset by favorable changes in estimated costs on systems
47
projects accounted for under the percentage-of-completion method, a lower volume of third-party module net sales, which generally have margins less than systems business projects, and higher capacity utilization of our manufacturing facilities.
•   as of december 31, 2014, we had 30 installed production lines with an annual global manufacturing capacity of approximately 2.7 gw at our manufacturing facilities in perrysburg, ohio and kulim, malaysia. we produced 1.8 gw dc of solar modules during 2014 which represented a 13% increase from 2013. the increase in production was primarily driven by higher module efficiency. we expect to produce approximately 2.5 gw of solar modules during 2015.
•   during 2014, we ran our manufacturing facilities at approximately 81% capacity utilization, which represented a 4 percentage point increase from 2013.
•   the average conversion efficiency of our modules was 14.0% in 2014, which was an improvement of 0.8 percentage points from our average conversion efficiency of 13.2% in 2013.
market overview the solar industry continues to be characterized by intense pricing competition, both at the module and system levels. in the aggregate, we believe manufacturers of solar modules and cells have installed significant production capacity in relation to global demand. we believe the solar industry will continue to experience periods of structural imbalance between supply and demand (i.e., where production capacity exceeds global demand), and that such periods will put pressure on pricing. additionally, intense competition at the systems level can result in an environment in which pricing falls rapidly, thereby further increasing demand for solar solutions but constraining the ability for project developers, epc companies, and/or vertically-integrated solar companies such as first solar to sustain meaningful and consistent profitability. in light of such market realities, we continue to execute our long term strategic plan described below under which we are focusing on our competitive strengths. a key core strength is our differentiated, vertically integrated business model that enables us to provide utility-scale pv generation solutions to sustainable geographic markets that have an immediate need for mass-scale pv electricity.
solar markets worldwide continue to develop, in part aided by demand elasticity resulting from declining industry average selling prices, both at the module and system level, which make solar power more affordable to new markets, and we have continued to develop our localized presence and expertise in these markets. we are developing, constructing, or operating multiple solar projects around the world, many of them the largest or among the largest in their regions, including:
•   our 141 mw ac luz del norte pv power plant under construction near copiapó, chile, which upon completion will be the largest solar plant in the region and the biggest solar power facility in the world to sell electricity on an open contract basis;
•   a 53 mw ac solar plant in jordan, which upon completion will be the largest pv power plant in the middle east;
•   a 45 mw ac project located at two sites in the state of telangana, india; and
•   the 102 mw ac nyngan and 53 mw ac broken hill solar plants, located in new south wales, australia, which upon completion will be australia's largest utility-scale solar facilities.
in north america, we continue to execute on our advanced-stage utility-scale project pipeline. we continue to make construction progress on what are currently or will be among the world's largest pv solar power systems. we expect a substantial portion of our consolidated net sales, operating income, and cash flows through the end of 2016 to be derived from these projects. we continue to advance the development and selling efforts for the other projects included in our advanced-stage utility-scale project pipeline, and we continue to develop our early-to-mid stage project pipeline and evaluate acquisitions of projects to continue to add to our advanced-stage utility-scale project pipeline.
lower industry module and system pricing, while currently challenging for certain solar manufacturers (particularly manufacturers with high cost structures), is expected to continue to contribute to global market diversification and volume elasticity. over time, declining average selling prices are consistent with the erosion of one of the primary historical constraints to widespread solar market penetration, its affordability. in the near term, however, declining average selling prices could adversely affect our results of operations. if competitors reduce pricing to levels below their costs, bid aggressively low prices for ppas and epc agreements, or are able to operate at negative or minimal operating margins for sustained periods of time, our results of operations could be further adversely affected. we continue to mitigate this uncertainty in part by executing on and building our advanced-stage utility-scale systems pipeline, executing on our module efficiency improvement and bos cost reduction roadmaps to maintain
48
and increase our competitiveness, profitability, and capital efficiency, adjusting our production plans and capacity utilization, and continuing the development of worldwide geographic markets.
in the components business, we continue to face intense competition from manufacturers of crystalline silicon solar modules and other types of solar modules and pv systems. solar module manufacturers compete with one another in several product performance attributes, including reliability and selling price per watt, and, with respect to solar power systems, net present value ("npv"), return on equity ("roe"), and levelized cost of electricity ("lcoe"), meaning the net present value of total life cycle costs of the solar power project divided by the quantity of energy which is expected to be produced over the system's life. we believe we are among the lowest cost pv module manufacturers in the solar industry on a module cost per watt basis, based on publicly available information. this cost competitiveness is reflected in the price at which we sell our modules and fully integrated pv solar power systems and enables our pv solar power systems to compete favorably. our cost competitiveness is based in large part on our proprietary technology (which enables conversion efficiency improvements and enables us to produce a module in less than 2.5 hours using a continuous and highly automated industrial manufacturing process, as opposed to a batch process), our scale, and our operational excellence. in addition, our cdte modules use approximately 1-2% of the amount of the polysilicon that is used to manufacture traditional crystalline silicon solar modules. the cost of polysilicon is a significant driver of the manufacturing cost of crystalline silicon solar modules, and the timing and rate of change in the cost of silicon feedstock and polysilicon could lead to changes in solar module pricing levels. polysilicon costs have had periods of decline over the past several years, contributing to a decline in our manufacturing cost competitiveness over traditional crystalline silicon module manufacturers. given the lower conversion efficiency and smaller size (sometimes referred to as form factor) of our modules compared to certain types of crystalline silicon modules, there may be higher bos costs associated with systems using our modules. thus, to compete effectively on the basis of lcoe, our modules need to maintain a certain cost advantage per watt compared to crystalline silicon-based modules with higher conversion efficiencies. we continue to focus on reducing bos costs associated with pv solar power systems using our modules. we believe we can continue to reduce bos costs by improving module conversion efficiency, leveraging volume procurement around standardized hardware platforms, using innovative installation techniques and know how, and accelerating installation times to reduce labor costs. bos costs can represent a significant portion of the costs associated with the construction of a typical utility-scale pv solar power system.
while our modules and pv solar power systems are generally competitive in cost, reliability, and performance attributes, there can be no guarantee such competitiveness will continue to exist in the future to the same extent or at all. any declines in the competitiveness of our products could result in additional margin compression, further declines in the average selling prices of our solar modules and pv solar power systems, erosion in our market share for modules and pv solar power systems, decreases in the rate of net sales growth, and/or declines in overall net sales. we have taken, and continue to take, various actions to mitigate the potential impact resulting from competitive pressures, including accelerating progress along our module efficiency improvement and bos cost reduction roadmaps and further focusing our research and development on increasing the conversion efficiency of our solar modules.
as we continue to expand our systems business into sustainable markets, we can offer value beyond the solar module, reduce our exposure to module-only competition, provide differentiated product offerings to minimize the impact of solar module commoditization, and provide comprehensive utility-scale pv solar power system solutions that significantly reduce solar electricity costs. thus, our systems business allows us to play a more active role than many of our competitors in managing the demand for our solar modules. finally, we continue to form and develop strong relationships with our customers and strategic partners around the world and continue to develop our range of product offerings, including epc capabilities and o&m services, in order to enhance the competitiveness of systems using our solar modules. for example, we have and expect in the future to form joint ventures or other business arrangements with project developers in certain strategic markets in order to provide our modules and potential systems business pv generation solutions to the projects developed by such ventures.
certain trends and uncertainties we believe that our continuing operations may be favorably or unfavorably impacted by the following trends and uncertainties that may affect our financial condition and results of operations. see item 1a: "risk factors" and elsewhere in this annual report on form 10-k for a discussion of other risks that may affect our financial condition and results of operations.
long term strategic plan in executing our long term strategic plan we are focusing on providing solar pv generation solutions using our modules to sustainable geographic markets that we believe have a compelling need for mass-scale pv electricity, including markets throughout the americas, asia, australia, the middle east, and africa. as part of our long term strategic plan, we are focusing on opportunities in which our solar pv generation solutions can compete directly with fossil fuel offerings on an lcoe or similar basis, or complement such fossil fuel electricity generations. execution of the long term strategic plan entails a reallocation of resources
49
around the globe, in particular, dedicating resources to regions such as latin america, asia, the middle east, and africa. we are evaluating and closely managing the appropriate level of resources required as we transition into and penetrate these specific markets. we have and intend to continue to dedicate significant capital and human resources to reduce the total installed cost of solar pv generation, to optimize the design and logistics around our solar pv generation solutions, and to ensure that our solutions integrate well into the overall electricity ecosystem of each specific market.
we expect that, over time, an increasing portion of our consolidated net sales, operating income, and cash flows will come from solar offerings in the sustainable markets described above as we execute on our long term strategic plan. the timing, execution, and financial impacts of our long term strategic plan are subject to risks and uncertainties, as described in the risk factors. we are focusing our resources in those markets and energy applications in which solar power can be a least-cost, best-fit energy solution, particularly in regions with high solar resources, significant current or projected electricity demand, and/or relatively high existing electricity prices. as part of these efforts, we continue to expand resources globally, including the appointment of country heads, business development, sales personnel, and other supporting professional staff in target sustainable markets. accordingly, we are shifting current costs and expect to incur additional costs over time as we establish a localized business presence in these regions.
joint ventures or other business arrangements with strategic partners are a key part of our long term strategic plan, and we use such arrangements to expedite our penetration of various markets and establish relationships with potential customers and policymakers. some of these business arrangements involve and are expected in the future to involve significant investments or other allocations of capital. we continue to develop relationships with policymakers, regulators, and end customers in each of these markets with a view to creating markets for utility scale pv solar power systems. we sell solar power solutions directly to end customers, including independent power producers, utilities, retail electricity providers, and commercial and industrial customers. depending on the market opportunity, our sales offerings range from module only sales to module sales with a range of development, epc services, and other solutions, to full turn-key pv solar power system sales. we expect these sales offerings to continue to evolve over time as we work with our customers to optimize how our pv solar generation solutions can best meet our customers' energy and economic needs. in addition to our utility-scale power plant offerings, we have fuel displacement, commercial, industrial, and off-grid and energy access offerings.
in order to create or maintain a market position in certain strategically targeted markets, our offerings from time to time may need to be competitively priced at levels associated with minimal gross profit margins, which may adversely affect our results of operations. we expect the profitability associated with our various sales offerings to vary from one another over time, and possibly vary from our internal long-range profitability expectations and targets, depending on the market opportunity and the relative competitiveness of our offering compared with other energy solutions, fossil fuel based or otherwise, that are available to potential customers.
we expect to use our working capital, the availability under our revolving credit facility, or non-recourse or limited-recourse project financing to finance the construction of certain of our pv solar power systems, if the sale of such systems prior to the commencement of construction does not meet our economic return expectations or we cannot sell under terms and conditions that are favorable to us. from time to time, we may own and operate certain pv solar power systems, often with the intention to sell at a later date. the ability to do so allows us to gain control of the sales process, provide a lower risk profile to a future buyer of a pv solar power system, and improve our ability to drive higher eventual sale values. we may also elect to construct and retain ownership interests in power plants for which there is no ppa with an off-taker, such as a utility, but rather an intent to sell the electricity produced by the plant in a competitive wholesale market. we continue to pursue strategic partnerships that open up new geographic markets. we also continue to assess and pursue other business arrangements that provide access to a lower cost of capital and optimize the value of our projects. business arrangements that can lower the cost of capital and provide other benefits relating to the project sales process, such as yieldco arrangements (as described below and under the heading "liquidity and capital resources"), have been used increasingly by renewable energy companies. additionally, our joint ventures and other business arrangements with strategic partners have and may in the future result in us temporarily retaining a minority or noncontrolling ownership interest in the underlying systems projects we develop, supply modules to, or construct potentially for a period of up to several years. such business arrangements could become increasingly important to our competitive profile in markets globally, including north america. in each of the above mentioned examples, we may retain such ownership interests in a consolidated and/or unconsolidated separate entity.
yieldco on february 23, 2015, we and sunpower announced that we are in advanced negotiations to form a joint yieldco to which the parties each expect to contribute a portfolio of selected solar generation assets from their existing portfolios of assets. upon the execution of a master formation agreement, the parties intend to file a registration statement with the securities and exchange commission for an initial public offering of limited partner interests in the yieldco. formation of the yieldco and completion of
50
the ipo are subject to, among other things, the execution of definitive documentation, each party's board approval, and regulatory approval. there is no assurance that the yieldco will be formed or that the ipo will be consummated or that any other transaction will occur.
construction of some of the world's largest pv solar power systems we continue to execute on our advanced-stage utility-scale project pipeline. we expect a substantial portion of our consolidated net sales, operating income, and cash flows through 2016 to be derived from several large projects, including the following projects which will be among the world's largest pv solar power systems: the 250 mw mccoy solar energy project, located in riverside county, california; the 250 mw silver state south project, located near primm in clark county, nevada; and the 150 mw imperial solar energy center west project, located in imperial county, california, which are all under contract, and the following projects which are not yet sold or contracted: the 300 mw stateline project, located in san bernardino county, california; the 280mw california flats project, located in monterey county, california; the 250 mw moapa project, located in clark county, nevada; and the 141 mw luz del norte project located near copiapó, chile. please see the tables under "management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations-systems project pipeline" for additional information about these and other projects within our systems business advanced-stage project pipeline. the construction progress of these projects is subject to risks and delays as described in the risk factors. revenue recognition for these and other systems projects is in many cases not linear in nature due to the timing of when all revenue recognition criteria have been or are expected to be met, and consequently period-over-period comparisons of results of operations may not be meaningful. as we progress construction towards substantial completion of these pv solar power systems, we may have a larger portion of our net sales, operating income, and cash flows come from future sales of solar offerings outside of north america, pursuant to our long term strategic plan described above. north america, however, will continue to represent a meaningful portion of our net sales, operating income, and cash flows through 2016 as a significant portion of our advanced-stage project pipeline, excluding the projects above, is also comprised of projects in north america.
systems project pipeline the following tables summarize, as of february 24, 2015, our approximately 3.2 gw systems business advanced-stage project pipeline. as of december 31, 2014, for the projects sold/ under contract in our advanced-stage project pipeline of approximately 1.5 gw, we have recognized revenue with respect to the equivalent of approximately 0.2 gw. such mw equivalent amount refers to the ratio of revenue recognized for the projects sold/ under contract in our advanced-stage project pipeline compared to total contracted revenue for such projects, multiplied by the total mw for such projects. the remaining revenue to be recognized subsequent to december 31, 2014 for the projects sold/ under contract in our advanced-stage project pipeline is expected to be approximately $3.0 billion. the substantial majority of this amount is expected to be recognized as revenue through the later of the substantial completion or project closing dates of the projects sold/ under contract. the remaining revenue to be recognized does not have a direct correlation to expected remaining module shipments for such projects sold/ under contract as expected module shipments do not represent total systems revenues and do not consider the timing of when all revenue recognition criteria are met including the timing of module installation. the actual volume of modules installed in our projects sold/ under contract will be greater than the project size in mw ac as module volumes required for a project are based upon mw dc, which will be greater than the mw ac size pursuant to a dc-ac ratio typically ranging from 1.2 to 1.4. such ratio varies across different projects due to various system design factors. projects are removed from our advanced-stage project pipeline tables below once we have completed construction and after all revenue has been recognized.
we continually seek to make additions to our advanced-stage project pipeline. we are actively developing our early to mid-stage project pipeline in order to secure ppas and are also pursuing opportunities to acquire advanced-stage projects, which already have ppas in place. from february 26, 2014 through february 24, 2015, we acquired 1.4 mw of advanced-stage projects, and we expect to acquire additional advanced-stage projects when such acquisitions meet our strategic and/or our return on investment requirements.

segment overview we operate our business in two segments. our components segment involves the design, manufacture, and sale of solar modules which convert sunlight into electricity. we primarily manufacture cdte modules and have also begun manufacturing high-efficiency crystalline silicon modules. third-party customers of our components segment include project developers, system integrators, and owners and operators of pv solar power systems.
our second segment is our fully integrated systems segment, through which we provide complete turn-key pv solar power systems, or solar solutions that draw upon our capabilities, which include (i) project development, (ii) epc services, (iii) o&m services, and (iv) project finance expertise. we may provide our full epc services or any combination of individual products and services within our epc capabilities depending upon the customer and market opportunity. all of our systems segment products and services are for pv solar power systems which primarily use our solar modules, and such products and services are sold directly to investor owned utilities, independent power developers and producers, commercial and industrial companies, and other system owners. additionally, within our systems segment, we may hold and operate certain of our pv solar power systems based on strategic opportunities.
in our reportable segment financial disclosures, we include an allocation of net sales value for all solar modules manufactured by our components segment and installed in projects sold or built by our systems segment in the net sales of our components segment. in the gross profit of our reportable segment disclosures, we include the corresponding cost of sales value for the solar modules installed in projects sold or built by our systems segment in the components segment. the cost of solar modules is comprised of the manufactured cost incurred by our components segment.
see note 24 "segment and geographical information," to our consolidated financial statements for the year ended december 31, 2014 included in this annual report on form 10-k.
see also item 7: "management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations - systems project pipeline" for a description of the projects in our advanced-stage project pipeline. due to the distinct size, profitability, and terms of the underlying sales arrangements for each project under construction, the timing of meeting all revenue recognition criteria may create uneven net sales and gross profit patterns, making year over year comparisons less meaningful.

product revenue the following table sets forth the total amounts of solar modules and solar power systems net sales for the years ended december 31, 2014, 2013, and 2012. for the purpose of the following table, (a) solar module revenue is composed of total net sales from the sale of solar modules to third parties, and (b) solar power system revenue is composed of total net sales from the sale of pv solar power systems and related services and solutions including the solar modules installed in the pv solar power systems we develop and construct along with revenue generated from our pv solar power systems (in thousands):
2014                    2013                    2012
solar module revenue                  $228,319                $380,869                $325,427
solar power system revenue           3,163,495               2,928,120               3,043,118
net sales                           $3,391,814              $3,308,989              $3,368,545
solar module revenue to third parties decreased by $152.6 million during 2014 compared to 2013 due to a 26% reduction in the volume of watts sold and a 19% decrease in the average selling price per watt.
solar power system revenue increased by $235.4 million during 2014 compared to 2013 primarily as a result of the number and size of projects under construction between these periods as well as the timing of when all the revenue recognition criteria have been met. specifically, the increase was attributable to higher revenue from the partial sale of our solar gen 2 project, the sale of our campo verde and macho springs projects, and the commencement of construction and related revenue recognition on multiple projects in california and our agl nyngan project in australia. these increases were partially offset by decreases in systems business project revenue resulting from our desert sunlight project as it nears substantial completion, our completed first phase of the imperial valley energy center south project, our completed amherstburg, belmont, and walpole projects, and the completion of the agua caliente project.
solar module revenue to third parties increased by $55.4 million during 2013 compared to 2012 due to an increase in the volume of watts sold of 39%, partially offset by a 15% decrease in the average selling price per watt.
solar power system revenue decreased by $115.0 million for 2013 compared to 2012 primarily due to the number and size of projects under construction between these periods as well as the timing of when all the revenue recognition criteria have been met. solar power system revenue included decreases in net sales from our av solar ranch one, copper mountain 2, and topaz projects, which are at various points of completion, combined with reductions in net sales for the substantially completed agua caliente, alpine, silver state north, avra valley, and greenough river projects. these decreases were partially offset by increases in net sales from the initial revenue recognition for our desert sunlight, pnm, and dewa projects combined with increases in net sales from our completed first phase of the imperial energy center south project and our projects in canada, including amherstburg, belmont, and walpole.
net sales components business we generally price and sell our solar modules per watt of name plate power. during 2014, a significant portion of net sales from the components business related to modules included in our pv solar power systems described below under "net sales - systems business." other than the modules included in our pv solar power systems, we sold the majority of our solar modules to pv solar power system project developers, system integrators, and operators who own, operate, or construct solar projects in india, great britain, israel, and the united states.
from time to time we enter into module sales agreements with customers worldwide for specific projects or volumes of modules. such agreements are generally not long-term in nature. during the years ended december 31, 2014 and 2013, 39% and 48%, respectively, of our components business net sales, excluding modules included in our pv solar power systems, were denominated in euros and were subject to fluctuations in the exchange rate between the euro and u.s. dollar.
under our typical customer sales contracts for solar modules, we transfer title and risk of loss to the customer and recognize revenue upon shipment. pricing is typically fixed or determinable at the time of shipment, and our customers do not typically have extended payment terms. customers do not have rights of return under these contracts. our revenue recognition policies for the components business are described further in note 2 "summary of significant accounting policies," to our consolidated financial statements for the year ended december 31, 2014 included in this annual report on form 10-k.
55
during 2014, southern company, midamerican energy company, and nextera energy, inc. individually accounted for more than 10% of our components segment's net sales, which includes the solar modules used in our systems projects.
systems business through our fully integrated systems business, we provide a complete turn-key solar power system solution using our solar modules, which may include project development, epc services, o&m services, and project finance expertise. additionally, from time to time we may own and operate pv solar power systems, which will be included within our systems business. revenue recognition for our systems projects are in many cases not linear in nature due to the timing of when all revenue recognition criteria are met, and consequently, period over period comparisons of results of operations may not be meaningful. we typically use the percentage-of-completion method using actual costs incurred over total estimated costs to construct a project (including module costs) as our standard accounting policy, but we only apply this method after all revenue recognition criteria have been met. there are also many instances in which we recognize revenue only after a project has been completed, primarily due to a project not being sold prior to completion or because all revenue recognition criteria are not met until the project is completed. our revenue recognition policies for the systems business are described in further detail in note 2 "summary of significant accounting policies," to our consolidated financial statements for the year ended december 31, 2014 included in this annual report on form 10-k.
during 2014, 2013, and 2012, the majority of our systems segment net sales were generated in north america.
during 2014, the principal customers of our systems segment were southern company, nextera energy, inc., and midamerican energy company, each of which accounted for more than 10% of our systems segment sales.

the 3% increase in net sales during the year ended december 31, 2014 compared with the year ended december 31, 2013 was primarily due to a 7% increase in net sales from our systems segment, partially offset by a 6% decrease in net sales from our components segment.
net sales from our components segment, which includes solar modules used in our systems projects, decreased by $71.3 million due to a 12% decrease in average selling prices, partially offset by a 7% increase in the volume of watts sold.
net sales from our systems segment, which excludes solar modules used in our systems projects, increased by $154.1 million, primarily as a result of the number and size of projects under construction between these periods as well as the timing of when all the revenue recognition criteria have been met. specifically, the increase was attributable to higher revenue from the partial sale of our solar gen 2 project, the sale of our campo verde and macho springs projects, and the commencement of construction and related revenue recognition on multiple projects in california and our agl nyngan project in australia. these increases were partially offset by decreases in systems business project revenue resulting from our desert sunlight project as it nears substantial completion, our completed first phase of the imperial valley energy center south project, our completed amherstburg, belmont, and walpole projects, and the completion of the agua caliente project.
the 2% decrease in net sales during 2013 compared with 2012 was primarily due to a 2% decrease in net sales from our systems segment and a 1% decrease in net sales from our components segment.
net sales from our components segment, which includes solar modules used in our systems projects, decreased by $12.0 million due to a 17% decrease in average selling prices, partially offset by a 19% increase in the volume of watts sold.
56
net sales from our systems segment, which excludes solar modules used in our systems projects, decreased by $47.5 million, primarily due to the number and size of projects under construction between these periods as well as the timing of when all revenue recognition criteria have been met. net sales from our systems segment included decreases in net sales from our av solar ranch one, copper mountain 2, and topaz projects, which are at various points of completion combined with reductions in net sales for the substantially completed agua caliente, alpine, silver state north, avra valley, and greenough river projects. these decreases were partially offset by increases in net sales from initial revenue recognition for our desert sunlight, pnm, and dewa projects combined with increases in net sales from our completed first phase of the imperial energy center south project and our projects in canada, including amherstburg, belmont, and walpole.
cost of sales components business our cost of sales includes the cost of raw materials and components for manufacturing solar modules, such as glass, transparent conductive coatings, cadmium telluride and other thin film semiconductors, laminate materials, connector assemblies, edge seal materials, and other materials and components. our cost of sales also includes direct labor for the manufacturing of solar modules and manufacturing overhead such as engineering, equipment maintenance, environmental health and safety, quality and production control, and procurement costs. cost of sales also includes depreciation of manufacturing plant and equipment and facility-related expenses. in addition, we record shipping, warranty, and the majority of our obligation for solar module collection and recycling costs within cost of sales.
as further described in note 24 "segment and geographical information," to our consolidated financial statements for the year ended december 31, 2014 included within this annual report on form 10-k, at the time when all revenue recognition criteria are met, we include the sale of our solar modules manufactured by our components business and used by our systems business within net sales of our components business. therefore, the related cost of sales is also included within our components business at that time.
systems business within our systems business, project-related costs include standard epc costs (consisting primarily of bos costs for inverters, electrical and mounting hardware, project management and engineering costs, and engineering and construction labor costs), site specific costs, and development costs (including transmission upgrade costs, interconnection fees, and permitting costs).

our cost of sales increased by $118.5 million, or 5%, and increased by 1.7 percentage points as a percentage of net sales when comparing 2014 with 2013. the increase in cost of sales was driven by a $194.8 million increase in our systems segment cost of sales primarily for bos components and other construction and development costs related to the number of projects and the timing of when all revenue recognition criteria were met along with a mix of higher cost projects. these increases were partially offset by a $76.3 million reduction in cost of sales in our components segment primarily due to the following:
•continued manufacturing cost reductions of $164.9 million and
•lower inventory write-off and asset impairment charges of $16.8 million; partially offset by
•higher costs of $67.9 million associated with increased solar modules sales volumes and
•the downward change in estimate of $43.3 million on our future recycling costs recorded during 2013.
57
our costs of sales decreased by $69.6 million, or 3%, and declined 0.8 percentage points as a percentage of net sales when comparing 2013 with 2012. the decrease in cost of sales was primarily due to a $44.8 million reduction in cost of sales in our components segment and can largely be attributed to the following 2012 expenses that substantially did not occur in 2013:
•   decreased expenses of $39.5 million associated with the voluntary remediation efforts for our 2008-2009 manufacturing excursion;
•   accelerated depreciation expense of $24.8 million for certain manufacturing equipment that was replaced as part of our planned equipment upgrade programs;
•   lower expenses of $27.5 million associated with inventory write-downs to lower of cost or market and other adjustments primarily as a result of favorable fluctuations in inventory market pricing;
•   reduced expenses of $15.8 million related to our voluntary remediation efforts for workmanship issues affecting a limited number of solar modules manufactured between october 2008 and june 2009.
in addition, in 2013, the adjustment to lower our module and collection and recycling liability was $17.9 million higher than the prior year resulting in a reduction to cost of sales. these decreases in our cost of sales were partially offset by a $45.6 million increase associated with growth in the volume of solar modules sold, net of cost reductions in our manufacturing process and module efficiency improvements. also, our cost of sales was unfavorably impacted by lower utilization of our manufacturing capacity due to the temporary idling of production lines in perrysburg, ohio and kulim, malaysia causing a $23.6 million increase in cost of sales. additionally, cost of sales decreased by $24.8 million in our systems segment primarily for bos components and other construction costs related to the relative number and size of various utility-scale solar power systems under construction and the progress on such construction between the periods as well as the timing of when all revenue recognition criteria were met.
gross profit gross profit is affected by numerous factors, including our module and system average selling prices, our manufacturing costs, bos costs, project development costs, the effective utilization of our production capacity and facilities, and foreign exchange rates. gross profit is also affected by the mix of net sales generated by our components and systems businesses. gross profit for our systems business excludes the sales and cost of sales for solar modules used in our systems projects which we include in the gross profit of our components business. as we move to a higher mix of third-party epc only contracts, the gross profit on those contracts could be lower than gross profit on our self developed contracts.

gross profit as a percentage of net sales decreased by 1.7 percentage points during 2014 compared with 2013 primarily due to a mix of lower gross profit projects sold and under construction in 2014 and an adjustment for lower estimated recycling costs recorded in 2013. these decreases in gross profit were partially offset by favorable changes in estimated costs on systems projects accounted for under the percentage-of-completion method, a lower volume of third-party module net sales, which generally have margins less than systems business projects, and higher capacity utilization of our manufacturing facilities.
gross profit as a percentage of net sales increased by 0.8 percentage points during 2013 compared with 2012 primarily due to the following: (i) a 1.2 percentage point increase related to lower expense associated with voluntary remediation efforts for our 2008-2009 manufacturing excursion; (ii) a 0.6 percentage point increase related to lower module collection and recycling liability; (iii) a 0.7 percentage point increase due to lower accelerated depreciation expense for certain manufacturing equipment that have been replaced as part of our planned upgrade programs; (iv) a 0.8 percentage point increase related to lower inventory write-down expense ; and (v) a 0.5 percentage point increase due to lower costs associated with voluntary remediation efforts for workmanship issues affecting a limited number of solar modules manufactured between october 2008 and june 2009. these increases were partially offset by a 1.7 percentage point gross profit decrease in systems segment due to the mix of lower gross profit projects under construction between the periods and a 1.3 percentage point decrease due to lower gross profit for modules sold in our components segment primarily due to increased underutilization and lower average selling prices compared to module production costs between periods.

research and development research and development expense consists primarily of salaries and personnel-related costs, the cost of products, materials, and outside services used in our process and product research and development activities for both the components and systems businesses, and depreciation and amortization expense associated with research and development specific facilities and intangible assets. we acquire equipment for general use in our process and product development and record the depreciation of this equipment as research and development expense. currently, the substantial majority of our research and development expenses are attributable to our components segment. we maintain a number of programs and activities to improve our technology and processes in order to enhance the performance and reduce the costs of our solar modules and pv solar power systems using our modules.
the following table shows research and development expense for the years ended december 31, 2014, 2013, and 2012:

the overall increase in our research and development expense during 2014 compared with 2013 primarily resulted from additional costs related to the development of our next-generation cdte solar modules, our joint collaboration agreement with ge to further advance our cdte solar technology, and higher employee compensation costs. during 2014, we continued the development of our solar modules with increased efficiencies at converting sunlight into electricity and increased the average conversion efficiency of our solar modules from 13.2% in 2013 to 14.0% in 2014.
the overall increase in our research and development expense during 2013 compared with 2012 primarily resulted from costs related to the improvement of our current generation modules, integration of our module and bos technology into our pv power plants, and the development of our next generation cdte and crystalline silicon solar cells. the increase in research and development expense of $1.8 million year over year was primarily related to our acquisition of cdte pv intellectual property assets and solar manufacturing processes from ge and an acquisition of crystalline silicon technology from tetrasun. in connection with the ge acquisition, we entered into a joint collaboration agreement with ge to collaborate on future technology development to further advance cdte solar technology. research and development expense increased $5.8 million as a result of tetrasun acquisition primarily due to incremental increases in labor, facility, and depreciation expenses as well as additional costs related to testing of the tetrasun cell manufacturing technology and the development of crystalline silicon solar cells. these increases were partially offset by a $3.2 million decrease in personnel-related expenses resulting from lower employee compensation. during 2013, we continued the development of our solar modules with increased efficiencies at converting sunlight into electricity and increased the average conversion efficiency of our solar modules from 12.6% in 2012 to 13.2% in 2013.
selling, general and administrative selling, general and administrative expense consists primarily of salaries and other personnel-related costs, professional fees, insurance costs, travel expenses, and other business development and selling expenses. our components and systems businesses each has certain of its own dedicated administrative key functions, such as accounting, legal, finance, project finance, human resources, procurement, and marketing. costs for these functions are recorded and included within selling, general and administrative costs of the respective segment. our corporate key functions consist primarily of company-wide corporate tax, corporate treasury, corporate accounting/finance, corporate legal, investor relations, corporate communications,government relations, and executive management functions. these corporate functions and the assets supporting such functions benefit both the components and systems segments. we allocate corporate costs to the components and systems segments as part of selling, general and administrative costs, based upon the estimated benefits provided to each segment from these corporate functions. we determine the estimated benefits provided to each segment for these corporate costs based upon a combination of the estimated time spent by corporate employees supporting each segment and the average relative selling, general and administrative costs incurred by each segment before such corporate allocations.

our selling, general and administrative expenses decreased by $16.4 million, or 6%, and were 7.5% and 8.2% as a percentage of net sales, when comparing 2014 with 2013, respectively. the most significant items affecting our selling, general and administrative costs during 2014 and 2013 are as follows:
•   lower depreciation and amortization expense of $14.4 million primarily due to accelerated deprecation for certain leasehold improvements and the sale of our mesa facility in 2013;
•   lower employee compensation and benefits expense of $5.4 million primarily as a result of lower incentive and share-based compensation; partially offset by
•   higher business development expense of $4.0 million driven by our continued expansion into certain strategically targeted sustainable markets.
our selling, general and administrative expenses decreased by $10.7 million, or 4%, and were 8.2% and 8.3% as a percentage of net sales, when comparing 2013 with 2012, respectively. the most significant items affecting our selling, general and administrative costs during 2013 and 2012 are as follows:
•   a $15.9 million reduction in expense related to the 2008-2009 manufacturing excursion, which was recorded in 2012;
•   lower infrastructure expenses of $7.1 million primarily due to an early exit from certain administrative office leases in 2012 and a reduction in telecommunication spending; and
•   decreased depreciation and amortization expense of $6.4 million mainly due to the acceleration of expense for certain leasehold improvements in 2012 and lower depreciation expense related to our mesa facility; partially offset by
•   increased project, business development, legal, and professional services fees of $14.5 million largely due to additional business development activity and the continued expansion of our systems business into sustainable markets and
•   higher salary and benefit expenses of $5.6 million in connection with an increase in share-based compensation of $26.1 million, partially offset by a decrease in salaries of $20.5 million due to headcount reductions and lower incentive compensation. share based compensation expense increased primarily as a result of the impact of a change in our estimated forfeiture rate for share-based compensation awards in 2012, partially offset by a change in 2013. our 2012 restructuring activities resulted in an increase in actual forfeitures and thus lower share based compensation expense compared with historical experience prior to such restructuring activities.
production start-up production start-up expense consists primarily of salaries and personnel-related costs and the cost of operating a production line before it has been qualified for full production, including the cost of raw materials for solar modules run through the production line during the qualification phase. it also includes all expenses related to the selection of a new site, the related legal and regulatory costs, and the costs to maintain our plant replication program, to the extent we cannot capitalize these expenditures. in general, we expect production start-up expense per production line to be higher when we build an entirely new manufacturing facility compared with the addition of new production lines at an existing manufacturing facility, primarily due to the additional infrastructure investment required when building an entirely new facility. production start-up expense is attributable to our components segment.

during 2014, 2013, and 2012 we incurred $5.1 million, $2.8 million, and $7.8 million, respectively, of production start-up expenses. in 2014, expenses primarily related to the start-up of our tetrasun operations. expenses for 2013 and 2012 are primarily for global manufacturing personnel dedicated plant expansion, new equipment installation, equipment upgrades, and process improvements for both new and existing plants.
restructuring and asset impairments restructuring and asset impairment expense includes those expenses incurred related to material restructuring initiatives and include severance and employee termination costs that are directly related to our restructuring initiatives, costs associated with contract terminations, and other restructuring related costs. these restructuring initiatives are intended to align the organization with current business conditions (including expected sustainable market opportunities) and to reduce costs.

components segment loss before income taxes and equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates decreased by $115.3 million during 2014 compared with 2013 primarily as a result of lower restructuring and asset impairment charges related to the sale of our facility in mesa, arizona and a decrease in selling, general and administrative expense mainly driven by less depreciation and amortization expense for certain leasehold improvements and our mesa facility. these reductions were partially offset by an adjustment for lower estimated recycling costs recorded during 2013.
62
systems segment income before income taxes and equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates decreased by $61.7 million during 2014 compared with 2013 due to a mix of lower gross profit projects sold and under construction in 2014 and higher selling, general and administrative expense attributable to increased headcount and higher development and consulting expenses from expanding into new markets. these items were partially offset by favorable changes in estimated costs on systems projects accounted for under the percentage-of-completion method.
components segment loss before income taxes and equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates decreased by $465.4 million, during 2013 compared with 2012 primarily due to higher net sales related to an increase in the volume of modules sold and lower restructuring expenses partially offset by higher asset impairment expenses. in addition, our components segment cost of sales decreased 4% during 2013 compared with 2012, primarily due to (i) a decrease in module collection and recycling liability; (ii) a decrease in costs associated with voluntary remediation efforts for our 2008-2009 manufacturing excursion; (iii) lower accelerated depreciation expense for certain manufacturing equipment that was replaced as part of our planned equipment upgrade programs; (iv) lower inventory write-down expense primarily as a result of favorable fluctuations in inventory market pricing; and (v) a decrease in costs associated with voluntary remediation efforts for workmanship issues affecting a limited number of solar modules manufactured between october 2008 and june 2009. these decreases were partially offset by higher cost of sales associated with growth in the volume of solar modules sold and underutilization charges.
systems segment loss before income taxes and equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates decreased $47.2 million during 2013 compared with 2012 primarily due to the difference in project gross profit mix for which revenue was recognized during 2013 compared with 2012.
income tax expense income taxes are imposed on our taxable income by taxing authorities in the various jurisdictions in which we operate, principally the united states, germany, and malaysia. the statutory federal corporate income tax rate in the united states is 35.0%, while the tax rates in germany and malaysia are approximately 30.2% and 25.0%, respectively. in malaysia, we have been granted a long-term tax holiday, scheduled to expire in 2027, pursuant to which substantially all of our income earned in malaysia is exempt from income tax.

income tax expense increased by $4.9 million during 2014 compared with 2013. the increase in income tax expense was primarily attributable to an increase in pretax book income earned in higher tax jurisdictions in 2014, partially offset by a discrete tax benefit of $26.2 million due to the expiration of the statute of limitations for various uncertain tax positions. see note 20 "income taxes," to our consolidated financial statements for the year ended december 31, 2014 included in this annual report on form 10-k for additional information.
income tax expense decreased by $31.4 million during 2013 compared with 2012, primarily due to a reduction in valuation allowance recorded year over year, offset by an increase in pre-tax book income. see note 20 "income taxes," to our consolidated financial statements for the year ended december 31, 2014 included in this annual report on form 10-k for additional information.
equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates, net of tax equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates, net of tax represents our proportionate share of the earnings and losses of unconsolidated affiliates with whom we have made equity method investments.

losses from unconsolidated affiliates increased during 2014 compared to 2013 primarily due to the impairment of certain of our equity method investments. additionally, during the period, we increased strategic investments in certain third-parties to develop, construct, or operate solar power projects, and a small portion of the increase in 2014 related to our corresponding share of these entities' operating losses. these types of ventures are core to our business and long-term strategy related to providing solar solutions using our modules to sustainable geographic markets. losses from unconsolidated affiliates in 2013 were consistent with 2012.
liquidity and capital resources as of december 31, 2014, we believe that our cash, cash equivalents, marketable securities, cash flows from operating activities including the contracted portion of our advanced-stage project pipeline, availability under our revolving credit facility considering minimum liquidity covenant requirements, and access to the capital markets will be sufficient to meet our working capital and capital expenditure needs for at least the next 12 months. we intend to continue to carefully manage credit and market risk.
cash generated from operations, including the contracted portion of our advanced-stage project pipeline, is our primary source of operating liquidity, and we believe that internally generated cash flows combined with our existing cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities, and availability under our revolving credit facility considering minimum liquidity covenant requirements, are sufficient to support day-to-day business operations. we monitor our working capital to ensure we have adequate liquidity, both domestically and internationally.
in june 2013, we sold 9.7 million shares of common stock for proceeds of $428.2 million, net of issuance costs. in july 2013, we entered into an amendment to our revolving credit facility, which extended $450.0 million in availability through july 2018. additionally, we have an active shelf registration statement filed with the sec for issuance of debt or equity securities if needed.
we intend to maintain appropriate debt levels based upon cash flow expectations, the overall cost of capital and expected cash requirements for operations, capital expenditures, and discretionary strategic spending. in the future, we may also engage in one or more debt or equity financings, potentially including project specific non-recourse debt financings. we believe that when necessary, we will have adequate access to the capital markets, although our ability to raise capital on terms commercially acceptable to us could be constrained if there is insufficient lender or investor interest due to industry-wide or company-specific concerns. such financings could result in increased debt service expenses or dilution to our existing stockholders.
as of december 31, 2014, we had $2.0 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities compared with $1.8 billion as of december 31, 2013. cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities as of december 31, 2014 increased primarily as the result of cash generated from operating activities, partially offset by the repayment of long-term debt and project acquisitions. as of december 31, 2014 and 2013, $1.4 billion and $1.2 billion, respectively, of our cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities were held by foreign subsidiaries and are generally based in u.s. dollar and euro denominated holdings. we utilize a variety of tax planning and financing strategies in an effort to ensure that our worldwide cash is available in the locations in which it is needed.
our expanding systems business requires liquidity and is expected to continue to have significant liquidity requirements in the future. the net amount of our project assets, deferred project costs, billings in excess of costs and estimated earnings, and payments and billings for deferred project costs, which approximates our net capital investment in the development and construction of pv solar power systems as of december 31, 2014 was $583.8 million. solar power project development and construction cycles, which span the time between the identification of a site location to the commercial operation of a pv solar power system, vary substantially and can take many years to mature. as a result of these long project cycles, we may need to make significant up-front investments of resources in advance of the receipt of any cash from the sale of such pv solar power systems. these amounts include payment of interconnection and other deposits (some of which are non-refundable), posting of letters of credit, and incurring engineering, permitting, legal, and other expenses. additionally, we may choose to use, and from time to time have used, our working capital, the availability under our revolving credit facility, or enter into non-recourse or limited recourse project financing to finance the construction of our systems projects, if such projects cannot be sold before construction begins. depending upon the size and number of projects that we are developing and self-financing the construction of, the systems business has and is
64
expected in the future to require significant liquidity. for example, we may have to substantially complete the construction of a systems project before such project is sold. delays in construction progress or in completing the sale of our systems projects which we are self-financing may also impact our liquidity. we have historically financed these up-front investments for project development and when necessary, construction, primarily using working capital.
we are partnering with local developers on project development in new markets around the world where we may take an equity stake in a project for a number of years. we are also self-developing projects in such markets where we may hold all or a significant portion of the equity in the projects for several years. given the duration of these investments and the currency risk relative to the u.s. dollar in some of these new markets, we are exploring local financing alternatives. should these financing alternatives be unavailable or too cost prohibitive, our liquidity and exposure to significant currency risk could be adversely impacted.
additionally, our evolving flexible business model allows us to retain ownership of certain of our systems projects for a period of time after they become operational up to the useful life of the pv solar power system if we determine it would be of economic and strategic benefit to do so. if, for example, we cannot sell a systems project at economics that are attractive to us or potential customers are unwilling to assume the risks and rewards typical of pv solar power system ownership, we may instead elect to own and operate such systems project, generally until such time that we can sell a project on economically attractive terms. as with traditional electricity generating assets, the selling price of a solar power plant could be higher post-completion to reflect the elimination of construction and performance risk and other uncertainties. the decision to own and operate a pv solar power system impacts liquidity depending upon the size and cost of the project. we may elect to enter into temporary or long-term non-recourse project financing to reduce the impact on our liquidity and working capital. we are considering entering into yieldco or similar arrangements with respect to ownership interests in certain of our projects, which could cause the economics of such arrangements to be recognized over the project's life, such as the potential joint venture yieldco transaction described under "management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations - certain trends and uncertainties - yieldco." we define yieldco as an entity that owns cash-generating infrastructure assets including solar power plants and, similar to reits or mlps, spins out ownership to the public markets.
the following considerations have impacted or are expected to impact our liquidity in 2015 and beyond:
•   the amount of accounts receivable, unbilled and retainage as of december 31, 2014 was $77.0 million. included in accounts receivable, unbilled and retainage as of december 31, 2014 was $41.9 million of accounts receivable, unbilled. accounts receivable, unbilled represents revenue that has been recognized in advance of billing the customer under the terms of the underlying construction contracts. such construction costs have been funded with working capital and the unbilled amounts are expected to be billed and collected from customers during the next twelve months. once we meet the billing criteria under a construction contract, we bill our customers accordingly and reclassify the accounts receivable, unbilled and retainage to accounts receivable trade, net. included in accounts receivable, unbilled and retainage as of december 31, 2014, was $35.1 million of current accounts receivable, retainage. accounts receivable, retainage represents the portion of a systems project contract price earned by us for work performed, but held for payment by our customer as a form of security until we reach certain construction milestones. such retainage amounts relate to construction costs incurred and construction work already performed.
•   the amount of finished goods inventory ("solar module inventory") and bos parts as of december 31, 2014 was $567.5 million. as we continue with the construction of our advanced-stage project pipeline, we must produce solar modules and procure bos parts in the required volumes to support our planned construction schedules. as part of the normal construction cycle, we typically must manufacture modules or acquire the necessary bos parts for construction activities in advance of receiving payment for such materials. once solar modules and bos parts are installed in a project, such installed amounts are classified as either project assets, deferred project costs, or cost of sales depending upon whether the project is subject to a definitive sales contract and whether all revenue recognition criteria have been met. accordingly, as of any balance sheet date, our solar module inventory represents solar modules that will be installed in our advanced-stage project pipeline or that we expect to sell to third parties.
•   there may be a delay in when our solar module inventory and bos parts can be converted into cash compared to a typical third-party module sale. such timing differences temporarily reduce our liquidity to the extent that we have already paid for our bos parts or the underlying costs to produce our solar module inventory. as previously announced, we have adjusted, and will in the future adjust, as necessary, our manufacturing capacity and planned solar module production levels, to match expected market demand. any decrease in planned production reduces our risk and the impact on liquidity of having excess solar module inventories that we must sell to third parties while responding to market pricing uncertainties for solar modules. our solar module inventory as of december 31, 2014 is expected to primarily support our systems business, including our advanced-stage project pipeline, with the remaining amounts being used to support expected near
65
term demand for third-party module sales. as of december 31, 2014, approximately $191 million or 43% of our solar module inventory was either on-site or in-transit to our systems projects. all bos parts are for our systems business projects.
•   we expect to commit working capital during 2015 and beyond to acquire solar power projects in various stages of development including advanced-stage projects with ppas and continue developing those projects as necessary. depending upon the size and stage of development, costs to acquire such solar power projects could be significant. when evaluating project acquisition opportunities, we consider both the strategic and financial benefits of any such acquisitions.
•   joint ventures or other business arrangements with strategic partners are a key part of our strategy. we have begun initiatives in several markets to expedite our penetration of those markets and establish relationships with potential strategic partners, customers, and policymakers. many of these business arrangements are expected to involve a significant cash investment or other allocation of working capital that could reduce our liquidity or require us to pursue additional sources of financing, assuming such sources are available to us. additionally, we have elected and may in the future elect or be required to temporarily retain a minority or non-controlling ownership interest in the underlying systems projects we develop, supply modules to, or construct. any such retained ownership interest is expected to impact our liquidity to the extent we do not obtain new sources of capital to fund such investments.
•   during 2015, we expect to spend between $225 million to $275 million for capital expenditures, including expenditures for upgrades to existing machinery and equipment, which we believe will increase our solar module efficiencies. a majority of our capital expenditures for 2015 are expected to be in foreign currencies and are therefore subject to fluctuations in currency exchange rates.
•   under sales agreements for certain of our solar power projects, we may be required to repurchase such projects if certain events occur, such as not achieving commercial operation of the project within a certain time frame. although we consider the possibility that we would be required to repurchase any of our solar power projects to be remote, our current working capital and other available sources of liquidity may not be sufficient to make any required repurchase. if we are required to repurchase a solar power project, we would have the ability to market and sell such project at then current market pricing, which could be at a lower than expected price to the extent the event requiring a repurchase impacts the project's marketability. our liquidity may also be impacted as the time between the repurchase of a project and the potential sale of such repurchased project could take several months.
the unprecedented disruption in the credit markets that began in 2008 had a significant adverse impact on a number of financial institutions. global sovereign debt problems and its impact on the balance sheets and lending practices of global banks in particular could negatively impact our access to, and cost of, capital, and therefore could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and competitive position. it could also similarly affect our customers and therefore limit the demand for our systems projects or solar modules. as of december 31, 2014, our liquidity and marketable securities and restricted investments have not been materially adversely impacted by the current credit environment, and we believe that they will not be materially adversely impacted in the near future. we will continue to closely monitor our liquidity and the credit markets. however, we cannot predict with any certainty the impact to us of any further disruption in the current credit environment.

operating activities cash provided by operating activities was $681.0 million during 2014, $856.1 million during 2013, and $762.2 million during 2012. the decrease in operating cash flows during 2014 was primarily due to lower cash received from customers in 2014, as compared to 2013. in addition, during 2014 our operating cash flows were unfavorably impacted by higher income taxes paid of $17.0 million, compared to income taxes refunds, net of taxes paid of $1.6 million in 2013 and $21.5 million in 2012. the excess tax benefit related to share based compensation arrangements was $31.2 million for 2014, as compared to $35.1 million for 2013 and $27.4 million for 2012. the remaining decrease in cash provided by operating activities was the result of net differences in interest received, interest paid, and other operating activities in 2014 compared to 2013 and 2012. changes in net assets and liabilities decreased our cash flow from operations by $9.2 million in 2014 versus an increase to our cash flow from operations of $186.5 million in 2013. the decrease in net assets and liabilities during 2014 of $195.7 million primarily resulted from the following:
(i)   our accounts receivable trade, unbilled and retainage, exclusive of the change in allowance for doubtful accounts and net of effects from business combinations, decreased $453.8 million during 2014 and $565.0 million during 2013. fluctuations in our accounts receivable are primarily due to the number and size of utility-scale projects under construction, timing of billings and collections as well as timing of revenue recognition. we bill our customers once the billing criteria under a construction contract are met, generally around completion of certain project construction milestones. decreases in our accounts receivable were driven primarily by cash collections on various large projects as well as cash collections related to module-only sales to third-party customers.
(ii)   our project assets and deferred project costs, net of effects from business combinations, decreased our cash flow from operations by $141.9 million during 2014 as compared to a $316.0 million increase during 2013. the development and construction of solar power plants require long periods of time and substantial initial investments, including costs associated with transmission deposits, land acquisition, permitting, legal and other costs and the actual costs of constructing a project. the decrease in our project assets and deferred project costs during 2014 was driven by a decrease in project assets primarily from our solargen 2, macho springs and maryland projects, partially offset by increases in project assets from the continued development and construction of our moapa, lost hills, barilla, luz del norte and stateline projects. additionally, deferred project costs decreased primarily due to the sale of our campo verde project and the revenue recognition from our desert sunlight project.
(iii)   our accrued expenses and other liabilities, excluding the effects of business combinations, decreased $452.4 million during 2014 and $138.9 million during 2013 as compared to a $506.3 million increase in 2012. accrued expenses and other liabilities include billings in excess of costs and estimated earnings, which represents billings made or payments received in excess of revenue recognized on contracts accounted for under the percentage-of-completion method. typically, billings are made on the completion of certain milestones as provided for in the sales arrangement, and the timing of revenue recognition may be different from when we can bill the customer. accrued expenses and other liabilities also includes payments and billings for deferred project costs, which represents customer payments received or customer billings made under the terms of solar power project related sales arrangements for which all revenue recognition criteria for real estate transactions have not yet been met. the decrease in our accrued expenses and other liabilities during 2014 as compared to 2013 was primarily attributed to attaining revenue recognition under the full accrual method associated with our campo verde project, the sale of 51% of our solar gen 2 project and revenue recognition of our desert sunlight project, partially offset by billings for our silver state south project in excess of revenue recognized.
investing activities cash used in investing activities was $511.9 million during 2014, compared with $537.1 million during 2013 and $383.7 million during 2012. cash used in investing activities during 2014 included capital expenditures of $257.5 million, compared to $282.6 million and $379.2 million in 2013 and 2012, respectively. the decrease can generally be attributed to increased focus on capital spending management and the impact of timing differences associated with cash payments for property, plant and equipment. cash proceeds from the sale of property, plant, and equipment were $1.5 million during 2014, $116.4 million during 2013, primarily as a result of the mesa sales agreement, and $5.1 million during 2012. during 2014 we provided net additional funding to affiliates of $23.2 million. during 2014 and 2013, we increased our net investments in marketable securities by $77.5 million and $341.0 million, respectively, compared to a decrease of our net investments totaling $79.5 million during 2012. we had an outflow for restricted cash of $124.1 million during 2014 compared to inflows of $5.2 million and $16.2 million in 2013 and 2012, respectively. during 2014, 2013 and 2012, we made cash investments in unconsolidated entities of $25.0 million, $17.9 million, and $5.0 million, respectively. acquisitions, net of cash acquired, resulted in payments of $4.3 million in 2014, compared to $30.7 million in 2013 and $2.4 million in 2012. payment for acquisitions in 2014 related primarily to our acquisition of skytron, a european-based o&m company. payments for acquisitions in 2013 related primarily to acquisitions of solar chile s.a., a chilean-based
67
solar project development company, and tetrasun, inc., a development stage company with high efficiency crystalline silicon technology. during 2012, we made a second payment of $2.4 million under the terms of the acquisition agreement related to our acquisition of ray tracker, inc. ("ray tracker"), a tracking technology and pv bos company we acquired in 2011 in an all-cash transaction.
financing activities cash provided by financing activities was $7.4 million during 2014 and $101.2 million during 2013, and cash used in financing activities was $89.1 million during 2012. cash provided by financing activities during 2014 resulted primarily from proceeds of $65.6 million from borrowings under long-term debt and excess tax benefit from share-based compensation arrangements of $31.2 million, partially offset by the repayment of long-term debt of $60.1 million and contingent consideration and other financing activities payments of $29.3 million.
cash provided by financing activities during 2013 resulted primarily from the net cash proceeds from our june 2013 equity offering of $428.2 million, and excess tax benefit from share-based compensation arrangements of $35.1 million, partially offset by repayment of long-term debt and economic development funding of $73.3 million and net repayment of borrowings under our revolving credit facility of $270.0 million.
cash used in financing activities during 2012 resulted primarily from the repayment of long-term debt, which included our german facility agreement, for a total of $178.8 million and the repayment of economic development funding of $6.8 million, partially offset by net proceeds from our revolving credit facility of $70.0 million and excess tax benefits from share-based compensation arrangements of $27.4 million.
contractual obligations the following table presents our contractual obligations as of december 31, 2014 (in thousands), which consists of legal commitments requiring us to make fixed or determinable cash payments. we purchase raw materials for inventory or balance of systems parts, services, and manufacturing equipment from a variety of vendors. we also enter into contracts for the construction of solar power projects. during the normal course of business, in order to manage manufacturing and construction lead times and help assure adequate supply, we enter into agreements with suppliers that either allow us to procure goods and services when we choose or that establish purchase requirements each year or over the term of the agreement.

revolving credit facility our credit agreement with several financial institutions as lenders, jp morgan securities llc and bank of america securities llc as joint-lead arrangers and bookrunners and jp morgan chase bank, n.a. as administrative agent ("revolving credit facility") provides us with a senior secured credit facility with an aggregate available amount of $600.0 million, with the right to request an increase up to $750.0 million, subject to certain conditions. borrowings under the revolving credit facility bear interest at (i) libor (adjusted for eurocurrency reserve requirements) plus a margin of 2.25% or (ii) a base rate as defined in the credit agreement plus a margin of 1.25%, depending on the type of borrowing requested by us. these margins are subject to adjustments depending on our consolidated leverage ratio. as of december 31, 2014 and 2013, we had no borrowings under our revolving credit facility, respectively. we had $202.5 million and $158.6 million of letters of credit using availability under our revolving credit facility, leaving $397.5 million and $441.4 million of availability at december 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. we believe that when necessary, we will have adequate access to capital markets, but there may be circumstances in the future related to macroeconomic conditions or factors specific to us that could limit, or increase the cost of, capital from such markets.
69
in addition to paying interest on outstanding principal under the revolving credit facility, we are required to pay a commitment fee, currently at the rate of 0.375% per annum, based on the average daily unused commitments under the facility. the commitment fee may also be adjusted due to changes in our consolidated leverage ratio. we also pay a letter of credit fee equal to the applicable margin for eurocurrency revolving loans on the face amount of each letter of credit and a fronting fee of 0.125%.
on july 15, 2013, we entered into the fourth amendment to the amended and restated revolving credit facility (the "amendment"). the amendment provided for, among other things, the division of the revolving credit facility into tranche a commitments in an aggregate amount equal to $450.0 million and tranche b commitments in an aggregate amount equal to $150.0 million and the extension of the maturity date of the tranche a loans until july 15, 2018. the maturity date of the tranche b loans and commitment is october 15, 2015 and is unchanged. the amendment also contained certain covenant changes.
in connection with the amendment, we entered into an amended and restated guarantee and collateral agreement. loans and letters of credit issued under the revolving credit facility are jointly and severally, unconditionally and irrevocably guaranteed by first solar inc., first solar electric, llc, first solar electric (california), inc. and first solar development, llc and are secured by security interests in substantially all of the grantors' tangible and intangible assets other than certain excluded assets.
the revolving credit facility contains financial covenants including: a leverage ratio covenant, a minimum ebitda covenant, and a minimum liquidity covenant. we are also subject to customary non-financial covenants. we were in compliance with these covenants as of december 31, 2014, and expect to remain in compliance with these covenants for at least the next twelve months.
see note 15 "debt," to our consolidated financial statements for the year ended december 31, 2014 included in this annual report on form 10-k for further information about our long-term debt facilities.
off-balance sheet arrangements we have no off-balance sheet debt or similar obligations, other than financial assurance instruments and operating leases, that are not classified as debt. we do not guarantee any third-party debt. see note 15 "commitments and contingencies," to our consolidated financial statements for the year ended december 31, 2014 included in this annual report on form 10-k for further information about our financial assurance instruments.
recent accounting pronouncements see note 3 "recent accounting pronouncements," to our consolidated financial statements for the year ended december 31, 2014 included in this annual report on form 10-k for a summary of recent accounting pronouncements.
critical accounting estimates in preparing our financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states ("gaap"), we make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the amounts of reported assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses, as well as the disclosure of contingent liabilities in our financial statements and the related notes thereto. some of our accounting policies require the application of significant judgment by management in the selection of the appropriate assumptions for making these estimates. by their nature, these judgments are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty. we base our judgments and estimates on our historical experience, our forecasts, and other available information, as appropriate. our significant accounting policies are described in note 2 "summary of significant accounting policies," to our consolidated financial statements for the year ended december 31, 2014 included in this annual report on form 10-k.
our critical accounting estimates, which require the most significant management estimates and judgment in determining amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10-k, are as follows:
revenue recognition - systems business. we recognize revenue for arrangements entered into by our systems business generally using two revenue recognition models, following the guidance in asc 605, accounting for long-term construction contracts or, for arrangements which include land or land rights, asc 360, accounting for sales of real estate.
for systems business sales arrangements that do not include land or land rights and thus are accounted for under asc 605, we use the percentage-of-completion method, as described further below, using actual costs incurred over total estimated costs to develop and construct a project (including module costs) as our standard accounting policy, unless we cannot make reasonably dependable estimates of the costs to complete the contract, in which case we would use the completed contract method.
70
for systems business sales arrangements that are accounted for under asc 360 where we convey control of land or land rights, we record the sale as revenue using one of the following revenue recognition methods, based upon evaluation of the substance and form of the terms and conditions of such real estate sales arrangements:
(i)   we apply the percentage-of-completion method, as further described below, to certain real estate sales arrangements where we convey control of land or land rights, when a sale has been consummated, we have transferred the usual risks and rewards of ownership to the buyer, the initial and continuing investment criteria have been met, we have the ability to estimate our costs and progress toward completion, and all other revenue recognition criteria have been met. the initial and continuing investment requirements, which demonstrate a buyer's commitment to honor their obligations for the sales arrangement, can typically be met through the receipt of cash or an irrevocable letter of credit from a highly creditworthy lending institution. when evaluating whether the usual risks and rewards of ownership have transferred to the buyer, we consider whether we have or may be contingently required to have any prohibited forms of continuing involvement with the project. prohibited forms of continuing involvement in a real estate sales arrangement may include us retaining risks or rewards associated with the project that are not customary with the range of risks or rewards that an engineering, procurement, and construction ("epc") contractor may assume.
(ii)   depending on whether the initial and continuing investment requirements have been met and whether collectability from the buyer is reasonably assured, we may align our revenue recognition and release of project assets or deferred project costs to cost of sales with the receipt of payment from the buyer if the sale has been consummated and we have transferred the usual risks and rewards of ownership to the buyer.
(iii)   we may also record revenue for certain sales arrangements after construction of discrete portions of a project or after the entire project is substantially complete, we have transferred the usual risks and rewards of ownership to the buyer, and we have received substantially all payments due from the buyer or the initial and continuing investment criteria have been met.
for any systems business sales arrangements containing multiple deliverables (including our solar modules) not required to be accounted for under asc 360 (real estate) or asc 605 (long-term construction contracts), we analyze each activity within the sales arrangement to ensure that we adhere to the separation guidelines of asc 605 for multiple-element arrangements. we allocate revenue for any transactions involving multiple elements to each unit of accounting based on its relative selling price and recognize revenue for each unit of accounting when all revenue recognition criteria for a unit of accounting have been met.
revenue recognition - percentage-of-completion. in applying the percentage-of-completion method, we use the actual costs incurred relative to the estimated costs to complete (including module costs) in order to estimate the progress towards completion to determine the amount of revenue and profit to recognize. incurred costs include all installed direct materials, installed solar modules, labor, subcontractor costs, and those indirect costs related to contract performance, such as indirect labor, supplies, and tools. we recognize direct material and solar module costs as incurred costs when the direct materials and solar modules have been installed in the project. when contracts specify that title to direct materials and solar modules transfers to the customer before installation has been performed, we will not recognize revenue or the associated costs until those materials are installed and have met all other revenue recognition requirements. we consider direct materials and solar modules to be installed when they are permanently placed or affixed to the solar power system as required by engineering designs. solar modules manufactured by us that will be used in our solar power systems, which we still hold title to, remain within inventory until such modules are installed in a solar power system.
the percentage-of-completion method of revenue recognition requires us to make estimates of contract revenues and costs to complete our projects. in making such estimates, management judgments are required to evaluate significant assumptions including the cost of materials and labor, expected labor productivity, the impact of potential variances in schedule completion, the amount of net contract revenues, and the impact of any penalties, claims, change orders, or performance incentives.
if estimated total costs on any contract are greater than the contract revenues, we recognize the entire estimated loss in the period the loss becomes known. the cumulative effect of the revisions to estimates related to contract revenues and costs to complete contracts, including penalties, incentive awards, claims, change orders, anticipated losses, and others are recorded in the period in which the revisions to estimates are identified and the loss can be reasonably estimated. the effect of the changes on future periods are recognized as if the revised estimates had been used since revenue was initially recognized under the contract. such revisions could occur in any reporting period and the effects may be material depending on the size of the contracts or the changes in estimates.
71
accrued solar module collection and recycling liability. at the time of sale, we recognize an expense for the estimated cost of our future obligation for collecting and recycling solar modules sold that are covered by our pre-funded collection and recycling program. we estimate the cost of our collection and recycling obligations based on the present value of the expected probability weighted future cost of collecting and recycling the solar modules, which includes estimates for the cost of packaging the solar modules for transport, the cost of freight from the solar module installation sites to a recycling center, the material, labor, capital costs ,and scale of recycling centers, and an estimated third-party profit margin and return on risk for collection and recycling services. we base this estimate on (i) our experience collecting and recycling our solar modules and on our expectations about future developments in recycling technologies and processes, (ii) economic conditions at the time the solar modules will be collected and recycled, and (iii) the expected timing of when our solar modules will be returned for recycling. in the periods between the time of our sales and the settlement of our collection and recycling obligations, we accrete the carrying amount of the associated liability by applying the discount rate used for its initial measurement.
during the year ended december 31, 2014, we did not make any significant changes to our recycling technology roadmap cost estimates or inflation assumptions based on our annual cost study. as part of this study, we obtained a high volume of operational cost data that confirmed our currently estimated future collection and recycling costs remained appropriate. we will continue to evaluate our estimates as technology and cost assumptions change in the future. at december 31, 2014, our estimated liability for collecting and recycling solar modules covered by our collection and recycling program was $246.3 million. a 1% increase in the annualized inflation rate used in our estimated future collection and recycling cost per module would increase our liability by $60.6 million, and a 1% decrease in that inflation rate would decrease our liability by $49.8 million.
product warranties and accrued expense in excess of product warranties. we provide a limited warranty against defects in materials and workmanship under normal use and service conditions for 10 years following delivery to the owners of our solar modules. we also typically warrant to the owners of our solar modules that modules installed in accordance with agreed-upon specifications will produce at least 90% of their labeled power output rating during the first 10 years following their installation and at least 80% of their labeled power output rating during the following 15 years. in resolving claims under both the defects and power output warranties, we have the option of either repairing or replacing the covered solar modules or, under the power output warranty, providing additional solar modules to remedy the power shortfall. we also have the option to make a payment for the then current market price of solar modules to resolve claims. our warranties are automatically transferred from the original purchasers of our solar modules to subsequent purchasers upon resale. in 2013, we announced to our customers the availability of a new linear power output warranty for modules shipping beginning in the second quarter of 2014.
as an alternative to our module power output warranty, we have offered a system level module performance warranty for a limited number of our recent system sales. this system level module performance warranty is designed for utility scale systems and provides 25-year plant-level energy degradation protection. the system level module performance warranty is typically calculated as a percentage of a system's expected energy production, adjusted for certain actual site conditions including weather, with the warranted level of performance declining each year in a linear fashion, but never falling below 80% during the term of the warranty. in resolving claims under the system level module performance warranty to restore the system to warranted performance levels, we first must validate that the root cause is due to module performance. for qualifying claims, we typically have the option to repair or replace modules, provide supplemental modules, or make a cash payment. consistent with our module power output warranty, when we elect to satisfy a valid warranty claim by providing replacement or supplemental modules under the system level module performance warranty, we do not have any obligation to pay for the labor to remove or install modules.
in addition to our solar module warranty described above, for solar power plants built by our systems business, we typically provide a limited warranty on the balance of the system against defects in engineering design, installation, and workmanship for a period of one to two years following the substantial completion of a phase or the entire solar power plant. in resolving claims under the engineering design, installation, and workmanship warranties, we have the option of remedying the defect through repair or replacement.
when we recognize revenue for module or systems project sales, we accrue a liability for the estimated future costs of meeting our limited warranty obligations. we make and revise these estimates based primarily on the number of our solar modules under warranty installed at customer locations, our historical experience with warranty claims, our monitoring of field installation sites, our internal testing of and the expected future performance of our solar modules and bos components, and our estimated per-module replacement cost. such estimates have changed, and may in the future change, based primarily upon historical experience including additional information received from the evaluation of warranty claims and the complete processing of such claims.
72
we also make an estimate for the costs of any voluntary remediation programs including our 2008-2009 manufacturing excursion. our estimate for remediation costs for our 2008-2009 manufacturing excursion is based on evaluation and consideration of currently available information including the estimated number of affected modules in the field, historical experience related to our remediation efforts, customer-provided data related to potentially affected systems, the estimated costs of performing any remediation services, and the post-sale expenses covered under our remediation program. from time to time we have taken remediation actions in respect of affected modules beyond our limited warranty, and we may elect to do so in the future. in such cases, we would incur additional expenses that are beyond our limited warranty. if we commit to any such remediation actions beyond our limited warranty, developing our estimates for such remediation actions may require significant management judgment.
at december 31, 2014, our accrued liabilities for product warranties and accrued expense in excess of product warranties were $223.1 million and $30.9 million, respectively. we have historically estimated our product warranty liability for power output and defects in materials and workmanship under normal use and service conditions to have an estimated warranty return rate of approximately 3% of modules covered under warranty. a 1% change in the estimated warranty return rate would change our estimated product warranty liability by approximately $60 million.
accounting for income taxes. we are subject to the income tax laws of the united states, and its states and municipalities and those of the foreign jurisdictions in which we have significant business operations. these tax laws are complex and subject to different interpretations by the taxpayer and the relevant governmental taxing authorities. we must make judgments and interpretations about the application of these inherently complex tax laws when determining our provision for income taxes and must also make estimates about when in the future certain items affect taxable income in the various tax jurisdictions. disputes over interpretations of the tax laws may be settled with the taxing authority upon examination or audit. we regularly assess the likelihood of assessments in each of the taxing jurisdictions resulting from current and subsequent years' examinations, and we record tax liabilities as appropriate.
we establish liabilities for potential additional taxes that may arise out of tax audits. once established, we adjust the liabilities when additional information becomes available or when an event occurs requiring an adjustment. significant judgment is required in making these estimates and the actual cost of a legal claim, tax assessment, regulatory fine, or penalty may ultimately be materially different from our recorded liabilities, if any.
in preparing our consolidated financial statements, we calculate our income tax expense based on our interpretation of the tax laws in the various jurisdictions where we conduct business. this requires us to estimate our current tax obligations and the realizability of uncertain tax positions and to assess temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax basis of assets and liabilities. these temporary differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities, the net current amount of which we show as a component of current assets or current liabilities and the net noncurrent amount of which we show as other assets or other liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets.
we must also assess the likelihood that each of our deferred tax assets will be realized. to the extent we believe that realization of any of our deferred tax assets is not more likely than not, we establish a valuation allowance. when we establish a valuation allowance or increase this allowance in a reporting period, we generally record a corresponding tax expense in our consolidated statement of operations. conversely, to the extent circumstances indicate that a valuation allowance is no longer necessary, that portion of the valuation allowance is reversed, which generally reduces our overall income tax expense.
we also consider the earnings of our foreign subsidiaries and determine whether such amounts are indefinitely reinvested outside the united states. we have concluded that, except for the earnings of our canadian subsidiary and with respect to previously taxed income, all such accumulated earnings are currently indefinitely reinvested. accordingly, no additional taxes have been accrued that might be incurred if such amounts were repatriated to the united states. if our intention to indefinitely reinvest the earnings of our foreign subsidiaries changes, additional taxes may be required to be accrued. see note 20 "income taxes," to our consolidated financial statements for the year ended december 31, 2014 included in this annual report on form 10-k for additional information.
we continually explore initiatives to better align our tax and legal entity structure with the footprint of our non-u.s. operations and recognize the tax impact of these initiatives, including changes in the assessment of uncertain tax positions, indefinite reinvestment exception assertions, and the realizability of deferred tax assets, in the period when management believes all necessary internal and external approvals associated with such initiatives have been obtained, or when the initiatives are materially complete. it is possible that the completion of one or more of these initiatives may occur within the next 12 months.
73
long-lived asset impairment. we are required to assess the recoverability of the carrying value of long-lived assets including "property, plant and equipment," "project assets," and "pv solar power systems" when an indicator of impairment has been identified. we review our long-lived assets each reporting period to assess whether impairment indicators are present. we must exercise judgment in assessing whether an event indicating potential impairment has occurred.
for purposes of recognition and measurement of an impairment loss, a long-lived asset is grouped with other assets and liabilities at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities. we must exercise judgment in assessing the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities.
for long-lived assets, when impairment indicators are present, we compare undiscounted future cash flows, including the eventual disposition of the asset group at market value, to the asset group's carrying value to determine if the asset group is recoverable. this assessment requires the exercise of judgment in assessing the future use of and projected value to be derived from the assets to be held and used. assessments also consider changes in asset group utilization, including the temporary idling of capacity and the expected timing of placing this capacity back into production.
for an asset group that fails the test of recoverability described above, the estimated fair value of long-lived assets may be determined using an "income approach," "market approach," "cost approach," or a combination of one or more of these approaches as appropriate for the particular asset group being reviewed. all of these approaches start with the forecast of expected future net cash flows including the eventual disposition at market value of long-lived assets. we also utilize third-party valuations and information available regarding the current market for similar assets. if there is an impairment, a loss is recorded to reflect the difference between the asset group's fair value and carrying value prior to impairment. this may require judgment in estimating future cash flows, relevant discount rates, and residual values applied in the income approach used in estimating the current fair value of the impaired assets to be held and used.
goodwill. goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price of acquired businesses over the estimated fair value assigned to the individual assets acquired and liabilities assumed. we do not amortize goodwill but instead are required to test goodwill for impairment at least annually in the fourth quarter. we perform impairment tests between scheduled annual tests if facts and circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit that has goodwill is less than its carrying value.
we may first make a qualitative assessment of whether it is more likely than not that a reporting unit's fair value is less than its carrying value to determine whether it is necessary to perform the two-step goodwill impairment test. the qualitative impairment test considers various factors including macroeconomic conditions, industry and market conditions, cost factors, a sustained share price or market capitalization decrease, and any reporting unit specific events. if it is determined through the qualitative assessment that a reporting unit's fair value is more likely than not greater than its carrying value, the two-step impairment test is not required. if the qualitative assessment indicates it is more likely than not that a reporting unit's fair value is not greater than its carrying value, we must perform the two-step impairment test. we may also elect to proceed directly to the two-step impairment test without considering such qualitative factors.
the first step in a two-step impairment test is the comparison of the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount, including goodwill. our reporting units consist of our fully integrated systems business, cadmium telluride module manufacturing business, and our crystalline silicon module manufacturing business from our tetrasun acquisition in 2013. in accordance with the authoritative guidance over fair value measurements, we define the fair value of a reporting unit as the price that would be received to sell the unit as a whole in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. we primarily use the income approach methodology of valuation, which includes the discounted cash flow method, to estimate the fair values of our reporting units.
significant management judgment is required when estimating the fair value of our reporting units including the forecasting of future operating results and the selection of discount and expected future growth rates that we use in discounting cash flows. if the estimated fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying value, goodwill is not impaired and no further analysis is required.
if the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value in the first step, then we are required to perform the second step of the impairment test. in this step, we assign the fair value of the reporting unit calculated in step one to all of the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit, as if a market participant just acquired the reporting unit in a business combination. the excess of the fair value of the reporting unit determined in the first step of the impairment test over the total amount assigned to the assets and liabilities in the second step of the impairment test represents the implied fair value of goodwill. if the carrying value of a reporting unit's goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of goodwill, we would record an impairment loss equal to the difference. if there is no such excess, then all goodwill for a reporting unit is considered impaired.
